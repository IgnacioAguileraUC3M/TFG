TI Sustainability evaluation of different systems for sea cucumber
   (Apostichopus japonicus) farming based on emergy theory
SO JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
AB Emergy analysis is effective for analyzing ecological economic systems. However, the accuracy of the approach is affected by the diversity of economic level, meteorological and hydrological parameters in different regions. The present study evaluated the economic benefits, environmental impact, and sustainability of indoor, semi-intensive and extensive farming systems of sea cucumber (Apostichopus japonicus) in the same region. The results showed that A. japonicus indoor farming system was high in input and output (yield) whereas pond extensive farming system was low in input and output. The output/input ratio of indoor farming system was lower than that of pond extensive farming system, and the output/input ratio of semi-intensive farming system fell in between them. The environmental loading ratio of A. japonicus extensive farming system was lower than that of indoor farming system. In addition, the emergy yield and emergy exchange ratios, and emergy sustainability and emergy indexes for sustainable development were higher in extensive farming system than those in indoor farming system. These results indicated that the current extensive farming system exerted fewer negative influences on the environment, made more efficient use of available resources, and met more sustainable development requirements than the indoor farming system. A. japonicus farming systems showed more emergy benefits than fish farming systems. The pond farming systems of A. japonicus exploited more free local environmental resources for production, caused less potential pressure on the local environment, and achieved higher sustainability than indoor farming system.

TI Achieving a Climate-Change Resilient Farming System through Push-Pull
   Technology: Evidence from Maize Farming Systems in Ethiopia
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Building climate-resilient farming systems is important to promote the sustainability of agriculture at the global level. Scaling-up agroecological approaches in main staple crops, such as maize, is particularly important in enhancing the climate resilience of millions of smallholder farmers in developing countries. In this regard, push-pull technology (PPT) is an ecological approach to a farming system that aims to improve the climate resilience of maize producers in a smallholder mixed farming system. PPT is primarily designed to control pests and weeds in an ecofriendly approach, to improve soil fertility, to improve livestock feed, and to increase farmers' incomes. In this study, we compared the level of climate resilience between PPT maize farming systems and non-PPT maize farming systems in southern Ethiopia. Using the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Self-Evaluation and Holistic Assessment of Climate Resilience of Farmers and Pastoralists (SHARP), we measured 13 agroecosystem indicators of climate resilience and compared the degree to which the two farming systems differ in their level of resilience to climate change. The results indicate that PPT farming systems are more climate-resilient than their non-PPT counterparts. PPT maize farming systems had a significant impact on 8 out of the 13 agroecosystem indicators of climate resilience. To harness the full benefits of PPT, governmental extension agents, NGOs, and agricultural researchers should promote PPT-based maize farming systems. The promotion of PPT needs concerted efforts and strong national coordination in solving PPT implementation barriers, such as improving access to input and output markets and animal health services.

TI Natural resource conservation through indigenous farming systems: Wisdom
   alive in North East India
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE
AB Primitive agriculture like jhuming is widely prevalent in North East India for food production. Besides this, some potential indigenous farming systems are exist like Alder (Alnus nepulensis) based farming system, Zabo farming, Panikheti in hills and pond based farming system in plains of the region developed by local farmers using their ingenuity and skills over the centuries. These techniques and systems have sustainable agricultural base and practiced in isolated pockets in the North East India. While some components of farming systems has good Scientific base for resource conservation like nutrient cycling through in-situ residue management, green leaf manuring, soil and water conservation and maintenance of forestry. However, there are other few components like burning of biomass in jhuming needs a relook. The paper is aimed to document the various indigenous techniques of soil and water conservation linked with these farming systems in the North-eastern region of India.

TI Rural Livelihood Trajectories Around a "Bull Market" in Kyrgyzstan
   Studying Agropastoral Change at the Household Level Through Farming
   System Modeling
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Transhumant agropastoralism is a major concern in debates about economic development and food security in Kyrgyzstan. Using the concept of the "agropastoral system," this study emphasizes the diversity of existing family farming systems and agropastoral livelihoods at the regional level and their various economic perspectives in a constantly evolving environment. Qualitative and empirical research conducted in the eastern part of Chuy oblast led to establishment of a typology of household farming systems, based on their resources and strategies, showing the agro-economic logic in the increasing socioeconomic inequalities in rural areas. Four farming systems were identified: deprived households involved in kitchen gardening and daily farm labor, risky small crop farming systems that increasingly rely on off-farm jobs to secure their livelihoods, sustainable dairy farming systems, and dynamic meat producers. In the context of increasing demand for animal products in urban areas, the position of each farming system in dairy and beef marketing reveals its ability to seize economic opportunities in the agricultural sector and in competition with off-farm activities.

TI Historical Transition of a Farming System towards Industrialization: A
   Danish Agricultural Case Study Comparing Sustainability in the 1840s and
   2019
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB A Danish pre-industrial farming system is reconstructed and compared to its modern industrialized farming system equivalent to evaluate agricultural performance in a sustainability perspective. The investigated Danish farm system and its contributing elements have undergone significant transformations. The intensity of contemporary agriculture shows that high productivity levels have been achieved by increasing the input of energy using modern machinery. At the same time, the energy efficiency (calculations based on energetic indicators) diminishes over time as the degree of dependence on fossil fuels increases. The results from this study show significant changes in the farming system, specifically inputs from agricultural land use, livestock, and energy systems. From being highly circular, the system changed to being a clear linear farming system with highly increased productivity but less efficient at the same time, questioning the relationship between productivity and efficiency and resource utilization in modern farming systems. Through utilizing an agroecological historical approach by comparing system performance over time, the results offer opportunities to explore how agricultural farming systems evolve over time and help to describe the complexity of the system level in a sustainability perspective.

TI Farming Systems Changes in the Urban Shadow: A Mixed Approach Based on
   Statistical Analysis and Expert Surveys
SO AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB Due to the growth of the "urban shadow", farming systems in metropolitan areas (MAs) are characterized by specific environmental, economic, and social pressures. Urbanization pressure and its related threats, as well as the opportunities resulting from a convenient location close to consumers' markets, cause rapid farming systems changes. The present study provides a quali-quantitative overview of change in farming systems in selected Polish metropolitan areas. Various statistical methods were applied to analyze changes in farming systems. First, farming system changes were characterized for the study area by the exploratory factor analysis. In addition, experts' opinions (qualitative data) on changes in farming systems until 2027 are presented. The research conducted showed that there are a few main patterns in changes to/adaptations of farming systems: Horizontal growth of farms, farmland concentration, process of specialization (horticulture, orchards), trajectories towards more multifunctional farming practices (off-farm diversification, as well as "deepening" and "broadening" strategies), reduction of livestock farming, deintensification and farmland abandonment. Those processes vary in space, and they are only partially explained in terms of distance to the core city (location). Experts forecast that the identified trends will continue, paying attention to the growing importance of multifunctional agriculture and the intensification of recessive processes, including farmland abandonment and excessive deintensification of production. According to the experts surveyed, most farmers will continue to apply traditional development strategies, which will be ineffective without the possibility of increasing the area of farms.

AB Farming outputs in agriculture depend on the nature of production, i.e. different farming systems generate different outputs. All these outputs are important for the society, and, therefore, require an integrated approach in view of the specific farming characteristics, where market and non-market outputs are taken into account. Therefore, the paper focuses on analysis of farming system outputs and methods of their evaluation. The objectives of this paper are to define the features of different farming systems and their outputs, then, to analyse the methods of evaluation of farming system outputs used in the studies. In order to achieve the research aim, analysis of economic scientific literature has been conducted; characteristics of farming systems and their outputs have been analysed; evaluation methods of the market and non-market farming system outputs, revealing their advantages and disadvantages, have been examined. Methods of systemic and logic analysis have been applied to analysis of the farming system outputs and their evaluation. The analysis has shown that intensive farming systems generate more market goods, while extensive farming systems - more public goods. Price-based methods are mostly used for the evaluation of market outputs of farming systems. Stated preferences methods are the most universal techniques used for the determination of the values from non-market farming system outputs. Hedonic pricing approaches are used for evaluation of specific agricultural public goods related to recreation or leisure and related to the particular groups of users.

TI Ecosystem Services in Biologically Diversified versus Conventional
   Farming Systems: Benefits, Externalities, and Trade-Offs
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB We hypothesize that biological diversification across ecological, spatial, and temporal scales maintains and regenerates the ecosystem services that provide critical inputs-such as maintenance of soil quality, nitrogen fixation, pollination, and pest control-to agriculture. Agrobiodiversity is sustained by diversified farming practices and it also supplies multiple ecosystem services to agriculture, thus reducing environmental externalities and the need for off-farm inputs. We reviewed the literature that compares biologically diversified farming systems with conventional farming systems, and we examined 12 ecosystem services: biodiversity; soil quality; nutrient management; water-holding capacity; control of weeds, diseases, and pests; pollination services; carbon sequestration; energy efficiency and reduction of warming potential; resistance and resilience to climate change; and crop productivity. We found that compared with conventional farming systems, diversified farming systems support substantially greater biodiversity, soil quality, carbon sequestration, and water-holding capacity in surface soils, energy-use efficiency, and resistance and resilience to climate change. Relative to conventional monocultures, diversified farming systems also enhance control of weeds, diseases, and arthropod pests and they increase pollination services; however, available evidence suggests that these practices may often be insufficient to control pests and diseases or provide sufficient pollination. Significantly less public funding has been applied to agroecological research and the improvement of diversified farming systems than to conventional systems. Despite this lack of support, diversified farming systems have only somewhat reduced mean crop productivity relative to conventional farming systems, but they produce far fewer environmental and social harms. We recommend that more research and crop breeding be conducted to improve diversified farming systems and reduce yield gaps when they occur. Because single diversified farming system practices, such as crop rotation, influence multiple ecosystem services, such research should be holistic and integrated across many components of the farming system. Detailed agroecological research especially is needed to develop crop- and region-specific approaches to control of weeds, diseases, and pests.

TI Implementing the agroecological transition: an analysis of
   decision-making rules in banana farming systems in the French West
   Indies
SO REVUE D ECONOMIE REGIONALE ET URBAINE
AB This article deals with the implementation of the agroecological transition in the French West Indies. To address this challenge, a viability model is suggested. This approach offers an original framework to highlight agroecosystems dynamics by allowing consideration of simultaneously economic and agronomic dimensions. This holistic approach to agroecosystems is designed at the farming system scale. Farming systems, which are thought as socio-ecosystems (i.e., ecological systems inextricably connected to a socio-economic matrix), represent an essential component of the agricultural sector. Farming systems are a strategic level on which to tackle the different components of viability from a holistic point of view. Farming systems are at the crossroads of agro-technical, organizational, institutional and territorial innovations. They also constitute a consistent level on which to address the issues of complexity and uncertainty. A viability model with target (reaching a high soil quality threshold) is designed, tested and supports operational objectives. The viability analysis enables to answer different questions relating to a given state (i.e. initial state) concerning possible futures. It aims to reveal the set of decision-making rules to be followed to ensure a viable evolution of farming systems. The viability model is applied for banana farming systems. The model results allow to define to what extent a farm can undertake its agroecological transition. It helps to assess the costs and duration of the agroecological transition considering farmers' choices (practices and crops). It shows that postponing the implementation of viable decision rules is costly. The more farmers postpone, the longer it will take for their system to recover viable properties and the more it will cost.

TI Predicting soil farming system and attributes based on soil bacterial
   community
SO APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB Soil of agro-ecosystems consists of complex biological interactions directly shaped by human activity, accounting for the overall soil quality. Bacterial communities are key players in most biogeochemical cycles. Here we investigated soil bacterial communities in four adjacent maize farming systems, conventional, transition, natural, and organic in order to study the effects of these practices on soil bacterial community, uncover most influential bacterial taxa and explore them as predictors of categorical and continuous soil variables (i.e. attributes). While richness and diversity were only marginally affected, we found pronounced farming system effects on bacterial community composition. The organic farming system exhibited higher bacterial community stability over two crop years. Conventional farming network exhibited the highest density and number of keystone taxa, however all keystone taxa were shared by one module only. Whilst organic farming presented the biggest and less dense network with the smallest number of keystone taxa. Blastocatellales was one of the most influential orders in organic and natural farming system networks. Bacterial taxa associated to the farming systems were visualized by a bipartite graph and used to build random forest models capable of predicting the farming system regardless of the crop year with high accuracy. The models were also able to predict soil chemical and biological attributes to a different extent. Altogether, we have shown that soil bacterial communities are deeply shaped by the underlying farming system, and can be used as a tool in sustainable farming monitoring.

SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
AB The present study the efficacy of technological intervention on production potential of diversified farming system was conducted at Godhra, Kalol, Halol and Lunawara Talukas of Panchmahals district of Central Gujarat during the year 2010-12. Seven components like maize, fodder, vegetables, fruit crops, dairy, goatry and poultry were considered for study. Keeping these aspects in view, the influence of technological intervention on scientific farming system with comparisons to traditional farming system was worked out. The average land holding of selected farmers was 1.22 ha. Results of the study revealed that the production of maize, fodder, vegetables, fruit crops, dairy, goatry and poultry under scientific farming system was significantly influenced as compared to traditional farming system. The percentage increase in the production of maize, hybrid Napier and lucerne, tomatoes, chilly, brinjal, fruits, milk and egg in scientific farming system was recorded 47.2, 45.52, 37.32, 41.46, 41.66, 65.99, 37.25 and 152.29 respectively over traditional system. Similarly the average net return and cost benefit ratio was also computed significantly higher in scientific than traditional farming system. Overall observations after integrating different components of farming system, it may inferred that the production, productivity, economic returns, balance nutrition along with better employment can be improved by adopting diversified farming system under semi-arid ecosystem of western India which have not only alleviated the socio-economic condition of farmers, but also provided sustainability in productivity by following of various scientific technologies over traditional farming.

TI Shrimp-vegetable rotational farming system: An innovation of shrimp
   aquaculture in the tidal flat ponds of Hangzhou Bay, China
SO AQUACULTURE
AB This study was conducted to explore the feasibility of an integrated rotational farming system with shrimp Limpenaeus vannamei and three vegetable species (i.e., broccoli [Brassica oleracea], cole [B. napus], and potherb mustard [B. juncea]) in the tidal flat ponds of Hangzhou Bay, China. A six-month (November to May) vegetable planting experiment without the addition of fertilizer was conducted followed by a five-month (May to October) shrimp culture experiment. Results show that the concentrations of soil total nitrogen significantly decreased in the three vegetable rotational farming systems by the end of the experiment (P < .05), whereas a significant reduction in soil phosphorus was only observed in the broccoli and cole farming systems (P < .05). The straw fresh weight of broccoli, cole, and potherb mustard were 38.25 +/- 1.29, 45.26 +/- 3.03, and 30.75 +/- 1.98 tons hm(-2), respectively. The amount of removed nitrogen and phosphorus for the three vegetable rotational farming systems were 416.16 kg and 130.33 kg, 538.12 kg and 108.63 kg, and 17.70 kg and 19.68 kg per hectare, respectively. The nitrogen and phosphorus content in the pond water demonstrated significant variations (P < .05) in the three rotational systems at the 30th and 60th days of the experiment (P < .05). The phytoplankton species, abundance, and biomass in these rotational farming systems were significantly lower than those in the control group. The shrimp production in the rotational systems was also higher than that in control group. However, no statistical differences were observed among these groups (P > .05). The condition factor was higher in the rotational farming systems than in the monoculture group (P < .05). The shrimp costs in the rotational farming systems were similar to those in the monoculture group, whereas the shrimp returns in rotational farming systems (26,381.8 US$, 27,180.2 US$, and 26,880.6 US$ for broccoli, cole, and potherb mustard, respectively) were higher than those in the monoculture group (24,410.5 US$). The rotational farming systems of vegetables produced economic benefits for broccoli, cole, and potherb mustard (12,351.6 US$, 8699.6 US$, and 7092.7 US$, respectively). As expected, the profits of rotational farming systems were approximately 1.63 to 2.26 times higher than those of shrimp monoculture. The ecological and economic effects of different shrimp and vegetable combinations revealed that the rotational farming of shrimp and vegetables (i.e., broccoli, cole, and potherb mustard) is a feasible and sustainable development model that fits well with the conditions of shrimp ponds in the coastal tidal flats of Hangzhou Bay, China. The findings of this work have broad prospects in promoting the development of shrimp culture and in exploiting and utilizing coastal tidal flats.

TI Hierarchical Patch Dynamics Perspective in Farming System Design
SO AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB Farming systems are complex and include a variety of interacting biophysical and technical components. This complexity must be taken into account when designing farming systems to improve sustainability, but more methods are needed to be able to do so. This article seeks to apply the Hierarchical Patch Dynamics theory (HPD) to farming systems to understand farming system complexity and be better able to support farming system re-design. A six-step framework is proposed to adapt the HPD theory to farming system analysis by taking into account (i) spatial and temporal interactions and (ii) field and management diversity. This framework was applied to a vineyard case study. The result was a hierarchical formalization of the farming system. The HPD framework improved understanding and enabled the formalization of (i) the hierarchical structure of the farming system, (ii) the interactions between structure and processes and (iii) scaling up and down from field to farm scale. HPD theory proved to be successful in analyzing farming system complexity at the farm scale. The framework can help with specific aspects of farming system design, such as how to change the scale of study or determining which scale should be used when choosing indicators for crop management and integrating multi-scale constraints and processes.

TI Proposing an ecologically viable and economically sound farming system
   using a matrix-based geo-informatics approach
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Healthy farming systems play a vital role in improving agricultural productivity and sustainable food production. The present study aimed to propose an efficient framework to evaluate ecologically viable and economically sound farming systems using a matrix-based analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and weighted linear combination method with geo-informatics tools. The proposed framework has been developed and tested in the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka. Results reveal that more than 50% of farming systems demonstrated moderate status in terms of ecological and economic aspects. However, two vulnerable farming systems on the western slopes of the Central Highlands, named WL1a and WM1a, were identified as very poor status. These farming systems should be a top priority for restoration planning and soil conservation to prevent further deterioration. Findings indicate that a combination of ecologically viable (nine indicators) and economical sound (four indicators) criteria are a practical method to scrutinize farming systems and decision making on soil conservation and sustainable land management. In addition, this research introduces a novel approach to delineate the farming systems based on agro-ecological regions and cropping areas using geo-informatics technology. This framework and methodology can be employed to evaluate the farming systems of other parts of the country and elsewhere to identify ecologically viable and economically sound farming systems concerning soil erosion hazards. The proposed approach addresses a new dimension of the decision-making process by evaluating the farming systems relating to soil erosion hazards and suggests introducing policies on priority-based planning for conservation with low-cost strategies for sustainable land management.

TI How do Stakeholders Perceive the Sustainability and Resilience of EU
   Farming Systems?
SO EUROCHOICES
AB An increasing variety of stresses and shocks provides challenges and opportunities for EU farming systems. This article presents findings of a participatory assessment on the sustainability and resilience of eleven EU farming systems, to inform the design of adequate and relevant strategies and policies. According to stakeholders that participated in workshops, the main functions of farming systems are related to food production, economic viability and maintenance of natural resources. Performance of farming systems assessed with regard to these and five other functions was perceived to be moderate. Past strategies were often geared towards making the system more profitable, and to a lesser extent towards coupling production with local and natural resources, social self-organisation, enhancing functional diversity, and facilitating infrastructure for innovation. Overall, the resilience of the studied farming systems was perceived as low to moderate, with robustness and adaptability often dominant over transformability. To allow for transformability, being reasonably profitable and having access to infrastructure for innovation were viewed as essential. To improve sustainability and resilience of EU farming systems, responses to short-term processes should better consider long-term processes. Technological innovation is required, but it should be accompanied with structural, social, agro-ecological and institutional changes.

TI Development and environmental policies of Ethiopia: Policy review from
   view point of development-environment sustainability linkage
SO HELIYON
AB Ethiopia is rich in a wide range of agro-ecological zones in which a variety of agricultural ac-tivities and farming systems operate. These agricultural activities and farming systems affect the quality of the environment and sustainability of natural resources in different ways, which should be one of the prime concerns of national development policies. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which Ethiopia's national development, environmental policies, and strategic plans consider the interrelationship between farming systems and environmental sus-tainability. The second objective was to determine the extent to which the policies and strategies integrate economic growth and environmental sustainability. Accordingly, different national development policies, strategies, and programs of Ethiopia were reviewed. The results reveal that these policies and strategies fundamentally focus on economic growth. Policymakers did not pay adequate attention to the environmental effects of farming systems in national development policies and strategic plans. Policies do not consider the integration of development and envi-ronmental sustainability. Simply put, the multidimensional links between economic growth and environmental sustainability have not been adequately articulated in development policies and programs. Therefore, both economic and environmental effects of the farming systems should be well-addressed during the preparation of development policies and strategic plans.

SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Traditional Indian agriculture is mainly focused on manpower, which involves lots of hard work and energy but difficult to earn their livelihood because of very less output even though it requires considerable inputs in terms of seeds, livestock breeds, fertilizers, pesticides, energy, feed, and labour. An innovative farming system with maximum productivity and fewer input drives is an urgent need to consider an integrated farming system. It efficiently recycles the natural resources and maintains nutrient equilibrium, brings about soil, air and water sustainability, enhances economic profitability and stability, thus preserving the quality and diversity of the living world.

TI Sustainability Matters: Consumer Acceptance of Different Vertical
   Farming Systems
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Fresh produce within vertical farming systems grows vertically in different layers stacked atop each other, thus allowing for the efficient use of space. As the environment in vertical farming systems is completely controlled, neither sunlight nor soil is necessary. On the one hand, vertical farming may help to provide a healthy diet for the growing global population because it has a greater crop yield per square meter used than conventional farming; moreover, it can offer the opportunity to grow food in climatically disadvantaged areas. On the other hand, growth conditions may be perceived as unnatural and the entire vertical farming system as unsustainable. Therefore, understanding the consumers' acceptance of vertical farming systems is important. This study is the first work to provide insights into consumers' acceptance of three different vertical farming systems. Data are collected through an online survey of 482 consumers in Germany in February 2018. Drivers of consumer acceptance of vertical farming systems are identified through structural equation modelling. The results indicate that perceived sustainability is the major driver of consumer acceptance of vertical farming systems. The larger the system, the higher the likelihood that it will be considered as sustainable. Obviously, consumers perceive something like ecologies of scale.

SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Farming and fishing are major sources of livelihood in rural households in the Philippines. Farming systems in the country are complex, multi-faceted, and geared to promote efficient production and a steady source of income. However, these have also wrought unwanted consequences on the environment, notably soil erosion, water pollution, groundwater depletion, loss of natural habitats, and loss of biological diversity. Farming systems are affected by exogenous environmental factors; in turn, the farming systems also affect agricultural production resource bases. Initiatives from various sectors to mitigate the adverse environmental impacts of farming systems and to protect the agricultural production bases are in place in terms of policies, programs, and action projects.

AB This paper makes a case for, instead of disseminating isolated technologies, adopting the farming systems approach to controlling desertification and sustaining dryland farming in the desert ecosystem of India. Unless assured of substantial increases in productivity, farmers will not adopt new technology. But synergistic integration of dryland farming with animal husbandry and amelioration of degraded lands in a farming systems perspective can only help raise the productivity in resource-poor regions to levels that may interest farmers. This paper discusses initial results of efforts to develop prototype farming systems for desert agriculture with built-in synergy. (C)1998 Academic Press Limited.

TI Analysis of deforestation and economically sustainable farming systems
   under pressure of population growth and income constraints at the
   village level in Tanzania
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB The main aim of this paper is to apply mathematical programming and welfare maximization theory to analyze the effect of population growth on agriculture/forest land use competition, per capita cash income and subsistence consumption from privately owned farms as a basis to determine the economic sustainability of the present farming systems in the West Usambara Mountains. Two working hypotheses are presented: (1) given present population growth trends, present farming systems are not economically sustainable; (2) population growth will cause deforestation over time due to the expansion of farmlands.
   The analysis presented in this paper indicates that the present farming systems can sustain the present population growth rate (2.1% per annum for Lukozi Village) and per capita income for a maximum duration of 25-30 years. Life expectancy in Tanzania is over 45 years (based on 1988 population census). Thus, the present farming systems cannot sustain even one human generation.
   This suggests that, for the existing farming systems to become economically sustainable, it is important to improve farming technology which could increase crop production through improvements of land productivity, and to increase income from other sources. Such a strategy will meet the increased food demand as a result of population growth as well as limiting the expansion of farmlands through forest clearing. In addition, the welfare of the farmers and rural populace could be enhanced and improved. Also, it might be relevant to expand small-scale industrial activities to increase income from off-farm activities. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

   Eastern Himalayan Region
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
AB The present work was carried out at Chandel Khullen village of Chandel hill district of Manipur during 2010-11 to 2012-13. The average holding size of the farmer was 1.33 ha in 2010-11, 1.96 ha in 2011-12 and 2.21 ha in 2012-13. The tribal farmer adopted seven components, i e crop production, vegetables, fruits, piggery, backyard poultry, fishery and water management as suggested by ICAR Manipur Centre. In 2010-11, the paddy yield was 3.5 tonnes/ha as compared to 4.79 tonnes/ha in 2012-13. It was mainly due to adoption of improved package and practices. The cabbage and onion yield increased by 103 and 54 per cent, respectively after adoption of improved cultivation methods under integrated farming system. Similarly, the papaya and banana production was increased by 275 and 270 per cent. There was marked increase in pork, chicken, egg and fish production. In 2012-13, this system also provided significantly higher Rs per Re invested than that of the other 2010-11. In Manipur, women's participation is more in farming system rather than men. In the same way, this farming system also gives more opportunity to women to engage in agriculture farming. Thus integrated farming system provides new venture for employment and sustainable development of livelihood for North Eastern people. The overall result revealed that the improved practices with different crop and animal components are an excellent approach for sustainable production, income generation and employment opportunity for the small and marginal rural households of Manipur.

TI Participatory modelling with farmer groups to help them redesign their
   livestock farming systems
SO AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB To improve sustainability, farmers may want to redesign their livestock farming systems in depth. Systemic modelling has proved an efficient tool to study complex issues regarding farming systems, but it remains inefficient to support farmers in their system redesign processes. This paper describes and discusses a novel method to model livestock farming systems with groups of farmers to help them redesign their own systems. Modelling livestock farming systems at the farm scale with farmer groups is an original approach in livestock farming system modelling. Following a constructivist approach, our method involves working with farmers already involved in redesign processes and building causal maps according to their own representations, without using models previously created by scientists. Applying the method, we built two causal maps of livestock farming system operation, each one built with a group of five farmers including both those converting and converted to organic farming. Converting to organic farming was considered as one example of a redesign process. On the basis of a subjective assessment by both the participating farmers and researchers, and an analysis of map structures, we assessed the method's strengths and weaknesses. We considered that one of its main advantages lay in its collective dimension: sharing, comparing and questioning interested the participating farmers greatly; however, it requires good facilitation skills and suitable group composition. Furthermore, the formalising process identified, for example, vicious circles in system operation, which made the farmers think about solutions for breaking them. Finally, analysis of map structures identified similarities and differences between the two groups that were discussed with both of them during a final workshop; this activity continued farmers' self-reflection about their systems, which may help lead to innovative and more sustainable livestock farming systems.

TI Scenarios for Sustainable Farming Systems for Macadamia Nuts and Mangos
   Using a Systems Dynamics Lens in the Vhembe District, Limpopo South
   Africa
SO AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB Agriculture is arguably one of the most important economic sectors for South Africa's development as it is directly linked to food security. Farming systems in South Africa have been characterized by a duality where large-scale commercial farmers and small-scale farmers co-exist. The conventional approach to understanding agricultural production in the country has always viewed the two farming systems as mutually exclusive. The study argues that there are various points of interaction between the two kinds of farmers and by using a systems dynamics approach to evaluate the two farming systems this can be applied to agricultural decision making. Data were used to identify and characterise small- and large-scale farming systems of two tree crops (mangos-Mangifera indica L. and macadamia nuts-Macadamia integrifolia M&B.) in the Vhembe district of Limpopo South Africa. The interactions between the two different farmers are illustrated using Causal Loop Diagrams (CLDs) of the two farming systems under similar commodities. Results, presented as four conceptual scenarios, show that there are multiple points of interaction, such as the interdependence of farmers of macadamia nuts to meet export demands. Policy recommendations to strengthen collaboration between small-scale mango farmers and implement irrigation expansion for farmers who depend on rain-fed farming are discussed and present opportunities for the co-functioning of the two farming systems.

AB The potential of organic agriculture to contribute to sustainable development in Ghana is unclear. This article assesses the sustainability performance of organic and conventional cocoa farming systems in Ghana. Data was collected from 398 organic and conventional cocoa farmers using the SMART-Farm tool. Compared to conventional cocoa farming systems, we found a higher environmental sustainability performance in organic cocoa farming systems regarding water withdrawal (+29%), species diversity (+26%), land degradation (+24%), genetic diversity (+24%) and greenhouse gases (+22%). The organic farming systems performed better compared to conventional in profitability (+20%) due to market premiums, gender equity (+27%), and verbally committed to sustainability topics (+25%). Agronomic practices had a strong influence on the observed sustainability performance, especially the environmental performance. Typical organic cocoa farming system has small farm sizes, spends more hours weeding manually since chemical weedicides are prohibited and has more diverse crops. Measures to improve performance is paramount for farming systems sustainability.

TI Livestock Farming Systems and Agroecology in the Tropics
SO SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE REVIEWS 14: AGROECOLOGY AND GLOBAL CHANGE
SE Sustainable Agriculture Reviews
AB The climate change crisis is inducing severe energy and food shortages in tropical regions. A potential solution is to build agroecological systems as an alternative to intensive and industrial agriculture. For that research should focus on the functions of animal and livestock farming systems. Positive and negative function effects should be assessed. This is particularly important in developing countries where most of tomorrow's food and feed will have to be produced. What are the main issues for animal production in the tropics? The major challenges are how to redesign productivity and food security, economic efficiency and environmental preservation, and how to integrate economy and environment. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary to address such complex problems, where interactions among interdependent components of the system result in multicausality.
   The concept of livestock farming system, with its double consistency of social and biophysical dimensions, can help address complex problems. The concepts of livestock farming system and of agroecology can be easily combined to design sustainable animal production systems. Enhancing agroecological approaches that lead to both food security and biodiversity conservation must involve spreading concepts through practices, particularly to solve the problems of small farmers. As so, the purpose of the paper is to highlight many case studies. The animal and farming system ecoservices are described at the animal level with the case of the multifunctional tropical goat and also at the territory level with the case of agrosylvopastoralism focusing the role played by the animal. Finally, the socio-cultural functions of animals or systems in this region are described. The double dimension of livestock system concept allows the integration of the livestock keepers in the human and societal context to attain agroecological objectives which is recognised as a core objective to attain according through the agroecological perspective. Topical livestock farming systems can show their potential to reach sustainability and help family economy.

TI Soil Microbiome Is More Heterogeneous in Organic Than in Conventional
   Farming System
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB Organic farming system and sustainable management of soil pathogens aim at reducing the use of agricultural chemicals in order to improve ecosystem health. Despite the essential role of microbial communities in agro-ecosystems, we still have limited understanding of the complex response of microbial diversity and composition to organic and conventional farming systems and to alternative methods for controlling plant pathogens. In this study we assessed the microbial community structure, diversity and richness using 16S rRNA gene next generation sequences and report that conventional and organic farming systems had major influence on soil microbial diversity and community composition while the effects of the soil health treatments (sustainable alternatives for chemical control) in both farming systems were of smaller magnitude. Organically managed system increased taxonomic and phylogenetic richness, diversity and heterogeneity of the soil microbiota when compared with conventional farming system. The composition of microbial communities, but not the diversity nor heterogeneity, were altered by soil health treatments. Soil health treatments exhibited an overrepresentation of specific microbial taxa which are known to be involved in soil suppressiveness to pathogens (plant-parasitic nematodes and soil borne fungi). Our results provide a comprehensive survey on the response of microbial communities to different agricultural systems and to soil treatments for controlling plant pathogens and give novel insights to improve the sustainability of agro-ecosystems by means of beneficial microorganisms.

TI Life cycle assessment of different sea cucumber (Apostichopus japonicus
   Selenka) farming systems
SO JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
AB The life cycle assessment was employed to evaluate the environmental impacts of three farming systems (indoor intensive, semi-intensive and extensive systems) of sea cucumber living near Qingdao, China, which can effectively overcome the interference of inaccurate background parameters caused by the diversity of economic level and environment in different regions. Six indicators entailing global warming potential (1.86E + 04, 3.45E + 03, 2.36E + 02), eutrophication potential (6.65E + 01, -1.24E + 02, -1.65E + 02), acidification potential (1.93E + 02, 4.33E + 01, 1.30E + 00), photochemical oxidant formation potential (2.35E-01, 5.46E -02, 2.53E-03), human toxicity potential (2.47E + 00, 6.08E-01, 4.91E + 00) and energy use (3.36E + 05, 1.27E + 04, 1.48E + 03) were introduced in the current study. It was found that all environmental indicators in the indoor intensive farming system were much higher than those in semi-intensive and extensive farming systems because of the dominant role of energy input, while energy input also contributed as the leading cause factor for most of the indicators in the semi-intensive farming system. Yet in the extensive farming system, infrastructure materials played a major role. Through a comprehensive comparison of the three farming systems, it was concluded that income per unit area of indoor intensive farming system was much higher than those of semi-intensive and extensive farming systems. However, the extensive farming system was the most sustainable one. Moreover, adequate measures were proposed, respectively, to improve the environmental sustainability of each farming system in the present study.

TI An overview of farming system typology methodologies and its use in the
   study of pasture-based farming system: a review
SO SPANISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
AB The main objective of the paper is to do a critic study of the use of typology methodologies within pasture-based farming systems (PBFS), especially those situated in less favoured areas, showing in each case the more relevant variables or indicators determining the farming system classification. Another objective is to do an overview of the most used farming system typology methodologies in general. First some considerations about the concept of farming system and approaches to its study have been done. Next, the farming system typology methodologies have been showed in general to different farming systems, but addressed preferably to PBFS. The different tools integrated in these methodologies have been considered: sampling methods, sources of data, variables or indicators obtained from available data and techniques of analysis (statistical or not). Methods for farming system classification have been presented (expert methods, analytical methods or a combination of both types). Among the statistical methods, the multivariate analysis has been overall treated, including the principal component analysis and the cluster analysis. Finally, the use of farming system typology methodologies on different pasture-based farming systems has been presented. The most important aspects considered are following: the main objective of the typology, the main animal species, the employed methods of classification and the main variables involved in this classification.

TI Farming systems affect potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tuber and soil
   quality
SO FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
AB In organic farming, nutrient cycling is based mainly on a farm level with external inputs only when organic fertilisers are not cycled and produced, and conventional systems largely depend on external inputs. Therefore, crop rotations are important tools for maintaining soil fertility and for increasing crop yields and qualities not only in organic farming systems but also in conventional systems. Moreover, proper nutrient management is a key element for sustainable farming. To identify the farming systems that would be sustainable for a longer period, a field experiment was conducted. The aim of this study was to investigate how different farming systems influenced tuber yields and quality (N, NO3-, P, K, Ca, Mg, dry matter and starch concentrations) of potato as well as how potato cultivation within a crop rotation under different farming systems affects soil quality(pH, N-tot,C-org, plant available P, K, Ca and Mg concentrations). Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) was part of a five crop rotation experiment in which red clover (Trifolium pratense L), winter wheat (Trifolium aestivum L), peas (Pisum sativum L), potato and barley (Hordeum vulgare L) followed each other simultaneously on a same field. Data presented in this paper concerned the first 3 years of the rotation during 2009-2011. The experiment was performed with six different. farming systems as follows: two organic and four conventional. In both organic farming systems, catch crops (Organic CC) were used to provide organic green manure. In the second organic system, fully composted cattle manure (Organic CC+M) at a rate of 40 t ha(-1) was also added as a fertiliser. The four conventional farming systems differed in the amounts of mineral fertilisers used as follows: N0P0K0 (control), N50P25K95 (low), N100P25K95 (average), or N150P25K95 (high). The average yield as well as tuber N, NO3- and Mg concentrations were significantly influenced by farming systems, year and their interaction. Fresh tuber yields were significantly higher under conventional systems in which nitrogen fertilisers were used. The use of average and high amounts of mineral nitrogen fertilisers increased tuber nitrogen and nitrate concentrations. The use of nitrogen fertilisers slightly decreased tuber Mg concentrations. There were no significant differences among farming systems in average tuber K, Ca, dry matter and starch concentrations. Only the year and its interaction with farming systems had a significant influence on these indicators. Different farming systems had different effects on some soil quality parameters. The Organic CC system significantly decreased the average soil K concentration after potato cultivation. The other organic system, Organic CC+M, significantly increased the average soil C-org and P concentrations after potato cultivation. The conventional control system significantly decreased the average soil N-tot, K and Mg concentrations and increased the P concentration. The conventional system that received 50 kg N ha(-1) significantly decreased the average soil N-tot concentration after potato cultivation. The farming system that received an average amount of mineral nitrogen fertilisers significantly increased the average soil C-org and P concentrations and decreased the soil pH and K after potato cultivation.
   The conventional system that received 150 kg N ha(-1) significantly decreased the average soil C-org, K and Mg concentrations. The average plant available Ca concentrations before and after potato crops did not have statistically significant differences among systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Mixing specialized farming systems in Flevoland (The Netherlands):
   agronomic, environmental and socio-economic effects
SO NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
AB Mixed farming systems have potential agronomic, environmental and socio-economic advantages over specialized farming systems. This paper attempts to quantify these advantages for the Dutch province Flevoland. A mixed farming system at regional lever is characterized by intensive co-operation between two or more specialized farms, each producing crop or animal products. To test the hypothesis that such a mixed farming system might improve sustainability of agriculture in Flevoland, nutrient balances, labour requirements and labour income were quantified for a specialized arable farm, a specialized dairy farm and both combined into a mixed farming system, exchanging land, labour and machinery. Scope for reduced biocide use in the mixed farming system was assessed in a qualitative way. In the mixed farming system labour income per ha was 25% higher. Seventy percent of this increase could be explained through higher yields per ha of the profitable crops ware potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) and sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.). The remaining 30% resulted from lower costs, mainly through a better utilization of available labour. Differences between the combined nutrient balance of both specialized farms and that of the mixed farming system were small. Indications of reduced biocide use in the mixed farming system could not be found. It was concluded that in a mixed farming system it is possible to realize a higher income without increasing environmental pollution. Key factor is the ratio between animal and arable production, determining the extent to which crop rotations can be widened and the relative amounts of slurry that can be applied to grassland.

It was initiated by the Farming Systems and Soil Resources Institute (FSSRI) of the UP at Los Banos. A primary objective of this initiative was the institutionalization of agricultural technologies within farming communities, and all efforts were made to help farmers use technologies which would optimize their resource use, and have positive impacts on their environment and socio-economic well-being. To institutionalize these technologies, however, takes time, involves different mechanisms and requires the participation of several actors. This paper highlights the vital role played by community organizations in the adoption of integrated aquaculture technologies for the purpose of improving existing farming systems in Lucban, Quezon.

SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
AB Farming system approach has been widely recognized and advocated as one of the tools for harmonious use of inputs and their compounded response to make the production system sustainable. The present study was conducted to examine linkages among various components of farming systems in Mizoram state by using Leontief input-output model. The study identified 10 dairy based farming systems based on the major contribution to income of farm enterprise. The inter-component linkages from livestock to crop were stronger as compared to crop to livestock for all the fanning systems. The degree of integration of different components of the various fanning systems in terms of linkages is found to be strongest under D + C + P + Po farming systems. The interdependence observed among various components of farming system suggests the need to adopt total systems approach for development of sustainable fanning systems.

TI Financial profitability of diversified farming systems: A global
   meta-analysis
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB Diversified farming systems are promoted as a pathway to more sustainable agricultural production. Yet wide -scale adoption may be slow because of uncertainty about the viability of farmer livelihoods on diversified farms and entrenched perceptions that monocultures are key to making farming profitable. Here, a global meta-analysis of 3192 effect sizes from 119 peer-reviewed articles provides evidence that diversified farming systems are at least as profitable as simplified farming systems. Our study showed that, on average, total costs, gross income and profits (net income, or gross margin) were higher in diversified systems relative to simplified ones, while the benefit-cost ratio was equivalent. These results held in developed and developing countries and across geographic regions. From a subset of 43 articles reporting labour inputs, we found that labour costs increased in diversified farming systems, but so did gross incomes leading to farm profits equivalent to those in simplified systems and dispelling myths that higher labour requirements undermine the viability of diversification. Our global meta-analysis provides compelling evidence that diversified farming systems are not only viable but actually economically preferable to simplified systems in the wide range of contexts represented in this study. Policies, markets, investments, and value chains need to align with this evidence and promote diversified farming systems for the benefit of farmers and rural economies.

SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURE
AB Study on horticulture + crop + dairy + poultry (H + C + D + P) and horticulture + crop + dairy+ poultry + sheep/goat (H + C + D + P + S/G) farming systems was conducted in Tiruvallur and Thanjavur districts of Tamil Nadu, India to understand the contribution of horticulture-based farming system in providing sustainable livelihood and influencing techno-socio-economic characteristics of farm families. A Sustainable Livelihood Index (SLI) was developed. The H + C + D + P was not only perceived to be eco-friendly but also ensured high level of food security (76.92%) than H + C + D + P + S/G (66.67%). However, both the systems had low level of input recycling and permanent asset creation. The H + C + D + P + S/G was more profitable (60.00%) than H + C + D + P (46.15%). The livelihood sustainability was positively influenced by education, decision making pattern and communication behaviour. The study suggests that livelihood of poor farm families in developing countries would be improved better, if they are appropriately sensitized on horticulture-based farming systems.

TI Heavy-metal balances of agro-ecosystems in the Netherlands
SO NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
AB In this paper, heavy-metal flows (cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc) of arable, dairy and mixed farming systems in the Netherlands are studied. Farm-gale and field-scale balances are calculated. On the field-scale, static and dynamic balances are distinguished. By determining the characteristic metal flows, it becomes possible to differentiate between farming systems and to select the most viable options for sustainable heavy-metal management. The crop relation and the choice of fertilizers clearly influence the heavy-metal balance of arable farming systems. In dairy farming systems, the role of feed management is very important, but the effects on the heavy-metal balance are not always straightforward. Mixed farming systems compare favorably with specialized (arable or dairy) farming systems with regard to heavy-metal accumulation. Due to the internal cycling of feedstuff and manure, less inputs are required and thus the import of heavy-metal containing raw materials and products is minimized. Uncertainties related to the calculation of heavy-metal balances are discussed.

TI Farmer knowledge and perception of production constraints in Northwest
   Cambodia
SO JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB Upland farming in Northwest Cambodia has developed rapidly over the last 20 years, with limitations to the plough based system now apparent, including soil degradation and reductions in yield and profitability. A survey was conducted in order to prioritise the main constraints to production, to aid in future research planning, and to identify potential beneficial modifications to the current system. Three hundred and ninety one farmers were interviewed regarding their current farming system constraints, knowledge of conservation agriculture and their future plans in the Districts of Samlout in Battambang Province and Sala Krau in Pailin Province. Perceived major problems in the farming system were extreme climate events such as droughts and heavy rain, declining crop yields, and cash flow shortages, particularly in the pre-monsoon period. This is a plough based farming system, yet 66% of farmers had heard of conservation agriculture, and 59% wanted to learn more about conservation agriculture practices. Two thirds of farmers were interested in how to grow crops in the post-monsoon dry season on residual soil moisture. The survey highlighted opportunities for farmer education and adoption of farming system modifications to improve productivity and sustainability of the farming system in Northwest Cambodia, and assist with climate change adaptation.

SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB This study aimed to address analysis and zoning of sustainability of family farming system in Kermanshah province. To achieve this objective, two steps were taken: (1) Identification of a comprehensive framework to measure the sustainability of family farming system, and (2) Evaluation criteria and sub-criterion weight for the proposed framework by conducting Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP). In this regard, firstly, 12 agrarian experts who had theoretical and practical experiences were selected by purposed sampling for FAHP. Secondly, descriptive cross-sectional survey was carried out on family farming system. Results of FAHP revealed that management, capitals, vulnerabilities, and stresses were of utmost importance in a context of sustainability of family farming system, respectively. According to the findings, Eslamabad-e Gharb and Harsin with scores of 72.91 and 58.76 have high sustainability. In contrast, Qasr-e Shirin (20.92) showed high unsustainability. Furthermore, Sarpol-e Zahab, Kermanshah, and Javanroud with values of, respectively, 57.95, 57.37, and 52.92 lie in the middle of the spectrum.

TI Evaluation of the sustainability of contrasted pig farming systems:
   breeding programmes
SO ANIMAL
AB The sustainability of breeding activities in 15 pig farming systems in five European countries was evaluated. One conventional and two differentiated systems per country were studied. The Conventional systems were the standard systems in their countries. The differentiated systems were of three categories: Adapted Conventional with focus on animal welfare, meat quality or environment (five systems); Traditional with local breeds in small-scale production (three systems) and Organic (two systems). Data were collected with a questionnaire from nine breeding organisations providing animals and semen to the studied farming systems and from, on average, five farmers per farming system. The sustainability assessment of breeding activities was performed in four dimensions. The first dimension described whether the market for the product was well defined, and whether the breeding goal reflected the farming system and the farmers' demands. The second dimension described recording and selection procedures, together with genetic change in traits that were important in the system. The third dimension described genetic variation, both within and between pig breeds. The fourth dimension described the management of the breeding organisation, including communication, transparency, and technical and human resources. The results show substantial differences in the sustainability of breeding activities, both between farming systems within the same category and between different categories of farming systems. The breeding activities are assessed to be more sustainable for conventional systems than for differentiated systems in three of the four dimensions. In most differentiated farming systems, breeding goals are not related to the system, as these systems use the same genetic material as conventional systems. The breeds used in Traditional farming systems are important for genetic biodiversiiy, but the small scale of these systems renders them vulnerable. It is hoped that, by reflecting on different aspects of sustainability, this study will encourage sustainable developments in pig production.

TI Can Ecological Farming Systems Positively Affect Household Income from
   Agriculture? A Case Study of the Suburban Area of Hanoi, Vietnam
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB From 1995, Vietnam started building safety standards for agricultural products divided into three labels, "safe", "VietGAP", and "organic" to deal with environmental problems and health issues resulting from the intensification of farming methods and increasing awareness of food safety. This research examines the reasons for government support of agricultural production according to those standards instead of conventional methods. To this end, we characterised the current farming systems, identified factors affecting the generation of cash income from agriculture, and investigated the influence of the farming system on farm income in the suburban area of Hanoi. Data collection involved a survey based on a structured questionnaire, key informants' interviews, and focus group discussions conducted in 2015 with a sample size of 312 respondents. Three forms of farming systems: conventional, safe, and organic were identified. Literature suggested that ecological farming systems that are safe and organic are supported by stakeholders in Vietnam to maintain agricultural sustainability. A multiple linear regression model was applied to identify factors that affect cash incomes from agricultural activities. This research found a direct correlation between the ecological factor of farming systems and respondents' cash income from agricultural activities. Additionally, the amount of family labour and respondents' higher-level education and farm experiences appeared to positively influence the cash incomes from agriculture. On the other hand, farm size and membership in a farmers' association were identified as the major factors that negatively affect agricultural cash income in the study area.

TI Technology, infrastructure and enterprise trade-off: Strengthening
   smallholder farming systems in Tamil Nadu State of India for sustainable
   income and food security
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB The complexities of smallholder farming systems pose a challenge in demonstrating the potential benefits or risks of new technologies and policies. Using Integrated Analysis Tool, a rule-based dynamic simulation model, this study tried to improve the performance of major farming systems in the Tamil Nadu State of India. Amongst the four major farming systems viz. Black gram-based (BFS), Paddy-based (PFS), and Integrated Farming Systems (IFS) in Villupuram district and Dryland Farming System (DFS) in Virudhunagar district, IFS was found to be the most profitable and resilient based on their performance simulated for a 3-year rotation. Setting IFS as a benchmark, potential interventions were evaluated under other farming systems to improve their relative performance. The analysis allowed understanding the interactions in smallholder farming systems and the potential impact of interventions in a whole farm way considering the cash flows, cost intensity, and input-output trade-offs. While multi-bloom technology in black gram increased the net profit of BFS without much stress on input and labour, area expansion under rainfed groundnut incurred high expenditure. Trading-off paddy with maize and groundnut significantly increased the net profit of PFS but replacing sugarcane with tapioca and turmeric was not remunerative. Improved livestock management practices have substantially increased the net profit of DFS wherein crop yield could not be enhanced substantially without the prospects of good irrigation infrastructure. The irrigation endowed PFS has achieved 90% performance, whereas the water-starved BFS and DFS could achieve only 65% performance of IFS. We conclude that agricultural policy must not only focus on potential interventions that are profitable but also consider what is acceptable to the farmer, considering synergies and trade-offs between competing resources at the farm level.

TI Long-term effect of rice-based farming systems on soil health
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB Integrated rice-fish culture, an age-old farming system, is a technology which could produce rice and fish sustainably at a time by optimizing scarce resource use through complementary use of land and water. An understanding of microbial processes is important for the management of farming systems as soil microbes are the living part of soil organic matter and play critical roles in soil C and N cycling and ecosystem functioning of farming system. Rice-based integrated farming system model for small and marginal farmers was established in 2001 at Central Rice Research Institute, Cuttack, Odisha. The different enterprises of farming system were rice-fish, fish-fingerlings, fruits, vegetables, rice-fish refuge, and agroforestry. This study was conducted with the objective to assess the soil physicochemical properties, microbial population, carbon and nitrogen fractions, soil enzymatic activity, and productivity of different enterprises. The effect of enterprises induced significant changes in the chemical composition and organic matter which in turn influenced the activities of enzymes (urease, acid, and alkaline phosphatase) involved in the C, N, and P cycles. The different enterprises of long-term rice-based farming system caused significant variations in nutrient content of soil, which was higher in rice-fish refuge followed by rice-fish enterprise. Highest microbial populations and enzymatic properties were recorded in rice-fish refuge system because of waterlogging and reduced condition prolonged in this system leading to less decomposition of organic matter. The maximum alkaline phosphatase, urease, and FDA were observed in rice-fish enterprise. However, highest acid phosphatase and dehydrogenase activity were obtained in vegetable enterprise and fish-fingerlings enterprise, respectively.

   The data of investigation show that productivity of plant rotations depends to the cultivated plants and the applied fanning system. The highest yield was reviewed cultivating plants after green manure (lupines and white mustard) in two farming systems.
   Crop rotations had no effect to the soil acidity and increased total nitrogen and organic carbon content in the soil. Phosphorus amount in the soil increased in all farming systems, potassium only in sustainable farming system.
   The data about the number of micromycetes, organic and mineral nitrogen assimilating bacteria in the rizosphere soil of various grown plants are also presented.

The present situation of farming systems is discussed, including the heavier demands farming makes on some natural resources while farming populations tend to decline. In seeking a framework to promote sustainable farming systems, a variety of policy options are examined, including price, structural and R&D policies. The feasibility of these policy changes is assessed in the context of the Common Agricultural Policy and its potential capacity to move away from a price/cost setting role to a more complex and multidimensional one.

TI Increasing Farm Productivity, Income and Employment through Farming
   System Approach: A Review of Concepts, Constraints and Issues
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Farming is an important component of the economy of developing countries. Farming system is a viable approach, which represents an appropriate combination of farm enterprises, viz; crop production, horticulture, livestock, fishery, forestry, poultry and goat farming, etc. Farming system provides increased productivity per unit land, better utilisation of resources, recycling of farm wastes, sustainability, higher income and employment generation and reduction of risk. Hence, it is viewed as a powerful tool for natural and human resource management in developing countries like, India. This is multidisciplinary whole farm approach and very effective in solving the problems of small and marginal farmers. This approach not only increases income and employment opportunity but protect the environment through recycling of the crop and animal wastes within the farm itself. The present paper reviews the role of farming system approach in increasing income and employment, also highlights constraints in their adoption.

TI Participatory assessment of critical thresholds for resilient and
   sustainable European farming systems
SO JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB Farming systems in Europe are experiencing multiple stresses and shocks that may push systems beyond critical thresholds after which system change is expected to occur. These critical thresholds may lie in the economic, environmental, social and institutional domain. In this paper we take a participatory approach with involvement of farming system stakeholders to assess the presence of critical thresholds in 11 European farming systems, and the potential consequence of surpassing those with regard to system sustainability and resilience. First, critical thresholds of the main challenges, key system variables and their interactions in the studied farming systems were assessed. Second, participants assessed the potential developments of the key system variables in case critical thresholds for main system challenges would be exceeded. All studied systems were perceived to be close, at or beyond at least one identified critical threshold. Stakeholders were particularly worried about economic viability and food production levels. Moreover, critical thresholds were perceived to interact across system levels (field, farm, farming system) and domains (social, economic, environmental), with low economic viability leading to lower attractiveness of the farming system, and in some farming systems making it hard to maintain natural resources and biodiversity. Overall, a decline in performance of all key system variables was expected by workshop participants in case critical thresholds would be exceeded. For instance, a decline in the attractiveness of the area and a lower maintenance of natural resources and biodiversity. Our research shows that concern for exceeding critical thresholds is justified and that thresholds need to be studied while considering system variables at field, farm and farming system level across the social, economic and environmental domains. For instance, economic variables at farm level (e.g. income) seem important to detect whether a system is approaching critical thresholds of social variables at farming system level (e.g. attractiveness of the area), while in multiple case studies there are also indications that approaching thresholds of social variables (e.g. labor availability) are indicative for approaching economic thresholds (e.g. farm income). Based on our results we also reflect on the importance of system resources for stimulating sustainability and resilience of farming systems. We therefore stress the need to include variables that reflect system resources such as knowledge levels, attractiveness of rural areas and general well-being of rural residents when monitoring and evaluating the sustainability and resilience of EU farming systems.

TI Impact of Farming System on Potato Yield and Tuber Quality in Northern
   Baltic Sea Climate Conditions
SO AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB For finding more sustainable cropping systems, this study on how the farming system influences the yield and quality of potato tubers was carried out with long-term crop rotation experiment. The long-term five-field crop rotation field trial was established with the following farming system treatments: organic farming system treatments: Org I (organic control), Org II (organic crop rotation with winter cover crops) and Org III (organic crop rotation with winter cover crops and the addition of composted cattle manure); conventional farming system treatments: NO (conventional system without fertilizers), N50 (conventional system with fertilization, N50P25K95), N100 (conventional system, N100P25K95) and N150 (conventional system, N150P25K95). The average yield (based on 3 trial years) of conventional systems was 25% higher, compared to organic systems. However, in organic systems, the yield was the most stable. The most fluctuating cropping system was the most intensively managed N150. In each trial year, the yield differed statistically and it varied from 4.7 t ha(-1) up to 10.9 t ha(-1). Org I had the same dry matter yield as the NO system, where chemicals were used, meaning that using chemicals for plant protection but no fertilizer for growth improvement had no positive effect. In each year, the yield in Org III system was similar to N50 system. Regarding the tubers per plant, there were no differences between farming systems but there was a significant difference between the trial years. The tubers in conventional systems had a lower starch content than the organic systems. It is possible to conclude that if cover crops and manure are used, organic farming practices provide just as good results as the conventional farming with low nitrogen level.

TI Environmental impacts of a Japanese dairy farming system using
   whole-crop rice silage as evaluated by life cycle assessment
SO ANIMAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
AB The objectives of this study were to assess and compare the environmental impacts of two types of dairy farming systems, one of which makes use of whole-crop rice silage and the other of which is conventional, using life cycle assessment (LCA). The functional unit was defined as 1 kg of 4% fat-corrected milk (FCM). The processes associated with the dairy farming life cycle, such as feed production, feed transport, animal management including biological activity of the animal, and waste treatment were included within the system's boundaries. Environmental impacts of the rice silage-using and conventional dairy farming systems were 987 and 972 g CO(2) equivalents for global warming, 6.87 and 7.13 g SO(2) equivalents for acidification, 1.19 and 1.23 g PO(4) equivalents for eutrophication, and 5.53 and 5.81 MJ for energy consumption, respectively. Our results suggest that the dairy farming system using rice silage in Japan has smaller environmental impacts for acidification, eutrophication, and energy consumption, and a larger impact for global warming compared with conventional farming. Further interpretation integrating these impact categories suggested 1.1% lower environmental impact of the rice silage-using dairy farming system as a whole.

TI The Livelihood Adjustment of Smallholding Rubber Farming Systems (SRFS)
   in Southwestern Thailand: Case Study in Ranong, Krabi, Phangnga, and
   Phuket Provinces
SO FOREST AND SOCIETY
AB This study aimed to examine the livelihood adjustment, to analyze factors affecting, and to synthesize the relationships between production and livelihood adjustment in model of SRFS for Ranong, Krabi, Phangnga, and Phuket provinces, in Southwestern Thailand. A sample group of 399 rubber farmers was involved in data collection and 60 key informants were selected as a subsample. A structured interview form and a semi-structured interview form were the tools for data collection. In data analysis, descriptive statistics, linear regression and technical-economic simulation were applied, as well as synthesized model of connections between the production system and livelihood under SRFS was analyzed. The results indicate that rubber farming could be classified into four types: smallholding rubber monoculture farming system (S1) (40.9%), smallholding rubber with fruit tree farming system (S2) (35.8%), smallholding rubber with oil-palm farming system (S3) (49.8%), and smallholding rubber with livestock farming system (S4) (5.9%). These were different in livelihood assets and livelihood outcomes. Smallholding rubber with livestock farming system (S4) was better for livelihood outcomes than the other systems. The social capitals were quite high while the economic capitals were quite low. Livelihood strategies give importance to increasing productivity, reducing costs, financial management, and changes in food consumption. All farms relied on government support and received welfare. For the 10-year economic model (2017-2026), S4 had the highest margin value. This study synthesized the relationships of production and livelihood adjustment model, showing that the model was composed of four sub-models: production system, support system, strategy, and livelihood adjustment system, and the resulting sustainable livelihood system will be useful for analyzing livelihood adjustments.

TI Rice with fish culture in the semi-deep waters of the Mekong Delta,
   Vietnam: a socio-economical survey
SO AQUACULTURE RESEARCH
AB The results of a socio-economical survey of farming systems practising rice culture with introduced fish, rice culture with indigenous fish and rice monoculture in the semi-deep waters of the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, are presented. Rice and fish yields, inputs, and cost-benefits were computed to evaluate the agricultural effects of rice with fish culture. Household size, labour availability and educational level were not significantly different among the three farming systems, Rice-fish farming systems differed mainly from rice monoculture by a higher fertilizer/water requirement and less pesticide use. The total farm cash and net return did not differ among the farming systems, The main beneficial effects of rice-fish culture are thought to be related to environmental sustainability, system biodiversity, farm diversification and household nutrition.

AB A tentative list of ecological attributes; diversity, cycling, stability and capacity, is proposed for quantification and ranking of farming systems along a hypothetical scale of increasing ecological sustainability. The modelling and preliminary analysis of four rice-based systems from the Philippines, two on-station experimental systems and two smallholder farms, confirms our intuitive perception of ecological sustainability and suggests a framework for further research into the area. This approach to farming systems analysis indicates that the route to an ecologically sustainable agriculture relies more on the principles of applied agro-ecology and less on the application of external agrochemical inputs. The practice is here termed integrated resources management and shares many of the characteristics of the agro-ecological engineering approach to integrated agriculture-aquaculture farming pioneered in China.

The literature contains a large number of farming systems and their name is made by one of the specific measures (specific work) that these includes. The Systems Agriculture widely used and those dominated are: the conventional farming systems, biodynamic, biological and sustainable farming system, that has emerged in the last decade. The need to create sustainable agriculture, that is stable and sustainable and a clean environment has emerged due to the danger caused by the negative effects of chemicalization agriculture. The creating implications of a sustainable agriculture system will allow of the agricultural activities to maintain the natural environment clean and to protect the fragile areas.

TI Agricultural Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services of Major Farming

   Southwestern Ethiopia
SO AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB Farming systems, with their concerns of biodiversity, ecosystem services, and productivity and production issues towards progress in human needs, wellbeing, and sustainable development, are challenging in most biosphere reserves. In this study, we assess the levels and trends of the agro-biodiversity and ecosystem services of different farming systems in the Yayo Biosphere Reserve in Ethiopia. Interviews with a total of 120 farmers, 16 key informants, and 12 focal group discussions (FDGs) were conducted, and species composition was assessed based on data collected on ten plots per major farming system. Result indicate that four farming systems, namely homegardens (HG), plantation coffee (PC), semi-forest coffee (SFC), and annual crop production (CP) systems, can be identified. Shannon and Evenness indices were highest in the HG system (H ' = 3.14, E = 0.8), and lowest in the CP system (H ' = 0.71, E = 0.18). Additionally, more diversified and relatively less cultivated farming systems provide more ecosystem services, and land users tend to practice less diversified farming systems in order to increase food supply at the expense of other ecosystem services. Therefore, this study recommends that diversified farming systems need to be considered to conserve or enhance specific ecosystem services in ways that reduce their negative tradeoffs.

TI Changes in coastal farming systems in a changing climate in Bangladesh
SO REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB Changes in farming systems are dominated by changes in global climate and local environment, apart from the non-climatic drivers. Given the challenges in partitioning the contribution of climatic and non-climatic factors to the changes in farming systems, this paper aims to assess the types and changes of coastal farming systems, the farmer perceptions of the causes of the changes in farming systems, and the relationship between the influencing factors and perceptions. A structured interview schedule was used to collect data from 381 randomly selected coastal households during September-October 2018. The random forest classification model was applied to estimate the relative importance of the farmers' characteristics on their perception of causes of changes in farming systems. This study reveals that the coastal farmers had mostly semi-subsistence type of mixed farming systems, which were going through dynamic changes in terms of their sizes and number of farmers. In general, the participation in rice, vegetables, and livestock farming was decreasing but increasing in fisheries, forestry, and fruit farming. Most (95.5%) of the farmers had to change at least one of the farming enterprises over the past decade (2009-2018) compared with the previous decade (1999-2008). About two-thirds of the farmers perceived that climate change had caused changes in their farming systems. Compared with the eastern coasts, the farmers in the western coasts tended to blame climate change to a higher extent for the effect on their agricultural activities. The random forest model outputs imply that the farmers who are younger in age and with less formal education, larger family, and smaller farmland should be supported with scientific knowledge on causes of changes in farming systems. This could help them more aware of climate change issues related to agriculture and increase their enthusiasm to take part in adaptive changes in farming systems.

TI Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Farmers and Their Responses: A Study
   of Three Farming Systems in Kerala, South India
SO LAND
AB Particularly in countries with an agrarian economy, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought hardships faced by farmers into sharp focus. One of the most badly hit countries was India. This study aims to bring to light the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the livelihoods of farmers in three farming systems (coffee farming, Kole wetland paddy farming, and homestead farming) in the southern Indian state of Kerala. We collected the data using telephone interviews and studied the impacts (economic, social, institutional) of the pandemic on the selected farming systems, the responses of farmers (short and long term) to these impacts, and the ability of farmers to secure their livelihoods (by analyzing resilience capacities and transforming structures and processes of the farming systems). The methodological framework used was developed based on the Sustainable Livelihoods Approach and the Resilience Framework. We found significant impacts on the three studied farming systems due to COVID-19. As the impacts, responses, and ability to secure livelihoods varied across the three farming systems, we concluded that there is not a single solution that could be prescribed for all farming systems and that each land use system must be treated individually.

The analysis has revealed local levels of farming intensification that could be detrimental, on a long-term basis, to the environmental compatibility of farming systems. However, the existence of specific regulations for milk production for Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, including the ban on feeding of corn silage, has been a key factor for maintaining a sustainable farming system in the area of origin of the typical cheese. Swine breeding was specifically addressed as a critical factor for farming systems modification.

It is in view of these, that this study seeks to investigate the perceived comparative advantage of organic and conventional farming systems in recent times. This study aimed at comparing the inputs and outputs of organic and conventional farming systems in Punjab province in Pakistan. In terms of farm inputs, the study revealed that organic crop farmers experienced higher mean expenses on irrigation and labor force with 12% and 7% difference respectively while on fertilizers and pesticides, the conventional farmers' mean expenses were significantly higher. In terms of farm outputs, the study also revealed that the conventional farmers yield was higher than that of the organic farmers by 11%. Irrespective of the findings, it was realized that people preferred to consume organic crops based on the quality of the crops prompted using natural manure unlike the conventional crops where the fertilizers are more of chemicals.

TI TRANSFORMATION OF AGRICULTURAL LAND DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS IN RUSSIA
SO EKONOMIKA POLJOPRIVREDA-ECONOMICS OF AGRICULTURE
AB In the conditions of degrading resources of fertile arable land, pressing demand for food from a growing world population, and progressing urbanization and industrialization, agricultural land distribution patterns are becoming more vulnerable to a variety of socioeconomic, environmental, and food security challenges. In the context of this trilemma, there is a need to understand the extent to which farming systems will be able to cope with increasing competition for land with other uses. In this study, the authors developed an approach for predicting the likely influences of non-agricultural lands on agricultural landscapes. In the case of diverse agricultural landscapes in Russia, farming systems were mapped based on a share of agricultural land categories in the land fund across 82 administrative entities. The establishment of a rating system and application of correlation analysis allowed revealing the mismatches between the cadaster-based spatial distribution of farming systems and actual inter-category relationships. The proposed framework is applicable internationally for the study of land-use patterns and simulation of agricultural land distribution systems under the influence of non-agricultural land uses.

TI Modelling as a tool to redesign livestock farming systems: a literature
   review
SO ANIMAL
AB Livestock farming has recently come under close scrutiny, in response especially to environmental issues. Farmers are encouraged to redesign their livestock farming systems in depth to improve their sustainability. Assuming that modelling can be a relevant tool to address such systemic changes, we sought to answer the following question: 'How can livestock farming systems be modelled to help farmers redesign their whole farming systems?' To this end, we made a literature review of the models of livestock farming systems published from 2000 to mid-2009 (n = 79). We used an analysis grid based on three considerations: (i) system definition, (ii) the intended use of the model and (iii) the way in which farmers' decision-making processes were represented and how agricultural experts and farmers were involved in the modelling processes. Consistent rationales in approaches to supporting changes in livestock farming were identified in three different groups of models, covering 83% of the whole set. These could be defined according to (i) the way in which farmers' decisions were represented and (ii) the model's type of contribution to supporting changes. The first type gathered models that dynamically simulated the system according to different management options; the farmers' decision-making processes are assumed to consist in choosing certain values for management factors. Such models allow long-term simulations and endorse different disciplinary viewpoints, but the farmers are weakly involved in their design. Models of the second type can indicate the best combination of farm activities under given constraints, provided the farmers' objectives are profit maximisation. However, when used to support redesigning processes, they address neither how to implement the optimal solution nor its long-term consequences. Models of the third type enable users to dynamically simulate different options for the farming system, the management of which is assumed to be planned according to the farmers' general objectives. Although more comprehensive, these models do not easily integrate different disciplinary viewpoints and different subsystems, which limits their usefulness as support tools for redesigning processes. Finally, we concluded about what specific requirements should be for modelling approaches if farmers were to be supported in redesigning their whole livestock farming systems using models.

TI Towards a control model for the highly cybernetic farming ecosystems
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART B-PESTICIDES FOOD
   CONTAMINANTS AND AGRICULTURAL WASTES
AB A dynamic model based on the linear systems theory is developed in designing a highly cybernetic farming strategy to efficiently manage residuals generated in farm ecosystems. A linear cybernetic model would be used to describe the dynamic behavior of resource flow in the farm ecosystem in which the state variables are resource quantities, and the control variables are residual quantities. The controlled process is defined as the controlled management strategy change. Cybernetic mechanism shows the application of residuals as control measures have determinate effects on the controlled process as along as the farming system is observable and controllable in the control sense. To illustrate the model algorithm the idea is applied to simulate the dynamic response of residual phosphorus concentrations in an integrated pig/corn farming system located in the south Taiwan region. General results show that the residual phosphorous concentration is influenced by farming activities which are controlled by a system of gross input and net output parameters. This paper demonstrates using input-output analysis technique that residuals generated in the farming system is the most important cybernetic variable, so that the proper management of residuals alone has the potential to maintain future productivity and sustainability.

AB Crop-Livestock-System (CLS) is an agricultural system approach that can improve business efficiency, maintain land fertility and realize sustainable agriculture, especially on small-scale agriculture. This research was conducted in Gunung Talang Subdistrict, Solok Regency, West Sumatra, aimed to find out the habits of farmers and the potential to integrate and calculate farmers' income if they only do one commodity farming, namely rice, or rice and cattle. Data collection was conducted from June to August 2018 using survey methods. Data collection was carried out through interviews with 30 lowland rice farmers as respondents, randomly selected. Data collected includes crop and livestock farming data such as: farmer characteristics, average rice field area, average productivity and production value, average number and value of inputs (seeds, inorganic fertilizers and organic fertilizers, and organic and inorganic pesticides, the average supply of laboratory in an integrated farming system between plants and cattle. The results showed that average rice yield was 5.74 tons/ha of dried ground rice. The use of inorganic fertilizer urea 100 kg/ha (N 71.43%), SP-36 50 kg/ha (50%), KCl 50-kg/ha (50%).The income of farmers with only rice IDR 11,816,807 for ones hectare land. Total income from paddy (1 ha) and livestock (2 heads) integrated farming system about IDR 17, 612,405/season and provide R/C value about 1.44, meanwhile R/C value of non integrated farming system about 1.33. It means, paddy and livestock integrated farming system could increase farmer's income about 49,45% per season compared to non integrated farming.

TI Impact of ecological and conventional farming systems on chemical and
   biological soil quality indices in a cold mountain climate in Slovakia
SO BIOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE & HORTICULTURE
AB There is a need to assess the impact of different farming methods on soil quality and fertility in specific ecoregions. Soil biochemical parameters and soil enzymatic activity appear very useful in monitoring soil pollution and management practices and can be used as indicators of sustainability. Soil chemical properties, biological properties and soil enzymatic activity (urease, acid and alkaline phosphatase) were investigated at six sites under ecological farming (no pesticides, organic fertilizers and crop rotation) and six sites under a conventional farming (pesticides and mineral fertilizers) system. A comparative study was performed during years 2008-2011 under production conditions in the investigated areas, situated in the marginal region of north-eastern Slovakia. Research showed that high doses of organic fertilizers had positive effect on soil productivity, and thus indirectly on maintaining soil pH and accumulation of humus in soil. The values of soil enzyme activities changed minimally during the research period. Statistically significant effect of experimental year and locality on all observed soil parameters was confirmed by analysis of variance. Large differences between the two sites were found in terms of microbiological properties, which are sensitive soil indicators of changes occurred under different farming systems. The study confirmed the positive influence and higher microbial activity indices of ecological farming (36% higher enzymatic activity, 65% higher soil respiration content, 60% higher soil microbial biomass carbon content) compared with conventional farming system.

TI Farming system design to feed the changing world. A review
SO AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Agricultural production is unstable as a result of complex, dynamic and interrelated factors such as climate, markets and public policy that are beyond farmers' control. Farmers must therefore develop new farming systems incorporating innovations in objectives, organization and practices adapted to changing production contexts. As a consequence, agronomists have expanded the "farming system design" field of research. A variety of quantitative and qualitative design approaches have been developed to support the analysis of current farming systems and the design and evaluation of alternatives. A comprehensive literature assessment is lacking for this emerging field of agricultural science. Here we review 41 farming system design approaches using computer models. Our main findings are the following: (1) the reviewed literature do not make reference to the theoretical approaches from the field of design science. (2) Two categories of farming system approaches can be distinguished: optimisation approaches, and participatory and simulation-based approaches. These two categories are connected to two of the main design science theories. (3) For optimisation approaches, farming system design is mainly seen as a problem-solving process. Emphasis is placed on the computational exploration of the solution space by a problem-solving algorithm. (4) For participatory and simulation-based approaches, conceptualization of the design problem is central to the farming system design process. The subsequent exploration of the solution space relies on the creativity of humans. (5) Optimisation approaches, and participatory and simulation-based approaches are oriented towards the development of exploitative rather than exploratory innovations. Exploitative innovations involve the exploitation of available knowledge while exploration innovations build on knowledge created in the course of the design process.

SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB In the eastern Amazon, new grasslands cultivated after deforestation often suffer fast weed invasion, which is a significant problem for the sustainability of new farming systems. The authors study the links between farming systems and grassland deterioration using farm survey data. They distinguish two main farm trajectories a changing trajectory in which farmers do not maintain a good balance between grassland and cattle, leading to deterioration; and a stabilized trajectory in which farmers implement various grassland management measures ranging from continuous grazing to complex rotation, with low weed invasion. The conditions for stabilization of farming systems and the choices available for grassland management are discussed.

TI Nitrogen leaching losses and balances in conventional and organic
   farming systems in Kenya
SO NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS
AB Organic farming has been proposed as a solution to foster agricultural sustainability and mitigate the negative environmental impacts of conventional farming. This study assessed N losses and soil surface N balances in conventional and organic farming systems in a sub-humid and semi-humid (Chuka and Thika) sites in Kenya. Nitrate-N (NO3--N) leached was trapped at 1m depth using the Self Integrating Accumulator core method and the changes in mineral-N were assessed at different soil depths and different crop growth stages. Both conventional and organic farming systems lost substantial amounts of NO3--N at the early growth stages of all the crops. Cumulative NO3--N leached was similar in all the farming systems in each cropping season. More NO3--N was leached during potato cropping (22-38kgNha(-1)) than during maize (0.9-5.7kgNha(-1)) and vegetable cropping (1.9-2.9kgNha(-1)). Under maize cultivation, three times more NO3--N was leached at Chuka site than at Thika site. During the potato cropping, between 79 and 83% of the N applied in the low input systems was leached, compared to 10-20% in the high input systems. Only Org-High exhibited a positive soil surface N balance (797-1263kgha(-1)) over a whole rotation period at both sites. We recommend reducing N applications for potato in all farming systems and at the early growth stages for all the crops in order to reduce N loss to the environment. We also recommend increasing N application rates in the low input systems and to developing a model to guide application of organic inputs.

TI Effects of strip intercropping and organic farming systems on quantity
   and quality of maize yield in a Mediterranean region of Turkey
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB Cowpea (Vigna sinensis L.) and okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L.) are traditionally intercropped with maize (Zea mays L.) by small-scale farmers in the Mediterranean region of Turkey. In this experiment, the performances of monoculture-organic (MO), strip intercropping-organic (10), monoculture-conventional (MC), and strip intercropping-conventional (IC) farming systems were compared with respect to yield quantity and quality properties of sweet maize, and local cowpea and okra varieties for 2 years. The land equivalent ratios (LERs) calculated based on mean maximum and minimum yields of cowpeas and okras ranged between 0.94 and 1.25 for strip intercropping with sweet maize. There appeared to be no difference in mean yields of maize, cowpeas, and okras between the 10 and IC systems and in mean maize yields between the MO and MC systems (P > 0.05). The LER value (0.99) of the 10 farming system was higher than that (0.95) of IC farming system. The LER values close to one indicated that there were no significant differences in yield quantity and quality of the crops among the four farming systems. The findings revealed that strip intercropping alone or in combination with organic cropping may be equally profitable to monoculture and favored for sustainable farming if agricultural production costs including environmental externalities, such as environmental degradation and destruction were accounted for.

TI EVALUATION OF THE POPULATION-DYNAMICS OF ANNUAL WEEDS TO TEST INTEGRATED
   WEED MANAGEMENT AT A FARMING SYSTEM-LEVEL
SO LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
AB In the Netherlands. several research projects are being carried out to develop sustainable farming systems that are characterized by markedly reduced inputs of pesticides and fertilizers. In these long-term projects, weed management appeared to be a serious constraint on the introduction of sustainable agriculture. A method to monitor the population dynamics of annual weeds in crop rotations and to compare the results for farming systems is presented. Preliminary results show that, after 3-5 years, weed densities tended to be higher in the integrated systems than in the conventional reference systems. This trend in the population dynamics of weeds is discussed with respect to differences in inputs in weed management (active ingredients) . possible effects on crop yields and improved strategies to prevent increases in weed abundance.

TI A new analytical framework of farming system and agriculture model
   diversities. A review
SO AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB In most current farming system classifications (e.g. "conventional"versus "organic"), each type of farming system encompasses a wide variety of farming practices and performances. Classifying farming systems using concepts such as "ecological", "sustainable intensification"or "agro-ecology"is not satisfactory because the concepts "overlap in. definitions, principles and practices, thus creating. confusion in their meanings, interpretations and implications". Existing classifications most often focus either on biotechnical functioning or on socio-economic contexts of farming systems. We reviewed the literature to develop an original analytical framework of the diversity of farming systems and agriculture models that deal with these limits. To describe this framework, we first present the main differences between three biotechnical types of farming systems differing in the role of ecosystem services and external inputs: chemical input-, biological input-and biodiversity-based farming systems. Second, we describe four key socio-economic contexts which determine development and functioning of these farming systems: globalised commodity-based food systems, circular economies, alternative food systems and integrated landscape approaches. Third, we present our original analytical framework of agriculture models, defined as biotechnical types of farming systems associated with one or a combination of socio-economic contexts differing in the role of relationships based on global market prices and "territorial embeddedness". We demonstrate the potential of this framework by describing six key agriculture models and reviewing key scientific issues in agronomy associated with each one. We then analyse the added value of our analytical framework and its generic character. Lastly, we discuss transversal research issues of the agriculture models, concerning the technologies required, their function in the bioeconomy, their multi-criteria and multi-level assessments, their co-existence and the transitions between them.

TI Adaptive capacity of farming systems to climate change in Iran:
   Application of composite index approach
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB CONTEXT: Climate change is expected to adversely affect agricultural production, particularly in Iran where the agricultural sector forms the backbone of the economy. This is true for the agriculture sector of the southwest region of Iran which is largely rain-fed and dominated by smallholder farmers with minimal livelihood alter-natives. Although several studies have been conducted on climate change, little has been done on the adaptive capacity of farmers within farming systems, especially in Iran.OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to evaluate the adaptive capacity of four common farming systems (i.e., family farming system, cooperative farming system, commercialized farming system, and agro-enterprise farming system) in Fars province, southwestern Iran.METHODS: A seven-step approach was used to normalize, weigh, and aggregate 102 individual indicators within a composite adaptive capacity index that is dimensionless, ranging from 0 to 1, and 1 is the optimal value. The required data were collected using a cross-sectional survey from 1472 farmers within the four mentioned farming systems.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the highest value was recorded by agro-enterprise for knowledge, perception and awareness, transport and physical accessibility, and institution and economic resources. Agro-enterprise scored higher in terms of awareness and action, which shows that these farming systems have a higher capacity for adaptation to the threat posed by climate diversity. Farmers in this farming system benefit from high formal education, high perceptions about the threat and risk of climate change, the occurrence of climatic events, causes for the change in climatic parameters, and awareness of climate change impactsSIGNIFICANCE: This paper recommends resilience-building interventions in the study area, which target in-dividuals with low adaptive capacities, especially farmers. The results can also assist agricultural policymakers to recognize which components and determinants of adaptive capacity should be prioritized to mitigate the threat of climate change to farming systems.

   Approaches
CY SEP 02-06, 2018
CL Clermont Ferrand, FRANCE
AB The role of herbivorous livestock in supporting the sustainability of the farming systems in which they are found is complex and sometimes conflicting. In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the integration of livestock into farming systems is important for sustainable agriculture as the recycling of nutrients for crop production through returns of animal manure is a central element of the dominant mixed crop-livestock systems. Sustainable agriculture has been widely advocated as the main practical pathway to address the challenge of meeting the food needs of the rapidly growing population in SSA while safeguarding the needs of future generations. The objective of this paper is to review the state of knowledge of the role of herbivores in sustainable intensification of key farming systems in SSA. The pathways to sustainable agriculture in SSA include intensification of production and livelihood diversification. Sustainable agricultural practices in SSA have focused on intensification practices which aim to increase the output : input ratio through increasing use of inputs, introduction of new inputs or use of existing inputs in a new way. Intensification of livestock production can occur through increased and improved fodder availability, genetic production gains, improved crop residue use and better nutrient recycling of manure. Livestock deliver many 'goods' in smallholder farming systems in SSA including improving food and nutrition security, increased recycling of organic matter and nutrients and the associated soil fertility amendments, adding value to crop residues by turning them into nutrient-rich foods, income generation and animal traction. Narratives on livestock 'bads' or negative environmental consequences have been largely shaped by the production conditions in the Global North but livestock production in SSA is a different story. In SSA, livestock are an integral component of mixed farming systems and they play key roles in supporting the livelihoods of much of the rural population. None-the-less, the environmental consequences of livestock production on the continent cannot be ignored. To enhance agricultural sustainability in SSA, the challenge is to optimize livestock's role in the farming systems by maximizing livestock 'goods' while minimizing the 'bads'. This can be through better integration of livestock into the farming systems, efficient nutrient management systems, and provision of necessary policy and institutional support.

AB Integrated farming system was directed in efforts to lengthen biological cycle by optimizing use of agriculture and livestock products. Each chain of cycle resulted new product that have high economic value, so this system was expected to optimize empowerment and use of marginal land in all regions. The problems encountered in agricultural systems in tidal swamp land in general, i.e; (a) limitations in the form of land, human resources, technology, and capital owned by farmers, then the potential of local resources need to be managed optimally, directed, integrated and sustainable with a view to improve land productivity and living standards of farmers by way of application of integrated farming systems by integrating crop and livestock based on the potential of local areas, and (b) socioeconomic problems and constraints in the development of food crops was due to a swamp area. The objective of this research was to produce integrated farming system concept to support agroindustry development in tidal swamp land in Pulang Pisau regency of Central Kalimantan province. This research was conducted with a book study method, which identifies a system consisting of integrated farming and agroindustry systems. In the both identification is performed by the system includes four aspects, i,e; economic aspects, technical aspects, social aspects of cultural and environmental. Integrated farming systems concept in tidal swamp land was generated from the production of integrated farming systems should first be processed through the processing system (agroindustry) in the form of home industry, or using a mechanical device. After that, it was carried out the marketing of products, systems concepts was expected to increase the added value of agricultural production (rice, coffee and cow). With the application of agroindustry systems in tidal swamp land Pulang Pisau regency of Central Kalimantan Province is expected to increase the economic income of farmers in village.

TI Visualizing Sustainability of Selective Mountain Farming Systems from
   Far-eastern Himalayas to Support Decision Making
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Mountain farming systems rely on both empirical and academic knowledge. Their sustainability depends on how effectively diverse knowledge is used for solution-oriented decision making. For mountains, decisions must be conducive to rural farmers whose livelihoods depend on agriculture and related activities. Adopting transdisciplinary research approach, we define a composite Sustainability Space indicator that will help decision makers better understand the ingredients for sustainability, and formulate policy and management decisions to reinforce on-the-ground sustainability. Sustainability Space was derived through analysis of the positive and negative impact factors co-defined by community and disciplinary experts, and visualized through a radar diagram. We used Principal Component Analysis to understand relationships between factors. The results on Sustainability Spaces for eight cases of farming systems from the far-Eastern Himalayas indicated that the sustainability of farming systems is strengthened if decisions holistically cater to (i) geophysical pre-requisites, (ii) ecological foundations, (iii) integrated processes and practices, (iv) resources, knowledge, and value systems, (v) stakeholders' development and economic aspirations, (vi) well-being of farming communities, and (vii) government support mechanisms. More equitable the attention to these seven components, the higher the sustainability of farming systems in this region could be.

AB Precise management of soil mineral nitrogen (N) is necessary to optimize the profitability of a farming system and to minimize groundwater pollution by reducing N leaching. Organic and low-input farming systems are alternatives to conventional systems for sustainable soil fertility. Little information is available, however, on the effects of these farming systems on soil mineral N availability. Evaluation of a 4-year rotation of organic (no synthetic fertilizer or pesticide use), low-input (reduced amount of synthetic fertilizer and pesticide use), and conventional (synthetic fertilizer and pesticides applied at conventionally recommended rates) (conv-4) fanning systems, and a conventional 2-year rotation (conv-2) on potentially mineralizable nitrogen (PMN) and soil mineral N levels in irrigated processing tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) was conducted after 10 years of management. The organic and low-input systems showed 112% and 36% greater PMN pools than the conventional system, respectively. However, nitrogen mineralization rate in the conventional system was 100% greater than in the organic and 28,70 greater than in the low-input system. Organic and low-input systems showed a small but continuous supply of mineral N during the cropping season, while the conventional systems supplied mineral N as fertilizer pulses.

TI Resource integration for multiple benefits: Multifunctionality of
   integrated farming systems in Northeast Thailand
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB Resource degradation in rice farming systems in Thailand endangers food security, but the systems may become more sustainable by combining them with aquaculture and livestock farm enterprises by capitalization of their synergies in resource use and re-use, i.e. by adopting integrated farming systems. Most empirical studies that assess this potential have focused on a few specific aspects, but not on the multiple social, economic, and ecological functions of resource integration. This study uses the framework of multifunction agriculture to assess the performance of integrated farming systems in Thailand and compares its performance with that of 'normal-rice' or non-integrated farming systems. Surveys were conducted in Khon Kaen province of Northeast Thailand using a combination of quantitative and qualitative survey methods.
   Integrated farming systems were found to outperform the normal or commercial farming systems in all four dimensions of a multifunctional agriculture: food security, environmental functions, economic functions, and social functions. The findings support the notion that diversification and integration of resources on farms is feasible in both economic and ecological terms. The analyses shows that integrated farming does not, however, diminish the need for external inputs. High start-up cost might constrain farmers from switching to integrated farming and from exploiting the benefits of resource integration. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Crop yield gap and stability in organic and conventional farming systems
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB A key challenge for sustainable intensification of agriculture is to produce increasing amounts of food and feed with minimal biodiversity loss, nutrient leaching, and greenhouse gas emissions. Organic farming is considered more sustainable, however, less productive than conventional farming. We analysed results from an experiment started under identical soil conditions comparing one organic and two conventional farming systems. Initially, yields in the organic farming system were lower, but approached those of both conventional systems after 10-13 years, while requiring lower nitrogen inputs. Unexpectedly, organic farming resulted in lower coefficient of variation, indicating enhanced spatial stability, of pH, nutrient mineralization, nutrient availability, and abundance of soil biota. Organic farming also resulted in improved soil structure with higher organic matter concentrations and higher soil aggregation, a profound reduction in groundwater nitrate concentrations, and fewer plant-parasitic nematodes. Temporal stability between the three farming systems was similar, but when excluding years of Phytophthora outbreaks in potato, temporal stability was higher in the organic farming system. There are two non-mutually exclusive mechanistic explanations for these results. First, the enhanced spatial stability in the organic farming system could result from changes in resource-based (i.e. bottom-up) processes, which coincides with the observed higher nutrient provisioning throughout the season in soils with more organic matter. Second, enhanced resource inputs may also affect stability via increased predator-based (i.e. top-down) control. According to this explanation, predators stabilize population dynamics of soil organisms, which is supported by the observed higher soil food web biomass in the organic farming system.We conclude that closure of the yield gap between organic and conventional farming can be a matter of time and that organic farming may result in greater spatial stability of soil biotic and abiotic properties and soil processes. This is likely due to the time required to fundamentally alter soil properties.

TI Long-term farming systems modulate multi-trophic responses
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Soil microbiome andmulti-trophic relationships are essential for the stability and functioning of agroecosystems. However, little is known about how farming systems and alternative methods for controlling plant pathogens modulate microbial communities, soil mesofauna and plant productivity. In this study, we assessed the composition of eukaryotic microbial groups using a high-throughput sequencing approach (18S rRNA gene marker), the populations of parasitic and free-living nematodes, plant productivity and their inter-relationships in long-term conventional and organic farming systems. The diversity of the fungal community increased in the organic farming system compared to the conventional farming system, whereas the diversity of the protist community was similar between the two farming systems. Compared to conventional farming, organic farming increased the population of free-living nematodes and suppressed plant parasitic nematodes belonging to Meloidogynidae and Pratylenchidae. Fungal diversity and community structure appeared to be related to nematode suppression in the system receiving organic fertilizer, which was characterized by component microbial groups known to be involved in the suppression of soil pathogens. Unraveling the microbiome and multi-trophic interactions in different farming systems may permit the management of the soil environment toward more sustainable control of plant pathogens.

TI Sustainability Analysis of Dairy-Horticulture Integrated Farming System
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
AB Purpose : The Integrated farming system offers better opportunities to be implemented in smallholder agriculture because it ensures productivity and profitability for sustainable livelihoods. However, the evaluation of this practice has not been clearly identified. This study is aimed at evaluating the ecological, economic, social, institutional, and technological aspects of sustainability of existing dairy-horticulture farming systems at farm level.
   Research Method : Data were collected through survey design using questionnaire, observation, and literature review. This research used Multidimensional Scaling, leverage analysis and Monte Carlo called RAP-DHFS (Rapid Appraisal for Dairy-Horticulture Farming System) to analyze the data.
   Findings : The results showed that the sustainability status of ecological dimension, economic dimension, social dimension, and technological dimension were classified as less sustainable which were 28.07%, 29.52%, 27.37%, and 29.15, respectively while the institutional dimension was considered as unsustainable (21.77%). There were also 10 attributes identified as the most influential attributes on the sustainability status.
   Limitations : The study was conducted at one village, which is a small scope of area.
   Value : This study provides a holistic assessment of the integrated farming system and shows the concern and risk for further development in rural areas.

TI Multiple-criteria decision analysis for integrated catchment management
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB implementation of integrated catchment management (ICM) is hampered by the lack of a conceptual framework for explaining how landowners select farming systems for their properties. Benefit-cost analysis (a procedure that estimates the costs and benefits of alternative actions or policies) has limitations in this regard, which might be overcome by using multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). MCDA evaluates and ranks alternatives based on a landowner's preferences (weights) for multiple-criteria and the values of those criteria. A MCDA approach to ICM is superior to benefit-cost analysis which focuses only on the monetary benefits and costs, because it: 1) recognizes that human activities within a catchment are motivated by multiple and often competing criteria and/or constraints; 2) does not require monetary valuation of criteria; 3) allows trade-offs between criteria to be measured and evaluated; 4) explicitly considers how the spatial configuration of farming systems in a catchment influences the values of criteria; 5) is comprehensive, knowledge-based, and stakeholder oriented which greatly increases the likelihood of resolving catchment problems; and 6) allows consideration of the fairness and sustainability, of land and water resource management decisions. A MCDA based on an additive, multiple-criteria utility function containing five economic and environmental criteria was used to score and rank five farming systems. The rankings were based on the average criteria weights for a sample of 20 farmers in a US catchment. The most profitable farming system was the lowest-ranked farming system. Three possible reasons for this result are evaluated. First, the MCDA method might cause respondents to express socially acceptable attitudes towards environmental criteria even when they are not important from a personal viewpoint. Second, the MCDA method could inflate the ranks of less profitable farming systems for the simple reason that it allows the respondent to assign non-zero weights to non-economic criteria. Third, the MCDA might provide a better framework for evaluating a landowner's selection of farming systems than the profit maximization model. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Evaluation of the sustainability of contrasted pig farming systems: the
   procedure, the evaluated systems and the evaluation tools
SO ANIMAL
AB Although a few studies consider the sustainability of animal farming systems along the three classical main pillars (economy, environment and society), most studies on pig farming systems address only one of these pillars. The present paper is the introduction to a series of companion papers presenting the results of a study undertaken within the EU-supported project Q-PorkChains, aiming at building a comprehensive tool for the evaluation of pig farming systems, which is robust to accommodate the large variability of systems existing in Europe. The tool is mostly based on questions to farmers and comprises a total of 37 dimensions distributed along eight themes: Animal Welfare, Animal Health, Breeding Programmes, Environmental 5ustainability, Meat Safety, Market Conformity, Economy and Working Conditions. The paper describes the procedure that was used for building the tool, using it on 15 contrasted pig farming systems and analysing the results. The evaluated systems are briefly described and a short overview of the dimensions is provided. Detailed descriptions of the theme-wise tools and results, as well as the results of an integrated evaluation, are available in the companion papers.

TI Revisiting and modelling the woodland farming system of the early
   Neolithic Linear Pottery Culture (LBK), 5600-4900 BC
SO VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY
AB This article presents the conception and the conceptual results of a modelling representation of the farming systems of the Linearbandkeramik Culture (LBK). Assuming that there were permanent fields (PF) then, we suggest four ways that support the sustainability of such a farming system over time: a generalized pollarding and coppicing of trees to increase the productivity of woodland areas for foddering more livestock, which itself can then provide more manure for the fields, a generalized use of pulses grown together with cereals during the same cropping season, thereby reducing the needs for manure. Along with assumptions limiting bias on village and family organizations, the conceptual model which we propose for human environment in the LBK aims to be sustainable for long periods and can thereby overcome doubts about the PFs hypothesis for the LBK farming system. Thanks to a reconstruction of the climate of western Europe and the consequent vegetation pattern and productivity arising from it, we propose a protocol of experiments and validation procedures for both testing the PFs hypothesis and defining its eco-geographical area.

TI The ecological dynamics of low external input agriculture: A case study
   of hill farming in a developing country
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
AB This paper on Low External Input Agriculture (LEIA) has explored how indigenous hill farming systems in a developing country setting of rural Nepal are functioning and which ecological properties of such systems could contribute to the development of Low External Input and Sustainable Agriculture (LEISA). Three cases were studied using direct field observation, group discussion and interviews, and the important practices of LEIA were ranked into eight classes to analyse the ecological sustainability of the hill farming systems. The study shows that the hill farming system is complex, diverse, heavily reliant on local resources and focuses on the renewability of production resources within the farm. All this can greatly contribute to make the system ecologically sustainable. However, demands for increased production put considerable pressure on farmers to apply external inputs which, if in excess, may jeopardise the whole system. A prerequisite for guidance in careful soil management is the strengthening of supportive research aimed at teaching farmers how to use external inputs. This must agree with the principles of sustainable agriculture and take into account the site-specific variations which are characteristic of Nepalese hill farming systems. We defined the term Ecological Dynamics as 'the pattern of changes in structure and/or forces in processes which govern the development of natural and artificial ecosystems'. This definition assists in identification of trends in ecological sustainability. Understanding indigenous farming systems reveals important ecological clues essential for the development of sustainable agriculture.

TI Which Innovative Cropping System for Which Farmer? Supporting Farmers'
   Choices Through Collective Activities
SO FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB Designing innovative cropping systems is an active field of agricultural research challenged by the agroecological transition. One of the challenges is to adapt cropping systems to the diversity of farms and contexts. For instance, in the cotton production zone of Burkina Faso differences between farm resources, agricultural situations and agronomic constraints have resulted in a wide range of farming systems. In this context, to break with the trend toward cotton production, we co-designed eight legume-based innovative cropping systems (ICS) likely to meet the objectives sought and the constraints faced by a wide range of local farmers, thus constituting a "basket of options". Our approach was to enable each farmer to choose the option they considered best suited to their conditions. To that end, the ICSs were implemented and discussed with farmers in participatory prototyping trials. After one season of co-evaluating the different ICSs, the farmers taking part in the co-evaluation were able to test an ICS on their own farm, by choosing and adapting one of the options. Thirty-nine farmers out of seventy-three chose an ICS to test. They were asked the reasons for their choice. Their selection criteria were analyzed in relation to comments made during collective activities organized in the participatory prototyping trials. To complete this analysis, we built an expert-based farming system typology and a statistical typology based on data collected in a rural household multi-indicator survey (RHoMIS) of 63 farms participating in this study. The two farming system typologies were compared, and the relationships between farming system types and the ICS tested on the farm were analyzed. We found that farmers did not really base their choice on their farming system. Rather, they used a wide range of criteria that varied from farmer to farmer, and they were influenced by what they had learned during the collective activities organized in the participatory prototyping trials.

TI Sustainable agricultural development using a farming systems approach in
   Zambia
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB Zambia implemented the Farming Systems Research and Extension approach to development of agricultural technologies during the last decade. The results seem to indicate that the inter-related objectives of increasing productivity, income and short-term food security of small-scale farmers have been addressed, but the achievements may have come at the expense of long-term sustainability in agricultural development. The system relied too heavily on farmer priorities and technologies dependent on purchased inputs. If sustainable systems are to be developed, both short-term gains and long-term sustainability issues must be included in the program. Since the FSR/E program was established in the early 1980s, relevant factors that pushed the issue of sustainability to the forefront have been recognized. These include population pressure, poor soil fertility and rising prices of inorganic fertilizer. Specific recommendations include low-input technologies, restoring soil fertility, animal husbandry and agroforestry.

TI Impact assessment of climate change on farming systems in the South
   Mediterranean area: a Tunisian case study
SO REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB This study considers a quantitative approach for assessing the performance of Tunisian farming systems to face climate change. It is based on the resilience concept and the calculation, with a modelling chain, of three indicators: land stock, labour stock, and income flux. Two system states, "base" and "climate change", and a time horizon of 2010-2025, are developed and compared for representative farming systems. The study shows that 55% of the farming systems were identified as being resilient to climate change. They are diversified and mostly grow cereals, vegetables, and forage crops combined with livestock, increasing their capability to mitigate climate change by reorganizing crop activities. 35% of the farms identified as being non-resilient are dominated by orchards, or cereals and orchards. They showed an important drop in farm income (-45%), mainly due to their inability to adapt their cropping systems to water stress and soil salinity. Finally, only 10% were identified as being poorly resilient farming systems. Those farms have mainly intensified cereal cropping systems based on a strategy of purchasing land to increase the surface area of profitable activities (forage and livestock). Overall, the methodology can be adapted for other dry land areas in the Mediterranean region and help experts and policy-makers to propose and test strategies for adapting to climate change.

TI A decision support framework for the design and operation of sustainable
   urban farming systems
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The increasing population and continuous urbanization make food security prominent in sustainable development. It is important to develop economic and resource-efficient farming solutions to meet food demand. Renewable energy and waste valorization may bring benefits to build sustainable food production systems and facilitate circular economy. This work aims to develop a decision support framework for the stakeholders to quantitatively assess and optimize their urban farming systems for efficient investment and operation. The proposed framework is based on a holistic system model that considers the energy and material consumption in vegetable production processes and the economic and environmental performance of urban farming systems. In the multi-dimensional assessment model, the net present value and cradle-to-gate CO2 emission, water consumption, and land occupation of different configurations of urban farming systems were assessed. In a further development, the assessment model was embedded in an optimization framework to identify the optimal system design and operation. The optimal crop mix and the corresponding cultivation set points (such as temperature, humidity, irradiance, illumination time, and CO2 concentration) for the farming modules were determined via optimization. To demonstrate the proposed framework, a case study on the design and operation of a vertical farm in Singapore was carried out. The case study examined alternative farming systems with glass-enclosed vs window-free structural design, grid vs solar photovoltaic (PV) energy supply, and traditional chemical fertilizers vs food waste compost fertilization. Results showed that plant-factory farming systems integrated with solar PV and beer-residue-derived fertilizer could be a promising and sustainable farming solution for Singapore as a tropical megacity.

TI Agrobiodiversity and perceived climatic change effect on family farming
   systems in semiarid tropics of Kenya
SO OPEN AGRICULTURE
AB The steady decline in agrobiodiversity is not only a significant threat to the genetic stability of the rural agroecosystems but also places a huge impediment to the realization of global food security. Climate change and decline in arable land is forcing subsistence farmers to abandon the less productive but well-adapted local crops for the newer short term and drought-tolerant crops decimating agrobiodiversity further. This study sought to establish the on-farm species and genetic diversity status among the family farming systems of semiarid areas of Eastern Kenya and effect on food security, agrobiodiversity management strategies, their perception of climate change, and climate change coping strategies. Structured questionnaires were administered to 92 active farmers in Embu, Kitui, and Tharaka Nithi Counties of Eastern Kenya. On-farm diversity, socio-economic factors, and their impact on agrobiodiversity were determined. Possible correlations were established using Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient. Remarkably, 26 crop species were recorded where legumes and cereals were dominant. According to the Shannon-Wiener Diversity index (H'), Tharaka Nithi County recorded the highest legumes and cereals diversity indices of 3.436 and 3.449, respectively. Food shortage was reported by over 50% of the respondents in the study area. The existence of weaker adaptive measures in response to climate change was evident. Family farming systems that had higher crop diversification and integrated livestock rearing in their farms were more food secure. Improved mitigation to climate change and diversification of farming systems among the smallholder farms is essential not only in boosting the food security but also in establishment of sustainable farming systems resilient to climate change.

TI Theoretical and practical considerations in the development of a
   methodological framework for evaluating sustainability of low-input
   ruminant farming systems in developing countries
SO ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
AB The sustainability of low-input ruminant farming systems remains poorly understood and evaluation frameworks that adequately capture their complexity are lacking. The multiple goals of producers, multipurpose roles of ruminants, animal welfare issues, credence goods and services of the system are omitted in existing frameworks. In that context, development of a novel comprehensive framework for evaluating the sustainability of the low-put ruminant farming system is important. The current manuscript, therefore, provides an overview of a systemic process for developing a participatory and interdisciplinary methodological framework to measure sustainability of the low-input ruminant farming system. The proposed framework provides guidance on potentially relevant variables and their subcomponents, and for designing appropriate data collection tools, conducing field measurements and analysing results. The suggested framework captures the complex interrelationships within and between dimensions and indicators of sustainability and apply a system dynamics approach to integrate the indicators into an overall measure of the sustainability of a system.

TI Clean biotechnology for sustainable farming
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGY
AB Sustainability would never be achieved farewell as agricultural practices continue beyond the carrying capacity of the ecosystem through the exaggerated abuse of agricultural chemicals. The rapid growth of agricultural productivity in chemical farming systems is shrinking off. Moreover, environmental torrent from agricultural activities jeopardizes agricultural growth in several countries. Problems associated with the wealthy agricultural production in the developed world and underproduction in developing countries necessitate a widely accepted assessment of the present status of agriculture. It is time to install new farming systems committed to following environmental and sustainable approaches, and producing healthy food free from agrochemical residues. Ecologically oriented farming routines are being developed within the frame of the recent achievements in environmental biotechnology, the mos. important of which is the clean farming system which is increasingly acknowledged as a potential solution to copious problems overlaying present world agriculture. It is a farming system, which aims at evading the routine use of agricultural chemicals and reducing their rates of application. Clean farming systems directly give rise to four environmental biotechnologies, i.e.. recycling of composted organic waste, fortifying the rhizosphere soil with biofertilizers, encouraging the use of biopesticides in agricultural practices and bioremediation of polluted agro-ecosystems.

TI Typology and structural characterisation of suckler cow farming system
   in Central Macedonia, Greece
SO ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE
AB The aim of this study was to establish a farm typology of the suckler cow sector, based on a stratified sample of 66 farms in the region of Central Macedonia, Greece. The method of hierarchical cluster analysis has been used to typology and characterisation of the farming system. The farm size was determined by the number of suckler cows and total livestock units. The degree of intensification of the farming system was classified based on the stocking rate of available pastures, labour efficiency, housing system and level of infrastructure. Cow productivity was evaluated as the weaned calves to cows' ratio. The profitability and the dependence of farms on subsidies were estimated by using gross profit with or without the addition of total subsidies. Following the results, four principal farming systems and one diversified were highlighted: firstly, a traditional, pasture-based, semi-extensive system with low profitability and strong dependence on subsidies was identified. Secondly, a viable and relatively profitable, despite the lack of pasture land, semi-intensive system was revealed. The third one was also a semi-intensive system with high pasture availability and low reliance on subsidies. The intensive farming system that was represented by the fourth case was unsustainable due to the absence of available pastures. The semi-intensive one, which characterised as 'diversified' was not a pure suckler cow farming system as it was mainly based on purchased calves fattening.

TI Yield and Economic Performance of Organic and Conventional Cotton-Based
   Farming Systems - Results from a Field Trial in India
SO PLOS ONE
AB The debate on the relative benefits of conventional and organic farming systems has in recent time gained significant interest. So far, global agricultural development has focused on increased productivity rather than on a holistic natural resource management for food security. Thus, developing more sustainable farming practices on a large scale is of utmost importance. However, information concerning the performance of farming systems under organic and conventional management in tropical and subtropical regions is scarce. This study presents agronomic and economic data from the conversion phase (2007-2010) of a farming systems comparison trial on a Vertisol soil in Madhya Pradesh, central India. A cotton-soybean-wheat crop rotation under biodynamic, organic and conventional (with and without Bt cotton) management was investigated. We observed a significant yield gap between organic and conventional farming systems in the 1st crop cycle (cycle 1: 2007-2008) for cotton (-29%) and wheat (-27%), whereas in the 2nd crop cycle (cycle 2: 2009-2010) cotton and wheat yields were similar in all farming systems due to lower yields in the conventional systems. In contrast, organic soybean (a nitrogen fixing leguminous plant) yields were marginally lower than conventional yields (-1% in cycle 1, -11% in cycle 2). Averaged across all crops, conventional farming systems achieved significantly higher gross margins in cycle 1 (+29%), whereas in cycle 2 gross margins in organic farming systems were significantly higher (+25%) due to lower variable production costs but similar yields. Soybean gross margin was significantly higher in the organic system (+11%) across the four harvest years compared to the conventional systems. Our results suggest that organic soybean production is a viable option for smallholder farmers under the prevailing semi-arid conditions in India. Future research needs to elucidate the long-term productivity and profitability, particularly of cotton and wheat, and the ecological impact of the different farming systems.

TI Understanding farming systems and their economic performance in
   Telangana, India: Not all that glitters is gold
SO CURRENT RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB Farming systems are transitioning from a subsistence orientation to market orientation in response to changing food demands, technologies, and policies. In India's dryland regions, watershed development, among several other initiatives, has been a critical driver of these transitions, but their outcomes are poorly understood. The present paper investigates the characteristics and economic performance of current farming systems in a region in Telangana, India, that has undergone a rapid transition from subsistence orientation to market orientation. We surveyed 3006 farms, followed by a farm-economics study involving 75 households belonging to the three major farming systems. The gross margin was low for all systems but most inadequate for the crop-without-livestock system, highest for the crop-with-small-ruminants system, and intermediate for the crop-with-dairy system. Economic risks and natural-resource scarcity threaten the sustainability of current farming systems, and the reassessment of watershed development policies is recommended.

TI Greenhouse gas fluxes from agricultural soils under organic and
   non-organic management - A global meta-analysis
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB It is anticipated that organic farming systems provide benefits concerning soil conservation and climate protection. A literature search on measured soil-derived greenhouse gas (GHG) (nitrous oxide and methane) fluxes under organic and non-organic management from farming system comparisons was conducted and followed by a meta-analysis. Up to date only 19 studies based on field measurements could be retrieved. Based on 12 studies that cover annual measurements, it appeared with a high significance that area-scaled nitrous oxide emissions from organically managed soils are 492 +/- 160 kg CO2 eq. ha(-1) a(-1) lower than from non-organically managed soils. For arable soils the difference amounts to 497 +/- 162 kg CO2 eq. ha(-1) a(-1). However, yield-scaled nitrous oxide emissions are higher by 41 +/- 34 kg CO2 eq. t(-1) DM under organic management (arable and use). To equalize this mean difference in yield-scaled nitrous oxide emissions between both farming systems, the yield gap has to be less than 17%. Emissions from conventionally managed soils seemed to be influenced mainly by total N inputs, whereas for organically managed soils other variables such as soil characteristics seemed to be more important. This can be explained by the higher bioavailability of the synthetic N fertilisers in non-organic farming systems while the necessary mineralisation of the N sources under organic management leads to lower and retarded availability. Furthermore, a higher methane uptake of 3.2 +/- 2.5 kg CO2 eq. ha(-1) a(-1) for arable soils under organic management can be observed. Only one comparative study on rice paddies has been published up to date. All 19 retrieved studies were conducted in the Northern hemisphere under temperate climate. Further GHG flux measurements in farming system comparisons are required to confirm the results and close the existing knowledge gaps. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Multicriteria analysis applied to the sustainable agriculture problem
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
AB The aim of this paper is to present an operational approach to compare the relative sustainability of existing farming systems. Sustainability rests on the assumption that an equilibrium must exist among three domains: social, economic and ecological. If we are to look for a solution to the problem, we must face a multi-dimensional approach. We propose that multicriteria analysis, a multi-dimensional method, is an appropriate methodology to study the issue. As sustainability cannot be measured directly, the nay out is to use indicators. We have performed a thorough analysis of four farming systems existing in Guaira, SP, Brazil to validate the methodology. Thirty indicators of sustainability (ten ecological, ten social, and ten economic) were defined and used to perform the analysis. The results of the multicriteria analysis proved useful because of its capability of reducing the dimensionality of the problem. From the three dimensions of sustainability, a final score was derived that can easily compare the relative sustainability of each farming system.

TI Impact of Covid-19 on farming systems in Europe through the lens of
   resilience thinking
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB Context: Resilience is the ability to deal with shocks and stresses, including the unknown and previously unimaginable, such as the Covid-19 crisis. Objective: This paper assesses (i) how different farming systems were exposed to the crisis, (ii) which resilience capacities were revealed and (iii) how resilience was enabled or constrained by the farming systems' social and institutional environment. Methods: The 11 farming systems included have been analysed since 2017. This allows a comparison of preCovid-19 findings and the Covid-19 crisis. Pre-Covid findings are from the SURE-Farm systematic sustainability and resilience assessment. For Covid-19 a special data collection was carried out during the early stage of lockdowns. Results and conclusions: Our case studies found limited impact of Covid-19 on the production and delivery of food and other agricultural products. This was due to either little exposure or the agile activation of robustness capacities of the farming systems in combination with an enabling institutional environment. Revealed capacities were mainly based on already existing connectedness among farmers and more broadly in value chains. Across cases, the experience of the crisis triggered reflexivity about the operation of the farming systems. Recurring topics were the need for shorter chains, more fairness towards farmers, and less dependence on migrant workers. However, actors in the farming systems and the enabling environment generally focused on the immediate issues and gave little real consideration to long-term implications and challenges. Hence, adaptive or transformative capacities were much less on display than coping capacities. The comparison with pre-Covid findings mostly showed similarities. If challenges, such as shortage of labour, already loomed before, they persisted during the crisis. Furthermore, the eminent role of resilience attributes was confirmed. In cases with high connectedness and diversity we found that these system characteristics contributed significantly to dealing with the crisis. Also the focus on coping capacities was already visible before the crisis. We are not sure yet whether the focus on shortterm robustness just reflects the higher visibility and urgency of shocks compared to slow processes that undermine or threaten important system functions, or whether they betray an imbalance in resilience capacities at the expense of adaptability and transformability. Significance: Our analysis indicates that if transformations are required, e.g. to respond to concerns about transnational value chains and future pandemics from zoonosis, the transformative capacity of many farming systems needs to be actively enhanced through an enabling environment.

TI Participatory assessment of sustainability and resilience of three
   specialized farming systems
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB There is a need for participatory methods that simultaneously assess agricultural sustainability and resilience at farming system level, as resilience is needed to deal with shocks and stresses on the pathways to more sustainable systems. We present the Framework of Participatory Impact Assessment for Sustainable and Resilient FARMing systems (FoPIA-SURE-Farm). FoPIA-SURE-Farm investigates farming system functioning, dynamics of main indicators, and specifies resilience for different resilience capacities, i.e., robustness, adaptability, and transformability. Three case studies with specialized farming systems serve as an example for the used methodology: starch potato production in Veenkolonien, The Netherlands; dairy production in Flanders, Belgium; and hazelnut production in Lazio, Italy. In all three farming systems, functions that related to food production, economic viability, and maintaining natural resources were perceived as most important. Perceived overall performance of system functions suggest moderate sustainability of the studied farming systems. In the studied systems, robustness was perceived to be stronger than adaptability and transformability. This indicates that finding pathways to higher sustainability, which requires adaptability and transformability, will be a challenging process. General characteristics of farming systems that supposedly convey general resilience, the so-called resilience attributes, were indeed perceived to contribute positively to resilience. Profitability, having production coupled with local and natural resources, heterogeneity of farm types, social self-organization, and infrastructure for innovation were assessed as being important resilience attributes. The relative importance of some resilience attributes in the studied systems differed from case to case, e.g., heterogeneity of farm types. This indicates that the local context in general, and stakeholder perspectives in particular, are important when evaluating general resilience and policy options based on resilience attributes. Overall, FoPIA-SURE-Farm results seem a good starting point for raising awareness, further assessments, and eventually for developing a shared vision and action plan for improving sustainability and resilience of farming systems.

TI Influence of different farming systems on the stability of low

SO ZEMDIRBYSTE-AGRICULTURE
AB Complex investigations designed to explore the impact of extensive, organic-sustainable and conventional-chemical farming systems on changes of soil chemical, physical and microbiological properties of sandy loam Haplic Luvisol (LVh) were performed at the Voice Branch of the Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry during 2003-2012. The studies were carried out employing different crop rotations, where the plant sequence was laid out in four treatments so that the plant residues in the soil would accumulate more organic matter and nitrogen. Research evidence showed that different farming systems and plant sequences in rotations did not affect soil acidity, but significantly increased the contents of total nitrogen and organic carbon and reduced the contents of available phosphorus and potassium. Soil physical properties changed accordingly. Higher moisture levels were determined in soil under extensive and conventional-chemical farming systems. At the lower soil layers the impact of green manure on the reduction of soil bulk density and increase of total and air-filled porosity was evident. Extensive and conventional-chemical farming systems favoured the distribution of fungi in the soil. With the application of organic farming system, the balance between the number of ammonifying and mineral nitrogen assimilating bacteria was maintained.

SO SCIENTIFIC DATA
AB With the Convention on Biological Diversity conference (COP15), United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), and United Nations Food Systems Summit, 2021 is a pivotal year for transitioning towards sustainable food systems. Diversified farming systems are key to more sustainable food production. Here we present a global dataset documenting outcomes of diversified farming practices for biodiversity and yields compiled following best standards for systematic review of primary studies and specifically designed for use in meta-analysis. The dataset includes 4076 comparisons of biodiversity outcomes and 1214 of yield in diversified farming systems compared to one of two reference systems. It contains evidence from 48 countries of effects on species from 33 taxonomic orders (spanning insects, plants, birds, mammals, eukaryotes, annelids, fungi, and bacteria) of diversified farming systems producing annual or perennial crops across 12 commodity groups. The dataset presented provides a resource for researchers and practitioners to easily access information on where diversified farming systems effectively contribute to biodiversity and food production outcomes.

TI Climate change and farming systems in the region of Setif (Algeria)
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB In Setif region (Algeria), the constraints of the semi-arid climate already limit farm profitability. Throughout the years, local farmers have modified their farming systems to mitigate the negative effects of climate. This paper aimed to describe the trend of climate change and at what extent it could affect the farming systems. The climate evolution was analyzed through the annual rainfall time series (1970- 2011) of 50 observation stations spread over the study area. A study of modifications in farming activities engendered by climate change, such as a shifting to new farming systems, was carried out on a sample of 537 farms spread over in three agro-ecological regions: the northern, central and southern zones. The annual rainfall of the period 1970-2011 over the study area was 457mm, However the annual rainfall maps for the periods 1970-1990 and 1991-2011 showed a high spatiotemporal variability, where some areas tended to become more wet, in contrast others areas were affected by drought severity . The main changes in agricultural activities for adapting to climate constraint were a reduction of areas devoted to rainfed crops (cereals) and the adoption of an intensive farming system based on poultry, cattle breeding and intensive crops, especially in the central and the southern zones. Challenges of agricultural development programs in the context of future climate change will be to manage the conversion of the ancestral farming systems to sustainable systems, preserve the social value of agriculture and boost the economic profitability of farms without affecting natural resources.

TI The impact of conventional and organic farming on soil biodiversity
   conservation: a case study on termites in the long-term farming systems
   comparison trials in Kenya
SO BMC ECOLOGY
AB Background A long-term experiment at two trial sites in Kenya has been on-going since 2007 to assess the effect of organic and conventional farming systems on productivity, profitability and sustainability. During these trials the presence of significant numbers of termites (Isoptera) was observed. Termites are major soil macrofauna and within literature they are either depict as 'pests' or as important indicator for environmental sustainability. The extent by which termites may be managed to avoid crop damage, but improve sustainability of farming systems is worthwhile to understand. Therefore, a study on termites was added to the long-term experiments in Kenya. The objectives of the study were to quantify the effect of organic (Org) and conventional (Conv) farming systems at two input levels (low and high) on the abundance, incidence, diversity and foraging activities of termites. Results The results showed higher termite abundance, incidence, activity and diversity in Org-High compared to Conv-High, Conv-Low and Org-Low. However, the termite presence in each system was also dependent on soil depth, trial site and cropping season. During the experiment, nine different termite genera were identified, that belong to three subfamilies: (i) Macrotermitinae (genera: Allodontotermes, Ancistrotermes, Macrotermes, Microtermes, Odontotermes and Pseudocanthotermes), (ii) Termitinae (Amitermes and Cubitermes) and (iii) Nasutitiermitinae (Trinervitermes). Conclusions We hypothesize that the presence of termites within the different farming systems might be influenced by the types of input applied, the soil moisture content and the occurrence of natural enemies. Our findings further demonstrate that the organic high input system attracts termites, which are an important, and often beneficial, component of soil fauna. This further increases the potential of such systems in enhancing sustainable agricultural production in Kenya.

TI Land-use intensification and its sustainability: A full-sun cocoa
   farming system and tree plantations in southwestern Ghana
SO TROPICS
AB The sustainability of intensive land use that was recently introduced to southwestern Ghana is discussed, based on field observations and interviews within a forestry project. Cocoa, a major crop in Ghana, was traditionally cultivated under natural shade trees, forming a forest-like landscape. However, due to land shortage and the introduction of modern farming systems, these shade trees now tend to be removed from the cocoa farms, leaving a high-input full-sun farming system, which is less sustainable. Moreover, a recent trend toward tree plantations is growing especially in areas damaged by wildfires. While this will increase the timber resources and improve farmers, livelihoods in some cases, the negative impacts include a decrease in biodiversity and an increase in land conflicts. To secure the sustainability of land use, forest resources should be more integrated into farming systems. The government should strengthen the extension services and improve administrative regulations. At the field level, the planting of shade trees and small-scale plantations by farmers should be promoted, and the land tenure issues resulting from tree plantations should be monitored.

TI Social and economic challenges in the development of complex farming
   systems
SO AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB The fundamental challenge in developing a new farming system is to have it adopted and maintained by farmers. The difficulty of achieving widespread adoption is increased if the new farming system is complex and/or radically different to current farming practice. This paper is a review of these issues with a focus on farming systems based on mimicry of natural ecosystems. It is proposed that there are four conditions which are necessary for an individual farmer to adopt an innovative farming-system: awareness of the innovation, perception that it is feasible to trial the innovation, perception that the innovation is worth trialing, and perception that the innovation promotes the farmer's objectives. Challenges involved in meeting each of these conditions are discussed. It is concluded that the most important challenges in developed countries are: (a) developing a farming system that is in fact more profitable than current practice; (b) assessing whether a system is in fact more profitable than current practice; and (c) overcoming the problem of deep uncertainty about the technology. In developing countries one must add the additional challenges of (d) high interest rates/high discount rates; and (e) insecure or inequitable land tenure.

TI European Union farming systems: Insights for a more sustainable land use
SO LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB The diversity of agricultural systems in European Union (EU) regions and countries is vast and vulnerable to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reforms. The CAP instruments have suffered several significant changes over the last decades to take into account the new contexts from the various EU enlargements and problems caused by former measures. This dynamic evolution of the farming system calls for updated assessment to better understand the respective policy impacts and to support the design of new and adjusted instruments. In this context, with this research, the intention is to highlight the most recent characteristics of the EU farming system and to assess the respective impacts from CAP measures. To achieve these aims, we considered statistical information from the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) which was exploited through linear programming models. The main findings reveal that EU subsidies have no implication on the structure of EU farming systems. In other words, the most profitable farming systems are the same whether they were provided with the CAP financial support or not, namely those from the 1st Pillar. On the other hand, the CAP rules condition the farmers' options, sometimes towards adopting a more subsidised production, but with lower margins. These frameworks would not be problematic, if the farming systems were more socially and environmentally sustainable, but this is not always the case. In a future scenario of a farming sector which more regulated by the market and less so by the CAP instruments, the environmental impacts will be more short-term than medium- or long-term, where the main problem will be with energy consumption.

TI Breeds both locally adapted and locally adopted, a condition for the
   sustainability of livestock activities
SO CAHIERS AGRICULTURES
AB Using the diversity of animal genetic resources is considered as one possible way toward sustainability of livestock farming systems. Emphasis is generally put on local breeds regarding their adaptation to the conditions and farming systems in their territory of origin. In this paper, we show how using some breeds, local or not, may modify farming systems and, then, contribute to their sustainability. Two case studies were conducted on dairy farming systems in Western France, one dealing with two cattle breeds recently introduced in this region, namely the Montbeliarde and Simmental breeds, the other one dealing with the rare and local Bretonne Pie Noir breed. The results of these studies were interpreted within a conceptual framework inspired by the pragmatist theory of inquiry. We conclude that the concept of "locally adapted breed" has to be associated with the concept of "locally adopted breed".

TI Emerging Smallholder Rubber Farming Systems in India and Thailand: A
   Comparative Economic Analysis
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND DEVELOPMENT
AB This paper provides a comparative perspective on the performance of smallholder rubber farm livelihood systems based on case studies of two regions in India and Thailand. The analysis of the emerging farming systems in the two countries' rubber farms reveals that the rubber monocrop system is viable, provided prices remain remunerative and primary markets efficient. Findings further indicate the dominant contribution of rubber production to the gross household income of the rubber growers in the integrated farming systems. Nevertheless, from a sustainable livelihoods perspective, the socioeconomic significance of the rubber integrated farming systems assumes greater prominence, given the fact that small producers are highly vulnerable to market uncertainties. It has been found that rubber integrated livelihood systems provide the smallholders with ample capability for resilience during crises and ensure a sustained flow of income. The two case studies demonstrate the need to promote and scale up rubber integrated farm livelihood systems in the smallholder-dominated rubber producing countries in the Asian region. The paper also recommends enhancing the capabilities of the smallholders by strengthening their access to the five forms of capital that sustain their livelihood.

TI Earthworm populations in two low-input cereal farming systems
SO APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB Earthworm populations in low-input integrated crop management (ICM: no application of insecticides, fungicides and growth regulators) and organic farming systems were compared. The study was performed as a 3-year field survey using a paired-farm approach in six different locations in northwestern Switzerland. Earthworms were extracted from soils sampled from 24 winter cereal fields using a combined method of extraction by mustard flour solution and handsorting.
   Earthworm communities differed between these farming systems. Over all sites, the mean biomass, abundance and species richness of earthworms found in the low-input ICM fields were significantly lower than in the organic fields. Adult earthworms in organic fields were 114% more abundant than in ICM fields, but the frequencies of most species within the respective systems were similar in both farming systems. The numbers of earthworm species and juveniles were higher in organic fields. Five species - Lumbricus terrestris (L.), Nicodrilus longus (Ude), Nicodrilus nocturnus (Evans), Nicodrilus caliginosus (Sav.) and Allolobo-phora rosea (Sav.) - were significantly more numerous in the organic fields than in the ICM fields.
   Multivariate analysis showed that the farming system explained most of the variance and was found to be the key factor in altering the earthworm fauna. Late ploughing in autumn was found to have a major negative effect on earthworm abundance, irrespective of the farming system. Farming practices that differ between these farming systems and may considerably influence earthworm populations and diversity are discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to create a representative and update farm typology for the suckler cow sector in the region of Central Macedonia, Northern Greece. The identification of the types was done both for the farming system and the farmer's profile, based on the data obtained from a Neyman stratified random sample of 66 farms. The stratification was made by size class at the level of Regional Unity. Primary data were collected through personal interviews with the cattle farmers by completing questionnaires concerning (a) social, environmental, zootechnical and economic parameters of suckler cow holdings and (b) attitudes, decisions and views of farm owners. The statistical approach of hierarchical cluster analysis was applied in two successive analyzes exploiting (a) 17 initial and composite variables that characterize farming system and (b) 9 initial variables of farmer profile classification. The purpose of cluster analysis was to characterize and classify the farms into different clusters of farming types and farmer types. Differences between clusters were assessed using one-way ANOVA and chi(2) test. In the first cluster analysis four principal farming systems and one diversified were highlighted. The second cluster analysis highlighted three main types of farmers and a diversified one. They were then associated with two-way Anova tests, farming systems with the main types of farmers. This resulted in 5 combinations with statistically significant correlations. Finally depends on gross profit, cost of feeding and subsidies, the combination of multifunctional young farmers that own mediumsized farms with the application of a semi-intensive farming system demonstrates the highest sustainability perspective.

TI The impact of intensive farming systems on groundwater availability in
   dryland environments: A watershed level study from Telangana, India
SO CURRENT RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB Intensification of agriculture in India has increased food self-sufficiency. However, it has also led to unwanted environmental impacts, particularly the increased pressure on groundwater resources. These impacts are most severe in the dryland regions of the country. Therefore, this paper aims to understand the impact of intensified forms of agriculture on the availability of water resources in a dryland watershed in Telangana, India. To achieve this, we first assessed the water use of three main farming systems in the study region. We then calculated the water balance at the watershed level to understand the agricultural impact on groundwater availability within the watershed. The three farming systems studied were the crop without livestock system (CWL; 48% of households), the crop-dairy system (CD; 38% of households), and the crop with small ruminants system (CSR; 6% of households). The results indicated that the CD system used the highest quantity of water (19,668 m3/ household/y), followed by the CSR (8645 m3/household/y) and CWL (4403 m3/household/y). CWL and CD systems comprise 86% of the households, making these systems the largest water users. Finally, the water bal-ance of the whole watershed showed a deficit of - 13.9 Mm3/y. Cultivation of water-demanding non-dryland crops, increased specialization of farming systems, and management practices in current farming systems are the factors causing over-utilization of water and subsequent groundwater depletion. We also realize that the current policy environment and other drivers such as decreasing landholdings and market forces, also induce increased water use in production. We, therefore, conclude that there is a need to promote agro-ecologically suitable farming strategies, improve the existing technological options and introduce new policies that reduce the over -use of water resources for sustainable agricultural production in dryland regions.

TI Comparison of vegetable production, resource-use efficiency and
   environmental performance of high-technology and conventional farming
   systems for urban agriculture in the tropical city of Singapore
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Urban farming can improve cities' food security and resilience, but the performance of different farming systems with respect to land and investment constraints has not been systematically investigated. Here, we compared conventional soil-based farming, vertical farming with natural lighting (Vnat), and indoor vertical farming. This study aimed to compare (1) the dynamic production of leafy vegetables over time given the same amount of investment and land constraints, (2) the associated water and energy use, and (3) the global warming potential (GWP) of the urban farming sector if each of the three farming systems was solely used in the tropical city-state of Singapore. A system dynamics (SD) model was constructed to map the potential quantity of leafy vegetables produced, together with the water and energy use of each farming system. The land and monetary investment constraints were set at an additional 0.3% of the total land area of Singapore and an annual investment of SGD 10-20 million (0.001-0.005% of Singapore's annual GDP). Vnat farming was predicted to have the highest production level (110,000 t) and self-sufficiency (76.9% of total demand) by 2050 based on the SD model. This would be 3 times the self-sufficiency level achieved by indoor and soil-based farming systems given the same investment and land constraints. Indoor farming was simulated to use <14% the land area of Vnat while soil-based farming exhausted the additional 0.3% of the land allocated. Indoor farming was also the most energy intensive system, requiring 100 times more than Vnat farming. Comparison of the GHG emission rates showed that indoor farming had the greatest GWP-at 2.51 kg CO(2)(-)eq per kg of lettuce produced. Our results suggest that Vnat farming may be the best form of urban farming system to provide large amounts of food in Singapore, considering the production level, the amount of resources used, and the environmental impacts.

TI Dynamics of Farming Systems under the Context of Coastal Zone
   Development: The Case of Xuan Thuy National Park, Vietnam
SO AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB The study was conducted in Xuan Thuy National Park to provide a comparative assessment of different farming systems under the context of the coastal zone development of Vietnam. Based on a sample of 234 farmers in this area, SCP (Structure-Conduct-Performance) analysis revealed three farming systems: integrated aquaculture-mangrove (IAM), intensive shrimp (ISH), and rice-based (RB) farming. The evaluation of farm performance among the systems indicated that ISH incurred the highest values of variable cost and sustainable family income. Meanwhile, IAM obtained the lowest production cost due to the availability of allocated natural resources. The imbalance of applying synthesized fertilizers and an overdependence on nitro-based fertilizers were reported in the case of RB systems. In comparison with the other coastal areas of Vietnam, these farming systems achieved a lower level of production efficiency. It is urgent for policy makers to take action to promote sustainable farming practices in accordance with the stringent enforcement of environmental standards to reduce potential impacts and strengthen the coexistence of systems. Additionally, the purpose of securing rural livelihood under coastal development is aligned with the recommended solutions for economic improvement in this study.

SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB The Sustainable Agriculture Farming System (SAFS) Project was begun in 1988 to compare conventional 4-year and 2-year rotations receiving synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to low input and organic farming systems. In 1998 and 1999, we evaluated the influence of 10 years of organic, low input, and conventional management practices on soil chemical properties, processing tomato yields, and fruit mineral composition. The organic system had highest soil total C, N, soluble P, exchangeable Ca, and K levels as a result of 10 years of manure application and cover crop use. In both years, fruit yields were similar in the three farming systems. Organic fruits contained highest amounts of P, and Ca. Conventionally-grown tomatoes were richer in N, and Na, while the low input system had an intermediate values for N, P, and Na, and the lowest Ca concentration of the three systems.

TI Evaluation of farming systems according to valuation indices developed

   systems
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
AB The aim of this fanning systems' project was to design, layout, evaluate, improve and disseminate results from two approaches to sustainable farming systems, namely those of "ecological" and "integrated" farming. As a reference, a conventional system was used as well. The farming systems were set up and studied at a farm-size scale; the total area for the experiment covered 60 ha of arable land, each field being between 2.5 and 4.0 ha. Our main emphasis was on development of farming systems; the design did not give priority to direct comparisons between different systems. For the evaluation of farming systems, multi-objective and dynamic parameters, such as a Soil Cover Index (SCI), Nitrogen Available Reserves (NAR), a Pesticide Index (PI), Energy Efficiency (EE), Phosphorus Available Reserves (PAR) and Net Surplus (NS) were used. The evaluation of the different farming systems showed that the ecological system surpassed the desired level for Net Surplus by a wide margin and also just reached the desired level for the Soil Cover Index, but failed to reach the desired level for Energy Efficiency and Nitrogen Available Reserves. The integrated system reached desired levels for Nitrogen Available Reserves and Energy Efficiency in 3 out of 4 years, and on average it reached the desired level for the Soil Cover Index and Net Surplus for the 4 years. The integrated system did not on average reach the desired level for the Pesticide Index. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Push-pull farming systems
SO CURRENT OPINION IN BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Farming systems for pest control, based on the stimulo-deterrent diversionary strategy or push-pull system, have become an important target for sustainable intensification of food production. A prominent example is push-pull developed in sub-Saharan Africa using a combination of companion plants delivering semiochemicals, as plant secondary metabolites, for smallholder farming cereal production, initially against lepidopterous stem borers. Opportunities are being developed. for other regions and farming ecosystems. New semiochemical tools and delivery systems, including GM, are being incorporated to exploit further opportunities for mainstream arable farming systems. By delivering the push and pull effects as secondary metabolites, for example, (E)-4,8-dimethy1-1,3,7-nonatriene repelling pests and attracting beneficial insects, problems of high volatility and instability are overcome and compounds are. produced when and where required.

TI Nitrogen balances and nitrogen-use efficiency of different organic and
   conventional farming systems
SO NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS
AB Nitrogen (N) is the most important yield-limiting factor in agricultural systems, however, N application can lead to emissions and environmental problems such as global warming (N2O) and groundwater contamination (NO3 (-)). This study analyses the N balance, nitrogen-use efficiency, and N loss potential of conventional farming systems (arable farming, improved arable farming, and agroforestry) and organic farming systems (mixed farming, arable farming, and agroforestry) based on long-term field experiments in southern Germany. The effects of the conversion of farm structure and N management are identified. The conventional farming systems in this study were high N-input and high N-output systems. The conventional arable farming system had the lowest nitrogen-use efficiency and the highest N surplus. An optimised N management and the use of high-yielding crop varieties improved its nitrogen-use efficiency. The establishment of conventional agroforestry resulted in the reduction of N input, N output and N surplus, while maintaining high yields. The organic mixed farming system is characterised by a relatively high N input and N output, the accumulation of soil organic nitrogen, the highest nitrogen-use efficiency, and the lowest N surplus of all analysed systems. These good results can be attributed to the intensive farm N cycle between soil-plant-animal. The shift from organic mixed farming to organic arable farming system extensified the N cycle, reduced N input, crop yield and N output. The change from organic arable farming to organic agroforestry reduced the N input, increased the biomass yield, and remained the N surplus within an optimal range.

AB PURE (Pesticide Use-and-risk Reduction in European farming systems with Integrated Pest Management), a large collaborative project funded by the EU, has designed and tested IPM solutions both on station and on-farm. Ex-ante and ex-post assessment of such solutions - developed by combining tactical and strategic means of managing pests (animal pests, pathogens and weeds) - were performed for key European farming systems, spanning from annual arable to protected crops. Overall, the solutions showed good sustainability. PURE also developed models and methods to help predict pest damage or design pest management strategies. In addition, the project developed tactics to deal with pest evolution, agroecological engineering, and eventually bio- and technological products to be included into IPM toolbox in the near future. The societal dimension, the interdisciplinarity and a wide geographic coverage are key features of the project. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this work was to evaluate the free phenol content and antioxidant activity of winter wheat white flour, whole grain flour and bran in ecological and integrated farming system. The experiment was established on a scientific research base Dolna Malanta in western Slovakia during the years 2009 - 2011. Free phenol content was determined by Folin-Ciocalteu's method and antioxidant activity by DPPH radical scavenging method. Whole grain flour and bran had higher content of free phenols in ecological farming system. Antioxidant activity was not affected by farming systems. The content of free phenols and antioxidant activity was affected by growing year and forecrop. Fertilisation had no effect on the content of free phenols and antioxidant activity. White flour contain two times less free phenols and antioxidant activity than whole grain flour. The highest free phenol content and antioxidant activity was determined in wheat bran.

TI Sensory qualities of whole wheat pan bread - influence of farming
   system, milling and baking technique
SO JOURNAL OF CEREAL SCIENCE
AB Organic wheat production has increased in Sweden, and there is a need to describe the quality of the final product. To optimize utilization of alternatively grown wheat for human consumption, it is necessary to understand the effects of crop and processing variation on the sensory qualities of the final product. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of farming systems, milling technique, and variation in formulation on the sensory attributes of whole wheat pan bread. Six samples of wheat (Triticum aestivum, variety Kosack) from field trials, three grown in conventional farming systems and three in organic farming systems (biodynamic and ecological), were roller- and stone-milled, respectively. Breads were baked according to an experimental design in which two levels of flour and two levels of kneading were also included. Sensory analysis, achieved through a descriptive profiling test, was conducted with eight trained assessors using 19 sensory attributes for 48 different bread types in two replicates. Image analysis was used to establish the slice area of the breads. Milling technique had a greater impact on the sensory qualities of bread and on the slice area than did farming system and baking technique. Conventional wheat had lower protein and ash contents, but higher volume weight than did the organic wheat. Damaged starch, extensographic values (R-m, E) and farinographic values for water absorption, dough development time and dough stability were higher for roller-milled samples than for the stone-milled. Whole meal breads of roller-milled wheat were dominated by sweetness, juiciness and compactness attributes, whereas those from stone-milled wheat were characterized by saltiness, deformity and roasted cereal attributes. The six wheat samples revealed that variation in breads' sensory qualities was larger for the three organic samples than for the three conventional samples. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

CL Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS
AB Horticulture production in Senegal is an important agricultural activity that is mainly located in the Niayes zone. However, the increasing use of fertilizers and pesticides to boost production in order to meet a growing demand has many implications for the environment. The recognition of the negative impact this system of production has on the health of the soil and farmers, but also on the atmosphere with the emission of GHGs, has increased in recent years and some leading NGOs have started promoting organic farming systems. Therefore, the rising level of environmental hazards from conventional farming system made it attractive to farmers in the Niayes to adopt sustainable agriculture practices based on organic farming.
   A whole farm model is used to study the economic and environmental performances of the organic farming system compared to the conventional farming system in the horticulture production in the Niayes region in Senegal. The gross margin is regarded as the economic indicator, while carbon emissions are regarded as environmental indicators. The results indicate that the organic farming system will be economically more attractive to farmers in the Niayes compared with the conventional farming system only when a premium price is applied to organic crops. Simulation results also reveal that there exist a "win-win" situation for conventional farmers when they go for organic farming for certain types of crops. However, environmental results based on carbon emissions reduction show that organic system is found to be more effective in mitigating climate change.
   Our study suggests that, through appropriate investment in agro-ecological research to improve organic management and the establishment of a local organic market for organic crops, organic farming can be a very competitive alternative to conventional farming, when it comes to healthy food production with less environmental impact in the horticultural sector. However, further studies are needed on components of sustainable intensification to see which system of production is more profitable for farmers of the Niayes region, but also beneficial for the environment, and at regional and even national levels.

SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
AB Farming system approach is considered as most powerful tool for improving livelihood of small and marginal farmers. A study was undertaken during 2011-2015 to characterize the existing farming situation in New Tehri district of Uttarakhand with the objective of holistic improvement of livelihood, profit maximization and on-farm employment generation through integrated farming system (IFS) approach. Analysis of results revealed that crop + dairy was the predominant farming system (68%) followed by crop + dairy + horticulture + goatery. Introduction of improved cultivars of rice, maize, wheat and barley gave additional yield of 17 to 42 % over traditional cultivars. Similarly, introduction of improved cultivars and need based integrated pest management resulted in increased productivity of pre-dominant pulses like pigeonpea, blackgram, mungbean, kidneybean, horsegram, chickpea and lentil by 31% to 70%. Introduction of improved cultivars of soybean (Cv. PS 1092) and mustard (Cv. Pusa Bold) along with integrated plant nutrient management (IPNM) measures provided enhanced yield of 27% (soybean) and 46% (mustard) in Narendra Nagar, whereas yield enhancement of 15% (soybean) and 47% (mustard) was recorded in Thauldar Block. Interventions in horticulture component also resulted in yield improvement and enhanced productivity. The monthly vegetable availability increased from 110 to 154 kg house hold in the study area. The results of the study showed that annual requirement of proteins (110-125 kg) and carbohydrates (550 to 575 kg) for a five member can be easily met out through integrated farming system approach. This study envisaged that integrated farming system approach along with improved technological interventions may bring long-term farming system sustainability, improved livelihood and generate sufficient local employment which will restrict rural youth migration in hill areas of Uttarakhand.

TI Functions and performances of goat breeding systems in the tropical zone
SO INRA PRODUCTIONS ANIMALES
AB The increase of milk and meat goat populations follows the expansion of human populations in the tropical area. Thanks to their great adaptability, goats can be reared in a wide range of agro-environmental conditions and within traditional farming systems. Many scientific publications underline the potentialities of this model. In the present review paper, breeding techniques are proposed for a sustainable and low input development. The "buck effect" induces estrus and ovulation and increases global fertility in the flock. Since reproduction is a key point for driving the farming systems, this technique improves flock productivity. Feeding supplementation strategies with non conventional resources are proposed. A major threat to small ruminant production in the humid tropics, gastrointestinal parasitism, can be controlled with integrated techniques modifying the equilibrium between the host and parasite populations with moderate recourse to drenching. Finally, the authors emphasise the importance of the choice of genotypes adapted to farming systems and their major constraints.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION
AB The soil physical-chemical changes in different land uses in a Tropical Cambisol at Apodi Plateau, Northeastern Brazil, were investigated between May 2017 and April 2018. Soil samples were collected at three soil layers (0-5, 5-15, and 15-25 cm) under three land uses: a 6-year agroecological farming system, a 10-year fruticulture farming system, and a 6-year conventional farming system. We evaluated: bulk density, soil porosity, weighted average diameter (WAD), geometric mean diameter (GMD), soil pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), P, and sum of bases. Soil quality index was built by considering four main functions: Water supply and storage, root growth capacity, nutrient cycling, and soil conservation. Our results emphasized the land use influence on the soil physical-chemical traits in a Tropical Cambisol. The PCA analyses showed that SOC, soil porosity, bulk density, WAD, GMD, soil pH, sum of bases, and soil P content were the main factors contributing to the data variance. We found the highest values of soil quality index in the conventional farming system (0.57 & PLUSMN; 0.03). The results highlight the importance to consider land uses that increase the sum of bases, WAD, GMD, and SOC content, and decrease bulk density. Our findings suggest that (1) a conventional farming system with liming and fertilizers' input positively changed soil physical-chemical traits, which in turn improved soil quality in a tropical Cambisol; and (2) by altering soil functions land uses may create a sustainable cycle into the soil profile thus promoting soil quality.

AB The paper studied the systems of agriculture practiced in Romania. Currently in Romania there are farming systems very complex. The complexity of systems is determined by the natural and socio-economic conditions, the development level of the science and technology with the evolution of human society. The literature contains a large number of farming systems and their name is made by one of the specific measures (specific work) that these includes. The Systems Agriculture widely used and those dominated are: the conventional farming systems, biodynamic, biological and sustainable farming system, that has emerged in the last decade. The need to create sustainable agriculture, that is stable and sustainable and a clean environment has emerged due to the danger caused by the negative effects of chemicalization agriculture. The creating implications of a sustainable agriculture system will allow of the agricultural activities to maintain the natural environment clean and to protect the fragile areas.

TI Drivers of land use change and household determinants of sustainability
   in smallholder farming systems of Eastern Uganda
SO POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Smallholder farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa have undergone changes in land use, productivity and sustainability. Understanding of the drivers that have led to changes in land use in these systems and factors that influence the systems' sustainability is useful to guide appropriate targeting of intervention strategies for improvement. We studied low input Teso farming systems in eastern Uganda from 1960 to 2001 in a place-based analysis combined with a comparative analysis of similar low input systems in southern Mali. This study showed that policy-institutional factors next to population growth have driven land use changes in the Teso systems, and that nutrient balances of farm households are useful indicators to identify their sustainability. During the period of analysis, the fraction of land under cultivation increased from 46 to 78%, and communal grazing lands nearly completely disappeared. Cropping diversified over time; cassava overtook cotton and millet in importance, and rice emerged as an alternative cash crop. Impacts of political instability, such as the collapse of cotton marketing and land management institutions, of communal labour arrangements and aggravation of cattle rustling were linked to the changes. Crop productivity in the farming systems is poor and nutrient balances differed between farm types. Balances of N, P and K were all positive for larger farms (LF) that had more cattle and derived a larger proportion of their income from off-farm activities, whereas on the medium farms (MF), small farms with cattle (SF1) and without cattle (SF2) balances were mostly negative. Sustainability of the farming system is driven by livestock, crop production, labour and access to off-farm income. Building private public partnerships around market-oriented crops can be an entry point for encouraging investment in use of external nutrient inputs to boost productivity in such African farming systems. However, intervention strategies should recognise the diversity and heterogeneity between farms to ensure efficient use of these external inputs.

TI A new method for analyzing agricultural land-use efficiency, and its
   application in organic and conventional farming systems in southern
   Germany
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
AB Improving the land-use efficiency (LUE) of farming systems could satisfy increasing global food, feed, biomass and bioenergy demand in a sustainable manner. This study presents a new method for calculating LUE, beginning with an overview of different approaches to assessing agricultural LUE. This new method takes into account the quality and function of agricultural products and the relationship between the yield of the assessed farm and the average yield of the reference region with comparable soils, climate and socio-economic conditions.
   The new approach was tested using data from long-term experiments at the Scheyern Research Farm in southern Germany, which include different farming systems (organic mixed farming, arable farming, and agroforestry; conventional arable farming and agroforestry). In our case studies, the WE of conventional systems (arable farming: 1.00; improved arable farming: 1.06; agroforestry: 0.98) was higher than those of the organic systems (mixed farming: 0.69; arable farming: 0.33; agroforestry: 0.43) due to different crop rotations, dry matter yields, and biomass usage (harvest ratio). The conversion of high-input arable farming systems (conventional farming) to agroforestry systems is an extensification with negative effects on the dry matter yield and land-use efficiency. Nevertheless, the conversion to agroforestry systems can increase dry matter yield and land-use efficiency in low-input arable farming systems (organic farming). LUE should be used in combination with agri-environmental indicators, in order to ensure both efficient and sustainable land use. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Bee farming system sustainability: An assessment framework in
   metropolitan France
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB Beekeeping is a long-standing production of livestock, which currently faces several technical and economic challenges such as high colony losses and highly variable honey yields. While the sustainability of current and future bee farms is at stake, the current research on agricultural sustainability assessment poorly considers the technical and management specificities of bee farming systems, systems that remain poorly understood. To fill this gap, we designed a sustainability assessment framework, in other words, a detailed and organised definition of the sustainability of bee farming systems, that identifies the current sustainability issues of these systems at the farm level. Through interviews and workshops, beekeepers and other stakeholders were involved in the design process to include a diversity of viewpoints on the definition of sustainability for bee farming systems, and to ensure the relevance of this assessment framework. The resulting framework highlights the current economic, social and environmental issues of bee farming systems and is organised into six dimensions. Three dimensions are farm-focused, and the three others consider the interactions of the farm with its environment, its territory and the beekeeping sector. That framework reveals the sustainability issues and factors that bee farming systems share with other agricultural sectors as well as their specific issues. In particular, the adaptive capacity of bee farming systems, including their flexibility, their diversity and the learning capacity of the beekeeper, appeared to be a key factor in their sustainability, as is the case for other pastoral systems that have to cope with unpredictable changes in the availability of their feed resources on which they have little direct control. In addition, land management practices partly determine the quality and availability of floral resources, which are hard to estimate, and thus present specific concerns and opportunities in their management. This work provides the first sustainability assessment framework that properly considers the current issues and specificities of bee farming systems, thus providing an outlook on the sustainability challenges of these systems and a basis for the development of an on-farm sustainability assessment tool.

TI Multiple Water Use Protocols in Integrated Farming System for Enhancing
   Productivity
SO WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
AB Agriculture is the largest consumer of water in world. Due to demand of water for industrial and drinking purposes, the share of available water resources in agriculture sector is reducing substantially in near future. However, the food, fodder, fuel, and fibre production for satisfying the demands of enhanced population requires more water. In this scenario, increasing water productivity through diversified farming system has been identified as one of the viable options. Diversified farming, otherwise also called integrated farming system (IFS), represents integration of various enterprises such as cropping systems, horticulture, animal husbandry, fishery, agro-forestry, apiary etc. for optimal utilization of farm resources besides water. Integrated farming, a judicious mix of cropping systems suited to given agro-climatic conditions and socio-economic status of the farmers, shall be able to generate additional employment and income for the small and marginal farmers under both rain-fed and irrigated environment. Although, IFS was mainly initiated in Asian agriculture, it is being introduced in almost all the countries of world. Such a system results in more rationale use of water with judicious distribution among different users. In this paper, different aspects of multiple uses of water for higher productivity and future strategies for enhancing water productivity are discussed.

TI SUSTAINABLE FARM INCOME OF DIFFERENT FARMING SYSTEMS IN WESTERN
   MAHARASHTRA
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND DEVELOPMENT
AB The per farm income pattern indicated that, the total income in Farming system(FS)-II was double than the FS-I, while total income of FS-III was four fold than that of FS-I. The total income from FS-I (crop production activity) was very less as compared to FS-II and FS-III. The itemwise income indicated that, the more than 50 per cent income was derived from crop production in FS-I and FS-II, while in FS-III, more than 50 per cent income was derived from horticulture and in the farming system-I, 31.52 per cent income was derived from other than farm business activity but in FS-II and FS-III, correspondingly, just 3.09 and 1.79 per cent income was derived from other than farm business activity. This has indicated that FS-I, depends more on other than farm business activity as compared to FS-II and FS-III. In expenditure pattern, out of the total expenditure more than 70 percent was the farm expenditure in all the farming systems. The expenditure on crop production was the major expenditure in FS-I and FS-II, while expenditure on horticulture was major expenditure in FS-III. The regionwise total expenditure was higher in irrigated region than the rainfed region.

TI Trade-offs in the performance of alternative farming systems
SO AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB Numerous alternative farming systems are proposed as solutions to the sustainability challenges of today's conventional farming systems. In this paper, we review the production, environmental, and socioeconomic performance of three widely discussed and promoted alternative farming systems-organic, smallholder, and urban agriculture. We show that both organic and smallholder agricultures have some benefits, but also entail important trade-offs; organic has environmental benefits, and also livelihood, health, and nutritional benefits for producers and consumers, but is hampered by lower yields and higher prices. Smaller farms have higher yields and host higher biodiversity, but are hampered by lower incomes to farmers. Urban agriculture can take some pressure off rural landscapes, provide nutritional benefits to the urban poor, and engage urban dwellers in addressing food system challenges, but it simply cannot scale up to be a substantial solution in and of itself. We suggest that instead of focusing on alternative systems, we should identify pathways to sustainable farming for all systems, reforming conventional systems where they perform poorly, and transitioning to alternative systems in contexts where they perform best.

TI Soil Quality and Agricultural Sustainability of Dryland Tropical Farming
   Systems: A Case Study in Mbeere District, Eastern Kenya
SO JOURNAL OF CROP IMPROVEMENT
AB A study was carried out to investigate soil quality of dryland farming systems of Mbeere District, Eastern Kenya and its implications on agricultural sustainability. Soil sampling was done in years 2002 and 2004 from 30 study farms and same sampling sites and from paired adjacent land-use systems (bush fallow and cultivated fields). Physical, chemical and biological laboratory analyses were carried out. Factor analysis showed that the main soil quality indicators for evaluating sustainability of the dryland farming systems of the district were texture; organic matter, exchangeable bases (Ca, Mg, K, and Na); extractable nutrients (P and Zn); and acidity (pH). Cultivated soils were characterised by low pH, nutrient deficiencies (N, P, Cu, and Zn) and low organic matter and a decline in organic C, total N, exchangeable K and extractable P across time. They were also lower in exchangeable bases and microbial biomass C than adjacent bush fallow soils. We conclude that the soils are degraded and farming systems are partially unsustainable and may increasingly be so in the near future if declining soil quality is not addressed.

TI Socioeconomic Impacts of Conservation Agriculture based Sustainable
   Intensification (CASI) with Particular Reference to South Asia
SO NO-TILL FARMING SYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE: Challenges and
   Opportunities
AB Compared to the past successes of global food supply, reduced natural and social capitals, Food-Energy-Water insecurities, climate change and volatile international commodity markets threaten future food production. Among the options for sustainable agriculture, various No-till (NT) practices have been adapted to different farming systems around the world. One particular adaptation, Conservation Agriculture based Sustainable Intensification (CASI) that combines the strengths of conservation agriculture and sustainable intensification, has succeeded in a number of farming systems including parts of South Asia. Farmer-participatory on-farm research results in the irrigated Rice-Wheat Farming System of Bangladesh, eastern India and Nepal showed that CASI strengthened the Food-Energy-Water nexus through increased food crop productivity, and energy and water use efficiencies. Furthermore, CASI reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved natural resources. Notable socioeconomic impacts of CASI were improved household food security and income, reduced production costs, better returns to labor, benefits to women, expanded social capital and strengthened system resilience. These socioeconomic benefits are important drivers of smallholder adoption of CASI and underpin the prospects for widespread scaling. These impacts from South Asia are an example of the potential for CASI adaptation for other -irrigated and dryland farming systems elsewhere in South Asia, as well as in East Asia, the Middle East and Africa.

AB Agriculture faces many social, economic, and environmental challenges. They are manifested by the degradation of natural resources, the clearing of rangelands, and the increase of poverty. In fact, climate change is projected to increase temperatures and extreme weather events and reduce precipitation and weather predictability. While there will be variations based on local specificity, this will result in a general reduction of both crops and livestock production and productivity throughout the farming systems, particularly in Tunisia's and and semi-arid regions. These systems are vulnerable, and their sustainability is threatened. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze farming systems' performance and sustainability. This paper aims to assess farming systems sustainability in the region of Siliana-Tunisia. The IDEA method (Indicators of Agricultural Sustainability) combined with field investigations allowed to assess 60 farming systems' sustainability levels. Results showed that the economic scale recorded the best performances. However, the agroecological and socio-territorial scales are the weak points.

AB An increasing studies related with the detrimental effects of agrochemicals suggested the advantage of biofertilizers and biopesticides uses to support the sustainable farming system. This study aimed to evaluate the response of shallot 'Lembah Palu' with the application of arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) and Beauveria bassiana (Bb) under organic farming system. A split-plot experiment was designed to combine Bb at two intervals (every 5 and 10 days) and AM with three rates (0; 5; and 10 g per plant). Leafminer population and infestation, root colonization, root biomass, and shallot yield were observed. Application of the AM and Bb affected shallot production and leafminer infestation, independently. Mycorrhizae application increased the root biomass and yield of shallot but gave negligible effects on population and leafminer attack. The shallot production with no mycorrhizae was significantly lower compared to both mycorrhizae application rates of 5 g and 10 g. The application of B. bassiana every 5 days was more effective in suppressing the population and infestation of leafminers compared to that every 10 day-treatment. The study points out the positive contribution of the mycorrhizae and B. bassiana in the shallot cultivation and supports the implementation of the organic farming system.

TI Effects of Farming Systems on Insect Communities in the Paddy Fields of
   a Simplified Landscape During a Pest-control Intervention
SO ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES
AB Agricultural intensification is one of the major threats to global biodiversity and ecosystem services. Sustainable management of agricultural lands can reduce these impacts, but few efforts have been made in the context of paddy rice fields, especially in simplified landscapes composed of large monocultures separated by fragments of natural lands, such as in Taiwan or elsewhere in Asia. In this study, during a pest control intervention, we examined the effects of management practices on insect communities under conventional and organic farming systems in the paddy fields of northern Taiwan in 2016. Our results showed that organic practices did not increase the species richness or abundance of the four insect groups (total, predators/parasitoids, pests, and other insects). In addition, the composition of the insect communities did not differ between organic and conventional farming systems. Both the abundance and richness of predator/parasitoid insects were similar between conventional and organic farming systems. The pest abundance in the organic systems could be suppressed by other unmeasured predators and integrated management practices, which showed similar levels to the conventional systems with pesticide applications. The results of this study suggest that farming systems may not influence insect biodiversity in simplified landscapes during pest-control intervention.

TI Sustainability assessment of autumn and spring potato production systems
   using extended exergy analysis (EEA)
SO ENERGY ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT
AB The unreasonable use of inputs, including chemical fertilizers and pesticides, has put agricultural production at risk of unsustainability in many areas. Extended exergy analysis (EEA) is an innovative method for assessing the ecological sustainability of agricultural ecosystems. EEA allows for a comprehensive assessment of the material and immaterial flows in the system and, as a result, a more accurate assessment of sustainability. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of the sustainability of autumn and spring potato systems was performed based on the EEA approach in Golestan Province in Iran during the crop year of 2017-2018. for this purpose, 120 and 60 farms were taken into account for the autumn and spring farming systems, respectively. The extended exergy (EE) values of autumn and spring potato crops in Golestan Province were 2.30E + 05 and 1.68E + 05 MJ ha(-1), respectively. The highest shares of EE in both autumn (57.00%) and spring (48.64%) crops were related to cumulative exergy consumption (CExC). The excessive consumption of inputs in the autumn system led to enhanced CExC. The exergy of environmental remediation cost (EEE) for the spring farming system (7.84E + 04 MJ ha(-1)) was lower than that of the autumn farming system (9.20E + 04 MJ ha(-1)), which was mainly due to the high consumption of inputs like diesel fuel in the latter system. Accordingly, the ecological sustainability of the spring farming system was greater than that of the autumn farming system. The values of capital conversion factor (K-cap) for material and energy inputs to the autumn and spring farming systems were 0.011 and 0.014 US$ MJ(-1), respectively, which indicated that potato production in Golestan Province was more costly in the spring farming system. The values of the specific capital conversion factor of product sales (K-cap(EE)) for the autumn and spring potato systems were 0.006 and 0.005 US$ MJ(-1), respectively. Therefore, the economic efficiency of the autumn farming system was higher than that of the spring farming system. Also, the Extended Exergy Efficiency Indices (I](EE)) for the autumn and spring potato production systems were 45 and 37%, respectively, which represented the higher thermodynamic efficiency of the autumn farming system. The cumulative degrees of perfection for the autumn and spring potato systems were 0.78 and 0.77, respectively, which demonstrated the more optimal use of energy and materials in the autumn compared to the spring farming system. Based on the results obtained in this research, it is recommended to improve management models including selections of appropriate types and amounts of input consumptions corresponding to the systems so as to reduce costs and ameliorate thermodynamic-economic indices.

AB Asia the birth place of aquaculture, supplies 85% of global aquaculture production and has had a long tradition in the development and use of different dietary feeding strategies, ranging from the use of fertilizers and simple supplementary feed mixtures to the manufacture of 'water-stable' pelleted shrimp feeds. The present paper reviews the different aquaculture feeding strategies used within semi-intensive and intensive farming systems in selected Asian countries, and in particular examines their relative impacts upon the aquatic environment. Emphasis is placed on the environmental compatibility and central role played by small scale polyculture-based integrated farming systems in Asian aquaculture, and the need to carefully balance exogenous supplementary feed inputs with the endogenous supply of natural food organisms within semi-intensive pond farming systems. In the case of intensive pond/cage-based farming systems attention is focused on the need to further improve feed formulation, feed manufacture, and on-farm feed and water management so as to maximize feed intake and feed efficiency, and minimize feed wastage and water pollution. Furthermore, in view of the negative experiences of some countries in the region with deteriorating water quality and disease outbreaks within intensive pond/cage-based farming systems, there is an urgent need to improve farm husbandry methods and reduce the current reliance of the aquaculture sector on chemotherapeutants; including limiting the use of the antibiotics only to qualified personnel by developing appropriate Codes of Practice. In this respect there is also a need to recognize the important role played by nutrition in disease resistance. In addition, the paper reviews the legislative controls concerning aquafeed manufacture in selected Asian countries, and highlights the implications of applying government feed legislative controls (i.e. relating to feed composition, feed manufacture, feed efficiency or water pollution) directly from one environmental setting or country to another, and urges countries to develop their own solutions depending upon the farming system employed (i.e. intensive or semi-intensive; tank, cage or pond; coldwater or warmwater, freshwater or seawater), national government policies and priorities, and the resources available to them. In conclusion the paper stresses the key role which can be played by the resident aquafeed manufacturing sector in helping farmers, not only in the provision of feed inputs, but more importantly concerning the management of the feed on the farm and in the use of appropriate environmentally sound husbandry practices; feed manufacturers usually having the closest contact with farmers and in many countries being the only link in the chain between the farmer and the government legislature.

SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
AB Farming system integrates livestock farming and agriculture. It has revolutionized conventional farming of livestock, the practice of cultivating the land and raising stock and the aquaculture, horticulture, agro-industry and allied production activities. It is playing a pivotal role in maintaining the sustainability and increases the productivity as well as provides employment for better livelihood. The present survey was carried out in Chandel, Churachandpur and Ukhrul hill districts of Manipur during 2012-13. A total of 70 farmers/district, with a cluster of thirty five farmers for improved integrated farming systems (IIFS) and thirty five for conventional farming system (CFS) were surveyed for this study. The average holding of each farmer was 0.64 ha in Chandel, 0.65 ha in Churachandpur and 0.87 ha in Ukhrul. Seven components, i e paddy, vegetables, fruits, piggery, backyard poultry, fishery and water management were studied. Among hill districts, Ukhrul had higher production of all enterprises. The results revealed that the performance of all components is better in IIFS than CFS. The average productivity of different enterprises was significantly higher in IIFS as compared to the CFS. The IIFS also gave higher net returns and benefit cost ratio to the farmers as compared to traditional farming. In farming system most of the activities were done by women, therefore they were employed more than men. The overall result revealed that the improved practice with different crop and animal components is an excellent approach for sustainable production, income generation and employment opportunity of the small and marginal rural households of Manipur.

TI Fuzzy Logic Based Simulation Approach for the Evaluation of Intelligent
   Farming Systems
SO JOURNAL OF MULTIPLE-VALUED LOGIC AND SOFT COMPUTING
AB Farming has been one of the most important issues for humans due to its contribution to the development of civilization. Farming is vital and most of the historical revolutions were triggered directly or indirectly by farming business among countries. Besides, all of the modern and technological innovations were directly adapted to the farming systems. Solar energy cannot be solely enough for farming all kinds of agricultural products during the whole year. Additionally, usage of only light, heat and other artificial equipment during the whole year to instead of sun is not economically feasible. In today's world, in order to feed the continually increasing world population effectively and efficiently and also to provide sustainable farming, the integration of advanced technologies into farming systems, which can be called intelligent farming, is of high importance for both researchers and the industry. In this study, a fuzzy logic based intelligent farming system is proposed, then, analyzed and evaluated by using fuzzy sets theory and simulation technique. Fuzzy logic is used to control the heating and lighting of the intelligent farming system, and simulation is used for evaluating the system. The results of the application indicate that the proposed approach is quite successful in increasing the efficiency with a 30% to 50% cost reduction.

TI ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS, FARMING SYSTEM AND CULTURAL LANDSCAPE IN THE
   ATLANTIC FOREST IN THE BRAZILIAN SOUTHEAST
SO ATELIE GEOGRAFICO
AB The relationship between environment, farming system and cultural landscape is examined using the concept of environmental ethics from Radical Ecology and the model of sustainable development from Political Ecology, with the objective of evaluating how the combination of these two theoretical perspectives offers a more complex explanation of technical change, natural resource appropriation and social transformation than those present in Economic Structuralism, Marxism and Darwinism or in Spiritual Ecology approaches. Different environmental ethics and models of worldview disenchantment present in the literature are reviewed and then evaluated in the case study on environment perception in the Fluminense Mountains. First, the environmental impact of new farming systems in the study area is presented, followed by changing value judgments of urban and rural areas as expressed in spatial perception. Then, the influence of different farming systems and religious worldviews on landscape domestication and on the perception of biodiversity is evaluated. Finally, environmental ethics are related to farming practices and shown to represent the basis of participatory rural extension and research. Throughout the article deterministic views of a linear relationship between technical change, deforestation and worldview are eschewed in favor of a synthesis of Radical and Political Ecology, which better captures the environmental and cultural complexity present in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.

AB Field trials were carried out in 1998 and 1999 at the Sustainable Agriculture Farming System Project (SAFS) located on the Agronomy Farm at the University of California, Davis to evaluate the effects of different farming systems on mineral composition and quality parameters of processing tomato fruits. The farming systems included 4-year rotations (processing tomato-safflower-corn-bean/wheat) under conventional, low-input, and organic management systems. The experimental design was a randomized complete block, split plot with four replicates. The three farming systems were main plots, and the crops in rotation were subplots. Total carbon, total nitrogen, soluble phosphorus, exchangeable potassium, calcium, and sodium, were highest in the organic system, Conventional 4-year rotations showed highest electrical conductivity and lowest values for most soil chemical parameters, while the low-input system had intermediate values. Nitrogen and sodium in the conventionally produced fruits were higher than the other systems, while phosphorus had the opposite effect. In 1998, fruit soluble solids, titrable acidity, and color score were highest in the conventional system and lowest in the organic system, while the low-input system showed intermediate values. In contrast, in 1999, no significant differences in fruit quality were found among the farming systems. The differences in environmental conditions and farming practices between the two years may explain the different quality responses. Several correlations were found among fruit quality parameters and soil chemical properties.

TI A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE - KELLOGG,WK
   INTEGRATED FARMING SYSTEMS INITIATIVE
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE
AB Creating sustainable options for farming systems in the USA requires addressing both technological and nontechnological barriers. It is necessary to continue research, development, and validation of technologies that enhance agricultural productivity, environmental stewardship, and the quality of rural life. Changes in agricultural practices, however, will come about only when economic, policy, informational, and attitudinal barriers to adoption of these technologies are reduced. The W.K. Kellogg Foundation (WKKF), through its Integrated Farming Systems (IFS) Initiative, is supporting a cluster of community-based IFS projects. The goals of these projects are: (i) for farmers to adopt more integrated and resource-efficient farming systems that maintain productivity and profitability while protecting the environment and the personal health of farmers and their families, and (ii) to assist farmers and others in rural communities in addressing the barriers associated with adopting more resource-efficient and integrated systems. Each IFS project represents a collaboration among individuals and organizations within a community that share concern for the health of their farming systems in the short- and long-term. All WKKF-funded IFS projects are tied together through leadership development, information networking, and the addressing of public policy options necessary to foster sustainable systems. It is the hope of WKKF that it can assist those with an interest in and commitment to fostering more sustainable agriculture in overcoming the existing barriers and creating an agricultural system that can truly sustain many future generations.

TI Improved fallows: a case study of an adaptive response in Amazonian
   swidden farming systems
SO AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB Many smallholders in the Amazon employ swidden (slash-and-burn) farming systems in which forest or forest fallows are the primary source of natural soil enrichment. With decreasing opportunities to claim natural forests for agriculture and shrinking landholdings, rotational agriculture on smaller holdings allows insufficient time for fallow to regenerate naturally into secondary forest. This case study examines how Peruvian farmers use "improved fallows" as an adaptive response to a situation of decreasing soil fertility and how the farmers describe the rationale underlying the various actions taken in these modified fallow systems. The results indicate that farmers establish improved fallows using contextual ecological knowledge and various techniques to introduce a large diversity of tree species. This practice is also used to restore degraded land to agricultural production. The tasks of maintaining productivity on agricultural land and reforesting degraded areas is becoming increasingly urgent in the Amazon, making agricultural practices that involve reforestation and tree management highly relevant. Since swidden farming systems are the basis for the livelihoods of most Amazon smallholders, good farming practices elaborated by swidden farmers are important for sustainable small-scale family farming systems in the Amazon.

TI The "barn": a conceptual framework for understanding the services
   provided by livestock in a territory
SO INRA PRODUCTIONS ANIMALES
AB Livestock and livestock products are often examined by discipline (environment, economy) or by organizational level (farm, sector, territory, country), making it difficult to simultaneously assess the diversity of services and impacts generated by livestock farming systems. Based on the scientific literature, we consider livestock farming systems at the interaction between the ecological, technical and social systems. Doing this, we can identify factors (biotic interactions, system management, collective organization) at the origin of their impacts and services. We then propose a simplified representation, the "barn", which visualizes how livestock systems (described by land use, animal density.) interact with their environment along five interfaces (inputs, environment and climate, markets, labor and employment, social and cultural factors). Two key characteristics of livestock farming systems, their integration into food systems (globalized vs. territorialized) and the extent to which they rely on exogenous vs. endogenous inputs, allow proposing a grid to analyze sustainability pathways for each type of territory; we use this grid to position the case studies analyzed in this special issue.

AB A method is presented for the optimization of arable farming systems that integrate economic and ecological goals.  Production systems ranging from low-input to high-input are generated with a computer model by systematic variation of major crop management components.  Economic and ecological goals are defined in terms of inputs and outputs of the production systems.  Each goal is first optimized separately without restrictions on the other goals.  Subsequently each goal is optimized while stepwise increasing restrictions are imposed on the other goals.  From this procedure, the exchange value of ecological goals in terms of economic goals is provided.  The method can be used to analyse effects of different economic and political environments on goal integration.  The farming systems selected with the model serve as a guideline for the introduction of sustainable arable farming systems in practice.

TI Sustainable development of agricultural systems: competing objectives
   and critical limits
SO FUTURES
AB The sustainability of agricultural systems has become a major focus for debates about future human survival. Much of the argument appears to rely on simplistic interpretation of ecological models, and fails adequately to define what sustainability objectives are being sought. We explore the implications of two alternative approaches to agricultural sustainability: the Critical Limits view which would require future farming systems to accept the ecosystem-imposed limits on the number of people in the world and the lifestyle they can enjoy; and the Competing Objectives view would balance agricultural sustainability with economic viability, reduction of environmental harm and fulfilling public demands for food and landscape benefits. The development of farming systems of the future will depend on which of these views is adopted by planners and policy makers.
   This paper challenges some of the ecological assumptions underlying the Critical Limits approach and questions the conventional view that extensive farming systems are more sustainable agriculturally than intensive systems. We may be able to deal more effectively with the environmental side effects of intensive farming systems by treating them as unwanted externalities and taking direct action to avoid or remove them rather than attempting to change fundamentally the nature of modern farming systems.
   To cope with the increasingly complexity and inter-connectedness of modem farming systems in the context of globalisation and potential perturbations like climate change, we need a pluralistic approach to policy, which can cope with the high levels of uncertainty in these areas and which allows maximum flexibility of response to changing circumstances.

TI Farming systems influence the compositional, structural, and functional
   characteristics of the sugarcane-associated microbiome
SO MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) has been produced worldwide as a relevant source of food and sustainable energy. However, the constant need to increase crop yield has led to excessive use of synthetic agrochemical inputs such as inorganic fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides in plant cultures. It is known that these conventional practices can lead to deleterious effects on health and the environment. Organic farming emerges as a sustainable alternative to conventional systems; however, farm management influences in plant-associated microbiomes remain unclear. Here, the aim is to identify the effects of farming systems on the sugarcane microbiota. To address this issue, we sampled the microbiota from soils and plants under organic and conventional farming from two crop fields in Brazil. Then, we evaluated their compositional, structural, and functional traits through amplification and sequencing of phylogenetic markers of bacteria (16S rRNA gene, V3-V4 region) and fungi (Internal Transcribed Spacer - ITS2). The data processing and analyses by the DADA2 pipeline revealed 12,839 bacterial and 3,222 fungal sequence variants. Moreover, differences between analogous niches were detected considering the contrasting farming systems, with samples from the conventional system showing a slightly greater richness and diversity of microorganisms. The composition is also different between the farming systems, with 389 and 401 differentially abundant taxa for bacteria and fungi, respectively, including taxa capable of promoting plant growth. The microbial co-occurrence networks showed structural changes in microbial communities, where organic networks were more cohesive since they had closer taxa and less modularity by niches. Finally, the functional prediction revealed enriched metabolic pathways, including the increased presence of antimicrobial resistance in the conventional farming system. Taken together, our findings reveal functional, structural, and compositional adaptations of the microbial communities associated with sugarcane plants in the field, according to farming management. With this, we point out the need to unravel the mechanisms driving these adaptations.

TI Determinants of phosphorus balance and use efficiency in diverse dairy
   farming systems
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB CONTEXT: Identifying the determinants of phosphorus (P) balance and use efficiency (PUE) is critical to improving the sustainability of dairy farming in countries operating diverse dairy farming systems because each system contributes to eutrophication through different pathways. However, information about P balance and PUE across diverse dairy farming systems is scarce.
   OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to use a novel approach to determine P balance and PUE, and identify their key determinants across diverse dairy farming systems in GB.
   METHODS: Data from 29 dairy farms representing systems with differing feeding approaches and production levels was collected from farm records or generated by quantifying P concentration in feed, manure, and soil samples. The methodology of the nutrient management tool 'Planning for Land Application of Nutrients for Efficiency and the environmenT (PLANET) and the principles of 'Annual Nutrient Cycling Assessment' (ANCA) were used to calculate farm-gate P balance (FPB) and soil-surface P balance (SPB), respectively. Differences in P balance and PUE between dairy farming systems were investigated using ANOVA. Determinants of P balance and PUE were identified using multiple stepwise linear regressions.
   RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrated a novel approach of calculating FPB and SPB that captures differences in the P concentration of manure and milk between systems.
   Phosphorus surplus was higher and PUE was lower in housed systems compared to pasture-based systems (except for a Spring-calving system grazing >= 274 days/year) primarily because of greater import of concentrate feed, highlighting the importance of reducing concentrate feed import into housed systems to minimise P import. Farms with greater inclusion rate of home-grown feed (primarily forages) in their herds' diet had higher PUE and lower P surplus. Thus, pasture-based systems could improve PUE by increasing the inclusion rate of home-grown feeds in the herd diet only if they maintain a stocking rate that matches the feed demand of the herd to the availability of home-grown feeds. In conclusion, the assessment of PUE and strategies to improve it should consider system classification beyond strict housed and pasture-based systems.
   SIGNIFICANCE: The current study demonstrated the foundations of an approach to calculate FPB and SPB that could be more robust compared to using standard P coefficients particularly in countries that operate diverse dairy farming systems. With further development, this approach could be adopted and could change the way GB dairy farmers and advisers calculate P balances in diverse systems.

TI Integrated farming system producing zero emissions and sustainable
   livelihood for small-scale cattle farms: Case study in the Mekong Delta,
   Vietnam
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB This study proposes an integrated cattle breeding and cultivation system that provides zero emission and sustainable livelihood for the community in rural areas. The proposed integrated farming system improves agricultural productivity and environmental and sanitation conditions, minimizes the amount of waste, and increases the family income up to 41.55%. Several waste types can be recycled and transformed into valuable products, such as energy for cooking, organic fertilizer for crops, and cattle feed for breeding. Wastewater effluent from the biogas tank can be treated by biochar and results show that it then meets the standards for irrigation purposes. Also, the waste flow from cattle breeding supplies enough nutrients to cultivate plants, and the plants grown supply are adequate food for the 30 cows living on the farm. This research shows that the use of an integrated farming system could achieve zero-emission goal. Thereby, it provides a sustainable livelihood for cattle breeding family farms. The proposed integrated cattle breeding and cultivation system improves agricultural productivity, environmental and increases the farmer income up to 41.55%. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Arbuscular mycorrhizae in a long-term field trial comparing low-input
   (organic, biological) and high-input (conventional) farming systems in a
   crop rotation
SO BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS
AB Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) root colonization was studied in a long-term field trial in which four farming systems currently in use in Switzerland were continuously applied to a randomized set of plots at a single field site from 1978 till 1993. There were two low-input farming systems (organic and bio-dynamic) and two high-input (conventional) farming systems (according to Swiss guidelines of integrated plant production with and without farmyard manure). The systems had an identical 7-year crop rotation and tillage scheme and differed essentially only in the amount and type of fertilizer supplied and in plant protection management. The percentage of root colonization by AM fungi was determined in field samples 2-3 times over the growing season in crops in the rotation, namely in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Sardona), vetch-rye and grass-clover. We found the percentage of root length colonized by AM fungi to be 30-60% higher (P less than or equal to 0.05) in the plants grown in soils from the low-input farming systems than in those grown in conventionally farmed soils. Approximately 50% of the variation of AM root colonization was explained by chemical properties of the soils (pH, soluble P and K, exchangeable Mg), the effect of soluble soil P being most pronounced. The potential of the field soils from the differently managed plots to cause symbiosis with AM fungi was tested in a glasshouse experiment, using wheat as a host plant. Soils from the low-input farming systems had a greatly enhanced capacity to initiate AM symbiosis. The relative differences in this capacity remained similar when propagules of the AM fungus Glomus mosseae were experimentally added to the soils, although overall root colonization by AM fungi was 2.8 times higher.

AB An integrated, semi-automated system is presented for the rapid and efficient testing and production of research-scale quantities of biochar. This biochar, produced from agricultural waste materials, can easily be incorporated in future sustainable livestock farming systems. These farming systems will be able to diversify farm income by generating a consistent, predictable, marketable product. Before biochar is incorporated into production systems, it needs to be assessed for its potential to improve soil or crop systems or produce energy. To assess the potential of biochar and proceed quickly from experimental design to experimental results, a variety of analytical instrumentation, control technologies, and processing technologies were brought together to decrease analysis time and double production of a wide variety of biochar types.

TI Evolution of farming systems and system philosophy
SO SYSTEMS RESEARCH AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
AB Farming systems (FSs), and ways of thinking about them, evolved in space and time. Rapid evolution took place in the last two decades when crop and livestock yields increased, together with concerns about their socio-economic and biophysical tradeoffs. The application of farming systems research (FSR) to agricultural development was a response to problems arising from a predominantly reductionist approach to research and a cornucopian view of external inputs. Modern technologies were either not welcome or caused unexpected negative trade-offs. This paper reviews definitions and forms of FSR and the need for evolution in thinking about agricultural development. Application of thermodynamic theory (TDT)I to the study of farming systems influences discussion between cornucopians and conservationists, and between reductionist and holistic approaches to research. There is a need to recognize context (suitability of technology), and to pay more attention to relations within systems (system dynamics) and to defining criteria for sustainability. The paper links biophysical and socio-economic processes, gives a physical background for the anthropomorphic concepts of waste, and reviews aspects of objectivism and constructivism. It is argued that FSR can only advance if the full portent of these issues is considered in thinking about development of FSs. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Intercropping in Rice Farming under the System of Rice
   Intensification-An Agroecological Strategy for Weed Control, Better
   Yield, Increased Returns, and Social-Ecological Sustainability
SO AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB Rice is the staple food for more than half of the world's population. In South Asia, rice farming systems provide food to the majority of the population, and agriculture is a primary source of livelihood. With the demand for nutritious food increasing, introducing innovative strategies in farming systems is imperative. In this regard, intensification of rice farming is intricately linked with the challenges of water scarcity, soil degradation, and the vagaries of climate change. Agroecological farming systems like the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) have been proposed as water-saving and sustainable ways of food production. This study examines the effect of intercropping beans with rice under SRI management on the growth of weeds and on the different plant growth parameters. Intercropping led to a 65% decrease in weed infestation on average, which is important given that weed infestation is stated as a criticism of SRI in some circles and is a major factor in limiting yield in rice-producing regions. In addition to the water savings of about 40% due to the SRI methodology, the innovation led to an increase in rice yield by 33% and an increase in the net income of farmers by 57% compared to the conventional rice farming method. The results indicate that intercropping can be a positive addition to the rice farming system, hence contributing to social-ecological sustainability.

TI Farmers' knowledge and perceptions in assessing tropical dryland
   agricultural sustainability: Experiences from Mbeere District, Eastern
   Kenya
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
AB Sustainability is socially constructed, and striving for a sustainable agricultural system requires addressing ecological, social and economic dimensions simultaneously. The objective of this study was to assess the sustainability of dryland farming systems of Eastern Kenya based on farmers' perceptions of their farming environment and the implications for rural livelihoods. Farmers' perceptions were elicited through semi-structured interviews in which questionnaires were administered, on single visits, to 30 selected farm households. The study showed that soil fertility and yields of staple food crops (maize) have declined in the past decade and that current farming systems are not able to produce adequate food and income to the dependent households. Thus, the farming system is showing symptoms of unsustainability. Improving farming system sustainability in this dryland area will ultimately require integration of technical and policy options that take cognisance of farmers' abilities, opportunities and socio-economic circumstances.

TI Development and application of a multi-attribute sustainability function
   for Dutch dairy farming systems
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB Sustainability in dairy farming is determined by using aspects (economic, social and ecological). Per aspect a number of measurable attributes is selected. Difficulty for determining the sustainability of farming systems is the combination of the different attribute measures into a sustainability function, which measures the overall sustainability. Furthermore, stakeholder groups often evaluate sustainability different and should be consulted to determine sustainability. In this research, the multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) is used to develop an overall sustainability function for Dutch dairy farming systems. This approach consists of four steps: (1) determination of attribute utility functions, (2) assessing attribute weights to determine utility functions per aspect, (3) assessing aspect weights to determine the overall sustainability function per stakeholder group and (4) determination of the overall sustainability function for society by aggregating preferences of stakeholders and experts using a goal programming approach. Depending on the possibility for objective evaluation of each aspect, either experts or stakeholders were consulted to determine attribute utility functions and the utility functions of the particular aspect. In this study, experts determined (attribute) utility functions for economic and ecological sustainability. Stakeholders (producers, consumers, industrial producers and policy makers) determined their own utility function for external social sustainability and their own aspect weights. The developed overall sustainability function is applied to different Dutch dairy fanning systems represented by four experimental farms. MAUT proves to be a suitable method to determine an overall sustainability function. Sustainability rankings for the dairy farming systems appear to be relatively insensitive to changes in attribute and aspect weights. Based on these results, it is concluded that the developed sustainability function based on stakeholder and expert perceptions can be used with reasonable confidence to determine the sustainability of different dairy farming systems.

TI Spatial modeling of soil erosion hazards and crop diversity change with
   rainfall variation in the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The spatial variation of soil erosion is essential for farming system management and resilience development, specifically in the high climate hazard vulnerable tropical countries like Sri Lanka. This study aimed to investigate climate and human-induced soil erosion through spatial modeling. Remote sensing was used for spatial modeling to detect soil erosion, crop diversity, and rainfall variation. The study employed a time-series analysis of several variables such as rainfall, land-use land-cover (LULC) and crop diversity to detect the spatial variability of soil erosion in farming systems. Rain-use efficiency (RUE) and residual trend analysis (RESTREND) combined with a regression approach were applied to partition the soil erosion due to human and climate-induced land degradation. Results showed that soil erosion has increased from 9.08 Mg/ha/yr to 11.08 Mg/ha/yr from 2000 to 2019 in the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka. The average annual rainfall has increased in the western part of the Central Highlands, and soil erosion hazards such as landslides incidence also increased during this period. However, crop diversity has been decreasing in farming systems, namely wet zone low country (WL1a) and wet zone mid-country (WM1a), in the western part of the Central Highlands. The RUE and RESTREND analyses reveal climate-induced soil erosion is responsible for land degradation in these farming systems and is a threat to sustainable food production in the farming systems of the Central Highlands.

TI Understanding the vulnerability, farming strategies and development
   pathways of smallholder farming systems in Telangana, India
SO CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT
AB Climate change projections for the 21st century indicate an increase in the already high number of food-insecure people in India. While considerable research on vulnerability to climate change exists, research about Indian smallholder farming systems as a whole, encompassing farming strategies and development pathways in this context, is limited. Hence, the current study examines the vulnerability of three smallholder farming systems, namely, (i) crop without livestock (CWL), (ii) crop with small ruminants (CSR), and (iii) crop with dairy (CD), in the context of climate change in Telangana, India. A mixed methods approach was used to conduct the research with a sample size of ten households per farming system. We found that households of different farming systems faced differential vulnerability due to variation in perceptions of climate change exposures, access to livelihood capitals, and the farming strategies they chose. The CWL households were highly vulnerable to increased maximum temperature and erratic rainfall, while households that farmed both crop and livestock were more vulnerable to overall reduction in precipitation. Decision-making related to farming strategies was a complex process involving several factors, of which the availability of livelihood capitals, provided by government programs, was the foremost. Due to this, households of the different farming systems pursued divergent farming strategies, leading to varying types of adaptation and climate change resilience. Among the three farming systems, the households in the CWL system had the least access to all livelihood capitals and showed the highest vulnerability as their farm strategies only helped to cope with immediate needs. The households in the CD system had access to all critical livelihood capitals, which facilitated opting for sustainable farming strategies. However, as these households were highly dependent on scarce ground water resources for production, their strategies helped only short-term adaption. The households in the CSR system, despite having access to limited capitals, adopted long-term adaptation strategies which is attributed to them being a pastoral ethnic group. Lastly, despite the existence of an integrated climate change policy, state-level development programs continue to focus more on agricultural intensification than on climate change adaptation. This stimulates farming strategies that are lucrative in the short term but endanger farming system resilience to climate change in the long term. We therefore recommend policy makers to give high priority to climate smart development in state development programs, and science-based evaluations of these programs to enable proper climate change adaptation in dryland regions that is inclusive of perspectives of different populations.

AB Rooted in thousand of years of traditional Chinese agricultural practices and techniques, the Integrated Farming System (IFS) is planned and widely practiced in different regions according to the principles of agronomy, ecology, economics and systems science. Its purpose is to establish agroecosystems with high efficiency and sustainability. Because the Chinese IFS makes it possible to meet the requirements of sustainable agriculture in China, it has been recognized by different levels of governments and by farmers. This paper present an overview of the IFS concept, principles, development, history and current status, classification, typical models, as well as trends for future development.

TI Assessing future sustainability and resilience of farming systems with a
   participatory method: A case study on extensive sheep farming in Huesca,
   Spain
SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB Finding pathways to more sustainability and resilience of farming systems requires the avoidance of exceeding critical thresholds and the timely identification of viable alternative system configurations. To serve this purpose, the objective of this paper is to present a participatory, integrated and indicator-based methodology that leads researchers and farming system actors in six steps to a multi-dimensional understanding of sustainability and resilience of farming systems in the future. The methodology includes an assessment of current performance (Step 1), identification of critical thresholds whose exceedance can lead to large and permanent system change (Step 2), impact assessment when critical thresholds are exceeded (Step 3), identification of desired alternative systems and their expected improved performance of sustainability and resilience (Step 4), identification of strategies to realize those alternative systems (Step 5), and an assessment on the compatibility of alternative systems with the developments of exogenous factors as projected in different future scenarios (Step 6). The method is applied in 11 EU farming systems, and the application to extensive sheep production in Huesca, Spain, is presented here, as its problematic situation provides insights for other farming systems. Participants in the participatory workshop indicated that their farming system is very close to a decline or even a collapse. Approaching and exceeding critical thresholds in the social, economic and environmental domain are currently causing a vicious circle that includes low economic returns, low attractiveness of the farming system and abandonment of pasture lands. More sustainable and resilient alternative systems to counteract the current negative system dynamics were proposed by participants: a semi-intensive system primarily aimed at improving production and a high-tech extensive system primarily aimed at providing public goods. Both alternatives place a strong emphasis on the role of technology, but differ in their approach towards grazing, which is reflected in the different strategies that are foreseen to realize those alternatives. Although the high-tech extensive system seems most compatible with a future in which sustainable food production is very important, the semi-intensive system seems a less risky bet as it has on average the best compatibility with multiple future scenarios. Overall, the methodology can be regarded as relatively quick, interactive and interdisciplinary, providing ample information on critical thresholds, current system dynamics and future possibilities. As such, the method enables stakeholders to think and talk about the future of their system, paving the way for improved sustainability and resilience.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the sustainability situation of agricultural activities based on the environmental indicators in Salihabad district of Hamadan province, Iran. In this area, many factors threaten the sustainability of agriculture. Some of these factors are: degradation of rangelands, increasing use of chemical inputs, soil erosion, lowering soil nutrients and quality, pollution of ground and surface water, and converting the arable land. The statistical population of the study included 27 villages, which 96 households were selected for study; using optimum allocation cluster sampling method. The data collection instrument was a questionnaire which it's validity confirmed by jury of experts and reliability determined by doing pre-test and calculation of Cronbach Alpha coefficient. The questionnaire was completed through interview with farmers in the field. Data analysis was accomplished using various statistical methods, including principle component analysis and cluster analysis. Findings indicate that considering the environmental indications of sustainability the farming systems in the area are at the "critical" stage; as 67.7 percent are "very unsustainable", 22.91 percent are "unsustainable", 7.29 percent are "relatively sustainable" and only 2.08 percent of farming systems were "sustainable", based on the environmental sustainability indicators which developed in this study. The findings of the research can contribute to policy formation for sustainable agricultural development programs in the area.

TI Assessing phosphorus management among organic farming systems: a farm
   input, output and budget analysis in southwestern France
SO NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS
AB Organic farming is gaining interest worldwide due to its low environmental impact. However, questions still remain about its long-term sustainability, particularly in terms of nutrient management. There is debate about the ability of organic farming systems to compensate for nutrient exports due to crop and animal production. Stockless systems are considered as the most critical and they are generally associated with negative farm-gate nutrient budgets. In this study, we examined the farm-gate nutrient budgets of 23 organic farms located in southwestern France, with special focus on stockless farming systems. Phosphorus (P) was taken as a case study due to the issue of its critical management in organic farming systems. The farms were characterised on the basis of interviews with farmers and the soil nutrient status was assessed through soil sampling. Results showed that none of the farms imported rock phosphate fertiliser. On the contrary, most farms imported organic fertiliser and/or compost and manure, the latter from neighbouring farms or urban areas. As a consequence, stockless farm P budgets were not necessarily negative and options existed from achieving better nutrient cycle closure. However, soil P test was low to moderate in many cases. These results suggested that P management in organic farming systems is not simply related to the mixed versus specialised characteristics of the farms and that nutrient cycling should be addressed and assessed at a larger, e. g., district, scale.

TI Enset farming system - a resilient, climate-robust production system in
   South and South-Western Ethiopia
SO COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
AB With the ever-increasing global problem of food insecurity, climate-robust and resilient indigenous farming systems are getting increased attention. The enset [Ensete ventricosum (Welw.) Cheesman] farming system is one of the most sustainable indigenous farming systems in Ethiopia. The present study uses observations and literature to review the ecosystem services of enset, the resilience of the farming system to global change, and the implications of replacing it with cereals and cash crops. From a sustainability point of view, enset is a multipurpose crop; and delivers provisioning services (food, feed, fuel, fiber, mat, wrapping, fencing, traditional medicine), cultural services (identity, homegarden ornament, and greenery), regulation services (carbon and nutrient sequestration, soil protection and control of local microclimate) and supporting services (soil formation and water cycle). It is a staple food for over 20 million people in the south and southwestern part of Ethiopia. The crop is resistant to drought, flood and frost, and can be harvested and stored for food over long periods of time. Unlike annual crops, enset requires less tillage and few off-farm inputs. In enset-coffee homegarden, the enset shade improves soil moisture availability and moderates the effect of climate change on coffee. The broad leaves of enset intercept heavy rain, reduce soil erosion and facilitate groundwater recharge. However, in most parts of Ethiopia, enset is hardly known as a food source or considered as a hardship crop. Finally, we suggest disease prevention, improvement of processing technology and farm income helps to avert the current trend of transitions from enset farming system to cash crops.

TI Farming systems methodology for efficient resource management at the
   farm level: a review from an Indian perspective
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
AB Farming systems research is a multi-disciplinary holistic approach to solve the problems of small farms. Small and marginal farmers are the core of the Indian rural economy Constituting 0.80 of the total farming community but possessing only 0.36 of the total operational land. The declining trend of per capita land availability poses a serious challenge to the sustainability and profitability of farming. Under such conditions, it is appropriate to integrate land-based enterprises such as dairy, fishery, poultry, duckery, apiary, field and horticultural cropping within the farm, with the objective of generating adequate income and employment for these small and marginal farmers Under a set of farm constraints and varying levels of resource availability and Opportunity. The integration of different farm enterprises can be achieved with the help of a linear programming model. For the current review, integrated farming systems models were developed, by Way Of illustration, for the marginal, small, medium and large farms of eastern India using linear programming. Risk analyses were carried out for different levels of income and enterprise combinations. The fishery enterprise was shown to be less risk-prone whereas the crop enterprise involved greater risk. In general, the degree of risk increased with the increasing level of income. With increase in farm income and risk level, the resource use efficiency increased. Medium and large farms proved to be more profitable than small and marginal farms with higher level of resource use efficiency and return per Indian rupee (Rs) invested. Among the different enterprises of integrated farming systems, a chain of interaction and resource flow was observed. In order to make fanning profitable and improve resource use efficiency at the farm level, the synergy among interacting components of farming systems should be exploited. In the process of technology generation, transfer and other developmental efforts at the farm level (contrary to the discipline and commodity-based approaches which have a tendency to be piecemeal and in isolation), it is desirable to place a whole-farm scenario before the farmers to enhance their farm income, thereby motivating them towards more efficient and sustainable fanning.

TI Long-term weed community dynamics in Swiss organic and integrated
   farming systems
SO WEED RESEARCH
AB In 1991, a farming-system comparison was established on Burgrain Farm (Alberswil) to investigate the longterm sustainability of farming systems in Switzerland. In this study, the impacts of the three farming systems [organic (ORG), and integrated (IF) with an extensive (IFext) and an intensive (IFint) variant] on weed dynamics and diversity in six fields planted with winter wheat, maize, summer/winter barley, potatoes/oilseed rape and temporary grassland are examined. Altogether, 51 plant species were recorded from 1999 to 2006 in the maize and winter wheat crop. Total weed ground cover prior to harvest was seven times higher for wheat and 15 times higher for maize in ORG than in IFint, but grain yields were not negatively affected. Weed diversity was higher for ORG than for IF. In the temporary grassland, Taraxacum officinale and Rumex obtusifolius increased with time and dominated the weed community in the maize which followed. Chenopodium and Polygonum species dominated in the wheat, especially in ORG. We conclude from this study that an optimal combination of direct and indirect means for controlling weeds would allow organic farming at this site, provided that problematic weeds (e.g. Elytrigia repens) can be kept at the low level observed at the end of 2006.

TI Efficiency of various farming systems on an infertile soil
SO ZEMDIRBYSTE-AGRICULTURE
AB Complex trials were carried out during 2003-2007 at the Voke Branch of the Lithuanian Institute of Agriculture and Institute of Botany. The experiments were designed to investigate the influence of organic, sustainable, and intensive-chemical farming systems on the changes in chemical properties of soil and crop productivity in the 4 crop rotations: 1) Lupinus angustifolius L., Secale cereale L., Solanum tuberosum L., Fagopyrum esculentum, Hordeum L.; 2) Lupinus angustifolius L. + Sinapis alba L., Solanum tuberosum L., Secale cereale L. + Trifolium pratense L., Fagopyrum esculentum, Hordeum L.; 3) Lupinus lutens L., Solanum tuberosum L., Secale cereale L. + Sinapis alba L., Fagopyrum esculentum, Hordeum L.; 4) Pisum arvense L., Secale cereale L., Lupinus luteus L., Fagopyrum esculentum, Hordeum L.
   Soil agrochemical parameters before the experiment were as follows: pH(KCl) - 5.6, P - 70-92 mg kg(-1), K - 142-165 mg kg(-1), organic carbon - 0.79-0.84%.
   The highest metabolizable energy yield (68.20-113.24 MJ kg(-1)) per crop rotation was identified in the sustainable and intensive farming systems after lupine and white pre-crops grown as green manure. The farming systems tested did not have any effect on soil acidity and total nitrogen and humus contents. The highest contents of micromycetes in the soil were established for organic and sustainable farming systems. The highest content of fungi (644.0 cfu x 10(3)) was recorded for the sustainable cropping system after lupine and white pre-crops grown as green manure in the autumn of 2003.

TI Organic agriculture in the twenty-first century
SO NATURE PLANTS
AB Organic agriculture has a history of being contentious and is considered by some as an inefficient approach to food production. Yet organic foods and beverages are a rapidly growing market segment in the global food industry. Here, we examine the performance of organic farming in light of four key sustainability metrics: productivity, environmental impact, economic viability and social wellbeing. Organic farming systems produce lower yields compared with conventional agriculture. However, they are more profitable and environmentally friendly, and deliver equally or more nutritious foods that contain less (or no) pesticide residues, compared with conventional farming. Moreover, initial evidence indicates that organic agricultural systems deliver greater ecosystem services and social benefits. Although organic agriculture has an untapped role to play when it comes to the establishment of sustainable farming systems, no single approach will safely feed the planet. Rather, a blend of organic and other innovative farming systems is needed. Significant barriers exist to adopting these systems, however, and a diversity of policy instruments will be required to facilitate their development and implementation.

TI Immediate impact of COVID-19 pandemic on farming systems in Central
   America and Mexico
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB CONTEXT: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all sectors and human activities around the World. OBJECTIVE: In this article we present a first attempt to understand the immediate impact of COVID-19 and the sanitary measures taken by governments on farming systems in Central America and Mexico (CAM). M ETHODS: Through a review of information generated in these initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic (webinars, blogs, electronic publications, media) and 44 interviews with key informants across the region, we have identified the main impacts felt by different types of farming systems in the region. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: From corporate agricultural production systems, to small and medium scale entrepreneurs and smallholder subsistence farm households, all types of farming systems were impacted, more or less severely, by the different measures implemented by governments such as reduced mobility, closure of public and private venues and restrictions in borders. Larger corporate farming systems with vertical market integration and high level of control or coordination within the supply chain, and smallholder or subsistence farming systems with important focus on production for self-consumption and little external input use, were both relatively less impacted and showed greater adaptive capacity than the medium and small entrepreneurial farming systems dependent on agriculture as their primary income and with less control over the upstream and downstream parts of their supply chain. All types of farming systems implemented a series of mechanisms to cope with the COVID- 19 pandemic including the development of alternative value chains, food and agricultural products delivery systems and the exponential use of digital means to communicate and maintain the viability of the different agricultural systems. Collective action and organization of farmers also proved to be an important coping mechanism that allowed some farmers to acquire inputs and deliver outputs in the context of restricted mobility, price volatility, and general uncertainty. Some features of the CAM region played an important role in mediating the impact of COVID-19 and associated sanitary measures. We identify as particularly relevant the nature of agricultural exports, the current structure of the agricultural sector, the diversified livelihood strategies of rural households, and the importance of mobility for rural livelihoods. SIGNIFICANCE: The results presented focus only in the immediate effect of COVID-19 pandemic and the mechanisms implemented by farmers in the first months. Whether these impacts and response mechanisms will result in a transformation of the farming systems towards greater resilience and sustainability is still an open question.

TI Farming system analysis of drylands agriculture in Lebanon: An analysis
   of sustainability
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB Agriculture in Lebanon is mainly rainfed and severely constrained by limited natural resources. Through centuries, local farmers have developed time-tested strategies to mitigate the impacts of drought and save natural resources. There are now indications that the once sustainable dryland farming systems are undergoing drastic changes. The study was undertaken to understand these recent drastic changes and their repercussions on the natural resource base in a Lebanese highland village in transition from a traditional agropastoral system to rainfed stone fruit production. Marginal lands are increasingly used in crop production and becoming less available to livestock grazing. As a result, traditional agropastoral systems are developing into more sedentary systems constrained by shrinking rangelands and limited feed availability.

The study of soil microbial hydrolytic activity (SMA) was carried out in a long-term crop rotation (barley undersown (us) with red clover, red clover, winter wheat, pea and potato) experiment in five different farming systems during 2014-2018. There were two conventional systems, with chemical plant protection and mineral fertilizers, and three organic systems, which included winter cover crops and composted manure. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the (i) cropping system and (ii) precrops in rotation on the soil SMA. The soil microbial hydrolytic activity was significantly affected by yearly weather conditions, farming system, and crops. In all farming systems, the SMA was the lowest after dry and cold conditions during early spring in 2018. In unfertilized conventional systems, the considerably lower SMA is explained by the side effects of pesticides and low organic residuals, and we can conclude that the conventional system with no added fertilizer or organic matter is not sustainable, considering soil health. In each year, the SMA of organic systems with cover crops and composted manure was 7.3-14.0% higher compared to all farming systems. On average, for both farming systems, the SMA of all the rotation crops was positively correlated with the SMA values of precrops. However, in conventional farming systems, the effect of undersowing on the SMA of the precrop was smaller compared to organic systems.

AB Farming systems research and extension (FSRE), as used by the global Association for Farming Systems Research-Extension, applies to a family of methodologies used to generate, evaluate and disseminate agricultural technologies in association with farmer participation. FSRE shares many attributes with Diagnosis and Design as practiced in agroforestry. The history of FSRE is traced from 1965 to the present, showing the formalization of the methodology and its critical use in sustainable agricultural technology development. In on-farm research, a primary basis for FSRE, research and extension merge in practice. The definition of recommendation domains (a fundamental concept of FSRE) is based on analysis and interpretation of multi-environmental research results as evaluated by varied criteria.
   In this paper, we present the results of three research projects to demonstrate the nature of farmer criteria for evaluation. Modified Stability Analysis (MSA) is used to demonstrate the relationship of on-farm research to specific extension messages. Design of on-farm research to make it amenable to analysis by MSA is discussed.

TI THE ROLE OF MODELING IN THE QUEST FOR SUSTAINABLE FARMING SYSTEMS
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB Sustainability in agriculture involves inter-temporal tradeoffs in the use of natural resources.  Analysis of sustainbility necessarily involves the study of the dynamics of change in the stock of natural resources.  To understand and analyse sustainability better it is important to be able to forecast the future consequences of current resource-use decisions.  As the time frame involved may be long, and complex interactions among various parts of the farming systems need to be well understood, modelling is a good tool for studying such phenomena.
   Following consideration of the role of various types of models of farming systems as substitutes for, or complementary to, real-world experimentation, it is contended that bio-economic simulation models are well-suited for studying sustainability.  A powerful tool to evaluate sustainability implications of alternative management practices is provided by the framework of optimal control theory.  Some illustrative applications of modelling are presented and possible problems in applying such models in the context of developing countries are presented.

TI Alternative Farming Systems for Diversification and Conservation of
   Agro-biodiversity
SO COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS OF THE TROPICS - ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT
AB Food insecurity and loss of biodiversity are the two major juxtaposed challenges facing the humanity. The situation is further aggravated by resource degradation mostly as a result of intensive agriculture and climate change impact particularly in the coastal areas of tropical countries. This calls for alternative approaches to conventional intensive farming that should enhance agricultural production and ecosystem services besides achieving agricultural diversification to instil stability and sustainability to the production system. In this chapter the status of coastal agriculture is reviewed vis-a-vis challenges and threat to agricultural production with the focus on the impact of modern agriculture on biodiversity, ecosystem, and the society. The importance of diversification to ensure regional food security and conservation of agro-biodiversity is discussed in details. This chapter also attempts to justify the need for alternative farming systems, its definition, major types, and the major alternative farming systems suitable for the tropical coastal region. At the end the impacts of these alternative farming systems were compared in terms of its suitability, promotion of diversity, input use, ecosystem services, resilience capacity, labour engagement, and use of traditional knowledge biodiversity conservation.

TI Examining multi-functionality for crop yield and ecosystem services in
   five systems of agroecological intensification
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB Agroecological intensification (AEI) integrates ecological principles and biodiversity management into farming systems with the aims of increasing farm productivity, reducing dependency on external inputs, and sustaining or enhancing ecosystem services. This review develops an analytic framework to characterize the fulfilment of these objectives by documenting the co-occurrence of positive, neutral, and negative outcomes for crop yield and nine regulating ecosystem services. We provide an illustrative examination of the framework, evaluating evidence for yield and ecosystem service outcomes across five AEI systems: conservation agriculture, holistic grazing management, organic agriculture, precision agriculture, and system of rice intensification (SRI). We reviewed 104 studies containing 245 individual comparisons between AEI and contrasting farming systems. In three of the five AEI systems, conservation agriculture, precision agriculture, and SRI, more than half of reviewed comparisons reported win-win' outcomes, enhancement of both yield and ecosystem services, or win-neutral' outcomes relative to contrasting farming systems. The review presents substantial evidence that the five AEI systems can contribute to multi-functional agriculture by increasing ecosystem service provision, or reducing negative externalities associated with agriculture, while maintaining or increasing yields. A framework such as the one presented here can help guide decision-makers considering how best to implement multi-functional agriculture so that both crop yield and ecosystem service delivery can be maintained or increased.

TI Improvement of mixed farming systems in Sudano-Sahelian Africa. Role of
   the species Stylosanthes hamata (L.) Taub. A review
SO BIOTECHNOLOGIE AGRONOMIE SOCIETE ET ENVIRONNEMENT
AB Introduction. In Sudano-Sahelian Africa, the traditional farming systems are no longer able to meet the food needs of the population. In order to sustainably improve the food security of small family farms, agro-ecological practices are increasingly being promoted by research and development organizations.
   Literature. Several studies have shown that agricultural productivity can be sustainably improved through a better integration of agriculture and livestock activities. One approach currently being considered is the integration into farming systems of Stylosanthes hamata (L.) Taub: a herbaceous annual to short-lived perennial. This plant has the proven potential to enhance the performance of cropping systems in many ways. It also allows for the critical production of a high quality fodder for animal feed, from the second year after planting onwards. However, phytosanitary, technical, environmental and / or socio-economic constraints would need to be lifted to allow a better integration of the crop into farming systems.
   Conclusions. Integration of S. hamata into the farming systems of the Sudano-Sahelian regions presents potential benefits that merit further investigation, in order to identify the appropriate modalities for this integration.

TI Environmental impacts of organic and conventional agricultural products
   - Are the differences captured by life cycle assessment?
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Comprehensive assessment tools are needed that reliably describe environmental impacts of different agricultural systems in order to develop sustainable high yielding agricultural production systems with minimal impacts on the environment. Today, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is increasingly used to assess and compare the environmental sustainability of agricultural products from conventional and organic agriculture. However, LCA studies comparing agricultural products from conventional and organic farming systems report a wide variation in the resource efficiency of products from these systems. The studies show that impacts per area farmed land are usually less in organic systems, but related to the quantity produced impacts are often higher. We reviewed 34 comparative LCA studies of organic and conventional agricultural products to analyze whether this result is solely due to the usually lower yields in organic systems or also due to inaccurate modeling within LCA. Comparative LCAs on agricultural products from organic and conventional farming systems often do not adequately differentiate the specific characteristics of the respective farming system in the goal and scope definition and in the inventory analysis. Further, often only a limited number of impact categories are assessed within the impact assessment not allowing for a comprehensive environmental assessment. The most critical points we identified relate to the nitrogen (N) fluxes influencing acidification, eutrophication, and global warming potential, and biodiversity. Usually, N-emissions in LCA inventories of agricultural products are based on model calculations. Modeled N-emissions often do not correspond with the actual amount of N left in the system that may result in potential emissions. Reasons for this may be that N-models are not well adapted to the mode of action of organic fertilizers and that N-emission models often are built on assumptions from conventional agriculture leading to even greater deviances for organic systems between the amount of N calculated by emission models and the actual amount of N available for emissions. Improvements are needed regarding a more precise differentiation between farming systems and regarding the development of N emission models that better represent actual N-fluxes within different systems. We recommend adjusting N- and C-emissions during farmyard manure management and farmyard manure fertilization in plant production to the feed ration provided in the animal production of the respective farming system leading to different N- and C-compositions within the excrement. In the future, more representative background data on organic farming systems (e.g. N content of farmyard manure) should be generated and compiled so as to be available for use within LCA inventories. Finally, we recommend conducting consequential LCA if possible when using LCA for policy-making or strategic environmental planning to account for different functions of the analyzed farming systems.

TI Indicators of agricultural intensity and intensification: a review of
   the literature
SO ITALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
AB Since the 1960s, research has dealt with agricultural intensification (AI) as a solution to ensure global food security. Recently, sustainable intensification (SI) has increasingly been used to describe those agricultural and farming systems that ensure adequate ecosystem service provision. Studies differ in terms of the application scales and methodologies, thus we aim to summarize the main findings from the literature on how AI and SI are assessed, from the farm to global levels. Our literature review is based on 7865 papers selected from the Web of Science database and analysed using CorText software. A further selection of 105 relevant papers was used for an in-depth full-text analysis on: i) farming systems studied; ii) related ecosystem services; iii) indicators of intensity; and iv) temporal and spatial scales of analysis. Through this two-step analysis we were able to highlight three main research gaps in the AI research indicators. Firstly, the farming systems analysed for assessing AI are often quite simplified or monoculture-oriented, and they do not take the diversity and complex organisation of farming systems into account. Secondly, these studies mainly focus on northern countries or developing countries, whereas there is a gap of knowledge in Mediterranean areas, which are the areas with a high complexity of farming systems and diversity in ecosystem services. Finally, AI is mostly assessed through nitrogen inputs and economic yield, which are used the most both at very local and global levels. Intermediate regional or local levels, which are relevant for policy implementation and local planning, are often neglected.

TI Assessing the Resilience and Sustainability of a Hazelnut Farming System
   in Central Italy with a Participatory Approach
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB European agriculture is facing increasing economic, environmental, institutional, and social challenges, from changes in demographic trends to the effects of climate change. In this context of high instability, the agricultural sector in Europe needs to improve its resilience and sustainability. Local assessments and strategies at the farming system level are needed, and this paper focuses on a hazelnut farming system in central Italy. For the assessment, a participatory approach was used, based on a stakeholder workshop. The results depicted a system with a strong economic and productive role, but which seems to overlook natural resources. This would suggest a relatively low environmental sustainability of the system, although the actual environmental impact of hazelnut farming is controversial. In terms of resilience, we assessed it by looking at the perceived level of three capacities: robustness, adaptability, and transformability. The results portrayed a highly robust system, but with relatively lower adaptability and transformability. Taking the farming system as the focal level was important to consider the role of different actors. While mechanisation has played a central role in enhancing past and present system resilience, future improvements can be achieved through collective strategies and system diversification, and by strengthening the local hazelnut value chain.

TI Reconciling technical, economic and environmental efficiency of farming
   systems in vulnerable areas
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB Integrated assessment tools are used ever more frequently for solving new environmental, social, and economic challenges related to agriculture sustainability. This is particularly relevant in ecologically vulnerable areas, where mitigation options include a complete redefinition of farming systems. This paper presents an assessment of mitigation options of a coastal agricultural watershed affected by algal proliferations (Lieue de Greve, western France).
   We developed a methodology based on two existing assessment approaches, an agrarian system diagnosis and an environmental assessment, to identify connections between farming systems and risky nitrogen-agricultural practices and to explore potential ways to reduce the environmental impact of farms while respecting their economic viability and technical feasibility. To understand the functioning of farming systems and calculate key indicators of economic performance, the agrarian system diagnosis combines landscape, historical, and techno-economic aspects of a farm. The environmental assessment includes (i) calculation of farm-gate nitrogen (N) budgets and N-use efficiency and (ii) use of a spatially explicit biophysical model, which simulates the effect of agricultural practices on water and N dynamics at the watershed scale and on N fluxes at the outlet.
   At the farm scale, the main outputs of the approach were (i) the identification of 11 farming-system types and factors influencing them in the past and present, (ii) the assessment of their techno-economic performances and (iii) for the main dairy systems, the assessment of their potential environmental impacts. Insights about the capacity of some systems to adapt to new constraints linked with environmental objectives were also brought out. Grass-based systems appeared to be the best alternative for existing farming systems since they display good economic results while limiting N emission risks.
   Scenarios of changes in agricultural practices at the watershed scale were tested with the biophysical model, comparing them to a reference scenario based on the continuation of current agricultural practices. The main results indicated that: (i) current water quality was in equilibrium with current agricultural practices, (ii) the response time of the watershed to changes in agricultural practices was relatively short (6-7 years) and (iii) the expansion of an agro-environmental incentive based on low-input practices and grass-based fodder proposed by local stakeholders to the whole watershed would result in a significant decrease in N fluxes but would not fulfill water-quality objectives. This integrated assessment approach demonstrated its ability to promote the emergence of mitigation solutions and to improve decision support. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI EUE (energy use efficiency) of cropping systems for a sustainable
   agriculture
SO ENERGY
AB Energy efficiency of agriculture needs improvement to reduce the dependency on non-renewable energy sources. We estimated the energy flows of a wheat-maize-soybean-maize rotation of three different cropping systems: (i) low-input integrated farming (LI), (ii) integrated farming following European Regulations (IFS), and (iii) conventional farming (CONV). Balancing N fertilization with actual crop requirements and adopting minimum tillage proved the most efficient techniques to reduce energy inputs, contributing 64.7% and 11.2% respectively to the total reduction. Large differences among crops in energy efficiency (maize: 2.2 MJ kg(-1) grain; wheat: 2.6 MJ kg(-1) grain; soybean: 4.1 MJ kg(-1) grain) suggest that crop rotation and crop management can be equally important in determining cropping system energy efficiency. Integrated farming techniques improved energy efficiency by reducing energy inputs without affecting energy outputs. Compared with CONV, energy use efficiency increased 31.4% and 32.7% in IFS and LI, respectively, while obtaining similar net energy values. Including SOM evolution in the energy analysis greatly enhanced the energy performance of IFS and, even more dramatically. LI compared to CONV. Improved energy efficiency suggests the adoption of alternative farming systems to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. However, a thorough evaluation should include net global warming potential assessment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Progress in climate change adaptation and mitigation actions in
   sub-Saharan Africa farming systems
SO CAHIERS AGRICULTURES
AB This paper reviews the progress in climate change adaptation and mitigation actions in sub-Saharan Africa farming systems. Farmers, organizations and Governments in the region have developed policies and innovations to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change. It appears that the developed and implemented innovative adaptive farming systems and technologies have culminated into resultant overall productivity improvement in farming systems, necessitating scaling up in order to widely strengthen the resilience and adaptive capacity of vulnerable communities to the impacts of climate change. Additionally, climate governance instruments that are aligned to the ratified international treaties have been developed and related programs have been rolled out in different countries. This offers hope for well-coordinated efforts and interventions for the mitigation and adaptation to the adverse impacts of climate change on the environment and livelihoods. Observably, there is a pressing need to scale up climate smart innovations sustainably through creation of an enabling policy environment, capacity building, and conducting climate change related research and outreach, and effective dissemination of climate technologies and information, especially in remote areas in the region. Since climate change is a global issue, local initiatives and actions for mitigating and adapting to the adverse impacts ought to be well integrated into the broader international context.

TI Traditional farming system for soil conservation on slope farmland in
   southwestern China
SO SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
AB Traditional and indigenous knowledge for sustainable land use and agro-ecosystem management has received increasing attention in recent years, especially in resource-poor, low-input and smallholder farming systems. The present paper introduces a traditional farming system, which is called "Biangoubeigou" and "Tiaoshamiantu" by local farmers in Sichuan hilly region, the upper Yangtze River basin of China. A field survey, interviews with farmers and local governors, and soil core sampling along a slope transect for Cs-137 assessment of net soil loss were carried out in Jiajia Village in the winter of 2002. Annual net soil loss in the area where traditional soil conservation approaches had been practised was estimated at 24.15 t ha(-1) yr(-1) using the Cs-137 technique. Compared with the highest on-site point soil loss of more than 105.80 t ha(-1) yr(-1) by the Cs-137 technique in this study and field erosion rate of 42.21 t ha(-1) yr(-1) from other plot monitoring studies in the similar area, this traditional farming system has effectively conserved soil on the slope land in the past decades.

TI WHICH OPTIONS FIT BEST? OPERATIONALIZING THE SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL NICHE
   CONCEPT
SO EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
AB The large diversity of farms and farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa calls for agricultural improvement options that are adapted to the context in which smallholder farmers operate. The socio-ecological niche concept incorporates the agro-ecological, socio-cultural, economic and institutional dimensions and the multiple levels of this context in order to identify which options fit best. In this paper, we illustrate how farming systems analysis, following the DEED cycle of Describe, Explain, Explore and Design, and embedding co-learning amongst researchers, farmers and other stakeholders, helps to operationalize the socio-ecological niche concept. Examples illustrate how farm typologies, detailed farm characterization and on-farm experimental work, in combination with modelling and participatory approaches inform the matching of options to the context at regional, village, farm and field level. Recommendation domains at these gradually finer levels form the basis for gradually more detailed baskets of options from which farmers and other stakeholders may choose, test and adjust to their specific needs. Tailored options identified through the DEED cycle proof to be more relevant, feasible and performant as compared to blanket recommendations in terms of both researcher and farmer-identified criteria. As part of DEED, on-farm experiments are particularly useful in revealing constraints and risks faced by farmers. We show that targeting options to the niches in which they perform best, helps to reduce this risk. Whereas the conclusions of our work about the potential for improving smallholders' livelihoods are often sobering, farming systems analysis allows substantiating the limitations of technological options, thus highlighting the need for enabling policies and institutions that may improve the larger-scale context and increase the uptake potential of options.

TI The relative importance of drought and other water-related constraints
   for major food crops in South Asian farming systems
SO FOOD SECURITY
AB Variation in water availability is a major source of risk for agricultural productivity and food security in South Asia. Three hundred and thirty expert informants were surveyed during 2008-09 to determine the relative importance of drought and water-related constraints compared with other constraints limiting the production of four major food crops (wheat, rice, sorghum, chickpea) in five broad-based South Asian farming systems. Respondents considered drought an important constraint to crop yield in those farming systems that are predominantly rainfed, but associated it with low yield losses (well below 10% of all reported losses) for crops in farming systems with well-developed irrigation. In these systems, other water-related constraints (including difficult access to sufficient irrigation water, the high cost of irrigation, poor water management, waterlogging and flooding of low-lying fields) were more important. While confirming the importance of drought and water constraints for major food crops and farming systems in South Asia, this study also indicated they may contribute to no more than 20-30% of current yield gaps. Other types of constraint, particularly soil infertility and the poor management of fertilizer and weeds for the cereals, and pests and diseases for chickpea, contributed most yield losses in the systems. Respondents proposed a wide range of interventions to address these constraints. Continued investments in crop-based genetic solutions to alleviate drought may be justified for food crops grown in those South Asian farming systems that are predominantly rainfed. However, to provide the substantial production, sustainability and food security benefits that the region will need in coming decades, the study proposed that these be complemented by other water interventions, and by improvements to soil fertility for the cereals and plant protection with chickpea.

AB The Center for Environmental Farming Systems (CEFS) is dedicated to farming systems that are environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable. Established in 1994 at the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (NCDACS) Cherry Farm near Goldsboro, N.C.; CEFS operations extend over a land area of about 800 ha (2000 acres) [400 ha (1000 acres) cleared]. This unique center is a partnership among North Carolina State University (NCSU), North Carolina Agriculture and Technical State University (NCATSU), NCDACS, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), other state and federal agencies, farmers and citizens. Long-term approaches that integrate the broad range of factors involved in agricultural systems are the focus of the Farming Systems Research Unit. The goal is to provide the empirical framework to address landscape-scale issues that impact long-run sustainability of North Carolina's agriculture. To this end, data collection and analyses include soil parameters (biological, chemical, physical), pests and predators (weeds, insects and disease), crop factors (growth, yield, and quality), economic factors, and energy issues. Five systems are being compared: a successional ecosystem, a plantation forestry-woodlot, an integrated crop-animal production system, an organic production system, and a cash-grain [best management practice (BMP)] cropping system. An interdisciplinary team of scientists from the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at NCSU and NCATSU, along with individuals from the NCDACS, NGO representatives, and farmers are collaborating in this endeavor. Experimental design and protocol are discussed, in addition to challenges and opportunities in designing and implementing long-term farming systems trials.

TI Ecological impact of wheat and spelt production under industrial and
   alternative farming systems
SO RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS
AB The Industrial Revolution and intensification of agriculture have, in some cases, led to economic activities that profoundly influenced the ecosystem to the point where environmental stability and geographic political security are jeopardized. The uncertainty about oil reserves, rising energy prices and the threat of harmful climate change effects has intensified the search for alternative farming systems that reduce negative environmental impact. This study reports the ecological impact of conventional (CON), integrated (INT), organic (ORG) and biodynamic (BD) farming systems calculated from data collected in a field trial at Maribor, Slovenia, and interpreted using the SPIonExcel tool. This tool is a member of the ecological footprint family and describes the area necessary to embed a human activity sustainably into the ecosphere. Three-year results show a markedly reduced ecological footprint of the ORG and BD systems in production of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. 'Antonius') and spelt (Triticum spelta L. 'Ebners rotkorn'), mainly due to the absence of external production factors. When yields were also considered, the ORG and BD systems again had a reduced overall footprint per product unit and increased ecological efficiency of production. Thus, ORG and BD farming systems present viable alternatives for reducing the impact of agriculture on environmental degradation and climate change. Nevertheless, room for improvement exists in the area of machinery use in all systems studied and yield improvement in the ORG farming system.

TI Multi-level socioecological drivers of agrarian change: Longitudinal
   evidence from mixed rice-livestock-aquaculture farming systems of
   Bangladesh
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB Coastal systems are facing natural and human-driven change coupled with a rising population. With increasing shifts in socioecological conditions during the past several decades, it is important to understand how socioecological drivers at different hierarchical levels: -micro, -meso, and -macro affect coastal farming systems, which play a crucial role in the livelihoods of coastal dwellers. Mixed rice-livestock-aquaculture farming in Southern Bangladesh exemplifies the rapid change occurring in many of the world's coastal farming systems in response to these drivers. We used panel data observations from the above study area and modeled trajectories of farm typologies, and the impact of multi-level socioecological drivers by a novel approach. Our approach integrates: (1) a well-articulated conceptual frame of change observed using (2) a temporal view of the potential drivers, change process and farm type outcomes, with the twenty years panel data of 502 households that is analyzed by means of (3) multivariate statistics in conjunction with panel data models that operationalize the conceptual frame. Our approach allows (a) estimating dynamic effects over time that typically cannot be estimated in a cross-sectional data set, (b) distinguishing between time-invariant fixed and time dependent random effects of multi-level socioecological drivers, and (c) controlling for omitted variables to a certain extent. Considering farming systems both within and outside of polder embankment systems intended to protect against oceanic water intrusion, we found a gradual shift from heterogeneous, rice-livestock farm types to more homogenous farms with less livestock and more off-farm activities. Micro-level factors including farm plot fragmentation, farmers' experience in cropping, machinery, salinity and soil fertility were influencing changes in farming systems. Meso-level factors including markets, road infrastructure, labor availability, access to extension and land tenure also affect the trajectory of farming systems change. Among macro-level drivers, increasing population density positively and significantly influenced cropping intensity among farms outside polder systems. Within polders, a positive but non-significant trend was observed for the influence of population density on cropping intensity. Our data also indicate negative and significant influence of cyclonic storms on cropping intensity over time in both areas. Our results underscore the importance of accounting for multiple levels of socioecological drivers of change when developing appropriate policy options for sustainable development in South Asia's coastal farming systems.

TI Spatial carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus budget in a village of the West
   African savanna - II. Element flows and functioning of a mixed-farming
   system
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB Management of organic resources plays a decisive role in the viability of mixed-farming systems in West African savannas. For this reason in this study carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) flows initiated by the different uses of organic resources were quantified in the different land-use systems of a village in southern Senegal. Livestock, crop harvest, and wood and straw collecting were responsible for, respectively, 59, 27 and 14% of the C outflows from the area exploited by the village. Livestock accounted for nearly 80% of C, N and P returns to the soil. As a result of these transfers and of on-site recycling of herbaceous biomass, high C inputs were brought to staple crops in the compound ring. Nitrogen and P depletion of the system amounted to -4 kg N and -1 kg P ha(-1) year(-1) only when other abiotic flows were included. This study also suggests that population growth is likely to rapidly alter the sustainability of this mixed-farming system at least due to a modification in the balance between the supply of and demand for organic resources.

TI Reconciling pastoral agriculture and nature conservation: developing a

SO PASTORALISM-RESEARCH POLICY AND PRACTICE
AB The article assesses the influence of the Common Agricultural Policy ( CAP) on the pastoral farming systems in a National Park within the south west of England and more recent attempts to use innovative and participatory techniques to reconcile pastoral farming systems with wildlife management. The paper confirms evidence that the economic sustainability of farm businesses in the UK involved in pastoral farming is reducing, and that wildlife-orientated schemes are changing traditional farming systems in a way that might not be in the long-term interest of wildlife. The data gathered raise questions about the cost-effectiveness of the current environmental approaches, which are government-run with centrally determined prescriptions relating to the natural resource and wildlife. Drawing on the concept of co-management, an alternative approach is identified and explored with both farmers and nature conservation regulators. This approach places more emphasis upon adjusting the traditional farming system of this marginal type of farming to align with the sustainable management of a fragile ecosystem.

TI A free online tool to calculate three nitrogen-related indicators for
   farming systems
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB Reactive nitrogen (N) is a key agricultural input, essential for crop growth and production, but excess N in the environment causes problems for human and ecological health. One of the most promising solutions for reducing environmental impacts of excess N levels and feeding a growing population is to improve N efficiency of farming systems i.e., increase the ratio of their N output to N input. Assessing promising solutions involves calculating N efficiency, which is not trivial. For this reason, a free online tool was developed - the SyNE calculator, https://www.nefficiencycalculator.fr/en/ - to allow farmers, farm advisors, researchers, and policy makers to calculate three N-related indicators of farming systems: SyNE, an N efficiency indicator; SyNB, an N balance indicator; and RNE, a relative N efficiency indicator. After entering information about a farming system, the SyNE calculator produces two main outputs: first, values of the three indicators (SyNE, SyNB, and RNE) and those of related variables (N inputs, N losses during production and transport of inputs, N outputs, and change in soil N); second, a downloadable diagram showing these values. The main advantages of this tool are that it (i) simplifies N indicator calculation, using the same scientific framework for all farming systems, and (ii) includes many reference values that are difficult to obtain (e.g., N losses during production and transport of inputs). Furthermore, this tool allows advanced users to modify the values and equations used to calculate the three N-related indicators. The SyNE calculator is currently available for farms producing dairy cattle, beef cattle, and field crops; in the near future, it will be available for farms producing pigs and broilers. If used, this online tool will contribute to the development of N efficiency evaluation by farmers, farm advisors, and researchers, which may result in improved agricultural N management practices.

On-farm experimental trials were conducted on the field of 25 smallholder farmers in three villages of central mid-hill region. Results indicated that although CA systems did not increase crop yields; higher return and revenue were generated due to increased number of crop harvests and higher price of the cash crops used in intercropping. Therefore, it was concluded that smallholder farmers should adopt CA system for increasing return and improving sustainability of the farming system. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI The potential role of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in the
   bioprotection of plants against soil-borne pathogens in organic and/or
   other sustainable farming systems
SO PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB Sustainable farming systems strive to minimise the use of synthetic pesticides and to optimise the use of alternative management strategies to control soil-borne pathogens. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are ubiquitous in nature and constitute an integral component of terrestrial ecosystems, forming symbiotic associations with plant root systems of over 80% of all terrestrial plant species, including many agronomically important species. AM fungi are particularly important in organic and/or sustainable farming systems that rely on biological processes rather than agrochemicals to control plant diseases. Of particular importance is the bioprotection conferred to plants against many soil-borne pathogens such as species of Aphanomyces, Cylindrocladium, Fusarium, Macrophomina, Phytophthora, Pythium, Rhizoctonia, Sclerotinium, Verticillium and Thielaviopsis and various nematodes by AM fungal colonisation of the plant root. However, the exact mechanisms by which AM fungal colonisation confers the protective effect are not completely understood, but a greater understanding of these beneficial interactions is necessary for the exploitation of AM fungi within organic and/or sustainable farming systems. In this review, we aim to discuss the potential mechanisms by which AM fungi may contribute to bioprotection against plant soil-borne pathogens. Bioprotection within AM fungal-colonised plants is the outcome of complex interactions between plants, pathogens and AM fungi. The use of molecular tools in the study of these multifaceted interactions may aid the optimisation of the bioprotective responses and their utility within sustainable farming systems.

SO OCL-OLEAGINEUX CORPS GRAS LIPIDES
AB To implement integrated farming systems, it is necessary to have tools to evaluate the achievement of their agronomical and environmental objectives. To do that, a set of eight agroecological indicators is proposed to assess the impact of agricultural techniques on the environment: cropping plan, soil covering, N-management, crop rotation. An example of the calculation of the indicators pesticides and cropping plan is given for a farming system with a rapeseed crop. Some examples of indicators use are given at field and farm levels. Some simulations of pesticide indicator values in various soil and weather conditions and with different pesticide recommendations give on evaluation of their impacts on the environment.

TI Soil organic carbon is affected by organic amendments, conservation
   tillage, and cover cropping in organic farming systems: A meta-analysis
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB Meta-analysis is often used to compare how soil health differs between organic and conventional farming systems. However, the burgeoning primary literature on organic farming now allows direct evaluation of the best management practices (BMPs) within organic farming systems on soil health improvements. Therefore, the main objective of this meta-analysis was to investigate the effect of BMPs, such as organic amendments, conservation tillage, and cover cropping, on soil health within organic farming systems. We focused on two principal soil health metrics: soil organic carbon (SOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) concentrations. On average, adoption of BMPs increased depth-weighted SOC and MBC concentrations by 18 and 30 %, respectively, relative to organically-managed control groups. Among BMPs, organic amendments and conservation tillage practices showed net positive effect on soil health with 24 and 14 % increase in depth-weighted SOC concentrations, respectively. Although cover cropping did not have an overall influence on SOC concentrations, we found a temporal trend such that cover cropping significantly increased SOC concentrations after 5 years of its adoption. This indicates that the soil health benefits from BMPs accrue over time and highlights the need of long-term adoptability of BMPs to achieve agricultural sustainability. Future primary articles that focus on under researched cropping practices in organic systems (e.g., crop rotation length and diversity, biochar addition) and the additive effects of multiple BMPs on soil health, will add to the synthesizable evidence base. Therefore, this meta-analysis confirms the soil health benefits of adopting BMPs within organic farming systems, identifies critical knowledge gaps, and provides directions for future organic farming research.

TI Impact of farming systems on soil ecological quality: a meta-analysis
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB The productivist model implemented after the second world war has succeeded in improving production to meet growing demands for food, but it has also deeply affected soil physicochemical properties, as well as of aboveground and belowground biodiversity. Alternative farming systems such as organic farming, biodynamic farming and soil conservation farming are actually developing to enhance the sustainability of farming systems. Although the impact of agricultural practices on soil ecological quality is well known, there is little knowledge on the impact of the different farming systems as a whole. Here, we analysed the impact of the main farming systems on soil biodiversity and functioning, reported in about 100 scientific publications. We found that conventional, organic, and biodynamic systems are the most widely studied, whereas soil conservation farming is poorly documented. Soil biological indicators are improved by ca. 70% in organic farming and biodynamic farming relative to conventional farming. 43% of soil bioindicators are improved in biodynamic farming relatively to organic farming. Soil conservation farming scores better than conventional farming for 57% of the indicators. Therefore, biodynamic farming displays the highest soil ecological quality, followed by organic farming, soil conservation farming and, last, conventional farming. Organic fertilisation and longer crop rotations are the most favourable practices, whereas pesticides and soil tillage are the most deleterious ones. The review also evidences a lack of studies on soil conservation farming and on bioindicators of the soil fauna.

TI Is the choice of a farm's commercial market an indicator of agricultural
   intensity? Conventional and short food supply chains in periurban
   farming systems
SO ITALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
AB Shot food supply chains (SFSCs) have been identified as an economic opportunity for agriculture under urban pressure, as well as drivers for more sustainable farming systems. However, few studies have focused on the intensity of periurban farms that participate in such SFSCs, compared with the performance of the other farms. In this paper, we examined the relationship between agricultural intensity and the market orientation in a representative sample of farms in the urban area of Pisa (Italy). We define agricultural intensity as the intensity of land use and its main drivers (e.g., farm management or the individual characteristics of farmers), and market orientation as the ratio of farm produce within conventional, short or mixed food-supply chains. The results suggest that the market orientation of periurban farming systems is more correlated to the indicators of farm management and land use intensity than to the individual farmer's characteristics. This result provides the first evidence that market orientation is a driver of intensity, and that individual farmer's characteristics are not significantly different in the three groups of market orientation. These findings could be generalised to other urban areas and correlated with the main orientation of farming systems in order to support both the assessment of farming systems and the implementation of innovative urban food policies.

TI A Review on Assessing and Mapping Soil Erosion Hazard Using
   Geo-Informatics Technology for Farming System Management
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB Soil erosion is a severe threat to food production systems globally. Food production in farming systems decreases with increasing soil erosion hazards. This review article focuses on geo-informatics applications for identifying, assessing and predicting erosion hazards for sustainable farming system development. Several researchers have used a variety of quantitative and qualitative methods with erosion models, integrating geo-informatics techniques for spatial interpretations to address soil erosion and land degradation issues. The review identified different geo-informatics methods of erosion hazard assessment and highlighted some research gaps that can provide a basis to develop appropriate novel methodologies for future studies. It was found that rainfall variation and land-use changes significantly contribute to soil erosion hazards. There is a need for more research on the spatial and temporal pattern of water erosion with rainfall variation, innovative techniques and strategies for landscape evaluation to improve the environmental conditions in a sustainable manner. Examining water erosion and predicting erosion hazards for future climate scenarios could also be approached with emerging algorithms in geo-informatics and spatiotemporal analysis at higher spatial resolutions. Further, geo-informatics can be applied with real-time data for continuous monitoring and evaluation of erosion hazards to risk reduction and prevent the damages in farming systems.

TI Conceptualising farming systems for agricultural development research:
   Cases from Eastern and Southern Africa
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB In the context of broad scale system changes (e.g. climate change) and the prioritisation of impact-at-scale development, there is a particular need for farming systems research (FSR) to improve our understanding of the links between systems at multiple scales. Drawing on three empirical case studies of large-scale agricultural interventions in eastern and southern Africa, we highlight problems that arise from conceiving and justifying interventions on the basis of the simple aggregation of farms into large collective systems. We review changes in the approach and concepts of FSR and point to the value of farming systems concepts that go beyond these aggregations, and find ways to capture the multi-level system dynamics that link on-farm decision making to broader political, social, and environmental changes. Recent attempts at more accurately conceptualising the domain of FSR, and drawing distinctions between 'farms', 'systems', and 'systems of farming', represent a useful contribution to such work.

TI Crop Diversification Improves pH in Acidic Soils
SO JOURNAL OF CROP IMPROVEMENT
AB Soil acidification has become a major challenge for sustainable crop production in the subsistence farming systems of developing countries. Diversified cropping may reduce soil acidity and improve agricultural sustainability. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of crop diversification on soil acidity in the subsistence farming systems of the mountains and plains of Nepal. We monitored soil pH of 180 sites that included low-diversity farms (LDFs), high-diversity farms (HDFs), and natural forest in mountains of Nuwakot and plains of Chitwan, Nepal. Soils were more acidic in Nuwakot than in Chitwan. The soil pH in HDFs with a value of 5.19 (Chitwan) and 4.03 (Nuwakot) was significantly higher than in LDFs and forests. Soil pH was lowest (4.67) in LDFs in Chitwan and in forest (3.32) in Nuwakot. Crop diversification can potentially improve the sustainability of subsistence farming systems through improvement in pH of the acidic soils.

TI Comparison of soil N availability and leaching potential, crop yields
   and weeds in organic, low-input and conventional farming systems in
   northern California
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB Increasing dependence on off-farm inputs including, fertilizers, pesticides and energy for food and fiber production in the United States and elsewhere is of questionable sustainability resulting in environmental degradation and human health risks. The organic (no synthetic fertilizer or pesticide use), and low-input (reduced amount of synthetic fertilizer and pesticide use), farming systems are considered to be an alternative to conventional fanning systems, to enhance agricultural sustainability and environmental quality. Soil N availability and leaching potential, crop yields and weeds are important factors related to agricultural sustainability and environmental quality, yet information on long-term fanning system effects on these factors, especially in the organic and low-input fanning systems is limited. Four fanning systems: organic, low-input, conventional (synthetic fertilizer and pesticides applied at recommended rates) 4-year rotation (conv-4) and a conventional 2-year rotation (conv-2) were evaluated for soil mineral N, potentially mineralizable N (PMN), crop yields and weed biomass in irrigated processing tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) and corn (Zea mays L.) from 1994 to 1998 in California's Sacramento Valley. Soil mineral N levels during the cropping season varied by crop, farming system, and the amount and source of N fertilization. The organic and low-input systems showed 112 and 36% greater PMN pools than the conventional systems, respectively. However, N mineralization rates of the conventional systems were 100% greater than in the organic and 28% greater than in the low-input system. Average tomato fruit yield for the 5-year period (1994-1998) was 71.0 Mg ha(-1) and average corn grain yield was 11.6 Mg ha(-1) and both were not significantly different among farming systems. The organic system had a greater aboveground weed biomass at harvest compared to other systems. The lower potential risk of N leaching from lower N mineralization rates in the organic and low-input fanning systems appear to improve agricultural sustainability and environmental quality while maintaining similar crop yields.

TI Modelling shifts between mono- and multifunctional farming systems: the
   importance of social and economic drivers
SO LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB In Europe, policy measures are starting to emerge that promote multifunctional farming systems and delivery of ecosystem services besides food production. Effectiveness of these policy instruments have to deal with ecological, economic and social complexities and with complexities in individual decisions of local actors leading to system shifts.
   The objective of this paper is to discover the most important social and/or economic drivers that cause farm systems to shift between a monofunctional (providing food) and a multifunctional state (providing food and natural pest regulation).
   Using a cellular automata model, we simulated decisions of individual farmers to shift between a mono-and multifunctional state through time, based on their behaviour type and on financial and social consequences. Collaboration of multifunctional farmers at a landscape scale is a precondition to provide a reliable level of natural pest regulation.
   Costs of applying green infrastructure was an important driver for the size and the conversion rate of shifts between mono-and multifunctional farming systems. Shifts towards multifunctional farming were enhanced by a higher motivation of farmers to produce sustainably, while shifts (back) to a monofunctional state was enhanced by a low social cohesion between multifunctional farmers.
   These results suggest that in order to develop a multifunctional farming system, individual farmers should act counterintuitively to their conventional farming environment. To maintain a multifunctional farming system, social cohesion between multifunctional farmers is most relevant. Financial aspects are important in both shifts.

SO FRONTIERS OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Smallholder farming systems are important for global food security, but these faces multiple environmental challenges hindering sustainable development. Although sustainable smallholder agriculture issues have been widely discussed and addressed by scientists globally, harmonized approaches in evaluating sustainability are still lacking. This paper proposes a five-step process for constructing a sustainability assessment method for smallholder farming systems, namely definition of system boundary & functional unit, indicator selection, indicator weighting, indicator conversion, and indicator aggregation. The paper summarizes the state-of-art progresses in agricultural sustainability assessment at different stages, and systematically discussed the benefits and limitations of weighting and aggregation methods. Overall, this evaluation process should be useful by providing rational and comprehensive results for quantifying the sustainability of smallholder farming systems, and will contribute to practice by providing decision-makers with directions for improving sustainable strategies.

TI Livestock in resource-poor farming systems
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB Current views underlying livestock research and development have to be reconsidered to understand the possibilities for a more sustainable animal production in resource-poor farming systems. Animal production systems are complex and dynamic and they provide more than just food through their versatile roles in supporting human welfare. The intangible products are important in areas lacking formal insurance and developed financial markets. The objectives of research, education and extension should be set in relation to this broad perspective on livestock keeping. Changes in land use and economic conditions are the driving forces for change in animal production systems. A systems approach is needed to assess disciplinary research focused on production levels of individual animals, and sustainability prospects of new technologies within the context of the farming system. This can help us to plan for the future.

TI Changes in shifting cultivation systems on small Pacific islands
SO GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
AB The limited information on change in shifting cultivation systems of small islands of the Pacific stands in contrast to increasing evidence of this farming system's demise in other parts of the tropics. Here, we assess changes in agricultural activities during the past 40 years of Bellona Island, Solomon Islands, where shifting cultivation is still maintained in the traditional way. Fallow length has increased despite population growth due to redistribution of the cultivated area, migration-induced extensification and changes in crops. Productivity of the farming system remains high although there are indications of soil degradation in the centre of the island. However, there are no signs that the traditional shifting cultivation system in Bellona may become unsustainable in the near future and extreme land use transformations seen in other Pacific islands are not found here.

TI Large-scale ecologically-based farming systems foster earthworm
   communities and their contribution to ecosystem processes
SO APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB In the Pampean region of Argentina, large-scale ecologically-based farming systems (EBS) are proposed as a more sustainable alternative to the conventional systems (CS). EBS rely on soil biological functioning, where earthworms are essential by their contribution to ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling and soil aggregation. Our aim was to assess the effect of EBS, compared to CS and undisturbed grasslands (GS), on earthworm communities and their contribution to the process of soil structure formation, evaluated through direct sorting and quantification of earthworm casts. EBS and GS had similar earthworm richness and abundance, in both cases significantly higher than in CS. Earthworm biomass was higher in GS than in both farming systems and higher in EBS than in CS. Cast production was higher in EBS compared to CS, and similar in EBS and GS. Cast production was linearly related to earthworm abundance and to a greater extent to earthworm biomass. We conclude, in the first direct assessment of earthworm contribution to soil structure formation in EBS of the Pampean region, that this farming system provides better conditions for earthworm development compared to CS, enhancing their role in the soil ecosystem processes. Thus, we confirmed the ability of EBS to increase soil biological fertility replacing chemical inputs by ecosystem processes thus achieving more resilient and sustainable farming systems.

TI Sustainability of Agricultural Diversity in the Farm Households of
   Southern Tibet
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Farming systems in Tibet are undergoing significant change as farm households are encouraged to shift from more subsistence-oriented staple cereals to more intensive, diverse, and integrated forage crop livestock systems reliant on engagement with external input and product markets. This is occurring at a time of rapid agrarian transition with more and more of the livelihoods, income, and expenditures of farm households dependent on off-farm sources. Modernizing an agricultural sector that can sustain the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and meet the demands of an ever more discerning customer base all within the confines of a limited resource base has proved a major R&D and policy challenge for Tibetan and Chinese officials, let alone the farmers and market actors impacted by these developments. In this paper, key drivers impacting diversity in Tibetan farm households, including agrarian transition and demographic, infrastructure, and food price developments, are outlined. The impact on household economics and on the environment of the more intensive and diverse farming systems are then discussed, along with the attitudes of farm households to the changing farming systems and to their future in farming. The paper finds significant labor and environmental challenges that farm households and policy makers must grapple with if the farming system and agrarian transition trajectories are to be sustained.

SO BLACK EARTH: ECOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES FOR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE ON
   CHERNOZEM SOILS
SE International Year of Planet Earth
AB Natural ecosystems are characterized by heterogeneity, a balance of energy and nutrients, self-regulation and regeneration of soil form and function. By contrast, conventional farming systems exhibit homogeneity, an imbalance of inputs and outputs, a weak capacity for self-regulation and a lesser degree of adaptation to the constraints of the environment. The building blocks of sustainability for soils and farming systems include the following:
   - Matching land use with land capability at the landscape scale and at the field scale
   - Crop rotation to combat pests and diseases and to achieve full return to the soil of nutrients and energy
   - which means optimum application of compost and farmyard manure, and a key role for perennial legumes
   - Minimum tillage
   With good design and management, rotational systems are more resilient, more productive and more profitable than monocultures. The resilience of ecological systems depends on checks and balances and capitalizes on the natural variability within the landscape. This is not easy to establish in farming systems; it needs to be underpinned by a new holistic science and social organization that embraces various disciplines and practitioners that can learn from one another.

TI Analysis of available capitals in agricultural systems in rural
   communities: the case of Saraguro, Ecuador
SO SPANISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
AB This paper presents the application of a new methodology for the analysis and appraisal of capitals available in rural community farming systems in research, technological development and innovation (R&D&Ti) projects. The methodology is based on participatory processes in the appraisal of capitals and includes the following: a) analysis of objectives and classification by capital; b) design of variables and indicators; c) information collection and systemization; d) appraisal of indexes of community capitals; and e) analysis of capital indexes. The analysis was conducted in 19 communities in the Saraguro canton. These communities participated in an R&D&Ti project, which lasted for 14 years and is based on the Farming Systems Approach to Research. This application explains, for the first time in this region, the advantages of applying methods for appraising capitals available in community farming systems, considering the different dimensions that should be included in the implementation of the R&D&Ti projects for development. The principal contribution is based on the indexes of capitals and the appraisal that integrates information from the rural communities and their social preferences, using participative techniques in Farming Systems Research and in the processes of evaluation.

TI Evaluation of biological indicators of soil quality under conventional
   and organic fruit farming system
SO CIENCIA E AGROTECNOLOGIA
AB The aim of this paper was to evaluate biological indicators of soil quality under conventional and organic farming systems of fruits in Piaui state. Soil samples were collected in the projection area of plant canopies and in the row at a 0-10, 10-20 and 20-40 cm depths in two areas: organic farming system with "acerola" orchards (SO), conventional farming system with guava orchards (SC). An adjacent area with native vegetation (AVN) was used as referential, being collected soil samples in all area. The variables studied were soil basal respiration, organic and microbial carbon and respiratory and microbial quotients. The higher value of basal respiration was observed in soil of SOcanopies, in 10-20 cm depth. The soils samples collected in the area of native vegetation (AVN) and under the plant canopies in organic system (SOcanopies) showed high organic carbon in the surface (0-10 cm depth) and (20-40 cm depth). Compared with soil of AVN, there was an increase in the carbon of microbial biomass (C-mic) in 0-10 in and 10-20 cm depth, for SOcanopies and SOcanopies. Organic system increased soil microbial activity and organic carbon content, showing benefits for this farming system.

TI Sustainability evaluation of the large-scale pig farming system in North
   China: an emergy analysis based on life cycle assessment
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB At present, the final purpose of livestock production is not only to increase yields but also to improve sustainability. In this study, the characterized results of a life cycle assessment are integrated into an emergy evaluation in terms of potential environmental services to reflect the impact on the sustainability of livestock production systems due to harmful outputs. Concurrently, the life cycle thinking is introduced into the study to diagnose the key points that will improve the sustainability of the system. The assessment was performed through a case study on a large-scale pig farming system in North China. The results of traditional indices indicate that the unit emergy value, emergy yield ratio, emergy loading ratio and emergy sustainability index of the large-scale pig farming system are 5.44E+05 sej/J, 1.00, 3.23 and 0.31, respectively, and reflect the low sustainability of the system. The revised unit emergy value and environmental loading ratio are increased by 76.7% and by 100.3%, respectively, and the revised emergy sustainability index is reduced by 51.6% when the harmful outputs of the large-scale pig farming system are considered. It is clear that the harmful outputs affect the sustainability of the pig production system significantly. Newly designed indices, the resource use efficiency and the unit environmental impact are 8.32E+05 sej/J and 4.17E+05 sej/J, respectively, supporting the efficiency and sustainability from the inputted resource types and outputted perspectives. Furthermore, the case study also shows that from the perspective of the pig life cycle, the improvement of feed composition and labor productivity in the grow-finisher step and the rearing level of breeding pigs are the most important points for the optimization of the large-scale pig farming system. This study is a general supplement to the gap in the assessment of large-scale pig farming in China, and the evaluation results that propose the integration of emergy analysis and life cycle assessment enables a broader view of the sustainability of the production process.

TI How to Address the Sustainability Transition of Farming Systems? A
   Conceptual Framework to Organize Research
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Stakeholders from academic, political, and social spheres encourage the development of more sustainable forms of agriculture. Given its scale and scope, the sustainability transition is a challenge to the entire agricultural sector. The main question is, how to support the transition process? In this article, we explore how agricultural science can address the sustainability transition of farming systems to understand and support transition processes. We discuss the potential for articulating three research approaches: comprehensive analysis, co-design, and simulation modeling. Comprehensive analysis of the sustainability transition provides perspectives on the interplay between resources, resource management, and related performances of farming systems on the one hand and technical, economic, and sociocultural dimensions of change on the other. Co-design of the sustainability transition stimulates local-scale transition experiments in the real world and identification of alternatives for change. Simulation modeling explores future-oriented scenarios of management at multiple levels and assesses their impacts. We illustrate the articulation of research approaches with two examples of research applied to agricultural water management and autonomy in crop-livestock systems. The resulting conceptual framework is the first one developed to organize research to understand and support the sustainability transition of farming systems.

TI Categorizing the sustainability of vegetable production in Chile: a
   farming typology approach
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB Sustainable practices are seen as one of the solutions to redress the negative impact of agriculture's growing intensification. Despite efforts by many governments, the adoption rate of sustainable practices amongst farmers is still low. One of the causes is policymakers' insufficient knowledge of farming-system diversity. In order to account for such diversity, this paper proposes classifying farming systems, including new elements such as the sustainability level of agricultural practices and market channel traits, in combination with socio-economic and farm characteristics. We apply a farming typology approach, using vegetable production in Chile as our case study. We developed the typology using multivariate analysis techniques including principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering (CA). We collected data using surveys (n = 352) in the central region of Chile. The results reveal five farming-system types: (1) Large dual farming, (2) ecological farming, (3) traditional farming, (4) conventional small-scale farming, and (5) conventional medium-scale farming. The five farming system types provide insights on the different agricultural practices used and their different starting points in terms of their transition towards more sustainable agriculture practices. We also propose possible policies based on these farming-system types that can be useful for policymakers to promote sustainable practices.

TI FARMING SYSTEMS OPTIONS FOR UNITED-STATES AGRICULTURE - AN
   AGROECOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE
AB Agricultural productivity gains since the 1950s have resulted from the development of farming systems that rely heavily on external inputs of energy and chemicals to replace management and on-farm resources. The intensity to which the natural environment has been modified to attain this productive capacity has directly resulted in degradation of the natural resources, notably land and water, that sustain these systems. The search for solutions to increasingly complex and interrelated agricultural problems including sustainable agriculture, environmental quality, food safety, and rural development requires a shift in both the scientific method and scale in which agricultural research is organized and conducted. Farming systems research and extension (FSRE) and other systems-oriented approaches fitted to agriculture an viewed as essential approaches for addressing complex agricultural problems, and for developing more efficient and sustainable farming systems. This article provides a brief synthesis of research information from several technical reports that were presented at a special symposium held during the American Society of Agronomy annual meetings in IM. The reports cover a wide range of topics including FSRE, agricultural systems, systems engineering, information systems, and sustainable development.

TI Integration of organic amendments, crop rotation, residue retention and
   minimum tillage into a subtropical vegetable farming system enhances
   suppressiveness to root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita)
SO AUSTRALASIAN PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB Vegetable farming systems in tropical and subtropical Australia are vulnerable for several reasons: degradation of the soil resource due to excessive tillage; environmental problems associated with off-site movement of soil, nutrients and pesticides during intense rainfall events; over-reliance on increasingly expensive external inputs (e.g. fossil fuels, plastic film, nutrients and pesticides); and de-registration of the soil fumigants and nematicides normally used to control soilborne pathogens. This two-year experiment compared the performance of a conventional capsicum farming system (an annual forage sorghum rotation crop and normal tillage practices) with three farming systems considered likely to be more sustainable because reduced tillage, a leguminous rotation crop, mulched crop residues and inputs of organic amendments were integrated into the system. One of these alternatives (capsicum grown under minimum tillage in soil mulched with crop residues rather than plastic) yielded significantly less fruit in both years, while root rotting caused by Pythium recalcitrans and Rhizoctonia solani caused problems in all alternative systems in the second year, presumably because the pathogens multiplied on residues from the previous rotation crop. Nevertheless, one of the sustainable alternatives (organic inputs from amendments and direct-drilled rotation crops for 2 years, with plastic laid onto a mulch of crop residues) performed well in all other respects, enhancing suppressiveness to root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) in the second year and producing higher yields than the conventional system in both years. These results suggest that the conventional vegetable farming system could be improved by 1) incorporating annual applications of commercially-available organic amendments, 2) growing cultivars of forage sorghum and soybean with resistance to root-knot nematode as rotation crops under minimum tillage on permanent beds, 3) mulching biomass from the rotation crops onto the bed surface well before the vegetable crop is to be planted, and 4) leaving the bed undisturbed and covering those residues with plastic. Future research should therefore concentrate on fine-tuning such farming systems; optimising residue management practices to minimise losses from root rotting pathogens that are good competitive saprophytes; and developing mulch-laying equipment capable of laying plastic onto undisturbed beds covered with crop residue.

TI Sensory qualities of plain white pan bread: Influence of farming system,
   year of harvest and baking technique
SO JOURNAL OF CEREAL SCIENCE
AB The sensory qualities of products from sustainable production systems are not well known, but important for development of such systems. To understand how wheat growing systems and baking processes influence white bread quality, six samples of wheat (Triticum aestivum, var.Ebi) from field trials harvested in two consecutive years, three grown in conventional farming systems and three in organic farming systems (biodynamic and ecological), were milled on the Bijhler laboratory mill. Flours were extracted to a fixed ash content (0.48% dmb) and analysed qualitatively and quantitatively. A total of twenty one bread types were baked: twelve according to the farinographic data and nine according to modified recipes. Ten selected and trained assessors completed a sensory analysis (a descriptive profiling test) with three replicates using seventeen sensory attributes.
   The slice area was established using image analysis. There were no differences in slice area between bread baked with conventionally or organically grown bread baked with organically grown wheat harvested in 1999, yet there were differences in 2000, such that slice area was larger for the conventional samples. The effect of year was greater than the effect of farming system or recipe modification, and differences in the sensory data was explained more by texture than by aroma and flavour attributes. Breads baked with wheat harvested in 1999 had significantly lower intensity of crumb attributes such as elasticity, smoothness and juiciness, but higher rancid flavour, springiness, compressibility, mastication resistance and lower colour intensity, as well as higher crust toughness, than did breads baked with wheat harvested in 2000. Breads baked with conventional flour had significantly higher elasticity and juiciness than breads baked with organic flour. Several interactions between year and farming system were revealed.

TI Landscape-scale soil quality change under different farming systems of a
   tropical farm in Hainan, China
SO SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
AB The impact of different tropical farming systems on soil quality was examined using a systematic sampling strategy. Total organic C, pH, extractable P, exchangeable K, bulk density, water stable aggregates, microbial biomass C, cation exchange capacity, soil depth, and clay content were determined. An assessment framework, including a minimum data set, linear scoring functions and weighted additive indices, was used to evaluate the soil quality of a tropical farm growing various crops in Hainan, China. Soil quality was evaluated according to four functions: water availability, nutrient availability, rooting suitability, and erosion resistance. Our results showed that soils were intrinsically lacking in nutrients and vulnerable to degradation, and that these problems were exacerbated by inappropriate management. There was strong evidence that long-term rubber farming caused soil acidification, soil compaction, and depletion of organic matter and nutrients. By contrast, conservation practices in coffee plantations protected or improved organic matter concentration and soil structure, resulting in higher soil quality indices.

TI Genetic Traits of Relevance to Sustainability of Smallholder Sheep
   Farming Systems in South Africa
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Sustainable livestock production is important to ensure continuous availability of resources for future generations. Most smallholder livestock farming systems in developing countries have been perceived to be environmentally, socially and economically unsustainable. Farming with livestock that is robust and adaptable to harsh environments is important in developing countries especially in semi-arid and arid environments. This review discusses the different sheep farming systems employed by smallholder farmers and associated sustainability problems facing them. The review also gives an overview of sustainability indicators and limitations to the sustainability for the different smallholder sheep production systems in South Africa. It is argued that genetic diversity is important for sustainability and needs to be maintained in sheep for sustainable production and reproduction performance. The application of traditional breeding and genomics to ensure sustainable production is explored. Animal breeding approaches, specifically genomics can be applied to improve areas of environmental sustainability of smallholder sheep farming systems but must be targeted to the specific production environments, challenges, and opportunities of smallholder production. The genetic traits important for sustainability, the role of genomics in improving these traits and linking these genetic traits to different farming systems in South Africa are discussed.

TI Emergy evaluation and economic analysis of three wetland fish farming
   systems in Nansi Lake area, China
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Emergy and economic methods were used to evaluate and compare three fish production models, i.e., cage fish farming system, pond intensive fish rearing system and semi-natural extensive pond fish rearing system, in Nansi Lake area in China in the year 2007. The goal of this study was to understand the benefits and driving forces of selected fish production models from ecological and economic points of view. The study considered input structure, production efficiency, environmental impacts, economic viability and sustainability. Results show that the main difference among the three production systems was the emergy cost for fish feed associated with their feeding system, i.e., feeding on natural biomass such as plankton and grass or on commercial feedstock. As indicated by EYR, ELR and ESI, it can be clearly shown that the intensive production model with commercial feed is not a sustainable pattern. However, the point is that more environmentally sound patterns do not seem able to provide a competitive net profit in the short run. The intensive pond fish farming system had a net profit of 2.57E+03 $/ha, much higher than 1.27E+03 $/ha for cage fish farming system and slightly higher than 2.37E+03 $/ha for semi-natural fish farming system. With regard to the drivers of local farmer's decisions, the accessibility of land for the required use and investment ability determine the farmer's choice of the production model and the scale of operation, while other factors seem to have little effect. Theoretically, the development of environmentally sustainable production patterns, namely water and land conservation measures, greener feed as well as low waste systems is urgently needed, to keep production activities within the carrying capacity of ecosystems. Coupled emergy and economic analyses can provide better insight into the environmental and economic benefits of fish production systems and help solve the problems encountered during policy making.

AB This paper introduces a method to optimize the environmental performance (EP) of agricultural activities, defined as the distance between the 'environmental' state of a system at a specific time or on a specific period and a 'high environmental performance' state to reach. Focus is on water management at the watershed level with three criteria: nitrogen, sediments (water quality) and water yields (water quantity). The purpose is to provide a new land-use plan. The originality of the method lies in the coupling between an agro-hydrological model, the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT), and the goal programming (GP) optimization method. Modeling is used to define the initial situation of the system and to generate data for the optimization. Goal programming is implemented to relocate farming systems in the watershed using a binary decision variable.
   The method is implemented on the La Boulouze watershed (South West of France). The results are an improvement of the EP, but the 'high environmental state' is not reached. The main land uses changes are the decrease of the sunflower-wheat farming system in favor of the meadows. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The role of farming systems group approaches in achieving sustainability
   in Australian agriculture
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
AB The concepts surrounding sustainability are outlined and economic, environmental and social sustainability are defined for Australian farming systems - including the issue of scale at which sustainability can be practically applied. Farming systems work in Australia is often a farmer - scientist partnership, with research mainly conducted at the paddock/farm scale, this being where management decisions are made. Farming systems research as conducted currently has concentrated on components of the 'system' and could be described as systems in name more than substance.
   Farming systems groups have primarily focused on issue of profitability and economic sustainability (soil resource). Some groups have focused on salinity and recharge related issues using perennial pastures, but work on biodiversity has been limited, despite its role as a key environmental sustainability issue, at least, in southern Australia. Several groups are addressing issues of social sustainability at scales larger (e.g. local community or region) than the farm. Farming systems groups need to progress towards more sustainable farming systems involving increased complexity and consideration of multiple values for a number of reasons outlined in this paper. Important factors in this evolution include investment in developing new technologies, the knowledge and learning environment, increased emphasis on environmental and social sustainability, progression to larger scales (e.g. catchment or region), and different relationships in view of changing institutional arrangements. Social learning and 'soft systems' approaches will become more important to provide skills to deal with complexity, conflict, and multiple values of people. Farming systems groups need to become more actively engaged with a wider group of stakeholders including catchment management organisations and other non-farming members of the community. Such engagement is occurring in some groups. However, there are large training needs, particularly for facilitators to effectively deal with the increasing complexity of work conducted by groups that are involving larger scales and using a multi-disciplinary approach.

TI A METHODIC WAY TO MORE SUSTAINABLE FARMING SYSTEMS
SO NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
AB A methodic pathway is suggested for the definition, elaboration, evaluation and introduction of farming systems based on an 'integrated' or an 'ecosystem-oriented' vision, both considered more sustainable than a 'world-market-oriented' vision. The objectives of these three basic types of systems are defined in measurable terms with respect to the major social values or interests supported or adversely influenced by agriculture. For each type of systems, a strategy is assessed through which the objectives can be achieved while avoiding their conflicts. Arable farming is taken as an example of the elaboration, evaluation and introduction of integrated and ecosystem-oriented systems. It is discussed how prototype systems can be developed on an experimental farm, evaluated by a pilot group of farmers and dispersed on a large scale. For the short term it is recommended to focus research and policy on integrated farming systems, as an urgently needed compromise between socio-economical and socio-ecological interests. For the long term it is recommended to develop ecosystem-oriented farming systems to solve the agricultural crisis in a more comprehensive and sustainable way.

TI Economic Factors Affecting Diversified Farming Systems
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB In response to a shift toward specialization and mechanization during the 20th century, there has been momentum on the part of a vocal contingent of consumers, producers, researchers, and policy makers who call for a transition toward a new model of agriculture. This model employs fewer synthetic inputs, incorporates practices which enhance biodiversity and environmental services at local, regional, and global scales, and takes into account the social implications of production practices, market dynamics, and product mixes. Within this vision, diversified farming systems (DFS) have emerged as a model that incorporates functional biodiversity at multiple temporal and spatial scales to maintain ecosystem services critical to agricultural production. Our aim is to provide an economists' perspective on the factors which make diversified farming systems (DFS) economically attractive, or not-so-attractive, to farmers, and to discuss the potential for and roadblocks to widespread adoption. We focus on how a range of existing and emerging factors drive profitability and adoption of DFS. We believe that, in order for DFS to thrive, a number of structural changes are needed. These include: 1) public and private investment in the development of low-cost, practical technologies that reduce the costs of production in DFS, 2) support for and coordination of evolving markets for ecosystem services and products from DFS and 3) the elimination of subsidies and crop insurance programs that perpetuate the unsustainable production of staple crops. We suggest that subsidies and funding be directed, instead, toward points 1) and 2), as well as toward incentives for consumption of nutritious food.

TI Development and control of weeds in arable farming systems
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB It is investigated, whether the arable weed vegetation can perform as a characteristic to stimulate sustainable development of agriculture in Central Europe. The concept of sustainable development represents a dynamic process, influenced by ecological, economic and social aspects. Characteristics are required to integrate desired ecological aspects into farming concepts, in order to stimulate production systems which add to a sustainable development of the sector. The investigations rely on data of an arable farming system experiment (INTEX). Three farming systems called good-farming-practice (GFP), integrated-flexible and integrated-non-inversion were established from 1994 to 1998 on two sites. The systems differed in crop rotation, soil tillage, fertilisation and pesticide use. Thus, weed management comprised Cultural or indirect control by plant husbandry and direct mechanical and chemical control. A residual weed vegetation after terminating all direct control in the arable crops was ex-ante intended in the integrated systems.
   The spring weed densities were observed in winter wheat previous to any direct control treatments. The residual weed vegetation was investigated in all crops by monitoring species numbers and total ground cover after terminating all direct control.
   The direct chemical control intensity was considerably lower in the integrated farming system, in which the crop rotation was extended and the soil was ploughed annually. Spring densities of problematic weeds like annual grass weeds and Galium aparine in the winter wheat crop were not higher in these systems.
   Higher covers of the residual weed vegetation Occurred more often in the productive arable crops of the two integrated farming systems, which additionally hosted higher number of species after terminating direct control. The different system strategies, including a higher input of herbicides in the system integrated-non-inversion, averted severe problems, including those arising from the dominating species being generally problematic in arable land use.

AB Sustainable land use requires development of agricultural production systems that, in addition to economic objectives, contribute to objectives in areas such as environment, health and well-bring, rural scenery and nature. Since these objectives are at least partially conflicting, development of sustainable fanning systems is characterized by negotiation about acceptable compromises among objectives. Four phases can be distinguished in the course of farming systems development: diagnosis, design, testing and improvement, and dissemination. During the last decade an approach coined 'prototyping' has emerged as a promising method for empirical farming systems development in Western Europe. Limitations of the approach include: (1) the limited number of systems that can be evaluated, resulting in a lack of perspective on conflicts among objectives, and (2) the expertise-based nature of rules used during systems design which unduly narrows the range of available options and obscures understanding of systems behaviour. In the paper, explorative studies based on transparent models of agronomy and management are put forward to supplement empirical prototyping and to remedy its shortcomings. To illustrate the potential of model-based explorations, two case studies are presented. The first case study deals with diagnosis and design of wheat based rotations in the Paris Basin of France, aimed at alleviating tactical problems of poor resource-use efficiency within the constraints imposed by existing crop rotations. The second case study addresses design of sustainable bulb-based farming systems in the Netherlands with the purpose of investigating strategic options at crop rotation and farm level to resolve conflicts between economic and environmental objectives. In the discussion, methodological elements of model-based explorations and interaction with stakeholders are addressed, and opportunities for enhanced development of sustainable farming systems are identified.

TI FARMING SYSTEMS IN TWO LESS FAVOURED AREAS IN PORTUGAL: THEIR
   DEVELOPMENT FROM 1989 TO 2009 AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR SUSTAINABLE LAND
   MANAGEMENT
SO LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB Since the late 1980s, sustainable land management is one of the objectives of the European Commission in Less Favoured Areas. In this paper, we investigate the economic and environmental sustainability of farming systems in two less favoured areas in Centro and Alentejo areas of Portugal. The specific objectives were the following: (i) to characterise the farming systems; (ii) to analyse their development over a 20-year period (1989-2009); and (iii) to investigate to what extent these farming systems contribute to sustainable land management. The diversity of the farming systems was identified through a survey and cluster analysis and compared with the Farm Accountancy Data Network classification on types of farming. Indicators on the economic and environmental sustainability were estimated, namely, farm net income, return to labour and rotation management, on the basis of a survey, Farm Accountancy Data Network database and Landsat imagery, respectively. Results indicate an increased focus on livestock in the past 20years (1989-2009). In Centro, rotation management was not affected. The small ruminant farms have been able to retain a positive farm net income but that was only possible with a below average return to labour. In Alentejo, the increased focus on livestock, cattle in particular, led to an intensification of fodder production on certain plots. Mixed crop-livestock farms show a negative farm net income since 1995 and depend heavily on subsidies to remain viable. As other studies in southern Europe have shown, farm strategies have often been directed towards lowering labour inputs, lowering forage deficits through on-farm produced resources and acquiring subsidies.

TI Review of livestock farmer adaptations to increase forages in crop
   rotations in western France
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB Since the 1960s there has been a global trend toward specializing and intensifying farming systems in order to produce more food. However, harmful environmental consequences have been recognized. Integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLS) are now being reconsidered as a means of improving farm and land sustainability. We suggest that understanding interrelations of ICLS to achieve sustainability requires scrutinizing the way farmers exploit them to adapt their farming system. We used six different case studies covering maritime and semi-maritime regions of France (beef and dairy + crop systems) to describe factors influencing production, environmental, and socio-economic considerations for change in farming practices. Farm surveys and analysis of farmers' practices and farm time-course of change were framed within the European farming system approach. Transition in the medium-term pointed out new interactions at stake between crops and livestock when farmers developed adaptation to climate changes, introduced grassland in contrast to the general trend of specialization and enhanced feed self-sufficiency. In the medium- and short-term, multifunctionality of crops and crop rotation adjustments, as well as regulation of cropping systems by livestock classes are the main levers of system flexibility. We showed how ICLS increased sustainability and began to notice the positive effects of farm collaboration. Further research is needed in partnership with additional stakeholders to support sustainable development of agriculture at the landscape level. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Water resources sustainability has the main contribution to the existence and durability of the farming systems and strongly depends on the cropping pattern practices A comprehensive cropping pattern planning takes in to account the high level of interrelation of the environmental, economic and social aspects of farming systems In order to assess the sustainability of water resources and determine an optimal pattern of cropping in a rural farming system, this paper introduces two ratios of "net return/water consumption" and "labor employment/water consumption" and attempts to simultaneously optimize them as the sustainability indicators To this purpose, a multi-objective fractional goal programming (MOFGP) procedure is considered as the main approach of the study to be accomplished by several other single and multi-objective linear and fractional programming models The results show that the FP models are more significant to contribute in assessing the sustainability indicators compared to the LP models, and the MOFGP solution is considered better, compared to the single objective FP solutions The results will be illustrated quantitatively

AB Agricultural researchers recognize the importance of the sustainability of agricultural systems and the need to develop appropriate ways to measure sustainability. The search for agroecosystem performance indicators (APIs) is an urgent task to develop understanding and to facilitate decision-making processes. The paper provides an input/output methodology for a farming system analysis in terms of both energy and monetary values, measurements that are sufficiently homogenizing and comprehensive to document patterns of agroecosystem transfers of bio-physical entities and socio-cultural values. This methodology was applied to two adjacent farms located in Central Italy, which differed in the farming system adopted (mixed fanning and arable farming) and in the level of external input applied. A broad range of APIs (structural and functional, direct and crossed) was developed to analyze both the fundamental energy transfers (and associated allocation of monetary values) between the crucial agroecosystem components and the overall efficiency of the farming system in transforming different external input into output. This analysis shows that energy and monetary values do nor offer a single, coherent account of the functioning of farm systems. The study stresses the need for the development of an environmental accounting method, which integrates ecological and economic aspects, For the present, it is recognized that structural and functional APIs calculated according to energy, rather than monetary, values are more meaningful in both the designing of sustainable fanning systems and in decision-making processes.

TI The search for new pasture plants to achieve more sustainable production
   systems in southern Australia
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
AB Increasing the proportion of the landscape planted to deep-rooted perennial pasture species is recognised as one of several remedial actions required for the control of dryland salinity in southern Australia. The widespread use of perennials in farming systems is limited at present by the lack of well-adapted perennials that can be grown to reduce recharge in a landscape where drought, soil acidity, temporary waterlogging, infertile soils and unrestricted grazing prohibit the use of many species. The range of plants adapted to salinity also needs to be expanded to stabilise and ameliorate soils already degraded by rising watertables and to increase the profitability of grazing discharge regions within the landscape.
   This paper describes the steps involved in a national forage screening and breeding program initiated by the Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) for Plant-based Management of Dryland Salinity(1), seeking to expand the range of perennial and or salt-tolerant forage plants that can be incorporated into farming systems of southern Australia. It describes the target environments, soil constraints, farming systems and the criteria being considered when assessing the potential of new plants, including assessment of the weed risk posed by introducing new species. This paper forms an introduction to a special issue which presents the outcomes of the pasture species field evaluation and plant breeding program conducted by the CRC.

AB Organic banana farming is an alternative to conventional banana production in Chinese Taipei. Results from a 10-year study on organic banana production at the organic farm of the Taiwan Banana Research Institute (TBRI) indicate that average incidence of Fusarium wilt for four Cavendish cultivars was 25.7% for the organic farming system, as compared to 66.9% for the conventional farming system. The lower incidence of Fusarium wilt in the organic system was considered to be associated with a positive change in the properties of the soil. Horticultural parameters at shooting did not show significant differences between organic and conventional banana, except for a lower number of healthy leaves in the organic banana. No differences in the post-harvest quality could be found between organic and conventional banana. A smaller bunch weight was recorded for the organic banana; however, more harvested bunches resulted in a higher overall yield in the organic farming system. Promotion of the organic farming system for adoption by more banana growers could enhance the sustainability of the Chinese Taipei banana industry.

TI Narrow and Brittle or Broad and Nimble? Comparing Adaptive Capacity in
   Simplifying and Diversifying Farming Systems
SO FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB Humanity faces a triple threat of climate change, biodiversity loss, and global food insecurity. In response, increasing the general adaptive capacity of farming systems is essential. We identify two divergent strategies for building adaptive capacity. Simplifying processes seek to narrowly maximize production by shifting the basis of agricultural production toward centralized control of socially and ecologically homogenized systems. Diversifying processes cultivate social-ecological complexity in order to provide multiple ecosystem services, maintain management flexibility, and promote coordinated adaptation across levels. Through five primarily United States focused cases of distinct agricultural challenges-foodborne pathogens, drought, marginal lands, labor availability, and land access and tenure-we compare simplifying and diversifying responses to assess how these pathways differentially enhance or degrade the adaptive capacity of farming systems in the context of the triple threat. These cases show that diversifying processes can weave a form of broad and nimble adaptive capacity that is fundamentally distinct from the narrow and brittle adaptive capacity produced through simplification. We find that while there are structural limitations and tradeoffs to diversifying processes, adaptive capacity can be facilitated by empowering people and enhancing ecosystem functionality to proactively distribute resources and knowledge where needed and to nimbly respond to changing circumstances. Our cases suggest that, in order to garner the most adaptive benefits from diversification, farming systems should balance the pursuit of multiple goals, which in turn requires an inclusive process for active dialogue and negotiation among diverse perspectives. Instead of locking farming systems into pernicious cycles that reproduce social and ecological externalities, diversification processes can enable nimble responses to a broad spectrum of possible stressors and shocks, while also promoting social equity and ecological sustainability.

AB A survey was conducted in 2012 to assess the diversity of farming systems in the potential potato production areas of Chencha in southern Ethiopia. It was part a PhD research study on evaluation and optimization of sustainability of farming systems which is part of an initiative to make the area a potato centre of excellence. Household surveys (n = 57) and farmers' group discussions were used to collect data from 21 villages. A mixed farming system was the prevailing system in the area where crops and livestock are simultaneously grown. The major crops grown in the area were potato, enset, wheat, barley and kale. Most crops were grown as food and cash crops. Barley and enset were mainly grown for household consumption. Farmers used improved varieties mainly for potato (73% of respondents) and wheat (77%). There were two cropping seasons per calendar year and crop rotation is common in the area. The dominant rotation system practised by 95% of the respondents was planting potato followed by wheat or barley. The common intercropping practices were mixed intercropping of barley with lentil and wheat with linseed. Based on local classification there were 12 soil types. The most common ones were Modo (dark loam), Gobo (red clay) and Kalta (brown clay). Fertilizers used were farmyard manure (97% of households), compost (40%), urea (78%) and diammonium phosphate (DAP) (81%). Farmers used low rates of inorganic fertilizers due to shortage of cash. Most of the households (55%) obtained a cash income from agricultural activities, mainly from crop production. The most important off-farm activity was weaving. Household food demands were met from own farm and external sources. Constraints of the farming system that need research and policy interventions include soil fertility depletion, low productive crop varieties, shortages of land, improved seed and cash.

TI Evolution of the Minangkabau's shifting cultivation in the west Sumatra
   highland of Indonesia and its strategic implications for dynamic farming
   systems
SO LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB This paper explores the evolution of the shifting cultivation of the Minangkabau, the biggest matrilineal society in Indonesia, and examines factors underlying the instability and vulnerability of farmers' livelihoods and the degradation of their resource base using an extended factor analysis technique, in order to understand how development strategies might be modified towards a more dynamic farming system. The study distinguished three main phases of the farming system's changes and found that these changes highly corresponded with the emerging market and institutional incentives. Furthermore, the factor analysis generated a six-factor model suggesting strategic interventions to foster the improvement of farmers' livelihoods and environment in future. In addition, consistent with the results of these factors analysis, we argue that, provided land tenure is conducive, there are substantial possibilities for policies and interventions that focus first on agricultural diversification and then on organization building, to assist in dealing with farmers' vulnerability and environmental degradation in the uplands.

TI Evaluation of the sustainability of contrasted pig farming systems:
   development of a market conformity tool for pork products based on
   technological quality traits ocr r24v
SO ANIMAL
AB A market conformity tool, based on technological meat quality parameters, was developed within the Q-PorkChains project, to be included in a global sustainability evaluation of pig farming systems. The specific objective of the market conformity tool was to define a scoring system based on the suitability of meat to elaborate the main pork products, according to their market shares based on industry requirements, in different pig farming systems. The tool was based on carcass and meat quality parameters that are commonly used for the assessment of technological quality, which provide representative and repeatable data and are easily measurable. They were the following: cold carcass weight; lean meat percentage; minimum subcutaneous back fat depth at nn. gluteus nnedius level, 45 postmortem and ultimate pH (measured at 24-h postmortem) in m. longissinnus lunnborunn and senninnennbranosus; meat colour; drip losses and intramuscular fat content in a m. longissinnus sample. Five categories of pork products produced at large scale in Europe were considered in the study: fresh meat, cooked products, dry products, specialties and other meat products. For each of the studied farming systems, the technological meat quality requirements, as well as the market shares for each product category within farming system, were obtained from the literature and personal communications from experts. The tool resulted in an overall conformity score that enabled to discriminate among systems according to the degree of matching of the achieved carcass and meat quality with the requirements of the targeted market. In order to improve feasibility, the tool was simplified by selecting ultimate pH at nn. longissinnus or senninnennbranosus, minimum fat thickness measured at the left half carcass over m. gluteus nnedius and intramuscular fat content in a m. longissinnus sample as iceberg indicators. The overall suitability scores calculated by using both the complete and the reduced tools presented good correlation and the results obtained were similar. The tool could be considered as robust enough to discriminate among different systems, since it was tested in a wide range of them. It also can be used to detect improvement opportunities to enhance sustainability of pig farming systems. The final objective of the study was achieved, since the market suitability tool could be used in an integrated sustainability analysis of pig farming systems.

TI A Spatially Explicit Choice Model to Assess the Impact of Conservation
   Policy on High Nature Value Farming Systems
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB High Nature Value (HNV) farmland is declining in the EU, with negative consequences for biodiversity conservation. Agri-environment schemes implemented under the Common Agricultural Policy have addressed this problem, with recent proposals advocating direct support to HNV farming systems. However, research is lacking on the economics of HNV farming, which makes it difficult to set the level and type of support that ensure its sustainability. In this paper, we focused on a Special Protection Area for steppe bird conservation, analysing how economic incentives, biophysical and structural features govern the choice of fanning system. We found that persistence of the traditional farming system important for steppe birds was associated with economic incentives, resistance to change, and good quality soils, whereas a shift to specialised livestock production systems was favoured by higher rainfall and less fragmented farms. A supply curve built using the choice model predicted that the proportion of traditional farming increased from 20% to 80% of the landscape, when economic incentives increased from about 100(sic)/ha to 160(sic)/ha. Overall, our study highlights the dependence of HNV farming systems on economic incentives, and provides a framework to assess the effects of alternative policy and market scenarios to sustain farmland landscapes promoting biodiversity conservation.

TI New perennial grains in African smallholder agriculture from a farming
   systems perspective. A review
SO AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Perennial grain crops are gaining increased attention from researchers as one possible solution to agriculture's many sustainability challenges. In the Sub-Saharan African context, perennial varieties of crops such as sorghum, rice, and pigeon pea have potential to provide numerous benefits for smallholder farmers. The introduction and adoption of new crops and practices is however a complex process that needs to be approached from an interdisciplinary and participatory perspective. We here review the small but growing body of knowledge about on-farm adoption and the use of perennial grains around the world, as well as the more extensive literature of farming systems research. We conclude that a farming systems approach offers a fruitful entry point for informing the emerging research agenda around perennial grains in African smallholder agriculture. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of the potentials and challenges of perennial grains also requires cross-scalar analysis capable of looking beyond the farming system. We thus outline five key considerations for developing and studying new perennial grains in smallholder contexts, i.e., (1) smallholder farming systems are complex, diverse, and locally adapted; (2) decision-making is shaped by various resource constraints; (3) farming is often "semi-subsistence" and forms part of broader livelihood strategies, wherein risk is an important factor; (4) gender relations and roles influence many aspects of smallholder farming systems; and (5) analyses of farmers' production systems, decision-making, and livelihood strategies must be embedded within a broader political-economic context. Based on these considerations, we suggest directions and examples of key questions for future research and derive methodological implications for how such research could be approached.

TI Evolution of mixed farming systems for the delivery of triple bottom
   line outcomes: a synthesis of the Grain & Graze program
SO ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE
AB The continued evolution of mixed farming systems will depend on the development of technology which addresses the basic biophysical constraints of the agro ecological zone within which these systems have developed. However, the application of these technologies will increasingly depend on the extent to which they address all dimensions of the social-economic-environmental system within which mixed farmers operate. The Grain & Graze program has accelerated the adoption of several technologies that can provide a basis for continuing evolution of mixed farming systems (e. g. grazing of cereals, drought containment of livestock, perennial pastures) while initiating the development and exploration of others whose potential will be realised in the longer term (e. g. pasture cropping, integrated pest management in mixed farming systems, cover cropping and alley farming with old man saltbush). Some technologies capable of supporting continued evolution were not addressed comprehensively by the program but remain opportunities for future development, particularly technologies for feed demand management and inter-seasonal feed transfer. The program made considerable progress in fostering the explicit consideration of the 'triple bottom line' consequences of new technology. It has confirmed that no universal solution to the question of profitability and sustainability is to be expected but has also demonstrated that methodology is available to make the formal consideration of this question much more robust. Clearer definition of the institutional requirements for support of change in complex systems, and for effective management of large national projects, will provide key underpinnings to ensure that subsequent programs achieve the benefits of scale in RD&E that Grain & Graze has convincingly demonstrated. In addition, we argue that ongoing evolution of mixed farming systems that will deliver triple bottom line outcomes will require policies that achieve appropriate cost sharing for delivery of environmental benefits and increased capacity for structural adjustment within the industry itself, to account for changes in demography, infrastructure and farm management arrangements.

AB Snap beans of "Terrii" variety were examined in the Jordan valley, at the University of Jordan research station during 2004/2005 growing season.
   Objectives were to study nitrate accumulations in pods, seeds, leaves, and shoots, under conventional, GAP, and organic farming systems.
   Two planting populations and three rates of fertilizers were applied in the main, and sub main plots, respectively. Conventional system included additions of synthetic fertilizers and the use of chemical pesticides. Organic system included additions of compost as the only source of nutrients with out any use of pesticides. The GAP system utilized practices from each of the other two systems.
   The conventional farming system demonstrated significantly higher NO3-N content of pods, seeds, leaves, and shoots, over those of both organic and GAP systems. The least NO3-N accumulation was found in plant parts of organic beans. Nitrate contents were generally, higher under higher plant populations of the three farming systems. Nitrate accumulation found to be increased in different plant parts as conventional fertilizer rates increased. In contrast, nitrate accumulations were constant or decreased as compost rates increased in both organic and GAP systems.
   Successful and widespread adoption of organic and GAP systems would provide with sustainable agricultural basis, without the legacy of harmful environmental degradation, that has been a feature of conventional farming systems.

TI An investigation into the transition from technological to ecological

SO AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB A conceptual framework influenced by the concept of moral ecology is developed and used to analyze the transition from technological (green revolution) to ecological (organic) rice farming by resource poor farmers from the Philippine island of Bohol. This Moral Ecology Framework (MEF) focuses on the epistemology of the two farming systems and how this influences management principles and practice.. The orienting concepts of systemic understanding, exchange between society and the environment, local versus extra-local exchange and scope are integral to this analysis. The case study demonstrates how the ostracism of nature under the green revolution coupled with its inflexible production options affected the sustainability of some local rice farming systems. Whereas the transition to organic farming and the concomitant incorporation of ecological processes and more flexible production options has allowed local farmers to enhance the sustainability of their farming systems by altering the exchange processes within the socio-ecological system.

SP Australasian Plant Pathol Soc
AB A sugarcane farming system based on residue retention, minimum tillage, a leguminous rotation crop and controlled traffic using global positioning system guidance is currently being adopted by the Australian sugar industry because it improves sugar yields, reduces costs and provides additional income from crops such as soybean and peanut. This paper discusses the soil health improvements that are being obtained with this new farming system, particularly its beneficial effects on soil carbon levels and soil biological properties. It also summarises research showing that breaking the sugarcane monoculture with a soybean or peanut crop reduces populations of lesion nematode (Pratylenchus zeae) and root- knot nematode (Meloidogyne javanica), the two most important nematode pests of sugarcane. The role of minimum tillage and inputs of organic matter in enhancing the natural biological control mechanisms that suppress these nematodes is also discussed. The paper then considers the farming system currently used for vegetable crops such as tomato, capsicum and rockmelon, where inadequate crop rotation, excessive tillage, low organic inputs and the fallowing and solarisation effect of covering beds with plastic leads to a situation where soil fumigation is seen as the only option for reducing losses from soilborne pests and pathogens. Since the sugar industry coexists with the vegetable industry in some areas of Australia, the paper argues the case for developing minimum tillage practices for vegetable production and integrating them into the sugarcane farming system. It concludes that a farming system of this nature would improve profitability in both industries, produce better environmental outcomes at a landscape level and provide more sustainable solutions to nematode and soilborne disease problems.

SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB The widespread adoption of soil conservation technologies by farmers (notably contour hedgerows) observed in Guba, Cebu City, Philippines, is not often observed elsewhere In the country. Adoption of these technologies was because of the interaction of such phenomena as site-specific factors, appropriate extension systems, and technologies. However, lack of hedgerow maintenance, decreasing hedgerow quality, and disappearance of hedgerows raised concerns about sustainability. The dynamic nature of upland farming systems suggests the need for a location-specific farming system development framework, which provides farmers with ongoing extension for continual promotion of appropriate conservation practices.

TI Livestock farmers' working conditions in agroecological farming systems.
   A review
SO AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB The livestock farming sector is under stress as fewer and fewer people are willing or able to become livestock farmers. Contributing to the decline in attractiveness of the profession are, among other factors, agricultural crises, higher consumer expectations, and difficult working conditions. Agroecology is a sustainable solution that can maintain livestock production and provide positive contributions to society without negatively affecting the environment. Moreover, in its search for social sustainability, agroecological farming could offer better working conditions to farmers and thus contribute to a sustainable future for the livestock farming sector. Here, we review research on livestock farmers' working conditions in agroecological farming systems. This paper aims to give a comprehensive overview of the available research findings and the dimensions used to describe farmers' working conditions. The major findings are the following: (i) relatively little published research is available; (ii) it is difficult to compare findings across studies as different dimensions are used to study working conditions and, in certain cases, detailed descriptions of the farming systems are not provided; (iii) certain dimensions were rarely addressed, such as farmers' health, or work organization; and (iv) in general, farmers' work is addressed as a component of environmental and economic analyses of the performance of agroecological livestock farming systems, using most often indicators on labor productivity and/or efficiency. Comprehensive multidimensional approaches to study working conditions are lacking, as are studies on the interactions and trade-offs between dimensions (e.g., workload, fulfillment, work organization). To study livestock farmers' working conditions in agroecological farming systems, we recommend to use a comprehensive approach assessing different dimensions contributing to working conditions, combined with the description of farmers' activities and work environment.

SO NO-TILL FARMING SYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE: Challenges and
   Opportunities
AB Agricultural intensification has delivered great gains in terms of food production but has come at great environmental cost. Consequently, there is growing societal demand for more sustainable farming systems, i.e., sustainable intensification. Within this, there is increasing recognition of the ecosystem services provided by soil organisms that contribute both to agricultural production and environmental sustainability. Conventional tillage-based farming systems experience frequent and significant soil disturbance, which negatively impacts many key soil organism groups, e.g., fungi and earthworms. Loss of these soil organisms results in loss of critical soil ecosystem services, including those related to soil nutrient cycling, crop nutrient uptake, and soil water management. Conversion of farming systems from conventional tillage to no-till can allow recovery of soil biology and restoration of soil ecosystem services. Thus, no-till farming systems can contribute positively towards sustainable intensification. However, important knowledge gaps and challenges remain. Greater knowledge of what soil organisms are present in soil and what services they provide is urgently needed. The ultimate goal is to understand how soil biology can be manipulated through management to provide desirable ecosystem services in space and time.

SO LAND USE POLICY
AB The potential contribution of integrated farming systems (IFS) to the development of a more sustainable agriculture has been largely ignored within social science and by policy analysts. The goals of IFS are to sustain agricultural production, maintain farm incomes, safeguard the environment and respond to consumer concerns about food quality issues. IFS can be conceptualised as a 'third way' or middle course for agriculture between conventional and organic farming. This paper describes the origins and basic principles of IFS and positions this distinctive approach to agriculture within the agri-environmental debate. It also explores some of the implications of pursuing this 'third way' for farmers and the institutional and policy frameworks. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The effect of meteorological factors on the productivity of catch crops
   in sustainable and organic farming systems
SO ZEMDIRBYSTE-AGRICULTURE
AB Field experiments were carried out for three years under the conditions of sustainable agriculture at the Lithuanian University of Agriculture's Experimental Station and under the conditions of organic agriculture in Kazli kiai organic farm. The study was aimed to evaluate the effects of climate factors on the productivity of different catch crop species (Trifolium pratense L., Lolium multiflorum Lam., Sinapis alba L., Brassica napus L.) under sustainable and organic farming systems.
   In both farming systems, climate factors had no effect on the productivity of undersown catch crops (red clover and Italian ryegrass). In the organic farming system, winter rape productivity was influenced by the duration of vegetation period (r = 0.89, P < 0.01), that of white mustard by the amount of precipitation (r = 0.81, P < 0.01) and hydrothermal coefficient (HTC) (r = 0.79, P < 0.05). In the sustainable farming system, climate factors had no effect on the productivity of post-harvest catch crops (white mustard and winter rape). The productivity of red clover, Italian ryegrass and winter rape was determined by crop density (strong and very strong correlations were established) in both thrilling systems. In the sustainable farming system, the productivity of the post-harvest catch crop species was more stable than that of the undersown catch crop species as the latter were suppressed by main crop (winter wheat) fertilized with mineral fertilizers and sprayed with pesticides. In the sustainable farming system, the highest dry mass yield obtained in autumn was that of white mustard (0.92 Mg ha(-1)), while the yield of red clover, Italian ryegrass and winter rape was lower - 29.3%, 59.8% and 37.0%, respectively. The yield of the aboveground dry mass in spring of red clover and winter rape was similar - 0.37 and 0.30 Mg ha(-1) respectively. In organic farming the highest yield in autumn was that of red clover 2.38 Mg ha(-1). The yield of Italian ryegrass, white mustard and winter rape was by 4.1, 2.0, 2.4 times in autumn and winter rape was by 1.8 times in spring lower than that of red clover.

SO JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY BIOTECHNOLOGY AND FOOD SCIENCES
AB The objective of this work was to evaluate the free flavonoid content and antioxidant activity of winter wheat white flour, whole grain flour and bran in ecological and integrated farming system in the years 2009-2010. The experiment was established on a scientific research base Dolna Malanta in western Slovakia during the years 2009 and 2010. Content of free flavonoids and antioxidant activity of white flour and whole grain flour was not affected by farming systems. Antioxidant activity of whole grain flour was more effected by a year and by a forecrop. White flour contain two times less free flavonoids and antioxidant activity than whole grain flour. By milling process most of the free flavonoids and other compounds with higher antioxidant activity remain in outer layers of grain.

TI Questioning triple rice intensification on the Vietnamese mekong delta
   floodplains: An environmental and economic analysis of current land-use
   trends and alternatives
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Large areas of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta floodplains (VMDF) are protected by high dikes to facilitate three rice crops per year. While this has increased rice production, there is evidence that triple rice systems have negative long-term effects, both environmental and economic. Double rice cropping, or other alternatives, may be more advantageous. We analyzed the costs and benefits of intensive rice systems over time and compared these with alternatives farming systems, based on data collected via field surveys and interviews with farmers in two provinces in the VMDF. Results show that farmers in areas with dikes high enough for triple rice production incurred rising production costs over time. Production costs were 58%-91% higher in high-dike, triple crop areas, than in low-dike double rice crop areas. Higher production costs are mainly the result of increased fertilizer and pesticide use. Profitability of triple rice farming systems was initially 57% more compared to double crop systems. After about 15 years, however, triple rice farmers earned only 6% more than double crop counterparts. Our results indicate that alternative farming systems, such as rice combined with vegetables, fisheries or other flood based livelihood, could offer greater benefits than intensive rice monocultures. Importantly, these higher benefits can be obtained without the environmental costs and impact currently endured across the delta with triple rice cultivation in high dikes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI STRATEGIES FOR SUSTAINABLE CROP PRODUCTION IN SEMIARID AFRICA
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB This is a record of the experience of a research team attempting to identify a development path for a farming system in semi-arid Africa. The farming system is the largely-subsistence production of crops and livestock by smallholders in the Machakos and Kitui Districts in Eastern Kenya. The region is known locally as Ukambani- "the place where the Kamba people live". This region has a long history in which the food demands of rapidly growing populations have periodically outstripped the productive capacity of the land and current technology. Today, the population pressure on land and its rate of growth are among the highest in the world, and emigration is no longer a feasible solution. But numerous other areas of Africa are not far behind in population pressures and a more sustainable agriculture in this region is important not only for Kenya. Almost certainly, the problems of agriculture in Machakos-Kitui today represent a future scenario for much of semi-arid Africa.
   This article is also concerned with methodology for conducting research on farming systems. While the project was designed according to the concepts of Farming Systems Research (FSR) (Collinson, 1982), the realities of development assistance projects created challenges in implementation. The research also departed from the conventional FSR plan as new possibilities were realized, and with great benefit.
   The outcome is a well-founded hypothesis: contrary to much contemporary wisdom, a strategy of augmenting traditional soil enrichment practices with modest amounts of fertilizer is economically feasible for many farmers and provides the best prospects for food security and sustainable agriculture in this climatic zone.

AB Modern deer farming systems have become increasingly intensive allowing strategic feeding for production and genetic improvement programmes. Meeting feeding standards that account for changing nutritional demands related to seasonality and reproductive state is critical. As the industry matures there is a growing awareness of the balance between retaining natural behaviour in producing breeding stock on larger extensive holdings and intensification systems for performance in young stock. Stocking rates are critical determinants of success as land use and capability needs are matched with an increasing stratification of stock type and purpose. Food product safety and welfare considerations of farmed deer are being driven by consumer demands. Farm quality assurance and codes of practice are developing to ensure that deer farming meets and exceeds international expectations of land use and deer welfare in modern deer farming systems.

TI The impact of water and agriculture policy scenarios on irrigated
   farming systems in Italy: An analysis based on farm level
   multi-attribute linear programming models
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB The objective of this paper is to evaluate the impacts of agriculture and water policy scenarios on the sustainability of selected irrigated farming systems in Italy, in the context of the forthcoming implementation of the directive EC 60/2000. Directive EC 60/2000 (Water Framework Directive) is intended to represent the reference norm regulating water use throughout Europe. Five main scenarios were developed reflecting aspects of agricultural policy, markets and technologies: Agenda 2000, world market, global sustainability, provincial agriculture and local community. These were combined with two water price levels, representing stylised scenarios for water policy. The effects of the scenarios on irrigated systems were simulated using multi-attribute linear programming models representing the reactions of the farms to external variables defined by each scenario. The output of the models consists of economic, social and environmental indicators aimed at quantifying the impact of the scenarios on different aspects of sustainability relevant for irrigated farming systems. Five Italian irrigated farming systems were considered: cereal, rice, fruit, vegetables and citrus. The results show the diversity of irrigated systems and the different effects that water pricing policy may produce depending on the agricultural policy, market and technological scenarios. They also highlight a clear trade-off between socio-economic sustainability and environmental (water, nitrogen, pesticide) sustainability. Water pricing will have, in most cases, less impact than agricultural markets and policy scenarios, though it appears to be an effective instrument for water regulation in the least intensive irrigated systems considered. This emphasises the need for a differentiated application of the Water Framework Directive at the local level as well as a more careful balance of water conservation, agricultural policy and rural development objectives.

AB This paper provides a comprehensive review of literature related to food security. The world food crisis is a threat to all countries, including Indonesia. The problem of food security in Indonesia is still happening, particularly, aspects of production and increasingly unbalanced food availability. Due to the increasing rate of population growth, land functional shift, degradation of land resources and water, as well as environmental pollution and climate change. Food production has not been able to meet the needs of the population continuously. Therefore, the food policy paradigm applied in Indonesia must change from food security to food independence. Thus, Indonesia is not dependent on other countries. Food diversification is one of the best policies to be implemented in achieving food independence and anticipating the food crisis. Food diversification utilizes land optimally by developing an integrated farming system. The integrated farming system is an efficient and environmentally agricultural system. It is able to utilize sustainable agriculture development, followed by the development of participatory technology (Participatory Technology Development) which refers to the local wisdom of the community.

SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB This paper examines the sustainability of shifting cultivation in Sarawak, East Malaysia, through a case study of the responses of two villages to demographic and economic forces during the period from 1979-80 to 1988-89. It is concluded that the farming system of which shifting cultivation is a part (which includes perennial cash crops) is sustainable in two senses: it is resilient to exogenous disturbances; it exhibits a non-negative trend in output. Shifting cultivation makes an important contribution to the overall stability and sustainability of the farming system and should be evaluated on this basis.

SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB A longterm experiment was conducted on Alfisols at Ibadan, Nigeria, to assess agricultural productivity and sustainability of different farming systems. The experiment, conducted for a 10 year period from 1979 to 1988, was implemented in two phases. The effects of methods of land clearing on crop growth-yield were evaluated during Phase I from 1979 to 1982. Effects of different farming systems on agronomic productivity were evaluated in Phase II from 1983 to 1988. Six land clearing-cum-tillage treatments evaluated in Phase I were: (i) manual clearing with no-till, (ii) manual clearing with plow-till, (iii) shearblade clearing with no-till, (iv) treepusher/rootrake clearing with no-till, (v) treepusher/rootrake clearing with plow-till, and (vi) traditional farming. Similarly, six farming systems evaluated in Phase II were: (i) alley cropping with Leucaena leucocephala, (ii) Mucuna fallowing on severely degraded soils (iii) Mucuna fallowing on moderately degraded soil, (iv) ley farming on severely degraded soil, (v) ley farming on moderately degraded soil, and (vi) natural fallow control. In Phase I, yields of maize (Zea mays), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) and cassava (Manihoc esculenta) were higher on manually cleared with no-till and shearblade cleared with no-fill treatments than on other treatments. In Phase II, maize growth was higher on plots with Mucuna fallowing than in alley cropping or ley farming treatments. In contrast, cowpea growth was higher on alley cropped plots. Regardless of the farming system, maize grain yield declined with the cultivation duration. The relative decline in cowpea grain yield with cultivation duration was less than that of maize.

This paper proposed the prototype of the framework, Sustainable Fish-Farming System(SFFS),, which can make the aqua-farming system more sustainable via applying the Internet of things(IOT) to reduce the need of energy for controlling the environment. The SFFS integrates the solar-farm and fish-farm to reduce the extra energy input. In addition, the lighting of LEDs is used to support the photosynthesis in the night-time. This way is more energy-efficient than the traditional pumping. Furthermore, this prototype shows the qualitative availability of SFFS.

TI Using Digestate and Biochar as Fertilizers to Improve Processing Tomato
   Production Sustainability
SO AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB The principal goal of the organic farming system (OFS) is to develop enterprises that are sustainable and harmonious with the environment. Unfortunately, the OFS yields fewer products per land than the non-organic farming system in many agricultural products. The objective of our study was to assess the effects of digestate and biochar fertilizers on yield and fruit quality of processing tomato produced under the OFS. The experiment was carried out in Po Valley, during the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons. Liquid digestate (LD), LD + biochar (LD + BC) and pelleted digestate (PD) were evaluated and compared to biochar (BC) application and unfertilized control. The results showed that plants fertilized with LD + BC recorded the maximum marketable yield (72 t ha(-1)), followed by BC (67 t ha(-1)), PD (64 t ha(-1)) and LD (59 t ha(-1)); while the lowest production (47 t ha(-1)) was recorded in unfertilized plants. Over the two cropping seasons, LD + BC, BC, PD, and LD, increased fruit number per plant (+15%), fruit weight (+24%), Brix t ha(-1) (+41%) and reduced Bostwick index (-16%), if compared to the untreated control. Considering the overall agronomic performances, digestate and biochar can be useful options for increasing yield and quality of processing tomato production in the OFS. Hence, these fertilizers can be assessed in future research both on other crops and farming systems.

In this paper, we use the concept of resilience as a framework to understand how bovine livestock farming systems may adjust to challenging environmental, social, and political conditions. Using an interactive simulation model (microworld), we explored potential developments for livestock farmers in Bourbonnais, France, to the effect of simultaneous changes in the socioeconomic landscape and unpredictable weather conditions resulting from climate change. The results offer insights into the potential trade-offs between systems scale and long-term sustainability by suggesting that sacrificing socioeconomic performance in the short and medium term may increase long-term sustainability and resilience.

TI Against the odds: Network and institutional pathways enabling
   agricultural diversification
SO ONE EARTH
AB Farming systems that support locally diverse agricultural production and high levels of biodiversity are in rapid decline, despite evidence of their benefits for climate, environmental health, and food security. Yet, agricultural policies, financial incentives, and market concentration increasingly constrain the viability of diversified farming systems. Here, we present a conceptual framework to identify novel processes that pro-mote the emergence and sustainability of diversified farming systems, using three real-world examples where farming communities have found pathways to diversification despite major structural constraints. By applying our framework to analyze these bright spots in the United States, Brazil, and Malawi, we identify two distinct pathways-network and institutional-to diversification. These pathways emerge through align-ment of factors related to social and ecological structure (policies, institutions, and environmental conditions) and agency (values, collective action, and management decisions). We find that, when network and institu-tional pathways operate in tandem, the potential to scale up diversification across farms and landscapes in-creases substantially.

TI NIRAVARI: A Parsimonious Bio-Decisional Model for Assessing the
   Sustainability and Vulnerability of Rainfed or Groundwater-Irrigated
   Farming Systems in Indian Agriculture
SO WATER
AB Groundwater irrigation is essential to sustain food production, and aquifer depletion represents a major sustainability challenge for humanity. There is a need for adequate modelling tools to assess the impacts of farming practices on groundwater resources with policy-makers and farmers in different contexts, especially in the case of smallholder farms in the tropics. We introduce the NIRAVARI model, which was designed to represent the Indian farming and water resource context. NIRAVARI is a parsimonious model integrating biophysical and decisional processes dealing with the farming system and the water table processes. A specific focus is given to how to irrigate with multiple water resources. Its formalisms include equations from well-tested published models for soil moisture and plant water stress simulations. The programming and graphic user interface is based on Excel VBA. We illustrate the ability of NIRAVARI to simulate a broad range of farmer adaptation strategies using four scenarios of cropping systems and water resources policies, and therefore, its interest for participatory scenario design and assessment with stakeholders.

TI Energy productivity and efficiency of the 'gher' (prawn-fish-rice)
   farming system in Bangladesh
SO ENERGY
AB 'Gher' farming is a unique system that incorporates the joint operation of three enterprises: freshwater prawn, fish and HYV rice, and is expanding rapidly in the coastal regions of Bangladesh because of its proven high income earning potential. In this paper, the sustainability of this system is evaluated by analysing its performance in terms of energy use by applying a stochastic distance function approach which revealed interesting and unexpected results. The prawn enterprise which is the key income earning component is found to be technically inefficient while the rice enterprise is found to be efficient. The net energy balance and the energy use efficiency of the 'gher' farming system is estimated at 18,510 MJ ha(-1) and 1.72 respectively. The 'gher' farmers are operating at a very high level of technical (energy) efficiency (92%). Diversification amongst enterprises is associated with technical (energy) inefficiency. However, larger operation size enhances efficiency. The key policy implication is that the 'gher' farming system can be sustained in the long run provided that productivity from the rice enterprise remains high. Also, policies to support the expansion of 'gher' farm sizes will improve efficiency. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Economic and ecological evaluation of management measures and or varying
   management systems
SO BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT
AB The effects on income and ecology of an Organic Farming System and an Integrated Crop Cultivation System at the experimental station of the Munich Research Association for Agricultural Ecosystems (FAM), are analysed by a computer based calculation system in the fanning years 1992/93-95/96. In this case the necessary energy-input and the greenhouse gases being emitted (CO2, N2O, CH4) by the different systems were calculated parallel to the variable costs of the different farming measures. Fundamentally this examination shows improvements in both systems to realize a more sustainable agriculture in comparison to the previous state. Nevertheless there are some differences between the systems: On one side the yields in the Integrated Crop Cultivation System were much higher than in the Ecological Farming System in this period. On the other side the Ecological Farming System reached a higher income connected with a lower energy-input and a lower emission of greenhouse gases. The Integrated Crop Cultivation System seems to be preferable, if the discussion is focussed primarily on a high agricultural output in order to save a high level on food supply. But on the average the Ecological Farming System is superior in regard with environmental circumstances. Further studies of the FAM including supplementary ecological indicators will supply more information to these preliminary results. Then it should be possible to implement same of the ecologically compatible and sustainable strategies in the landuse management of the region.

TI Farm-scale models built with farmers converting and converted to organic
   farming
SO AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Intensive livestock farming has recently induced several cases threatening food security. Therefore, redesigning sustainable livestock farming systems is a major challenge for agricultural science. Specifically, farm-scale models that truly integrate different subsystems, viewpoints and time scales are needed. Up to now, however, no modelling approach has been able to meet these requirements. In previous work, we have designed a participatory modelling method based on causal mapping to help farmer groups redesign their livestock farming systems. Two causal maps have been built with two neighbouring groups of dairy farmers converting and converted to organic farming. It was the first time that consistent wholes had been made of elements cited by farmers faced with a redesign process. This article describes the content of the causal maps, with a focus on the current issue of integrating multiple subsystems, viewpoints and time scales within the same farm-scale model. We found that the maps included items at the whole farm scale and from a variety of disciplinary viewpoints and time scales. This finding indicates that these characteristics are useful in modelling approaches for redesigning farming systems. In addition, both maps closely linked herd operations to the forage system in a cluster centered on the feeding-health-production complex. This result suggests that the feeding-health-production complex requires particular attention for organic conversion of dairy farms. Lastly, novel relations were identified in the maps that linked work organisation and farm configuration to reproductive performance. This finding shows that analysing work organisation helps understanding how biotechnical performance evolves in a farming system.

TI Rain water harvesting, agroforestry and goat based intensification for
   livelihood resilience in drought prone rainfed smallholder farming
   system: a case for semi-arid tropics
SO AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB Rainfed areas are the home of millions of resource poor farmers whose livelihood is under continuous threat due to frequent droughts. Assuring double cropping and imparting livelihood resilience to rainfed smallholders is a challenge. A study was planned in this direction during 2013-2021 for livelihood resilience and sustainable intensification of rainfed smallholder farming systems through rain water harvesting and agroforestry based interventions. The one hectare rainfed farming system model comprising of rain water harvesting farm pond (25 m x 20 m x 2.5 m), less water requiring food crops (groundnut-barley and sorghum-chickpea), agrihorticulture [Ziziphus mauritiana + (Sesamum indicum-Cicer arietinum)], silvipasture (Leucaena leucocephala + Tri-species hybrid grass + Stylosanthes hamata) and boundary plantation (Leucaena leucocephala and Opuntia ficus-indica) was evaluated at on-station as well as promoted on-farm. The goat rearing potential of the above model was also estimated under intensive and semi-intensive systems. The on-station rainfed farming system module produced 4979 kg ha(-1) barley equivalent yield consisting of multiple products like barley, chickpea, groundnut, Indian jujube fruits, sesame, fodder (sorghum, TSH, Stylosanthes, Leucaena dried leaf meal and spine-less fodder cactus cladodes) and Grewia fruits and resulted in 655 US$ year(-1) net returns with a benefit cost ratio of 2.1. The carrying capacity of the above model was found to be 9 and 35 goat year(-1) under intensive and semi-intensive rearing systems, respectively. The net returns increased by 36 and 226% with the inclusion of goat under intensive (US$ 892) and semi-intensive rearing system (US$ 2136), respectively in the rainfed farming system model. It was evident from the study that inclusion of goat, agroforestry and farm pond for rain water harvesting in the rainfed farming have resulted in higher profitability and resilience to less rainfall and its aberrations. Contrarily, the on-farm observations revealed that farmers could not take winter season crops without rain water harvesting. The rain water harvesting proved to be the key for reducing chances of crop failures due to droughts, ensuring double cropping (cropping intensity up to 200%) and sustainable intensification in rainfed areas. It can be concluded from the present study that intervention of water harvesting, agroforestry and goat in rainfed farming systems could enhance the farm productivity and profitability and impart resilience to the livelihood of rainfed farmers in semi-arid tropics.

TI NITROGEN LEACHING IN ECOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE - SUMMARY AND
   RECOMMENDATIONS
SO BIOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE & HORTICULTURE
CT Workshop on Nitrogen Leaching
CY OCT, 1993
CL ROYAL VET & AGR UNIV, COPENHAGEN, DENMARK
HO ROYAL VET & AGR UNIV
AB In October 1993 an international workshop on nitrogen leaching in ecological agriculture was held at the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University in Copenhagen, Denmark. This paper summarizes the discussion at the workshop and outlines recommendations and conclusions. The paper identifies key factors of major importance to a consideration of nitrogen leaching from ecological agriculture. These are: the farming systems approach: management of nitrogen resources at the farm and field level; the research methodology adopted to study nitrogen leaching; and finally the need to consider the problem of nitrogen leaching from a rotational perspective taking account of the heavy reliance on N fertilizers of conventional systems, which in turn leads to environmental, social and ethical problems. It is recommended to emphasize research work aimed at improving and developing ecological farming systems, in order to improve the ability of ecological agriculture to meet defined agronomic, economic, environmental, social and ethical criteria. Furthermore, it is recommended to encourage initiation of research in nitrogen supply and cycling in ecological farming systems and to organize further workshops aimed at intensifying cooperation and exchange in research work. It is concluded that there is a considerable potential for ecological farming systems to offer a viable approach to limit nitrate leaching whilst also meeting the requirements of broader goals of sustainability.

   Agricultural Industry
SO AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB The agricultural sector is a vital source of human well-being that provides the necessities of daily life. A variety of farming systems are utilized in agriculture, such as a wide range of tillage options, no-till, agroforestry, precision farming, organic farming, cover cropping, crop rotations, etc. Each of these farming systems has unique challenges, and nanotechnology has successfully improved on many of them. Agricultural applications of nanotechnology include nanofertilizers, nanopesticides, nanosensors, nanobiotechnology, and nanoremediation. This study focuses on the application of nano-farming technologies to different farming systems. Suggested practices include nano improvement of soil quality, crop nano-protection under biotic stress, nanoremediation of polluted soil and water environments, nanomanagement of agro-wastes, nano-agrochemicals, nano-precision farming, and nanobiotechnology for modern farming. This review also addresses expected problems that may occur due to over application of nanomaterials to farming systems, such as nanopollution and nanotoxicity of agroecosystem compartments. Several dimensions are emphasized in this study, such as green energy, sustainable development, the circular bioeconomy, land biodegradation, pollution, and the one health approach, as essential for the global goals of sustainable development. Nanofarming presents both benefits and obstacles to human life. The exact balance between these benefits and challenges needs more study.

TI Approaches to improve soil fertility in sub-Saharan Africa
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
AB Soil fertility provides the foundation for nutritious food production and resilient and sustainable livelihoods. A comprehensive survey and summit meeting were conducted with the aims of understanding barriers to enhancing soil fertility in sub-Saharan Africa and providing evidence-based recommendations. The focus regions were West Africa, East Africa, the Great Lakes region, and Ethiopia. Overall recommendations were developed with four emerging themes: (1) strengthening inorganic fertilizer-based systems, (2) access to and use of quality organic inputs, (3) capacity building along the entire knowledge-transfer value chain, and (4) strengthening farming systems research and development across biophysical and socio-economic factors. The evidence-based process and methodology for prioritizing these recommendations makes these findings useful for setting out action plans for future investments and strategies. Access to inorganic fertilizer, its use, and related implementation issues were prominent considerations; nevertheless, biophysical and socio-economic barriers and solutions were identified as equally important to building soil fertility and natural resources. Soil management initiatives should focus on providing holistic solutions covering both biophysical and socio-economic aspects along the entire value chain of actors and creating an enabling environment for adoption. A broader view of soil fertility improvement using all available options including both inorganic and organic sources of nutrients and farming system approaches are highly recommended.

TI Biostimulants and cherry rootstock increased tomato fruit yield and
   quality in sustainable farming systems
SO ITALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
AB Nowadays one of the main challenges in agriculture is to increase crop yield and quality in a sustainable way. Organic farming system (OFS) is considered more eco-friendly than the conventional farming system (CFS). However, cash crops showed a reduced yield when cultivated in OFS, and among them processing tomato reported the highest yield gap between OFS and CFS. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate, both in greenhouse and field experiments, the combined effects of a cherry rootstock, genotype 'Tomito', and the applications of different microbial biostimulants (single species and consortia). The agronomic performance of a commercial processing tomato genotype, 'H3402', was assessed in order to increase fruit yield and quality in sustainable farming systems. In greenhouse experiment, the use of 'Tomito' as rootstock highlighted both the highest plant height (35 cm) and leaf chlorophyll content (25.20), while plants inoculated with A. brasiliensis showed the highest number of flowers (4.5). In field experiment, the combined use of grafting and microbial biostimulants increased marketable (on average 2.3 kg plant(-1)) and total yields (on average 2.5 kg plant-1) in comparison with the genotype 'H3402'. All the investigated treatments reduced the number of fruits affected by blossom-end rot (on average -4.7 fruits plant-1), and A. brasiliensis also improved the fruit solid soluble content, recording values of 6.23 degrees Brix and 3.54 of Brix t ha(-1).

SO AQUACULTURE INTERNATIONAL
AB The extensive zero-water exchange shrimp farming system in the periphery of Chilka lagoon (Orissa, India) was studied. The study aimed to describe this unique farming system with special reference to dynamics of macrozoobenthos, production characteristics and economics. The study conducted was based on a general survey as well as monitoring of five individual farms over a complete production cycle. The fanning practice in this area is characterized by complete absence of water exchange during rearing. Ponds in this area are generally shallow (mean 72 cm). Most of the water and soil quality characteristics of these farms are within acceptable levels. Macrozoobenthos belonging to 12 taxa were collected, amphipods (81%) and polychaetes (13%) being most numerous. Overall macrobenthic density of farms studied varied from 968 to 11,470 individuals/m(2) with a gross mean of 5644 individuals/m(2). There was no general pattern to the variation in abundance of various taxa in different phases of the rearing cycle, suggesting a low predatory pressure by shrimp in the farms studied. Shrimp production was highly variable (91-250 kg/ha), but generally low with a mean of 145 kg/ha. The net income of these farms was estimated to be Rs. 63,250 per crop per ha. Compared with shrimp farming system with regular water exchange in the same area, Chilka farms generated high benefit-cost ratio indicating high profitability and sustainability.

AB The increasing environmental awareness of the actors of agro-food supply chains has led to the implementation of new tools to analyze the impacts generated during agricultural practices. The impacts depend not only on the production system but also on the farmer's management choices, in terms of input allocation, and on the production site, in terms of soil and climate conditions. In order to assess the environmental impact of conventional and organic farming systems on citrus growing in Italy and Spain, a life cycle assessment method has been implemented. The results show the organic system to be more sustainable than conventional and they could be useful indicators for correcting and modifying agricultural practices.

AB Participatory methods are a key element in the approach to agricultural development known as Farming Systems Research (FSR). The approach has evolved in developing countries over 20 years, but until recently, FSR has received only token support in developed countries. Recent interest in FSR in Australia has focused mainly on technology adoption, whilst participatory approaches have also been embraced by the "Landcare" movement. In neither case has there been any consistent emphasis on research to advance scientific understanding or develop new technology.
   This paper describes a new approach to FSR in Australia, prompted by the need to develop and employ farming practices which are demonstrably sustainable.
   Farming systems research is conceived of as a learning or innovation system, in which researchers, farmers and farm advisers, collaborate in the continuous improvement of farming systems to achieve twin goals of profitability and sustainability.
   Farmers in the northern grain-growing region of Australia, and the Australian Government, have each committed over $4 million to an FSR program based on the principles outlined here. The paper describes the theoretical basis for the program and its operational management, as well as outlining the difficulties encountered in implementing the plan.

TI A METHODIC PATHWAY TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE FARMING SYSTEMS
SO LANDBOUWTIJDSCHRIFT-REVUE DE L AGRICULTURE
AB A methodic pathway is suggested for the definition, elaboration, evaluation and introduction of farming systems based on an 'integrated' or an 'ecosystem-oriented' vision, both considered more sustainable than a 'worldmarket-oriented' vision. The objectives of these three basic types of systems are defined in measurable terms with respect to the major social values or interests supported or adversely influenced by agriculture. For each type of systems a strategy is assessed through which the objectives can be achieved while avoiding their conflicts. Arable farming is taken as an example of the elaboration, evaluation and introduction of integrated and ecosystem-oriented systems. It is discussed how prototype systems can be developed on an experimental farm, evaluated with a pilot-group of farmers and dispersed on a large scale. For the short term it is recommended to focus research and policy on integrated farming systems, as an urgent compromise between socio-economical and socio-ecological interests. For the long term it is recommended to develop ecosystem-oriented farming systems to solve the agricultural crisis in a more comprehensive and sustainable way.

TI Oh my darling clementine: heterogeneous preferences for sustainable
   citrus fruits
SO RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS
AB The current study assesses consumer preferences toward different production methods of clementines (Citrus clementina). Based on a survey of Italian urban individuals (N = 345), responsible for household food purchases, it investigates whether clementines produced by means of integrated farming system are perceived as a desirable alternative to organic and conventional fruits. A conjoint analysis was applied to estimate the mean relative importance of three different clementine attributes (namely, price, production method and presence of a geographical indication) and consumer utility attached to the different attribute levels. Results revealed price as the most important attribute; while only organic farming provided positive utility to consumers. Subsequently, the sample was clustered into four distinct market segments based on part-worth estimates, offering useful insights for practitioners and policy makers to design tailor-made interventions aimed at fostering sustainable clementines consumption.

TI Microbial taxonomic, nitrogen cycling and phosphorus recycling community
   composition during long-term organic greenhouse farming
SO FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
AB Understanding the interplay between the farming system and soil microbiomes could aid the design of a sustainable and efficient farming system. A comparative greenhouse experiment consisting of organic (ORG), integrated (INT) and conventional (CON) farming systems was established in northern China in 2002. The effects of 12 years of organic farming on soil microbiomes were explored by metagenomic and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing analyses. Long-term ORG shifted the community composition of dominant phyla, especially Acidobacteria, increased the relative abundance of Ignavibacteria and Acidobacteria Gp6 and decreased the relative abundance of Nitrosomonas, Bacillus and Paenibacillus. Metagenomic analysis further revealed that relative abundance of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms (Bacteria and Archaea) and anaerobic ammonium oxidation bacteria decreased during ORG. Conversely, the relative abundance of bacteria-carrying periplasmic nitrate reductases (napA) was slightly higher for ORG. Long-term organic farming also caused significant alterations to the community composition of functional groups associated with ammonia oxidation, denitrification and phosphorus recycling. In summary, this study provides key insights into the composition of soil microbiomes and long-term organic farming under greenhouse conditions.

TI Control of crop diseases through Integrated Crop Management to deliver
   climate-smart farming systems for low- and high-input crop production
SO PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB Crop diseases affect crop yield and quality and cause significant losses of total food production worldwide. With the ever-increasing world population and decreasing land and water resources, there is a need not only to produce more food but also to reduce agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to mitigate climate change and avoid land use change and biodiversity loss. Thus, alternative climate-smart farming systems need to adapt to produce more food per hectare in a more sustainable way than conventional high-input farming systems. In addition to breeding new high-yielding cultivars adapted to future climates, there is a need to deploy Integrated Crop Management (ICM) strategies, relying less on synthetic inputs for fertilization and crop protection and less on fossil fuel-powered machinery to decrease yield losses due to pest and pathogens and guarantee food security. In this review, we compare some low-input farming systems to conventional agricultural systems with a focus on ICM solutions being developed to reduce synthetic inputs; these include crop genetic resistance to pathogens, intercropping, canopy architecture manipulation, and crop rotation. These techniques have potential to decrease crop disease frequency and severity by decreasing amounts and dispersal of pathogen inoculum and by producing microclimates that are less favourable for pathogen development, while decreasing GHG emissions and improving environmental sustainability. More research is needed to determine the best deployment of these ICM strategies in various cropping systems to maximize yield, crop protection, and other ecosystem services to address trade-offs between climate change and food security.

TI The changing role of agriculture in Dutch society
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
AB Dutch agriculture has undergone significant changes in the past century, similar to many countries in the European Union. Due to economics of scale and in order to remain economically profitable, it became necessary for farmers to increase farm size, efficiency and external inputs, While minimizing labour use per hectare. The latter has resulted in fewer people working in the agricultural sector. Consequently, Dutch society gradually lost its connection to agricultural production. This divergence resulted in a poor image for the agricultural sector, because of environmental Pollution, homogenization of the landscape, outbreaks of contagious animal diseases and reduced animal welfare. Although the general attitude towards agriculture seems to have improved slightly in recently cars, there is still a long way to go in regaining this trust.
   In order to keep the Dutch countryside viable, farmers are considered indispensable. However, their methods of production should match the demands of society in terms of sustainability. This applies both to farming systems that are used in a monofunctional way (production only) and to multifunctional farming systems. For researchers involved in development of these farming systems, this requires new capabilities; contrary to the Situation in the past, citizens and stakeholder groups now demand involvement in the design of farming systems. In the Current paper, it is suggested that. besides traditional mainstream agriculture, other alternative farming systems Should be developed and implemented. Hence, Dutch agricultural research Should remain focused on the cutting edge of economy and society. Despite all efforts, not all of these newly developed systems will acquire a position within the agricultural spectrum. However, some of the successful ones may prove extremely valuable.

SO FISHERIES SCIENCE
AB The Mekong Delta of Vietnam is a region rich in aquatic resources with high potential for aquacultural development. Aquaculture in the Mekong Delta is often practiced in combination with other agricultural activities such as animal husbandry and rice cultivation, and is an important factor in improving living standards among impoverished farmers. In addition, the conversion of unproductive rice land to the alternative farming of marine shrimp-rice production is expanding rapidly and helping to raise income levels of farmers engaging in rice production. Other examples of aquaculture systems are also discussed.

TI Productive Performances of Slow-Growing Chicken Breeds and Their Crosses
   with a Commercial Strain in Conventional and Free-Range Farming Systems
SO ANIMALS
AB Simple Summary Poultry farming is set to expand in the future, and consumers are requiring more sustainable and ethical products. Free-range farming systems produce high-quality meat and also present added value in terms of welfare, sustainability, small-scale farmers' development, and ethical farming. Local chicken breeds should be used in organic and free-range farming, but they have long growth periods. As found in the present study, crossbreeding could improve growth results, thus safeguarding local chicken biodiversity. Local chicken breeds play a vital role in promoting sustainability by preserving genetic diversity, enhancing resilience, and supporting local economies. These breeds are adapted to local climates and conditions, requiring fewer external resources and inputs for their maintenance. By conserving and utilizing local chicken breeds, sustainable farming practices can be incentivized, maintaining ecosystem balance and ensuring food security for future generations. The present study aimed at evaluating the growth performance and slaughter traits of two local Italian chicken breeds (Bionda Piemontese and Robusta Maculata) and their crosses with a medium-growth genotype (Sasso chicken(& REG;)) reared in conventional and free-range farming systems. The conventional system used a high-energy high-protein diet in a closed barn with controlled temperature, humidity, and lighting, and a stocking density of 33 kg/m(2). The free-range system used a low-input diet (low-energy low-protein diet composed of local and GMO-free feed ingredients), uncontrolled environmental conditions, and a stocking density of 21 kg/m(2) in a barn with free access to an outdoor area. The birds were slaughtered at 84 days of age in both systems. The crossbred chickens showed the best results for growth performance in both farming systems compared to local breeds. Within genotype, the final live weight of chickens was similar in the two farming systems. In conclusion, slow-growth crossbreeds should be used in alternative farming systems, demonstrating better performance than pure local breeds.

TI The Role of Selected Ecosystem Services in Different Farming Systems in
   Poland Regarding the Differentiation of Agricultural Land Structure
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The functioning of various agroecosystems is nowadays shaped by different farming systems, which may impair their functions, as well as being beneficial to them. The benefits include ecosystem services, defined as economic and noneconomic values gained by humans from ecosystems, through supporting soil formation and nutrient circulation, and the impact of agriculture on climate and biodiversity. Their mutual flow and various disturbances depend on the agroecosystem's management method, which is associated with the type of management of agricultural land (AL) in individual farms. This paper raises a problem of transformation in the structure of three main farming systems in Poland, in 2004-2018, in relation to the implementation of 16 selected ecosystem services and their scale. Special attention was given to organic farming, as the most environmentally friendly and sustainable. The analysis demonstrates the increase in ALs in that type of production during the analyzed period of time. Disparities of transformation associated with the type of agricultural system were noticeable at the regional level, which were presented in 16 Polish voivodeships. The results of the analysis confirm that the organic system, which is an important carrier of various ecosystem services, gained a stable position. Moreover, areas with integrated farming still do not exceed 0.5% of total agricultural lands in such voivodeships. The analysis of factors influencing the deterioration or disappearance of selected environmental services characterizing agricultural systems indicates the need to depart from an intensive conventional management system.

AB The sustainability of livestock farming systems (LFS) in relation to climate change, population dynamics, food security and provision of agro-ecosystem services has become a central issue of public and scientific debate. Mediterranean pasture-based LFS differ from industrial systems in terms of utilization of natural resources, inputs use and production; besides, the socio-economic, environmental and cultural context is different and so they are the key factors affecting their sustainability. The objective of this paper is to describe a methodological process to select, measure and integrate relevant indicators into a holistic evaluation framework of sustainability for pasture-based LFS. First, we identify critical points of sustainability using a participatory SWOT analysis. Second, we describe, measure and classify indicators according to different systemic attributes of farming systems (productivity, stability/resilience, adaptability, equity, self-reliance) and pillars of sustainability (economic, social, environmental). Third, we illustrate the integration of these indicators into a global evaluation framework called MESMIS, using for this purpose a case study of Spanish sheep farming systems.

TI Organic farming enhances soil microbial abundance and activity-A
   meta-analysis and meta-regression
SO PLOS ONE
AB Population growth and climate change challenge our food and farming systems and provide arguments for an increased intensification of agriculture. A promising option is eco-functional intensification through organic farming, an approach based on using and enhancing internal natural resources and processes to secure and improve agricultural productivity, while minimizing negative environmental impacts. In this concept an active soil microbiota plays an important role for various soil based ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling, erosion control and pest and disease regulation. Several studies have reported a positive effect of organic farming on soil health and quality including microbial community traits. However, so far no systematic quantification of whether organic farming systems comprise larger and more active soil microbial communities compared to conventional farming systems was performed on a global scale. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis on current literature to quantify possible differences in key indicators for soil microbial abundance and activity in organic and conventional cropping systems. All together we integrated data from 56 mainly peer-reviewed papers into our analysis, including 149 pairwise comparisons originating from different climatic zones and experimental duration ranging from 3 to more than 100 years. Overall, we found that organic systems had 32% to 84% greater microbial biomass carbon, microbial biomass nitrogen, total phospholipid fatty-acids, and dehydrogenase, urease and protease activities than conventional systems. Exclusively the metabolic quotient as an indicator for stresses on microbial communities remained unaffected by the farming systems. Categorical subgroup analysis revealed that crop rotation, the inclusion of legumes in the crop rotation and organic inputs are important farming practices affecting soil microbial community size and activity. Furthermore, we show that differences in microbial size and activity between organic and conventional farming systems vary as a function of land use (arable, orchards, and grassland), plant life cycle (annual and perennial) and climatic zone. In summary, this study shows that overall organic farming enhances total microbial abundance and activity in agricultural soils on a global scale.

TI Closing the knowledge gap: How the USDA could tap the potential of
   biologically diversified farming systems
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE FOOD SYSTEMS AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
AB Modern agriculture has proven highly productive, yet has simultaneously generated environmental and social impacts of global concern. Pressing environmental issues call into question the ability of the current model of industrial agriculture to sustain adequate yields without undermining the natural resource base upon which it depends. Meanwhile, global food needs are projected to double by 2050, raising questions over the need to further intensify agricultural production. Current research demonstrates that biologically diversified farming systems can meet global food needs sustainably and efficiently, as they outperform chemically managed monocultures across a wide range of globally important ecosystem services while producing sufficient yields and reducing resource waste throughout the food system. Research and development related to diversified systems, however, commands less than two percent of public agricultural research funding. We argue that this "knowledge gap" is at the crux of the "yield gap" that is often raised as the impediment to transitioning a greater share of global agriculture to diversified, agroecological production. If United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) research, education, and extension were to shift significantly toward agroecology and biologically diversified farming systems, the potential to address global resource challenges would be enormous. Here we present a broad framework for how the USDA could use existing infrastructure to address the challenges of food and farming in the twenty-first century and beyond.

TI Water-use efficiency of alternative pig farming systems in Vietnam
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Livestock production in tropical countries consumes significant amounts of water for cooling and washing facilities and releases large amounts of wastewater to the environment, resulting in water scarcity and pollution. However, improving water-use efficiency (WUE) at the livestock farm level has received little attention in current research. This study measures the WUE of pig farms in Vietnam, a tropical Southeast Asian country. There, livestock production consists of three farming systems: industrial farms (IFs), semi-industrial farms (SIFs), and traditional farms (TFs). This study compares the WUE of these farming systems, suggests which of the systems is most sustainable, and proposes solutions to improve the WUE of each system. The results of surveying 247 pig farms and applying data envelopment analysis show that the free use of groundwater resources causes a low average WUE of 52%. IFs (closed pigpens) have the highest WUE, followed by TFs and SIFs (open pigpens). This finding confirms the sustainability of IFs over other types of farming. Furthermore, using Tobit models, we analyze the determinants of the WUE within each farming system. The results show that shortening the fattening phase and decreasing the floor space allowance per pig increase the WUE of TFs and SIFs. In addition, decreasing the depth of the puddles in pigpens and the frequency with which these puddles are drained improve the WUE of IFs. These results suggest a need to revise the design of pigpens in order to reduce water use related to washing and cooling.

SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB In a small-scale resource-poor farm, modest increments in productivity are no longer sufficient to justify the investment of scarce resources. Integrated farming systems with Multiple enterprises pave the way for realizing increased productivity, profitability and sustainability in small farms of the developing countries. A study conducted at Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India from July 2000 to March 2002 to optimize enterprise combination, increase employment and bring about maximum bioresource utilization and residue recycling for a 1-ha farm of the dryland tract of the western zone of Tamil Nadu compared four farming systems combinations: FS2 (crop + pigeon + goat + agroforestry + farm pond), FS3 (crop + pigeon + buffalo + agroforestry + farm pond), and FS4 (crop + pigeon + goat + buffalo + agroforestry + farm pond) with FS1 (sorghum only) which served as the reference system. The results indicated the following: crop (0.80 ha) fertilized with buffalo manure produced on the farm, with pigeon (10 pairs on 0.01 ha), goat (5:1 female:male on 0.02 ha), buffalo (2 milking buffaloes + 1 calf on 0.03 ha), agroforestry (0.10 ha) and farm pond (0.04 ha) was the profitable system enterprise that generated higher employment year-round. This system also facilitated the maximum recycling of resources and residues generated on the farm among the enterprises. The output and the waste of one enterprise served as input to another. The nutritive value of the system in terms of carbohydrate, protein and fat was also highest with this enterprise combination. Thus, FS4 seems to be the best enterprise combination as revealed by the physical indicators. However, since the purchase and maintenance of buffalo enterprise involves higher costs, for farmers who have limited cash for investment, linkage of crop (0.80 ha) with pigeon (10 pairs on 0.01 ha), goat (5:1 female: mate on 0.05 ha), agroforestry (0.10 ha) and farm pond (0.04 ha) is suggested as the alternative farming system for sustainability instead of conventional cropping alone.

TI Alternative approaches to therapeutics and subtherapeutics for
   sustainable poultry production
SO POULTRY SCIENCE
AB The world population is growing rapidly and thus its demand for food is growing as well. To meet the demand of the ever-increasing number of consumers, the poultry industry and both of its main sectors-con-ventional and organic/cage-free farming-are expanding in parallel. Due to increasing demand of poultry prod-ucts and higher mortality rate of chicks (an average 0.3% increase of mortality over last 5 yr), both conven-tional and organic poultry farming systems struggle with various issues; animal welfare, environmental sus-tainability, and antibiotic resistance of the prevailing zoonotic/enteric pathogens are common issues for con-ventional farming whereas slow growth rate, higher costs, inefficient land use, different diseases of the chicken, and cross-contamination with bacterial patho-gens into the final products are the major issues for organic poultry farming. On top of these issues, the use of subtherapeutic antibiotics was recently banned in conventional farming systems and by definition the organic farming system cannot use the antibiotics/syn-thetic chemicals even for therapeutic use. In conven-tional farming system, use of therapeutic antibiotics may result in residuals antibiotics in the final products. As a result, sustainable alternatives are in demand to mitigate the prevailing issues for both conventional and organic farming. Potential alternatives may include bac-teriophages, vaccination, probiotics, plant-derived prebiotics, and synbiotics. These alternatives have bene-ficial attributes and shortcomings of their use in both conventional and organic poultry production system. In this review, we'll discuss the scope of these potential alternatives as therapeutics and subtherapeutics in sus-tainable poultry production and ways to improve their efficacy.

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The European Union green deal has proposed the "organic farming action plan" to render a farming system that is more sustainable and adaptable in terms of climate change mitigation and thus enable meeting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs). While this policy instrument is fundamental to achieving sustainable agriculture, there is still no agreement on what sustainable agriculture is and how to measure it. This opinion paper proposes an ecosystem-based framework for the crop life cycle to determine the balance between the economic, social, and environmental pillars of sustainability toward supporting decision-making.

TI Resource recycling and their management under integrated farming system
   for lowlands of Bihar
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
AB A field experiment was conducted at main farm of ICAR Research Complex for Eastern Region, Patna during 2007-10 to study resource recycling from different IFS models and to identify a suitable combination of components for maximum returns and employment generation. under lowland situation of Bihar. Different combination of crop, animals, fishes and birds were examined in form of seven integrated farming systems (IFS) models. Among different IFS models crop + fish + duck + goat emerged as the best integrated farming system in terms of productivity, sustainability index (0.80%), net return ((sic) 1 59 485/year) and employment generation (752 man-days/year) apart from addition of appreciable quantity of N, P2O5 and K2O into the system in form of recycled animal and plant wastes. Crop + fish +duck + goat and crop + fish + cattle integration recorded nearly equal amount of rice- grain-equivalent yield. (21.20 and 21.18 tonnes/ha, respectively) but in terms of economics crop + fish +duck + goat supersedes by (sic) 30 870. The waste material/by products of crops and animals were recycled and used as inputs for other components of integrated farming system. Crop + fish + cattle model added higher quantity of N P and K overall other models.

TI Major nutrient balances in small-scale vegetable farming systems in
   peri-urban areas in China
SO NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS
AB Balances of major nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) in small-scale farming systems are of critical importance to nutrient management and sustainable agricultural development. Mass balances of N, P, and K and some of their influencing factors were studied for two years from July 2003 to July 2005 on small-scale vegetable-farming systems in two contrasting peri-urban areas (Nanjing and Wuxi) of the Yangtze river delta region of China. This balance approach considered organic fertilizer inputs (cow manure, pig manure, and human biosolids), inorganic fertilizer inputs (urea, composite fertilizer, and phosphates), irrigation water, and atmospheric deposition; and considered outputs by vegetables. Input via organic fertilizers was significant for all element balances in the Nanjing area. Inorganic and organic fertilizer, particularly inorganic fertilizer, contributed major nutrient inputs to the system in the Wuxi area. Compared with nutrient output by vegetables, there were significant surpluses of N and P on two vegetable farm systems. Furthermore, N surplus in the Nanjing area was higher than that in the Wuxi area with an inverse relationship to P surplus. In contrast, the general trend of K balances was negative on both sites; hence, the nutrient use efficiency was significantly lower for N and P than K. The nutrient imbalance may be attributed to the differences between fertilizer types and management modes driven by social economic status differences among farmer households. The large N and P net excess creates an environmental threat because of potential losses to ground or surface waters, whereas negative K balance creates soil fertility risks. The results highlight researchers' and farmers' need to develop rational fertilization technology to optimize nutrient management on vegetable farmlands to promote sustainable agricultural development in peri-urban areas.

TI Multi-disciplinary approaches suggest profitable and sustainable farming
   systems for valley floors at risk of salinity
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
CT Conference on Salinity Solutions
CY AUG, 2004
CL Bendigo, AUSTRALIA
AB Australia's traditional approach to salinity abatement has been to focus primarily on the control of recharge in land not at risk of salinity by incorporating deep-rooted perennial plants ( e. g. lucerne, oil mallees and farm trees) into farming systems throughout the landscape. However, in the broad valley floors and sedimentary plains of Australia's cropping regions ( the areas most at risk of salinity), recharge is mainly a 1-dimensional process. Thus, offsite recharge management may have little or no impact on salinity outcomes for the areas at risk. The future of the broad valley floors will be most influenced by the management decisions of landholders in the valley floors.
   To be sustainable and profitable, farming systems on valley floors need to (i) target perennial plants to the valley floors and improve soil management to dry the root-zone, decrease recharge and minimise capillary rise, (ii) increase the discharge of groundwater from valley floors using deep drains and stands of perennial plants, (iii) improve surface water management to ameliorate waterlogging, inundation and flooding, and (iv) incorporate better plants and better agronomic methods in the growth of profitable salt tolerant crops and fodder plants.
   This paper will illustrate the convergence of new research and development that offers real prospects of low risk, high return farming systems for Australia's threatened valley floors. We argue that there needs to be a major refocus by farmers, researchers and their funders in the development of profitable sustainable farming systems for valley floors.

TI Livestock in irrigated farming systems of Uttar Pradesh
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES
AB The study was taken up to work out an economic potential of livestock in irrigated farming systems of western Uttar Pradesh. The study based on 197 farmers of different size groups i.e. 63 marginal (<1 ha), 66 small (>1 to 2), 44 medium (>2 to 4 ha) and 25 large (>4 ha) randomly selected from 4 blocks of Bagpat and Ghaziabad district of Uttar Pradesh. On the whole the farmers in comparison to 1.82 buffalo out of 4.35 total animals kept, these were 0.58 crossbred cows clearly showed that crossbred breeding programme needs a special attention in the area. Most of the credit was disbursed toward crop cultivation. The employment from livestock activities was inversely related to farm size. Livestock constitutes about 39% of total income of marginal farmers while its share was only about 8% for large farmers. It indicated that the dairy business has wide scope on all farm size categories. Elasticity of coefficients in general varied from 0.096 for fertilizer consumption to 0.282 for area under other crops i.e. cereals, pulses, oilseeds and fodder etc. Elasticity coefficients for dairy animals were significantly positive for all size of farms indicating very good scope of livestock for increasing farm income. Fragmentation and subdivision of land holding, scarcities of tabour, low yield of local seeds, less reliable market in context of changing global market, scarcity of owned fund exogenous factors like, dependence of natural resources, global warming, non availability of good quality seeds (variety and breeds) and shades for animals, poultry etc. were major constraints in following integrated farming system. Farmers were agreeing that integrated farming system maintain suitable production system without damaging resource base/environment. It provides family employment throughout the year. It enables recycling the waste with in farming system and provides balance food ultimately a good approach for improving standards of living by increasing resource use efficiency and income generation round the year. Farmers may be encouraged for commercializing dairy activity by providing credit, marketing and high productive dairy animals.

TI Life cycle assessment of Swiss farming systems: II. Extensive and
   intensive production
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB Extensive or low-input farming is considered a way of remedying many problems associated with intensive farming practices. But do extensive farming systems really result in a clear reduction in environmental impacts, especially if their lower productivity is taken into account? This question is studied for Swiss arable cropping and forage production systems in a comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) study.
   Three long-term experiments (DOC experiment comparing bio-dynamic, bio-organic and conventional farming, the "Burgrain" experiment including integrated intensive, integrated extensive and organic systems and the "Oberacker" experiment with conventional ploughing and no-till soil cultivation, are considered in the LCA study. Furthermore, model systems for arable crops and forage production for feeding livestock are investigated by using the Swiss Agricultural Life Cycle Assessment method (SALCA).
   The analysis covers an overall extensification of cropping systems and forage production on the one hand and a partial extensification of fertiliser use, plant protection and soil cultivation on the other. The overall extensification of an intensively managed system reduced environmental impacts in general, both per area unit and per product unit. In arable cropping systems medium production intensity gave the best results for the environment, and the intensity should not fall below the environmental optimum in order to avoids deterioration of eco-efficiency. In grassland systems, on the contrary, a combination of both intensively and extensively managed plots was preferable to medium intensity practices on the whole area. The differences in yield, production intensity and environmental impact were much more pronounced in grassland than in arable cropping systems.
   Partial extensification of a farming system should be conceived in the context of the whole system in order to be successful. For example, the extensification solely of fertiliser use and soil cultivation resulted in a general improvement in the environmental performance of the farming system, whereas a reduction in plant protection intensity by banning certain pesticide categories reduced negative impacts on ecotoxicity and biodiversity only, while increasing other burdens such as global warming, ozone formation, eutrophication and acidification per product unit. The replacement of mineral fertilisers by farmyard manure as a special form of extensification reduced resource use and improved soil quality, while slightly increasing nutrient losses.
   These results show that a considerable environmental improvement potential exists in Swiss farming systems and that a detailed eco-efficiency analysis could help to target a further reduction in their environmental impacts. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO SCIENCE
AB An understanding of agroecosystems is key to determining effective farming systems. Here we report results from a 21-year study of agronomic and ecological performance of biodynamic, bioorganic, and conventional farming systems in Central Europe. We found crop yields to be 20% Lower in the organic systems, although input of fertilizer and energy was reduced by 34 to 53% and pesticide input by 97%. Enhanced soil fertility and higher biodiversity found in organic plots may render these systems less dependent on external inputs.

TI Nutritional Composition and Bioactivity of Salicornia europaea L. Plants

   Soils
SO HORTICULTURAE
AB The increasing salinization of agricultural soils urges us to find alternative and sustainable farming systems in order to allow the exploitation of areas that are otherwise becoming less suitable for conventional crops. Thanks to their adaptation to extreme saline conditions, halophytes are promising plants for resilient farming systems, such as intercropping with glycophytes, to ameliorate their productivity in saline soils. This research aimed to evaluate whether the nutritional profile and the content of some health-promoting compounds of the edible portion of Salicornia europaea were influenced by its cultivation in consociation with tomato plants. Moreover, the antioxidant, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties of S. europaea were studied to characterize its bioactivity. The farming system did not influence the concentration of nutrients and bioactive compounds, except for flavonoids. The antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties of Salicornia extract suggested the importance of this halophyte for animal and human health.

TI Local perceptions of sustainability of farming systems on Leyte,
   Philippines - divergences and congruencies between different
   stakeholders
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
AB Resource-poor farmers in the Philippines have limited options for sustaining their livelihood, therefore it is important for them to practise and/or develop sustainable farming systems. But often in sustainability evaluations the perceptions of local stakeholders are not considered, although they are the ones who will apply sustainable technologies - or not apply them! This paper reports a study in Leyte, Philippines, where farmers, as well as stakeholders active in extension advice, on five study sites were asked to identify and rank criteria that could be used for comparison of different farming systems. Criteria were organised under the Sustainable Rural Livelihoods Framework, with its five capital assets: financial, physical, natural, human and social. When stakeholders ranked the identified list of criteria later individually, statistical differences between farmers and other stakeholders as well as between regions were found with regard to single criteria, but not with regard to the importance of the five different capital assets. Furthermore, farmers' individual ranking differed from the ranking by the group during focus group discussions. These findings indicate that the perceptions of farmers and other stakeholders regarding sustainability of farming systems are similar when looking at the whole picture, but differences regarding single issues can be wider. This underlines the importance of including several local stakeholders to identify suitable criteria. The concept of sustainable rural livelihoods seemed to correspond with stakeholders', especially farmers', perception of sustainability and worked well for identifying criteria covering all aspects of sustainability, including social and human aspects.

TI Influence of Farming System on Weed Infestation and on Productivity of
   Narrow-Leaved Lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.)
SO AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB Legumes have become important crops, due to an increasing global population and its demand for feed protein. Furthermore, legumes can improve the characteristics of the soil, improve biodiversity levels in crop rotations, and be cultivated in both organic and sustainable farming systems. In this study, a two-factor field experiment was conducted in Gorzyn, Poland in 2011-2015. The first factor was the farming system: low-external inputs (LI; without fertilization and chemical protection), medium-input (MI; medium fertilization level and chemical protection), and high-input (conventional-CONV; high fertilization level and chemical protection). Narrow-leaved lupin cultivar was the second factor; the indeterminate cv. Kalif and the determinate cv. Regent. We evaluated (a) weed infestation levels, (b) seed and protein production, and (c) the economic effects of narrow-leaved lupin cultivation under different farming conditions. A total of 12 weed species were identified, with the lowest weed density level and biomass production observed in CONV, and the greatest weed density level observed in LI. Seed yield was determined by the farming system; the greatest in CONV and significantly lower in LI (by 0.73 t h(-1)) and MI (by 0.18 t ha(-1)). Little difference was observed in seed yield between cultivars. The greatest production values for the Kalif and Regent cultivars (996euro and 949euro ha(-1), respectively) were recorded in CONV, although LI proved to be the most profitable (with the highest gross agricultural income and lowest total cost of production). LI farming systems, in conjunction with chemical weed control, should be investigated in future studies.

TI Ecological mechanism and diversity in rice based integrated farming
   system
SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB The dynamic and transitional characteristics of rice field ecosystems provide an excellent environment for integration with compatible components such as fish and duck, which enhances the overall productivity through the effective nutrient recycling. The ecological mechanisms underlying the rice-fish-duck system sustainability have not been studied in detail especially on soil and water chemistry, dynamics of plankton, microbe and benthic populations and their community compositions. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to understand the ecological significance and diversities of organisms in the processes of maintenance of soil health, nutrient recycling and sustainable productivity in different rice-based integrated farming systems. In the integrated system such as rice-fish (RF), rice-duck (RD), and rice-fish-duck (RFD); the physico-chemical parameters of water (dissolved oxygen, nitrate, ammonia, total alkalinity, dissolved organic matter, and total suspended solid) and soil nutrient levels were significantly higher compared to conventional system due to the continuous addition of fecal matters, scooping and churning of soil by fish and ducks in the paddy field ecology. The aquatic biological diversity including planktons (phyto- and zooplankton), soil benthic fauna and microbial populations were dynamic in integrated rice-based system, provides an indication of enhanced soil fertility and production sustainability. The observed decreasing trends of plankton and soil benthic populations in integrated systems (RF, RD and RFD) indicated that fish and ducks fed these materials in rice ecology. Higher productivity and profitability in term of rice equivalent yields (REY) and the ratio of output value and cost of cultivation (OV/CC) were achieved in integrated farming system as compared to conventional rice farming (CRF). Thus, the present study reveals that adoption of rice-fish-duck integrated farming system enhances total farm production and income. Besides, the evaluation of different indicator indices viz., water quality index (WQI) and soil quality index (SQl) have shown a good prediction about ecological aspects of agro-ecosystems and will be helpful in farm management decisions making processes for improving farm productivity, profitability, and overcome any potential limiting factors in the rice-fish-duck integrated farming system. Finally, the present study concluded that rice-fish-duck integration utilizes maximum ecological niches and converted into potential production processes, which enhances farm production, farmer income and improved the soil health through the effective nutrient recycling in the rice ecologies.

AB Organic agriculture has expanded to a $13 billion industry in the United States in 2005, continuing the nearly decade-long trend of 20% annual growth. Despite the growth in organic agriculture, our scientific knowledge of organic agriculture farming systems remains limited. Interest in sustainable and organic education at the university level has increased in recent years. To help address this need, the Iowa State University Graduate Program in Sustainable Agriculture (GPSA) was established in 2001 to meet three principal objectives: 1) provide students with the analytical and problem-solving skills required to meet the challenges confronting agriculture in the 21st century; 2) develop an innovative interdisciplinary and interdepartmental approach to graduate education; and 3) position Iowa State University at the forefront of institutions conducting research and extending knowledge about sustainable agricultural systems. As of 2004, more than 70 faculty from various departments and 29 students have participated in the program. Students have the opportunity to investigate organic issues within the context of the five new GPSA courses and to conduct organic agriculture farming systems research in thesis and dissertation studies. Producers and agricultural professionals are involved with GPSA students through the curriculum and on-farm research. Research questions involving optimizing crop or livestock production, plant protection, soil quality, and socioeconomic benefits of farming systems constitute typical theses.

TI Farmer perspectives on introducing perennial cereal in Swedish farming
   systems: a sustainability analysis of plant traits, farm management, and
   ecological implications
SO AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB Agriculture is currently dominated by annual crops. A shift from annual to perennial cereals has been suggested as a way to improve the sustainability of agriculture. Such a shift may have impacts at multiple levels, from the field, to the farm, and the landscape. With a focus on Swedish farm production systems, farmers' views on the potential risks and possibilities of cultivating perennial cereals are discussed in light of the available knowledge regarding plant traits and ecological implications of perennial systems. Farmer interviews showed that potential changes in agricultural sustainability, if perennial cereals were to be introduced, are highly complex, and context specific. Perennial cereals could be part of a transition toward a more sustainable agriculture depending on how they are used in the local farming system and in the larger landscape. Efforts to increase the use of perennial crops require linking specific plant traits of the perennial crop to the properties of the farming systems where these crops would be employed.

TI How do Farming Systems Cope with Marketing Channel Requirements in
   Organic Horticulture? The Case of Market-Gardening in Southeastern
   France
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB Organic market-gardening farming systems are extremely diverse, ranging from the extensive to the very intensive, although all follow organic standards. This study aimed to analyze the extent to which the diversity of farming systems in southeastern France may be explained by the marketing channels adopted by growers. Eighteen organic market gardeners were surveyed. Three types of growers were identified, differentiated by the way they combine farming and marketing systems: (1) growers selling a diversity of food products through local marketing channels, which allows them to increase plant species biodiversity and enhance natural regulations in accordance with agro-ecology principles; (2) specialized growers selling a limited number of food products through long marketing channels at the few periods most economically favorable with regard to the export-market, a questionable strategy in terms of environmental sustainability; and (3) intermediate growers combining short and long marketing channels, who potentially may reconcile environmental and economic components of sustainability. The study confirmed the importance of better understanding the relationships between farming practices and marketing channels so that commercialization does not to become an impediment to sustainability in organic farming.

TI Feasibility and sustainability of agroforestry in temperate
   industrialized agriculture: preliminary insights from California
SO RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS
AB Intensive use of external inputs in specialized industrial farming systems has created significant socio-ecological externalities, including water and air pollution from nutrients and pesticides, soil erosion and depletion of carbon stocks, biodiversity loss and rising production costs. Ecological intensification is a strategy for reducing reliance on inputs by intentionally designing agroecosystems to harness biological processes and ecological relationships for the sustainable functioning of the system. Incorporating perennials and diversifying systems are two avenues for achieving ecological intensification, and both are characteristics of agroforestry. This preliminary report uses examples of agroforestry in the US state of California as a proof of concept to explore the agronomic and economic feasibility and sustainability benefits of agroforestry in intensive irrigated and temperate farming systems. An exploratory study of farmers experimenting with agroforestry systems and other agricultural professionals identified eight different variants of agroforestry systems being practiced on prime agricultural land in California, ranging from simple use of winter cover crops in orchards to multi-storied cropping systems with integrated grazing. Respondents noted benefits of reduced inputs and production costs, and better nutrient cycling, soil health and pest control. Trade-offs and challenges included increases in labor requirements and management complexity. Knowledge gaps included lack of guidance in biophysical systems design, lack of clarity about economic tradeoffs, and lack of information about ecosystem services benefits. In light of interviewees' responses, we discuss the constraints and factors needed to foster the successful expansion of agroforestry systems in California and other regions characterized by industrialized farming.

TI Stakeholders' assessment of dike-protected and flood-based alternatives
   from a sustainable livelihood perspective in An Giang Province, Mekong
   Delta, Vietnam
SO AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
AB Construction of extensive high dike compartments has spurred land use intensification on the upper floodplains of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. Increasingly intense rice-based fanning within these compartments has changed the water dynamics of the delta, making it impossible to exploit the erstwhile benefits of floodwaters. Progressive contraction of the natural floodplains has led to reduced deposition of fertile sediments and environmental degradation, endangering the sustainability of farmers' livelihoods. The Mekong Delta Plan recommends discontinuance of high dike construction in the upper delta and restoration of the floodplains. However, this requires a radical shift in the agricultural economy, halting intensification of rice-based farming systems and developing alternative farming systems that can flourish on restored floodplains using "living with floods" livelihood strategies. This paper explores stakeholders' perceptions and appreciation of these contrasting farming and livelihood systems for the upper delta. It also examines the extent that alternatives to flood-based agricultural systems are viewed as feasible and attractive. We applied multi-criteria analysis (MCA) with analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to explore the views of double and triple rice farmers and experts on alternatives based on a set of economic, water management and environmental aspects. MCA results indicate a clear preference among both farmers and experts for flood-based farming systems with low dikes. Floodwater retention capacity, infrastructure for flood protection, environmental sustainability, and market stability were ranked as the most important factors contributing to livelihood sustainability on the delta.

TI Assessing the impacts of the changes in farming systems on food security
   and environmental sustainability of a Chinese rural region under
   different policy scenarios: an agent-based model
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB Since China has undergone a series of economic reforms and implemented opening up policies, its farming systems have significantly changed and have dramatically influenced the society, economy, and environment of China. To assess the comprehensive impacts of these changes on food security and environmental sustainability, and establish effective and environment-friendly subsidy policies, this research constructed an agent-based model (ABM). Daligang Town, which is located in the two-season rice region of Southern China, was selected as the case study site. Four different policy scenarios, i.e., "sharply increasing" (SI), "no-increase" (NI), "adjusted-method" (AM), and "trend" (TD) scenarios were investigated from 2015 to 2029. The validation result shows that the relative prediction errors between the simulated and actual values annually ranged from -20 to 20%, indicating the reliability of the proposed model. The scenario analysis revealed that the four scenarios generated different variations in cropping systems, rice yield, and fertilizer and pesticide inputs when the purchase price of rice and the non-agricultural income were assumed to increase annually by 0.1 RMB per kg and 10% per person, respectively. Among the four different policy scenarios in Daligang, the TD scenario was considered the best, because it had a relatively high rice yield, fairly minimal use of fertilizers and pesticides, and a lower level of subsidy. Despite its limitations, ABM could be considered a useful tool in analyzing, exploring, and discussing the comprehensive effects of the changes in farming system on food security and environmental sustainability.

TI The influence of various organic fertilizers and catch crops on the
   balance of biogenic elements in the agrosystems
SO ZEMDIRBYSTE-AGRICULTURE
AB Field experiments were conducted during the period 2005-2009 at the Lithuanian Institute of Agriculture's Joniskelis Experimental Station on a clay loam Endocakari-Endohypogleyic Cambisol (CMg-n-w-can). The objective of this study was to estimate the effects of organic and sustainable farming systems on the balance of biogenic elements in the soil with a low (1.98-2.01%) and medium (2.10-2.40%) humus content, fertilized with farmyard manure, cereal straw, pea vines and biomass of various catch crops. The crop rotation, expanded in time and space, consisted of perennial grasses - red clover (Trifolium pretenses L.) and meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), pea (Pisum sativum L.) and spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) with grasses as an undersown crop. The investigated measures were assessed in a grass-cereal sequence: perennial grasses -> winter wheat + catch crops -> pea. In the sustainable farming systems, to promote straw mineralization mineral nitrogen fertilizers N-30 were used in the form of ammonium nitrate.
   It was found that in the catch crop the highest dry matter mass and the amount of nutrients were accumulated in the white mustard grown with buckwheat or white mustard grown as a monocrop. The balance of the main nutrients (NPK) was negative in the organic farming system in both humus backgrounds, using only green manure for fertilization. NP balance (and K - significantly) was positive in the organic farming system, where green manure and farmyard manure were incorporated. NPK balance was positive in the soil low in humus content when farmyard manure was used for winter wheat and N-30 for straw mineralization in the sustainable farming system. Only the nitrogen balance was negative in the soil with medium humus content because of the better growth conditions for crops and higher removal with the wheat yield. Unlike green manure, farmyard manure incorporated for winter wheat in the organic agrosystem secured a positive balance of NPK. However, due to the low mineralization rate in clay loam Cambisol, farmyard manure increased the yield of the second rotation member - pea more effectively than that of winter wheat.

TI Challenges of Smallholder Farming in Ethiopia and Opportunities by
   Adopting Climate-Smart Agriculture
SO AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB Agriculture is the backbone of the Ethiopian economy, and the agricultural sector is dominated by smallholder farming systems. The farming systems are facing constraints such as small land size, lack of resources, and increasing degradation of soil quality that hamper sustainable crop production and food security. The effects of climate change (e.g., frequent occurrence of extreme weather events) exacerbate these problems. Applying appropriate technologies like climate-smart agriculture (CSA) can help to resolve the constraints of smallholder farming systems. This paper provides a comprehensive overview regarding opportunities and challenges of traditional and newly developed CSA practices in Ethiopia, such as integrated soil fertility management, water harvesting, and agroforestry. These practices are commonly related to drought resilience, stability of crop yields, carbon sequestration, greenhouse gas mitigation, and higher household income. However, the adoption of the practices by smallholder farmers is often limited, mainly due to shortage of cropland, land tenure issues, lack of adequate knowledge about CSA, slow return on investments, and insufficient policy and implementation schemes. It is suggested that additional measures be developed and made available to help CSA practices become more prevalent in smallholder farming systems. The measures should include the utilization of degraded and marginal lands, improvement of the soil organic matter management, provision of capacity-building opportunities and financial support, as well as the development of specific policies for smallholder farming.

TI Do organic farming practices reduce nitrate leaching?

CT Annual Conference of the Soil-and-Water-Conservation-Society
CY AUG 08-11, 1999
CL BILOXI, MS
SP Soil & Water Conservat Soc
AB Agriculture is a contributor of nitrate to natural waters and there is concern about the excess nitrogen burden loadings from agriculture on natural waters. Agricultural practices that reduce nitrate leaching from arable land are needed. It is postulated by certain groups that organic farming practices reduce nitrate leaching among other environmental benefits. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to compile, summarize and critically analyse information about NO3-N leaching from farming systems that were managed according to organic farming principles; (2) to compare NO3-N leaching from organic farming systems with that from conventional systems. This review consists of several parts. The available literature on leaching of NO3-N from organic farming and conventional farming systems was analysed. Leachable amounts of NO3-N in soils from two types of farming systems were compared. Finally NO3-N leaching from animal manure versus inorganic fertilizer was examined.
   In all studies we found in the literature, both the sequence and type of crops grown, and the input intensity of N was different in organic and conventional systems. Organic farming systems had on average a lower N input and more legumes in rotation. Average leaching of NO3-N from organic farming systems over a crop rotation period was somewhat lower than in conventional agriculture.
   If the different input intensities of N between organic and conventional systems were taken into account and corrected for, no differences in leaching losses between systems were found. However, a proper comparison of leaching between the two types of systems should take the yield into account. Attempting to do this in this review, we found only two studies which provided data for this. In both studies, specific conditions of the soil-a high organic matter content resulting in a high N mineralization at one site and a heavy clay texture resulting in very small leaching losses at the other site-did not enable us to come up with a clear-cut answer. Nevertheless, we could not find any evidence that nitrate leaching will be reduced by the introduction of organic farming practices, if the goal is to maintain the same crop yield levels as in conventional farming systems. Reduction of nitrate leaching is not a question of organic or conventional farming, but rather of introduction and use of appropriate counter- measures. This insight should guide our thinking when developing environmentally friendly and sustainable cropping systems.

TI Responses of soil microbial biomass and N availability to transition
   strategies from conventional to organic farming systems
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB Organic farming can enhance soil biodiversity, alleviate environmental concerns and improve food safety through eliminating the applications of synthetic chemicals. However, yield reduction due to nutrient limitation and pest incidence in the early stages of transition from conventional to organic systems is a major concern for organic farmers, and is thus a barrier to implementing the practice of organic farming. Therefore, identifying transition strategies that minimize yield loss is critical for facilitating the implementation of organic practices. Soil microorganisms play a dominant role in nutrient cycling and pest control in organic farming systems, and their responses to changes in soil management practices may critically impact crop growth and yield. Here we examined soil microbial biomass and N supply in response to several strategies for transitioning from conventional to organic farming systems in a long-term field experiment in Goldsboro, NC, USA. The transitional strategies included one fully organic strategy (ORG) and four reduced-input strategies (withdrawal of each or gradual reduction of major conventional inputs-synthetic fertilizers, pesticides (insecticides/fungicides), and herbicides), with a conventional practice (CNV) serving as a control. Microbial biomass and respiration rate were more sensitive to changes in soil management practices than total C and N. In the first 2 years, the ORG was most effective in enhancing soil microbial biomass C and N among the transition strategies, but was accompanied with high yield losses. By the third year, soil microbial biomass C and N in the reduced-input transition strategies were statistically significantly greater than those in the CNV (averaging 32 and 35% higher, respectively), although they were slightly lower than those in the ORG (averaging 13 and 17% lower, respectively). Soil microbial respiration rate and net N mineralization in all transitional systems were statistically significantly higher than those in the CNV (averagely 83 and 66% greater, respectively), with no differences among the various transition strategies. These findings suggest that the transitional strategies that partially or gradually reduce conventional inputs can serve as alternatives that could potentially minimize economic hardships as well as benefit microbial growth during the early stages of transition to organic farming systems.

TI Is conservation agriculture a potential option for cereal-based
   sustainable farming system in the Eastern Indo-Gangetic Plains of Nepal?
SO COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
AB A decline in land and water productivity, increase in the cost of cultivation, and labor-intensive practices are affecting the cereal-based farming system in Nepal, particularly in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP). Conservation agriculture (CA) practices have been found to be the climate-, energy-, and labor-smart and sustainable agricultural production technologies. Sustainable and Resilient Farming System Intensification (SRFSI) has been working since 2014 in response to the sustainability of the cereal-based (rice-wheat and rice-maize) farming in Sunsari and Dhanusha districts of Nepal. This study was conducted to assess the adoption and scaling up of CA in addition to input usage, production, net profit, benefit to cost (B: C) ratio, and labor use of CA practice on average scale land holdings in Sunsari district. The study employed structured questionnaires and key informant surveys as the main data collection tools and project reports were used as secondary data. Results revealed that farmers had several tangible advantages: lower labor utilization per area (71 people day(-1) ha(-1) as compared to 106 for conventional), lower input cost (NRs. 78,395 ha(-1) as compared to 102,727 ha(-1)), less irrigation with regards to ponding time (50%) as compared to conventional practice, and higher crop productivity (8.11 t ha(-1) as compared to 8.08 t ha(-1) in rice-wheat and 13.1 t ha(-1) as compared to 11.75 t ha(-1) in conventional rice-maize) farming system through the adoption of CA practices. This study assessed the potential of CA-based practices in a cereal-based cropping system to improve the yields and net profit for sustainability.

TI Agroecology and industrial ecology: two complementary alternatives for
   animal production in the 21st century
SO INRA PRODUCTIONS ANIMALES
AB Agroecology and industrial ecology can be viewed as complementary means for the design of sustainable animal farming systems: agroecology by stimulating natural processes to reduce inputs, and using diversity to increase system resilience and provide ecosystem services. Industrial ecology mainly aims to close system loops within a territory, thereby reducing demand for raw materials and lowering pollution. Animal farming systems have so far been ignored in most agroecological thinking. We propose five principles applicable to animal production systems: i) adopting health management practices that minimize the use of chemical drugs, ii) decreasing the inputs needed for production by using grazing lands and by-products, iii) decreasing pollution by optimizing the functioning of farming systems, iv) enhancing diversity within animal production systems to strengthen their resilience, and v) preserving biological diversity and associated ecosystem services by adapting management practices. Based on four case studies, we show how these different principles can be combined to improve economic and environmental performance. We discuss opportunities and resistance to change what needs to be considered for the scaling-up of agroecological systems. Among these, we stress the motivation of farmers to break input dependency and the question of workload.

TI Soil Enzyme Activities and Their Relationship with Soil Physico-Chemical
   Properties and Oxide Minerals in Coastal Agroecosystem of Puducherry
SO GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL
AB The objectives of our research were to assess the soil enzyme activities in relation with soil physicochemical and oxide minerals in the coastal agroecosystem of Puducherry region, India. Soils from nine farms in organic (ORG), sustainable (SUS), and conventional (CON) farming were sampled. Organically managed farming system soils contain significantly higher amounts of soil total N, organic carbon, and a higher level of microbial biomass C and N. Urease, protease, beta-glucosidase, cellulose, saccharase, xylanase, and alkaline phosphatase enzyme activities were higher in organic farming system soils compared to sustainable and conventional farming soils. In addition, silt, clay, Al2O3, CaO, Fe2O3, K2O, MgO, MnO, Na2O, and P2O5 oxides were higher in organic farming soil and they showed a significant positive correlation with soil enzyme activities. Our study revealed that soil enzyme activities and soil minerals were significantly affected by farm management practices. The organic farming system had improved the soil health, enzyme activities, and plant available nutrients in coastal agro-ecosystem.

TI Prospects from agroecology and industrial ecology for animal production
   in the 21st century
SO ANIMAL
AB Agroecology and industrial ecology can be viewed as complementary means for reducing the environmental footprint of animal farming systems: agroecology mainly by stimulating natural processes to reduce inputs, and industrial ecology by closing system loops, thereby reducing demand for raw materials, lowering pollution and saving on waste treatment. Surprisingly, animal farming systems have so far been ignored in most agroecological thinking. On the basis of a study by Altieri, who identified the key ecological processes to be optimized, we propose five principles for the design of sustainable animal production systems: (i) adopting management practices aiming to improve animal health, (ii) decreasing the inputs needed for production, (iii) decreasing pollution by optimizing the metabolic functioning of farming systems, (iv) enhancing diversity within animal production systems to strengthen their resilience and (v) preserving biological diversity in agroecosystems by adapting management practices. We then discuss how these different principles combine to generate environmental, social and economic performance in six animal production systems (ruminants, pigs, rabbits and aquaculture) covering a long gradient of intensification. The two principles concerning economy of inputs and reduction of pollution emerged in nearly all the case studies, a finding that can be explained by the economic and regulatory constraints affecting animal production. Integrated management of animal health was seldom mobilized, as alternatives to chemical drugs have only recently been investigated, and the results are not yet transferable to farming practices. A number of ecological functions and ecosystem services (recycling of nutrients, forage yield, pollination, resistance to weed invasion, etc.) are closely linked to biodiversity, and their persistence depends largely on maintaining biological diversity in agroecosystems. We conclude that the development of such ecology-based alternatives for animal production implies changes in the positions adopted by technicians and extension services, researchers and policymakers. Animal production systems should not only be considered holistically, but also in the diversity of their local and regional conditions. The ability of farmers to make their own decisions on the basis of the close monitoring of system performance is most important to ensure system sustainability.

TI Application of system dynamics modelling in evaluating sustainability of
   low-input ruminant farming systems in Eastern Cape Province, South
   Africa
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB As a complex and dynamic concept that requires understanding from an ecological, economic and socio-cultural perspective, sustainability of agriculture and food systems is currently being strongly promoted by many governments and rural development practitioners. However, advances in monitoring and evaluating the sustainability of low-input ruminant farming are hindered by a lack of tools that simultaneously consider the interrelationships and dynamic behaviour of the different components of the system. Here we report on the application of a system dynamics model to evaluate the sustainability of low-input ruminant farming systems. This draws on nine indicators grouped as ecological; (soil organic matter, water availability and biomass supply), economic; (livestock productivity, labour supply and household income, and social: (farmer training, credence attributes of ruminant grazing systems and gender equality) to describe system behaviour over a ten-year period. The outputs from model simulations were used to compute index values for each of the indicators and the indices were subsequently used to evaluate sustainability of low-input ruminant farming systems. Household income, gender equality and farmer training had the highest sustainability indices whereas, soil organic matter and biomass supply recorded the lowest values. Overall, the low-input ruminant farming system was found to be moderately sustainable.

TI Could energy flow in agro-ecosystems be used as a "tool" for crop and
   farming system replacement?
SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB Energy flow in orchards can be used to determine first the best management practices and second the possibility of using those which have best environmental advantages. Conventional and organic peach and kiwi orchards were selected in order to (a) determine energy flow of the farming systems, and (b) reveal the importance of energy inputs in crop and farming system replacement. Fifteen farms (four conventional and three organic kiwi orchards; four conventional and four organic peach orchards) were selected with proportional stratified random sampling during the years 2010-2013. The Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) method was applied using nine production coefficients' variables (fertilizers, fungicides, insecticides, weed control, diesel, labor, irrigation, branches shoring, and machinery) and revealed three groups of the studied orchards. The highest contributors in cluster formation were weed control, branches shoring, labor, and machinery. The effect of the production coefficients on the grouping of the studied orchards reveals their importance for these crops and farming systems. Most of the production coefficients showed their lowest values in organic kiwi orchards (Group 3), so it could be said that they can play a key role in the replacement of the peaches, and conventional kiwi orchards. It seems that production coefficients can be used as a "tool" for decision makers who are seeking for crops and farming systems with low energy inputs and best environmental advantages in order to use them in crop replacement in agro-ecosystems.

TI Assessment of the resilience of the agricultural landscapes and

   in Kyrenia (Girne) Region of Northern Cyprus
SO LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB The purpose of this study is to assess the resilience of agricultural landscapes and associated ecosystem services at multiple scales (a farm and landscape) in Kyrenia Region of Northern Cyprus. In doing so, the key objectives of the study were (a) to design a conceptual framework for identifying the key linkages between the resilience of the agricultural landscape and farming systems, (b) to determine the major suitable resilience assessment principles and relevant indicators for both systems, and (c) to measure the resilience of the systems as well as to assess their cross-scale linkages. The suitable resilience assessment indicators for both systems were developed by reviewing the relevant literature. Two social valuation techniques (e.g. a multiple-choice questionnaire) were employed to assess the resilience of both systems. The participants rated the resilience of the systems and their components on a 1-5 scale. The results showed that the ecological resilience of the farming system is medium with 3.23 points. The resilience of the agricultural landscape system was evaluated within the context of three dimensions: agro-ecosystem, the agricultural, and human systems. Their resilience was found to be low and ranged between 2.40 and 2.90 points. The system's resilience was estimated to be low with 2.68 points. The outcomes of this study are significant in terms of helping policy-makers and resource managers to better understand the cross-scale linkages between the resilience of the agricultural landscape and farming systems to achieve the sustainability of natural resources, food production, and community livelihoods in Kyrenia Region and elsewhere.

SP IFSA
AB The reality is that there are no shortages of good approaches or intentions that have emerged over the last 35 years to advance sustainable development in rural areas. With the greater acceptance of participatory and multi-stakeholder processes, farm to landscape linkages, and practice to policy strategies, it is time to take stock of what is working and why. How do we take our best learning forward to truly make a difference in the lives of poor people in rural areas? In this paper, we look at approaches and innovations that have emerged from farming systems in the evolution of good practice for people-centred research and development. Approaches have evolved Largely through ad hoc practitioner experimentation and learning, often in diverse field settings. Whilst some methods have been imported from other approaches or sectors, most method improvement occurs endogenously. Nevertheless, farming systems is marked by continuous improvement, albeit mostly fine-tuning, of methods. As we include and transcend to the next generation of approaches, we must clarify what we wish to accomplish within the current context of the MDG targets and what good processes and practices will Look Like to get us there.

TI Investigating the technical sustainability of farming systems with
   correlational biplots
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
AB Nowadays sustainability has become one of the major topics of interest in farming systems research. Farming systems sustainability is analyzed in this work by introducing the concept of technical sustainability, defined here as the ability of a biological production system to make an efficient use of the available resources on field level with the main goal to maximize its economic output given a set of uncontrolled biophysical constraints. This concept is developed and applied to the agricultural production area of the Mantaro Valley (Peru). Through fortnightly visits, data on biophysical characteristics of the crops on selected production fields were collected without taking part in the decision process of the growers to manage their crops. Afterward, by applying a multivariate exploratory data method, principal component analysis, it was possible to establish technical efficiency gradients for the tested data. The capabilities of such type of analysis are explored by studying two types of standardization of the collected data. The biplot graphical output that can be built upon the results of the analysis represents an extra powerful feature to interpret the outcome of the analysis.

TI Emergy analysis for the environmental sustainability of an inshore fish
   farming system
SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB The emergy concept was used to evaluate the environmental sustainability of the rearing process of Gilthead Sea Bream (Sparus aurata) in an inshore fish farming system in Gulf of La Spezia (Italy, Northwestern Mediterranean). Emergy is defined as the available energy of one kind previously used up directly and indirectly to make a product or service. The indices for the examined fish farm calculated from the emergy evaluation were compared with those of three other systems producing fishes: two intensive fish farming systems producing, respectively, salmons (Salmo salar) and tilapia (Tilapia mariae), the third system producing again S. aurata but in a semi-natural extensive manner. The emergy evaluation showed that the rearing of fishes in a sheltered area of Mediterranean Sea imposes a large stress on the environment. The greatest contributions to the emergy needed for production were due to fingerlings purchased and goods and services provided that are two external, non-renewable inputs to the system. The strong dependence of external contributions and the relative inability at exploiting local natural resources affect strongly the level of environmental sustainability of the productive process.

TI Organic viticulture leads to lower trade-offs between agroecosystem
   goods but does not improve overall multifunctionality
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB CONTEXT: Assessing the multifunctionality of agroecosystems is crucial to design more sustainable farming systems. While it is known that organic farming benefits biodiversity and ecosystem services, how organic farming affects their multifunctionality, including agronomical, ecological as well as economic dimensions, re-mains poorly explored.OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated how individual indicators regrouped into agroecosystem goods of vineyards respond to farming systems and landscape composition. We also explored how ecosystem services resulting from agroecosystem goods respond to farming systems and landscape composition. In addition, we evaluated trade-offs and synergies between agroecosystem goods as well as between ecosystem services for each farming systems. METHOD: We quantified 14 indicators corresponding to five agroecosystem goods (biodiversity conservation, soil organic matter decomposition, pest control, wine production, margin) in 20 pairs of organic and conven-tional vineyards.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Our study reveals that organic farming did not improve agroecosystem multi -functionality compared to conventional farming but led to lower trade-offs between agroecosystem goods. We found that organic systems increase supporting and regulating services but had lower provisioning service compared to conventional systems. Indeed, organic vineyards had multiple beneficial effects including higher pest control, lower production costs but produced less wine. Our results indicate a strong trade-off between pest control and wine production in both systems. In addition, conventional systems supported a negative trade-off between biodiversity conservation and wine production which was not the case of organic systems.SIGNIFICANCE: Our study provides key information to further design farming systems that combine ecological, economical and agronomical performances. Further investigations are now needed to identify which combined management options maximize multiple performance of agroecosystems independently of certifications and across scales.

TI Technical efficiency and productivity of farms: a periurban case study
   analysis
SO AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD ECONOMICS
AB Periurban farming systems are characterized by the need to adapt the farming practices coping with a modified natural and social environment. Questions are thus posed on the efficient use of the inputs. The purpose of this study is to estimate the technical efficiency and the productivity of periurban farms. To do so, the study employs a data envelopment analysis that properly captures the heterogeneity of the periurban farming system. The sample considered livestock and crop farms, located in the South Milan Agricultural Park, where 50 farms were selected and interviewed. Results show that crop farms are more efficient than livestock farms, but they have a less productive technology. The participation in short food supply chains and the multifunctional agriculture does not affect the levels of technical efficiency of the farms. Policies are thus needed to improve the education level of farmers and to sustain the efficiency of farms that diversify the farm's economy.

TI Strengthening climate resilience of rural communities by co-producing
   landscape-specific integrated farming systems in Cambodia
SO JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE
AB Climate change poses a major threat to the livelihoods of rural smallholder farmers in Cambodia. Adaptation measures through sustainable land management (SLM) and farming practices can help farmers to increase their resilience to climate change and secure their livelihoods. This paper presents a novel approach for promoting landscape-specific integrated farming systems (IFS) through multi-stakeholder engagement, knowledge-based decision-making and improved land use planning. It presents a stepwise participatory approach, applied under an IFAD-funded project, to define context-specific IFS models. Through co-production processes with multiple stakeholders, three landscape units and seven landscape-specific IFS models consisting of different SLM technologies were defined and demonstrated on 1,500 farms in two case study sites. The process included training and awareness raising to enhance local stakeholder engagement in developing integrated farm plans. This paper provides insights into how such a novel approach can be embedded in rural development projects to enhance smallholders' resilience and livelihoods.

SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB This paper reviews the agroecosystems and agricultural biodiversity in Southern Africa and highlights the importance of the agricultural landscape in biodiversity conservation and the important role that the traditional farming systems play in conserving biodiversity. The review established that agrobiodiversity is of great importance to both small scale and large commercial farmers in Southern Africa through its provision of ecosystem services. The paper also highlights the significant loss of agrobiodiversity as a result of human population pressure and the transition from traditional mixed farming systems which is characterized with high agrobiodiversity, to modern monoculture farming resulting in decline of species diversity. Although concerted efforts are being made to promote the sustainable use and management of this agrobiodiversity, there need to have a multi-stakeholder approach so that conservation efforts are successful, a role that is currently played by the SADC Plant Genetic Resources Centre in Southern African conservation of agrobiodiversity.

SO JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION
AB A paired comparison of 60 Illinois farm families war employed, 30 using sustainable systems and 30 using conventional systems, to determine factors affecting adaption of sustainable farming systems The groups do not diverge significantly along dimensions typically accounting for farming contrasts, but are distinctive socially. Families using sustainable systems have traditions of environmentalism, systematically do on-farm experimentation, and are prudent about resources Rather than making a paradigm shift to environmentally sensitive farming, families who adopt have a predisposition toward sustainable practices in all aspects of their lives. Adoption of sustainable systems is therefore as much for efficiency or financial motives ar it is for environmental reasons. Families farming conventionally but sharing many characteristics identified with sustainable families, potentially are those best targeted for educational programs.

   DISEASES AND PROTECTION
AB Since 1990 the influence of sustainable land use systems on the agro-ecosystem has been investigated on the farmland of Munich Research Association for Agricultural Ecosystems Research (FAM) in Southern Bavaria. In order to determine the change of occurrence of Cirsium arvense cover abundance were estimated and shoots were counted at 268 nodes of a 50x50 m(2) grid for each spring and summer between 1991 to 2000. After switching over the management from conventional to integrated and organic farming in autumn 1992 C arvense has heavily spread. Until 1998 in both fanning systems the occurrence of C arvense has increased up to more than 60 % (integrated fanning system) and 70 % (organic farming system) respectively. Furthermore, the cover abundance has increased in the integrated fanning system until 1998. In the years 1999 and 2000 a decrease was observed. In the organic farming system higher amounts of cover abundance were determined than in the integrated farming system. There, a decrease of C. arvense can not be found until 2000.

AB The winter-rainfall ley-farming system of south-eastern Australia is heavily reliant on herbicide inputs for weed control. This is because of their efficiency and effectiveness and because farmers have adopted conservation farming with reduced tillage operations. Thus, any threat to the continued availability of effective herbicides is of major concern. Already herbicide resistance in weeds provides a threat to the sustainability of current farming practice.
   Our evaluation of the introduction of transgenic herbicide-resistant crop cultivars into the ley-farming system is that it is a high risk venture with limited, if any, economic benefits. The potential loss of current herbicides through a buildup in herbicide resist ance in weeds is not offset by clear advantages of the transgenic technology and current farming practice would be substantially compromised.
   Further benefit/cost analyses are warranted, as is research into the time frame for development of herbicide resistance. The introduction of transgenic herbicide-resistant cultivars will require regulatory controls, the provision of appropriate extension advice and mechanisms for ensuring that the practice of, and research into, integrated weed management are not compromised.

TI Exploring a safe operating approach to weighting in life cycle impact
   assessment - a case study of organic, conventional and integrated
   farming systems
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Normalization and weighting steps used in life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) are often ignored as the weighting factors currently available are seen as being uncertain, subjective and unreliable. This article aims to contribute to the development of a new approach towards weighting, exploring the application of the concept of a planetary safe operating space for human welfare. Based on this approach, the boundaries included in this study relate to: climate change, rate of biodiversity loss, nitrogen cycle, phosphorus cycle, stratospheric ozone depletion, global freshwater use and change in land use. The weighting factors are then applied to a case study comparing environmental impacts of organic, conventional and integrated farming systems with alternative land uses. An integrated farming system that uses a part of the land for natural forest was found to have the lowest total impact score. Conventional farming systems with Miscanthus and managed forest had the highest total impact scores. The main source of uncertainty in the results arose from the wide range of assessments for the safe boundary of the biodiversity loss impact category. As the weighting factors proposed in this paper are not based on the common LCA impact categories, more work is needed to adjust the weighting factors to be suitable for use in LCA studies. More research is also needed for further defining the safe planetary boundaries. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Multilevel and multi-user sustainability assessment of farming systems
SO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW
AB Sustainability assessment is needed to build sustainable farming systems. A broad range of sustainability concepts, methodologies and applications already exists. They differ in level, focus, orientation, measurement, scale, presentation and intended end-users. In this paper we illustrate that a smart combination of existing methods with different levels of application can make sustainability assessment more profound, and that it can broaden the insights of different end-user groups. An overview of sustainability assessment tools on different levels and for different end-users shows the complementarities and the opportunities of using different methods. In a case-study, a combination of the sustainable value approach (SVA) and MOTIFS is used to perform a sustainability evaluation of farming systems in Flanders. SVA is used to evaluate sustainability at sector level, and is especially useful to support policy makers, while MOTIFS is used to support and guide farmers towards sustainability at farm level. The combined use of the two methods with complementary goals can widen the insights of both farmers and policy makers, without losing the particularities of the different approaches. To stimulate and support further research and applications, we propose guidelines for multilevel and multi-user sustainability assessments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB On-farm research in remote areas demands methods that keep down costs and reduce the need for subsequent research and extension inputs and yet that still produce useful and sustainable recommendations. An important part of the process is to identify existing resource user groups and use them, rather than individual farmers, as a starting point for on-farm research. This approach is discussed in the context of farming systems research in the eastern hills of Nepal.

TI A Farming System Model to Leverage Agriculture for Nutritional Outcomes
SO AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
AB Agriculture is the primary livelihood of a majority of the population in South Asia. The region also houses a large population of undernourished people. The farming system for nutrition (FSN) model envisages developing and demonstrating a sustainable framework of farming to improve nutritional outcomes that can be used for upscaling and wider adoption. Agricultural intervention and farming systems research in India has been largely focused on enhancing production, productivity and profitability of crop and animal resources without much emphasis on better nutritional outcomes. The FSN model has been conceptualized to develop location-specific inclusive models to address the nutritional needs of farm and non-farm families based on their resource endowments and surrounding environment. The main components of the model are as follows: (1) survey to identify the major nutritional problems, (2) design suitable agricultural interventions to address the problems, (3) include specific nutritional criteria in the design, (4) improve small farm productivity and profitability, (5) undertake nutrition awareness programmes and (6) introduce monitoring systems for assessing impact on nutrition outcomes. The objective is to demonstrate feasibility of nutrition-sensitive agriculture. The proposed model is being tested in two select locations to demonstrate improvement in nutrition status through improved agricultural production system, dietary diversification, income enhancement, greater nutrition awareness and changed behaviour patterns, to be evaluated through a set of objective indicators.

TI Soil degradation assessment in mixed farming systems of southern Africa:
   use of nutrient balance studies for participatory degradation monitoring
SO GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
AB Soil degradation assessments for mixed farming systems of the Molopo Basin (North West Province, South Africa and Southern District, Botswana) are provided from farmer-based research, designed to quantify nutrient fluxes across the farming system and to analyze the social, economic, political and environmental factors affecting nutrient management practices. This paper discusses the practical difficulties of how to use participatory farmer-led studies to assess soil degradation extent and its causes, and of then disseminating this information to farming communities and policymakers. Nutrient balance studies show that land degradation is evident on arable fields as soil nutrient depletion (the main threat to poorer manure-reliant farmers) and soil acidification (the main threat to wealthier farmers who have become dependent on inorganic fertilizer additions). Integrated nutrient management strategies involving both compound fertilizer additions and regular manure inputs can mitigate most soil degradation even on the sandy infertile Kalahari soils, but remain infrequently practised. The need to retain nutrient flows through the livestock sector from rangeland to arable land is thus vital to environmental sustainability and offers an applicable entry point for agricultural development initiatives and support. Factors identified as threatening the flow of nutrients from rangelands to arable lands include policy settings in terms of the different support programmes offered to communal farmers, village-level extension advice, household poverty levels and labour constraints.

TI The Importance of Social Norm on Adopting Sustainable Digital
   Fertilisation Methods
SO ORGANIZATION & ENVIRONMENT
AB Precision farming systems promise a highly efficient resource use reducing cost for farmers and contributing to the preservation of the environment. A major obstacle, however, in such systems dissemination is the reluctant adoption by farmers. Prior work is suggesting that mainly knowledge or missing resources for investment are barriers, while social norms are rarely addressed for precision farming systems. We adopt the reasoned action approach including behavioural, social, and control aspects to analyse intentions and actual use of sustainable digital fertilisation methods. Based on a German sample of farmers, we find that social norm is the major predictor, while behavioural and control aspects surprisingly are not relevant at all. The results contribute to the understanding of what drives farmers in adopting precision farming systems on a theoretical basis and highlight the importance of considering social norms in increasing adoption.

TI Sustainability of dairy farming system in Tuscany in a changing climate
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
AB It is widely accepted that our climate is changing due to the increasing atmospheric concentrations of the 'greenhouse gases', and these changes may exercise strong impacts on different economic sectors. In particular for agricultural systems, such a change may have significant impacts on crop yield, cattle breeding and related management practices. Accordingly, the economic viability of agricultural production systems in future scenarios is a main concern especially for policy-making purposes. Up until now, the impact of climate change on agriculture has focused on change in crop yield, whereas a 'holistic' approach, considering both benefits (in terms of direct economic income) and detrimental environmental impacts of agricultural practices (soil loss, nitrogen leaching, water balance) has not been considered. On these premises, the objective of the present article was to assess agricultural sustainability on a farm level in Tuscany (central Italy) under the climate change regime, considering both conventional and organic farming systems (CFS and OFS, respectively). In particular, an ecological-economic optimisation model was run for both the present and future scenarios to perform an integrated assessment of sustainability of CFS and OFS on the case-study farm.

TI Estimating resource use efficiencies in organic agriculture: a review of
   budgeting approaches used
SO JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE
AB The basis of organic farming is that it is environmentally, socially and economically sustainable, and it aims, wherever possible, to use renewable resources in the production system and avoid waste. Thus this review considers the use of nutrient, energy and water within the farming systems, and indices that are used to evaluate the use of these resources and hence their impact on the environment. It is crucial that the delineation of system boundaries in both time and space, including both the vertical and horizontal dimensions, is defined to assess the resources used within the system. There is increasing interest in the emergy concept, which permits different forms of energy to be compared on the same basis. Across all farming systems, there is no direct link between nutrient surplus and nutrient loss. It is important to recognise that the choice of tool used to assess the environmental consequences of the farming system, as well as whether the results are expressed on a product or an area basis, may have implications for how emissions are attributed to different parts of the production system. In order for indicators to be useful, they must be influenced by the farmer's management practices. (c) 2007 Society of Chemical Industry.

TI Toward the economic-environmental sustainability of smallholder farming
   systems through judicious management strategies and optimized planting
   structures
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Sustainable crop production practices have become a global issue. However, current smallholder farming systems face many challenges due to the unreasonable structure and management strategies associated with planting crops. Although optimization is crucial, implementation remains unclear. Accordingly, here we investigate three typical smallholder farming systems in Quzhou County, the North China Plain, China, including 100 smallholder family units growing either wheat-maize, cotton, or vegetables. Changes in economic and environmental indicators are comprehensively analyzed through optimized planting structure and management strategies. Results show that although the vegetable system is the most profitable (i.e., by magnitudes of 10.7 and 6.5 compared to wheat-maize and cotton systems, respectively), environmental pressures associated with this system are greater (by magnitudes of 2.2-2.6 and 4.1-5.6, respectively). The Emergy Sustainability Index value was lower in the vegetable system (0.1) compared to the wheat-maize (0.4) and cotton (3.9) systems. Findings highlight that the economic-environmental nexus trade-offs among these three cropping systems under the status quo are highly unfavorable to sustainable crop production. Moreover, suitable management strategies and optimized planting structures can mitigate the global warming potential by 30-57% with a 102-120% increase in profits, which hinges largely on management strategies and targeted requirements. Our multiple scenario analysis shows that achieving a synergy between the economic-environmental nexus among various cropping systems is viable at county level. Results from this study can be used as a reference for other developing regions worldwide dominated by smallholders using various cropping systems to achieve sustainable smallholder agriculture.

TI Key Roles for Landscape Ecology in Transformative Agriculture Using
   Aotearoa-New Zealand as a Case Example
SO LAND
AB Aotearoa-New Zealand (NZ) is internationally renowned for picturesque landscapes and agricultural products. Agricultural intensification has been economically beneficial to NZ but has implications for its clean green image. Contaminated waterways, high carbon emissions, and extensive soil erosion demonstrate the downside of high stocking rates and land clearing. Transformative farming systems are required to address the challenge of balancing production with the environment. Whilst navigating through the process of change, farmers need to be supported to make informed decisions at the farm and landscape scale. Landscape ecology (LE) is ideally positioned to inform the development of future farming landscapes and provide a scientific context to the criteria against which land-related information can be evaluated. However, to do this effectively, LE needs to demonstrate that it can link theory with practice. Using NZ as a case example, this paper discusses the key roles for LE in future farming systems. It looks at the way LE can help quantify the state of the landscape, provide support towards the co-creation of alternative futures, and assist with the inclusion of land-related information into design and planning to ensure mitigation and adaption responses assist in the transformation of farming systems for sustainable outcomes.

TI The herd, a source of flexibility for livestock farming systems faced
   with uncertainties?
SO ANIMAL
AB 'Adapt to endure' has become a necessity in agriculture, but the means to do so remain largely undefined. The aim of this literature review is to analyse how the herd contributes to a livestock farming system's capacity to adapt to a changing world and evolve when the future is uncertain. We identify six categories of elements linked to the herd, called 'sources of flexibility', that are used to manage perturbation. The first three are: using the animal's adaptive capacities, using the diversity of species and breeds and combining the diversity of animal products. The last three are: organising the mobility of animals and livestock farmers, juggling the herd numbers and mastering the balance between productivity and herd survival. These sources of flexibility are described in the literature by studying the different ways in which they are used. For example, the 'juggle herd numbers' source is described by volume, categories of animals, type of transfer, such as births, purchases or gifts, and timing of use, especially linked to the timing of the perturbation. Identified studies also compare or rank sources and analyse the connections between them. The flexibility framework (management science) is used for this analysis according to the levels of organisation of a livestock farming system: a strategic level referring to long-term options and to the capacity to modify the system structure, and an operational level referring to adjustment decisions during the productive cycle, the presence or absence of intervention by the livestock farmer, and the time scales involved. We conclude that the decision to use one or another source (in terms of modalities, alternatives, scheduling and combinations) is made according to the production objectives, the structural means, the type/frequency/intensity of perturbations and the context/environment. Consequently, the flexibility of a livestock farming system cannot be assessed in absolute terms. Enhancing flexibility needs management of all elements and scales involved (and not only the herd), and requires diversity to be organised at different scales.

SO REVISTA CHILENA DE NUTRICION
AB Nowadays consumers are more concerned about food quality as well as how food is produced. Moreover, consumer demand for more natural, nutritious, safer to eat, and environmentally sustainable food has drawn attention to alternative breeding systems, such as a free-range system. Hens' eggs represent a rich source of important nutrients, including lipids and carotenoids. A detailed characterization of the nutritional and lipid profile of free-range chicken eggs from family farms was carried out. The chemical composition of the free-range egg yolks confirmed the advantages of this farming system, as a relevant source of unsaturated fatty acids and carotenoids, functional compounds in the human diet. These findings can help improve income generation, food supplementation, and consolidation of the family farming system.

AB A number of farming systems across the EU are under threat and extensively farmed land is being abandoned as systems fail to maintain a sustainable level of income to survive. Farming in the Hill and Uplands provides a number of ecosystem services which would be lost if land were abandoned. Present calculations in agri-environmental payments are based on income foregone and additional cost. For farms operating at a loss there is no income to forego and the economically realistic alternative is abandonment. Therefore the full cost of farming that land, is an 'additional cost' in itself. We propose a full cost of management approach which would be compliant under WTO agreements that could be applied to encourage ecosystem service provision and test these within the Scottish context of Higher Nature Value farming systems, identified through the Scottish farm account data. The FCM approach generates much higher levels of payment than under the present agri-environment support. However, this should not be a disincentive to explore these mechanisms further as it is recognised that the farms here are a special case for protection, provide important ecosystem service and therefore merit a higher level of support from society. There is sufficient scope within the existing WTO agreement to develop alternative payment approaches for encouraging the production of ecosystem services, if Member States and the EU to use it to its full potential.

TI Evaluation of the sustainability of contrasted pig farming systems:
   integrated evaluation
SO ANIMAL
AB The aim of this paper is to present an approach for an integrated evaluation of the sustainability of pig farming systems, taking into account the three classical pillars: economy, environment and society. Eight sustainability themes were considered: Animal Welfare (AW), Animal Health (AH), Breeding Programmes (BP), Environment (EN), Meat Safety (MS), Market Conformity (MC), Economy (EC) and Working Conditions (WC). A total of 37 primary indicators were identified and used for the evaluation of 15 much contrasted pig farming systems in five EU countries. The results show that the eight themes were not redundant and all contributed to the observed variation between systems. The tool was very robust for highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the systems along the eight themes that were considered. The number of primary indicators could be reduced from 37 to 18 with limited impact on the strengths/weaknesses profile of the individual systems. Integrating the eight theme evaluations into a single sustainability score is based on hypotheses or presumptions on the relative weights that should be given to the eight themes, which are very dependent on the context and on the purpose of the users of the tool. Therefore, the present paper does not have the ambition to provide a ready-for-use tool, rather to suggest an approach for the integrated evaluation of the sustainability of pig farming systems.

TI Multi-community effects of organic and conventional farming practices in
   vineyards
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Understanding the response of biodiversity to organic farming is crucial to design more sustainable agriculture. While it is known that organic farming benefits biodiversity on average, large variability in the effects of this farming system exists. Moreover, it is not clear how different practices modulate the performance of organic farming for biodiversity conservation. In this study, we investigated how the abundance and taxonomic richness of multiple species groups responds to certified organic farming and conventional farming in vineyards. Our analyses revealed that farming practices at the field scale are more important drivers of community abundance than landscape context. Organic farming enhanced the abundances of springtails (+31.6%) and spiders (+84%), had detrimental effects on pollinator abundance (- 11.6%) and soil microbial biomass (- 9.1%), and did not affect the abundance of ground beetles, mites or microarthropods. Farming practices like tillage regime, insecticide use and soil copper content drove most of the detected effects of farming system on biodiversity. Our study revealed varying effects of organic farming on biodiversity and clearly indicates the need to consider farming practices to understand the effects of farming systems on farmland biodiversity.

TI Sustainability and multifunctionality of protected designations of
   origin of olive oil in Spain
SO LAND USE POLICY
AB Agrarian systems provide sociocultural and environmental externalities, which contribute to the sustainability of rural areas. The aim of this article is to analyse the sustainability of some Spanish olive oil Protected Designations of Origin (PDO) through multicriteria techniques (Analytical Network Process), taking into consideration different farming systems. The analysis has been made through ten criteria grouped in three clusters: economic, environmental and socio-cultural and asked experts. This was done first to rank the criteria and second in terms of what type of farming system achieves these criteria better. According to the results, there is a high level of consensus regarding the criteria ranking and the way that farming systems contribute to agrarian multifunctionality and sustainable development, despite the different characteristics of PDOs. In all cases, organic farming is the best, followed by integrated farming, when achieving economic, environmental and socio-cultural criteria, except for Estepa (where integrated farming is preferred for the economic and socio-cultural criteria). Conventional farming is placed in third position when achieving all functions, except for the environmental criteria, for which abandonment is preferred to conventional farming in all PDOs. Multifunctionality and sustainability are maximized by a combination of farming systems: about 40% organic, 35% integrated, 20% conventional and 5% crop abandonment.
   The results of our model regarding the combination of farming systems are similar to the actual situation in the PDOs studied, and, more important, this has been achieved thanks to the PDO institutions. Good local institutions contribute to improve the sustainability of rural areas by encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship (especially in PDOs, triggered by Origin Designation Regulator Councils) and a European level, by paying farmers for externalities.

TI Sustainable productive intensification for family farming in developing
   tropical countries
SO CIENCIA E AGROTECNOLOGIA
AB In the past, agriculture was directed to satisfying human needs. Nowadays, it is directed to meeting the markets, forcing the peasantries to adapt to this condition. As a result, family farmers are multifaceted, incorporating both subsistence and market-oriented production. Traditional farming systems have been challenged since there is a pressure for the intensification of these systems. Then, it is important that scientific research about them goes on to recognize that many family farmers use limited resource bases. However, innovation and intensification are permanent needs of agriculture, although they must be adjusted to different contexts, respecting the cultural legacy of family farmers as a prerequisite for achieving the development.

TI LIVELIHOOD CAPABILITIES AND PATHWAYS OF SHRIMP FARMERS IN THE MEKONG
   DELTA, VIETNAM
SO AQUACULTURE ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT
AB Shrimp farming is a major livelihood activity in the Mekong Delta in the southernmost part of Vietnam. The Vietnamese government has promoted shrimp farming as a way to reduce poverty, provide employment opportunities and increase exports to support economic development. The shrimp farming system, however, is economically and ecologically risky and may negatively influence the environment and the sustainability of local people's livelihoods. Because very little is known about the diversity of strategies people employ to deal with these risks, a study was performed in the Mekong Delta across four shrimp farming systems: (1) improved extensive non-forest, (2) mixed mangrove-shrimp, (3) intensive and (4) clustered intensive. The risks and livelihood strategies that were encountered differed systematically across the four farming systems. It was found that the uncertainties that the shrimp farmers faced include limited access rights to the mangrove forest, crop failure due to regular occurrence of shrimp disease, high investment costs and volatile markets for shrimp. Shrimp farmers have created several strategies for coping with these uncertainties, including redesigning farms, producing salt, changing the species farmed from Penaeus monodon to Penaeus vannamei, becoming involved in a cooperative cluster, integrating aquaculture and agriculture, and farming shrimp by organic standards.

TI Intercropping for enhancement and provisioning of ecosystem services in
   smallholder, rural farming systems in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South
   Africa: a review
SO JOURNAL OF CROP IMPROVEMENT
AB Monocropping of maize (Zea mays L.) and communal grazing of livestock (cattle) are the major farming systems for smallholder farmers in the Upper Thukela region of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. However, these farming systems are unable to contribute meaningfully to sustainable food security and viable livelihoods. This is because of continuous declines in crop productivity and soil fertility under monocropping systems and shortages of adequate and good quality forage under communal grazing systems. Although the benefits of intercropping have been well documented, there has been low uptake by small-scale farmers in the temperate, frost-prone communal areas of KwaZulu-Natal. This may be attributed to a lack of research applicable to this region as well as to a lack of understanding of how these systems can address the social and technological challenges faced by these farmers. The latest advances in agroecological farming systems are reviewed here to enable small-scale farmers to better assess the benefits relative to ecosystem services that are compatible with their needs. One such service is the provision of food through nutrient cycling. Available nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are the most limiting nutrients in the soils, which are acidic in nature, of this high-rainfall area of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. This results in poor crop productivity and quality, particularly in smallholder, rural farming systems. High costs of chemical fertilizers, which most smallholder farmers cannot afford, and cropping systems involving monoculture, exacerbate the macro-nutrient deficiency, which leads to low crop yields and quality, feed scarcity, plant pests and diseases, resulting in reduced viable livelihoods and household food insecurity. One option to alleviate the situation is by the use of mixed cropping systems in the form of intercropping, the practice of growing two or more crop species at the same time and in the same place. This review explores, elucidates and summarizes the capability of intercropping to augment agroecosystem services essential for sustainability of smallholder, rural farming systems. The review highlights ways in which intercropping can address the socio-economic needs and aspirations of communities and conserve resources for the benefit of the local environment. Niche differentiation (facilitation and complementarity of resources); soil fertility; crop genetic diversity; management of pests, diseases and weeds; crop production; environmental sustainability and economic viability are discussed, as are the mechanisms underlying provisioning of ecosystem services. We have highlighted that intercropping farming systems considerably improve soil fertility, resource-use efficiency, carbon sequestration, phosphorus uptake and availability, water conservation in soils, crop and fodder productivity and quality and control pests and diseases compared with monoculture farming systems. The other major latest development in mixed-cropping systems is that crop genetic diversity resulting from intercropping contributes in various ways towards reducing incidences of pests and diseases. Technologies and mechanisms that have potential to enhance key ecosystem services for promoting sustainable food systems of rural farmers in KwaZulu-Natal are highlighted.

TI Economic and environmental performance of dryland wheat-based farming
   systems in a 1.5 degrees C world
SO MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB In 2015, the United Nations challenged the scientific community to evaluate development pathways consistent with the goal of limiting global average temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C. This study reports analysis that was carried out as part of a project responding to that challenge. Using recently developed methods for regional integrated assessment of agricultural systems, this study evaluates the economic and environmental performance of dryland farming systems in the United States of America (U.S). Pacific Northwest, a major wheat (Triticum aestivum) production region, under greenhouse gas mitigation and policy scenarios consistent with the 1.5 degrees C goal. A novel feature of this study is to combine bio-physical and economic models with site-specific life cycle analysis to evaluate both the economic performance of current and possible alternative farming systems. The analysis shows that these farming systems could be adapted through changes in management to reduce soil emissions of greenhouse gases and incorporation of new biofuel crops, and could be affected by changes in prices and costs of production associated with greenhouse gas mitigation policies. These changes could result in a win-win outcome for those farms in the Pacific Northwest region where site-specific conditions are suited to these adaptations, providing both higher farm incomes and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions reductions. A key implication for mitigation and adaptation strategies is the need to coordinate climate policy design and development of technologies needed to achieve policy goals.

TI Assessment of Soil Chemical Quality, Soil Microbial Population and Plant
   Growth Parameters Under Organic and Conventional Rice-Wheat Cropping
   System
SO AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
AB Low-input organic agriculture is preferred over conventional agriculture for its sustainability and environmentally friendly nature. In this investigation, a field trial experiment was conducted to unravel the effect of conventional and organic farming practices on soil health and productivity under rice-wheat cropping system. Moreover, the dynamics of microbial communities was analyzed under both the farming systems using denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and qRT-PCR techniques. This study found that the soil organic carbon was significantly higher under the organic farming system (0.63 +/- 0.3% in wheat and 0.88 +/- 0.2% in rice) than the conventional farming system (0.2 +/- 0.1% in wheat and 0.63 +/- 0.3% in rice). Quantification of 16S rDNA and nifH genes revealed higher abundance of total bacteria (2.52 x 10(11) in rice and 2.40 x 10(11) in wheat) as well as diazotrophs (8 x 10(6) in rice and 1.8 x 10(7) in wheat) under the organic farming system. Therefore, higher copy number of nifH genes in organic soil indicated that the diazotrophs played a significant role in supplying N for plant growth. DGGE band pattern authenticated that the bacterial diversity was higher under organic farming system. This study also showed that conventional practice gives comparatively more yield i.e. 0.29 t ha(-1) extra rice and 2.86 t ha(-1) more wheat than in organic farming. All other plant growth parameters are found higher in organic except nitrate reductase activity. This study signifies that organic farming is sustainable and can substitute the conventional practice for cost-effective, beneficial soil health and environmental sustainability for the long term.

TI Current status and future challenges in implementing and upscaling
   vertical farming systems
SO NATURE FOOD
AB Vertical farming can produce food in a climate-resilient manner, potentially emitting zero pesticides and fertilizers, and with lower land and water use than conventional agriculture. Vertical farming systems (VFS) can meet daily consumer demands for nutritious fresh products, forming a part of resilient food systems-particularly in and around densely populated areas. VFS currently produce a limited range of crops including fruits, vegetables and herbs, but successful implementation of vertical farming as part of mainstream agriculture will require improvements in profitability, energy efficiency, public policy and consumer acceptance. Here we discuss VFS as multi-layer indoor crop cultivation systems, exploring state-of-the-art vertical farming and future challenges in the fields of plant growth, product quality, automation, robotics, system control and environmental sustainability and how research and development, socio-economic and policy-related institutions must work together to ensure successful upscaling of VFS to future food systems.
   Vertical farming systems have the potential to form a part of resilient food systems through the production of reliable, high-quality crops in urban landscapes. This Review explores how multi-layer indoor crop cultivation systems currently operate and the conditions needed to upscale and support their integration into mainstream agriculture.

TI DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS UNDER POPULATION PRESSURE -
   AGRICULTURAL-DEVELOPMENT AND THE CASSAVA LIVESTOCK INTERACTION IN
   SMALLHOLDER FARMING SYSTEMS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB This paper identifies the pathways along which smallholder farming systems evolve in a context of population pressure in the cassava producing zones of Sub-Saharan Africa. The analysis indicates the existence of the cassava-livestock interaction. Particularly the use of cassava roots by pigs is important. Generally, two alternative development paths can be observed Land scarcity induced by population growth is the driving force behind them. For countries like Ivory Coast and Ghana, intensification of arable crop production including cassava is prevalent while in the East African countries, mixed crop (cassava)-livestock systems are emerging. The case of Nigeria is peculiar as farming systems evolve along both pathways. In the absence of population pressure and land scarcity extensive crop production systems evolve, as in Zaire. It is concluded that emphasis should be placed on institutional support and research that will encourage the productivity and sustainability of either systems. In Nigeria both policy strategies may have to be adopted.

TI Mapping future soil carbon change and its uncertainty in croplands using
   simple surrogates of a complex farming system model
SO GEODERMA
AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) in agricultural soils is vital for soil fertility for sustainable agricultural production and climate change resilience. Process-based farming system models are widely used to predict SOC dynamics in agricultural soils, but their application at regional scales is largely limited by computational requirements, data availability, and uncertainties in model predictions. Here we present an approach of combining a farming system model and a simplified surrogate model that emulates and mimics the behaviour of complex process-based models to predict SOC change (Delta SOC) and its uncertainty in Australian dryland cropping regions under anticipated climate change. We first calibrated and validated the farming system model APSIM for simulating Delta SOC (0-30 cm soil) using data from 90 farming-system trials at 28 sites across the study regions. Next we conducted a comprehensive simulation across the region using the validated APSIM model to predict Delta SOC over the period 2009-2070. Then simple surrogate models were developed based on the APSIM outputs. The surrogate models were able to explain > 96% of the variation in APSIM-predicted Delta SOC. Last the surrogate models were applied across the regions at the resolution of 1 km. In our simulations, Australian dryland cropping soils under farmers' common management practices and future climate conditions were a net carbon source (0.66 Mg C ha(-1) with the 95% confidence interval ranging from -5.79 to 8.38 Mg C ha(-1)) during the 62-year period. Across the regions, simulated Delta SOC exhibited great spatial variability ranging from -108.8 to 9.89 Mg C ha(-1) at the resolution of 1 km, showing significant (P < 0.05) negative correlation with baseline SOC level, temperature and rainfall, and positive correlation with pasture frequency (the duration of pasture in the rotation divided by the whole duration of the rotation) and nitrogen application rate. The uncertainty in Delta SOC and the underlying drivers were also assessed. This study presented a novel approach to efficiently predict future SOC dynamics and their uncertainty at fine resolutions, facilitating the development of site-specific management strategies for soil carbon sequestration.

TI Smallholder Agriculture and Climate Change
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES, VOL 42
SE Annual Review of Environment and Resources
AB Hundreds of millions of the world's poorest people directly depend on smallholder farming systems. These people now face a changing climate and associated societal responses. We use mapping and a literature review to juxtapose the climate fate of smallholder systems with that of other agricultural systems and population groups. Limited direct evidence contrasts climate impact risk in smallholder agricultural systems versus other farming systems, but proxy evidence suggests high smallholder vulnerability. Smallholders distinctively adapt to climate shocks and stressors. Their future adaptive capacity is uncertain and conditional upon the severity of climate change and socioeconomic changes from regional development. Smallholders present a greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation paradox. They emit a small amount of CO2 per capita and are poor, making GHG regulation unwarranted. But they produce GHG-intensive food and emit disproportionate quantities of black carbon through traditional biomass energy. Effectively accounting for smallholders in mitigation and adaption policies is critical and will require innovative solutions to the transaction costs that enrolling smallholders often imposes. Together, our findings show smallholder farming systems to be a critical fulcrum between climate change and sustainable development.

TI Microbial Community Analysis and Food Safety Practice Survey-Based
   Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment for Controlled Environment
   Hydroponic/Aquaponic Farming Systems
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB Hydroponic and aquaponic farming is becoming increasingly popular as a solution to address global food security. Plants in hydroponic systems are grown hydroponically under controlled environments and are considered to have fewer food safety concerns than traditional field farming. However, hydroponics and aquaponics might have very different sources of microbial food safety risks that remain under-examined. In this study, we investigated the microbiomes, microbial hazards, and potential bacterial transmission routes inside two commercial hydroponic and aquaponic farming systems using 16S-ITS-23S rRNA sequencing and a hydroponic food safety practice survey. The hydroponic farming system microbiome was analyzed from the fresh produce, nutrient solution, tools, and farmworkers. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes were the main components of hydroponic/aquaponic farming systems, with Pseudomonas being the most abundant genus in fresh produce samples. We further identified the presence of multiple spoilage bacteria and potential human, plant, and fish pathogens at the subspecies level. Spoilage Pseudomonas spp. and spoilage Clostridium spp. were abundant in the hydroponic microgreen farm and aquaponic lettuce farm, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrated the mapping of Escherichia coli 16s-ITS-23s rRNA sequence reads (similar to 2,500 bp) to small or large subunit rRNA databases and whole-genome databases to confirm pathogenicity and showed the potential of using 16s-ITS-23s rRNA sequencing for pathogen identification. With the SourceTracker and overlapping amplicon sequence variants, we predicted the bidirectional transmission route between plants and the surrounding environment and constructed the bacteria transmission map, which can be implemented in future food safety risk control plans.

AB With the increasing trend of GM crop areas, some concern is rising among those farmers whose intention is not to grow GM crops or who already grow in ecological farming system. Currently in the EU, a lot of discussions are being held in respect to the co-existence of GM crops with other conventional and ecological farming systems and their long-term sustainability. The most important measures for the successful co-existence are appropriate monitoring of GM crops (i.e. keeping records of sowing areas, labelling of GMO products), necessary keeping of isolation distance and therefore, cooperation and good communication amongst the neighbouring farmers.

TI Intensification and Upgrading Dynamics in Emerging Dairy Clusters in the
   East African Highlands
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Based on farmer and value chain actor interviews, this comparative study of five emerging dairy clusters elaborates on the upgrading of farming systems, value chains, and context shapes transformations from semi-subsistent to market-oriented dairy farming. The main results show unequal cluster upgrading along two intensification dimensions: dairy feeding system and cash cropping. Intensive dairy is competing with other high-value cash crop options that resource-endowed farmers specialize in, given conducive support service arrangements and context conditions. A large number of drivers and co-dependencies between technical, value chain, and institutional upgrading build up to system jumps. Transformation may take decades when market and context conditions remain sub-optimal. Clusters can be expected to move further along initial intensification pathways, unless actors consciously redirect course. The main theoretical implications for debate about cluster upgrading are that co-dependencies between farming system, market, and context factors determine upgrading outcomes; the implications for the debate about intensification pathways are that they need to consider differences in farmer resource endowments, path dependency, concurrency, and upgrading investments. Sustainability issues for consideration include enabling a larger proportion of resource-poor farmers to participate in markets; enabling private input and service provision models; attention for food safety; and climate smartness.

TI Agricultural Biodiversity Is Essential for a Sustainable Improvement in
   Food and Nutrition Security
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Agricultural biodiversity has hitherto been valued almost exclusively as a source of traits that can be used in scientific breeding programs to improve the productivity of crop varieties and livestock breeds. We argue that it can make a far greater contribution to increased productivity. In particular, a wider deployment of agricultural biodiversity is an essential component in the sustainable delivery of a more secure food supply. Diversity of kingdoms, species and genepools can increase the productivity of farming systems in a range of growing conditions, and more diverse farming systems are also generally more resilient in the face of perturbations, thus enhancing food security. Diversity can maintain and increase soil fertility and mitigate the impact of pests and diseases. Diversity of diet, founded on diverse farming systems, delivers better nutrition and greater health, with additional benefits for human productivity and livelihoods. Agricultural biodiversity will also be absolutely essential to cope with the predicted impacts of climate change, not simply as a source of traits but as the underpinnings of more resilient farm ecosystems. Many of the benefits of agricultural biodiversity are manifested at different ecological and human scales, and cut across political divisions, requiring a cross-sectoral approach to reassess the role of agricultural biodiversity in sustainable and secure food production.

TI Improved feeding and forages at a crossroads: Farming systems approaches
   for sustainable livestock development in East Africa
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB Dairy development provides substantial potential economic opportunities for smallholder farmers in East Africa, but productivity is constrained by the scarcity of quantity and quality feed. Ruminant livestock production is also associated with negative environmental impacts, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, air pollution, high water consumption, land-use change, and loss of biodiversity. Improved livestock feeding and forages have been highlighted as key entry point to sustainable intensification, increasing food security, and decreasing environmental trade-offs including GHG emission intensities. In this perspective article, we argue that farming systems approaches are essential to understand the multiple roles and impacts of forages in smallholder livelihoods. First, we outline the unique position of forages in crop-livestock systems and systemic obstacles to adoption that call for multidisciplinary thinking. Second, we discuss the importance of matching forage technologies with agroecological and socioeconomic contexts and niches, and systems agronomy that is required. Third, we demonstrate the usefulness of farming systems modeling to estimate multidimensional impacts of forages and for reducing agro-environmental trade-offs. We conclude that improved forages in East Africa are at a crossroads: if adopted by farmers at scale, they can be a cornerstone of pathways toward sustainable livestock systems in East Africa.

TI Bradyrhizobium inoculation has a greater effect on soybean growth,
   production and yield quality in organic than conventional farming
   systems
SO COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
AB Globally, organic farming and bradyrhizobia inoculation are gaining popularity as agronomically and environmentally sound soil management strategies with great potential to alleviate declining soil fertility, maintain environmental quality and enhance soybean production. However, the role of bradyrhizobia in organic farming system is poorly understood. Field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of bradyrhizobia inoculation and organic farming on growth parameters and yield quality of soybean varieties: SC squire, SB19 and Gazelle. The experimental treatments included native bradyrhizobia, commercial Bradyrhizobium japonicum, mixture of native + commercial bradyrhizobia and uninoculated control. The experimental design was a split-split plot, with three replications. The results demonstrated significant improvement in soybean nodule dry weight (NDW), shoot dry weight (SDW) and seed dry weight (SEDW) following bradyrhizobia inoculation. Remarkably, organic farming significantly out-performed conventional systems in nodulation, SDW and SEDW. Moreover, seed nutrient content differed depending on farming system; where nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and organic carbon were higher in organic farming. Soybean varieties differed significantly on SDW, NDW and SEDW; where SC squire performed better than SB19 and Gazelle. The results demonstrate the importance of organic farming and bradyrhizobia inoculation in enhancing soil fertility, yield production and quality, a key step towards sustainable food production.

TI Diversity of flower-visiting bees in cereal fields: effects of farming
   system, landscape composition and regional context
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB 1. Agri-environment schemes promote organic farming in an attempt to reduce the negative effects of agricultural intensification on farmland biodiversity and ecosystem services such as pollination. Farming system, landscape context and regional differences may all influence biodiversity, but their relative impact and possible interactions have been little explored.
   2. The study was performed in three regions (150 km apart, 400-500 km(2) per region) differing in land use intensity. Within each region, seven pairs of conventionally and organically cultivated wheat fields (mean size 4 ha, 42 study fields) were selected to encompass a gradient from heterogeneous to homogeneous landscapes within a 1-km radius around each field.
   3. Farming system had the greatest influence on biodiversity. Higher bee diversity, flower cover and diversity of flowering plants were recorded in organic compared with conventional fields. Bee diversity was related both to flower cover and diversity of flowering plants, suggesting plant-mediated effects of the farming system.
   4. Differences in bee diversity between organic and conventional fields increased with the proportion of arable crops in the surrounding landscape, indicating that processes at the landscape level modified the effectiveness of organic farming in promoting biodiversity. Similar patterns for flower cover and diversity of flowering plants suggested that landscape effects on bee diversity were mainly resource-mediated. After statistically removing the variance explained by flower parameters, residual bee diversity increased with increasing landscape heterogeneity.
   5. Bee diversity differed between the three regions, but the effects of farming systems and landscape context were independent of regional differences.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Bee diversity in wheat fields was mainly influenced by farming system, but an understanding of local bee diversity needs to incorporate both landscape and regional perspectives. The consistency of the results in three regions provides a reliable basis for management decisions. Agri-environment schemes that promote organic farming in homogeneous landscapes where there are few remaining flower-rich habitats could have the highest relative impact. However, while organic farming could help to sustain pollination services by generalist bees in agricultural landscapes, other measures are required to conserve more specialized bee species in semi-natural habitats.

TI Greenhouse gas emissions from Uganda's cattle corridor farming systems
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB The objective of this study was to estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from practised cattle farming systems (Stall, Semi-Intensive, Grazing, Tethering and Scavenging) and identify potential areas for GHG mitigation. Using the Global Livestock Environmental Assessment Model (GLEAM-i), GHG emissions in 2016 were 2009 Gg CO2-eq/yr of which the Grazing system contributed 88.5%. Enteric fermentation produced about 75.8% of the total GHG emissions. At an annual growth rate of 3%, the projected GHG for 2020 and 2025 would increase by 12.6% and 30.7% respectively. The milk and meat emission intensities were far higher than the global averages. A reduction in grazing by 10% and a 10% increase in use of anaerobic digesters to handle manure resulted in a 4.4% reduction in annual GHG emission.

TI Prospects of sustainable intensification of smallholder farming systems:
   A farmer typology approach
SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB Smallholder farming systems are highly diverse, owing to differences in farmers' resource endowments, levels of technology use, degree of market access and agro-ecological factors. Consequently, the prospects of achieving sustainable intensification of smallholder farming systems need to be examined vis-a-vis the dominant farmer typologies, so as to help craft effective and tailored interventions. The objective of this paper is to develop a methodology to establish farm typologies prevalent within the smallholder farming systems and infer their implications for the drive to achieve sustainable intensification of agriculture. A cross-sectional survey was carried out, covering 600 households in four regions of Ethiopia's Highlands. Multivariate statistical techniques of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis (CA) were used to group farmers into four distinct clusters. The study then compared relative levels of agricultural intensification and sustainability across the different typology clusters. The study found that households who are more commercially oriented and have larger landholdings, higher levels of productive assets and livestock ownership, exhibit higher levels of both agricultural intensification and relative sustainability. The study concludes that the farm typology approach has important policy application as it helps identify the set of socioeconomic characteristics of farmers that influence their propensity to achieve sustainable intensification.

TI Soil carbon sequestration, plant nutrients and biological activities
   affected by organic farming system in tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O.
   Kuntze) fields
SO SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
AB There is growing interest in investigations into soil carbon (C) sequestration, plant nutrients and biological activities in organic farming since it is regarded as a farming system that could contribute to climate mitigation and sustainable agriculture. However, most comparative studies have focused on annual crops or farming systems with crop rotations, and only a few on perennial crops without rotations, e.g. tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze). In this study, we selected five pairs of tea fields under organic and conventional farming systems in eastern China to study the effect of organic farming on soil C sequestration, plant nutrients and biological activities in tea fields. Soil organic C, total nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and magnesium (Mg), available nutrients, microbial biomass, N mineralization and nitrification were compared. Soil pH, organic C and total N contents were higher in organic tea fields. Soil microbial biomass C, N and P, and their ratios in organic C, total N and P, respectively, net N mineralization and nitrification rates were significantly higher in organic fields in most of the comparative pairs of fields. Concentrations of soil organic C and microbial biomass C were higher in the soils with longer periods under organic management. However, inorganic N, available P and K concentrations were generally lower in the organic fields. No significant differences were found in available calcium (Ca), Mg, sodium (Na), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) concentrations between the two farming systems. These findings suggest that organic farming could promote soil C sequestration and microbial biomass size and activities in tea fields, but more N-rich organic fertilizers, and natural P and K fertilizers, will be required for sustainable organic tea production in the long term.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
AB The context of agricultural production, climate change in particular, is increasingly requiring adaptations in the structure and management of farming systems. As explorers, implementers, testers and promoters of such adaptations, farmers and extension services have to be involved in the design process of adapted farming systems. However, the complexity of most design approaches produced by research (e.g. computer-model-based) keeps them outside the core of this process. Here we present a game called "forage rummy" developed to engage farmers and extension services in being the main players in livestock system design and evaluation. It relies on a number of "boundary objects" developed upon the conversion of scientific knowledge into more usable forms of support. These are a player-friendly game board based on a conceptual model of a livestock system on which flattened wooden sticks marked with year-round forage production and animal feeding requirements have to be assembled with the support of a computerized support system. Playing the game thus consists of repeated cycles of design of livestock systems adapted to scenarios of the agricultural production context and evaluation of their biophysical and organizational feasibility. An application to designing dairy systems adapted to climate change by 2050 is presented. As the first example of a game-based approach for farming system design, forage rummy proves to be useful in stimulating discussion, reflective and interactive analysis and learning about farming systems, their management and the scope for their adaptation. This is attributed to the researchers' effort to offer transparent and easily-usable forms of support to the design process. We conclude that the learning stimulated by the game could potentially lead to more consistent and concerted action between researchers, extension services and farmers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Evaluation of the sustainability of contrasted pig farming systems:
   economy
SO ANIMAL
AB The aim of this paper is to present an efficient tool for evaluating the economy part of the sustainability of pig farming systems. The selected tool IDEA was tested on a sample of farms from 15 contrasted systems in Europe. A statistical analysis was carried out to check the capacity of the indicators to illustrate the variability of the population and to analyze which of these indicators contributed the most towards it. The scores obtained for the farms were consistent with the reality of pig production; the variable distribution showed an important variability of the sample. The principal component analysis and cluster analysis separated the sample into five subgroups, in which the six main indicators significantly differed, which underlines the robustness of the tool. The IDEA method was proven to be easily comprehensible, requiring few initial variables and with an efficient benchmarking system; all six indicators contributed to fully describe a varied and contrasted population.

AB Highly developed farming systems, like flowerbulb production, are facing new challenges. Intensification and mechanisation have led to an increase of production, but have had negative side-effects on the environment as well. Research efforts have therefore focussed on finding solutions for environmental problems, caused by the modern farming systems. New technologies and strategies for integrated pest management and nutrient management were developed, but the implementation on a large scale was not successful. Even systems research, where new technologies were tested in the complexity of the farming system, did not result in a breakthrough. The cause for this lies in the social context of the farming system.
   The social context of flowerbulb production consists of many different stake-holders who all have their own, sometimes conflicting, goals. Among these stake-holders are national and local government, input suppliers, advisory services and environmental organisations.
   The Applied Plant Research (PPO) has started an initiative, where the different stakeholders who have an interest in flowerbulb production, are organised in a regional platform. PPO manages the exchange of information in the platform, where the aim is to agree on the steps to take towards sustainable flowerbulb production and to communicate these steps with one voice to the producers. This will result in the final goal of developing farming systems towards sustainable production. PPO brings results from research into the discussions and constraints that are faced by the platform of stakeholders are selected as new topics for the research agenda. The challenge for research institutes is to use this approach to reach a higher level of implementation of new developed strategies and technologies for sustainable development.

TI Post-NAFTA Changes in Peasant Land Use-The Case of the Patzcuaro Lake
   Watershed Region in the Central-West Mexico
SO LAND
AB Rural life in Mexico has changed drastically over the past several decades in the wake of structural reforms in the 1980s and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) implemented in 1994. Researchers predicted dire consequences for smallholder farmers following trade liberalization and in certain respects the prophecies have been fulfilled. Indeed, many regions experienced significant out-migration as smallholders, unable to compete with global maize imports without price subsidies, sold or abandoned their lands, making way for the expansion of industrial agriculture into forests, secondary vegetation and primary crops. Nevertheless, many smallholders have adapted to the new economic environment with farming systems that manage risk by diversifying portfolios to incorporate commercialized maize and livestock production. This article examines the evolution of smallholder farming systems since the mid 1980s, when the impact of neoliberal reforms emerged, using data collected from field research on 130 smallholder farms in the Patzcuaro Lake Watershed (PLW) in the State of Michoacan. Farmers in the PLW have been characterized as traditional peasant farmers, planting crops for subsistence, including a diverse array of domestic maize varieties and practicing limited animal husbandry with chickens, turkeys, pigs, an oxen and a cow or two for milk. But the results presented in this article show that the traditional peasant farming systems in the region have changed substantially to a highly diversified agriculture-cattle-forest system. Most notable changes include the use of fertilizers and pesticides; and the increase in livestock herd and reorientation to beef production. The results demonstrate the resilience of smallholder farmers, while at the same time raising potential concern that increased reliance on livestock and beef production specialization, might lead to shifts in farming systems that replace domestic maize varieties with hybrid corn used primarily for animal feed and thereby leaving vulnerable the genetic reservoir of traditional maize landraces.

TI Leveraging total factor productivity growth for sustainable and
   resilient farming
SO NATURE SUSTAINABILITY
AB Increased global agricultural output since the 1990s has been largely driven by innovations that raised the efficiency of use of labour, land, capital and other inputs-referred to as total factor productivity (TFP) growth. Yet debates over the future of farming still weigh heavily on models of agricultural land use and socioecological trade-offs along traditional (partial factor productivity) growth paths of 'intensification' or 'extensification'. Overlooking the role of TFP in the evolution of global agriculture not only obscures the changing drivers of productivity growth but also misses vital linkages with agricultural sustainability and farming system resilience. We describe two pathways for growth-technology-based and ecosystem-based-and link these in a heuristic framework that emphasizes sustainability and resilience outcomes in farming systems. Interdisciplinary research is urgently needed to empirically examine the dynamic interplay of TFP growth, farming system sustainability and resilience. Such insights will help to transform TFP growth as metric into actionable efforts on farms and beyond.

TI Current and emerging environmental challenges in Australian agriculture
   - the role of plant breeding
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
CT 12th Australasian Plant Breeding Conference
CY SEP 15-20, 2002
CL PERTH, AUSTRALIA
AB Dryland farming systems are evolving due to sustainability issues and market pressures that impact on growers; levels of atmospheric CO(2) and temperatures, both of which can dramatically impact on crop growth, are increasing at unprecedented levels; subsoil constraints and water stress remain. In this paper I assess the emerging and current environmental challenges to farmers and identify challenges and opportunities for plant breeders. Questions are raised which require debate. For example, crops will soon be growing at atmospheric CO(2) levels more than triple those in which they evolved. Should plant breeders be responding to the anticipated effects of elevated CO(2) and temperature? In other instances, issues are discussed which require immediate research by the plant breeding community. Examples of the latter are breeding crops that maximise water and nutrient use, either by increasing the rooting zone and/or improving the ability to grow roots into inhospitable subsoils; also, breeding crops specifically to overcome constraints imposed by farming systems. Immediate attention to these issues is required to sustain our landscape and agricultural systems as well as enhancing our ability to grow crops for an internationally competitive market place.

TI Changes in soil biological quality under legume- and maize-based farming
   systems in a humid savanna zone of Cote d'Ivoire
SO BIOTECHNOLOGIE AGRONOMIE SOCIETE ET ENVIRONNEMENT
AB Studying the impact of farming systems on soil status is essential in determining the most relevant for a given agroecological zone. Atrial was conducted in a West Africa humid savanna, aiming at assessing the short-term effects of farming systems on soil (0-10 cm) organic carbon (SOC) content and some soil microbiological properties. A randomized complete block experimental design with three replications, and the following treatments were used: Mucuna pruriens (Mucuna), Pueraria phaseoloides (Pueraria), Lablab purpureus (Lablab), a combination of these three legumes (Mixed-legumes), maize + urea (Maize-U), maize + triple super phosphate (Maize-Sp), maize + urea + triple super phosphate (Maize-USp), fertilizer-free maize continuous cropping (Maize-Tradi). Results indicated that SOC content was improved over time under legume-based systems. The relative increase was the highest with the legume association and Lablab, where SOC varied from 7.5 to 8.6 g.kg(-1) (i.e. 14.7%) and from 7.2 to 8.3 g.kg(-1) (i.e. 15.3%) respectively, between the start and the end of the trial. Besides, applying grass and maize residues as mulch on the ground, in association with inorganic fertilizers may be a way of improving SOC content in the short-term. Although legume-based systems exhibited highest values, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) did not show any statistical significant differences between treatments. However, soil C mineralization and soil specific respiration were influenced by the farming systems, with higher mean values under legume-based systems (42 +/- 7.6 mg C-CO2.g(-1) C-org and 0.4 mg C-CO2.g(-1) biomass C, respectively), compared to maize continuous cropping systems (33.1 +/- 1.6 mg C-CO2.g(-1) C-org and 0.3 mg C-CO2.g(-1) biomass C, respectively). Thus, these parameters can be used as sensitive indicators of the early changes in soil organic matter quality. The integration of legumes cover crops in farming systems may contribute to improve soil quality that would lead to sustainable agriculture in Cote d'Ivoire humid savannas.

TI The origin and hazard of inputs to crop protection in organic farming
   systems: are they sustainable?
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB Sustainability is defined as the ability of a system to 'continue'. In view of this definition, several aspects of the crop protection activity in organic farming are reviewed according to their ability to 'continue'. As no absolute measure of sustainability is available, this analysis takes the form of a comparison between organic and conventional crop protection methods. Two elements of crop protection are considered: one being the source of the inputs to crop protection and the other being the environmental hazard of the chemicals used in crop protection. In addition, the sustainability of some of the wider issues related to crop protection methods in organic farming are discussed. It is concluded that organic farming systems are not sustainable in the strictest sense. Considerable amounts of energy are input to organic farming systems, the majority of the compounds utilised in crop protection are derived from non-renewable sources and incur processing and transport costs prior to application. Further, these compounds are not without toxicological hazards to ecology or humans. Despite these problems, it is concluded that organic farming is probably more sustainable than conventional farming in a bio-physical sense. However, an assessment of the overall sustainability of farming systems may depend upon the valuation given by society to their inputs and outputs, and in this sense it is extremely difficult to assess which farming system is most sustainable.

TI Assessing the environmental impact of different crop protection
   strategies
SO AGRONOMIE
AB In 1993, a project was established to develop more sustainable arable farming systems. Fields were divided into two plots to compare the environmental and economic performance of conventional and integrated farming systems (IFS). As environmental impact assessment (EIA) techniques were, at that time, in their infancy, differences in crop protection strategies could only be evaluated using quantity of pesticide applied. EIA techniques are now more sophisticated and using data from the original project, potential impacts have been reassessed using the p-EMA model. The results show that using the quantity of pesticide applied as a surrogate indicator of risk is unsound, and that where the site has few sensitive habitats there may be little difference in predicted environmental impact between the different strategies. However, if the site is habitat-rich, IFS strategies can significantly lower the predicted risk. The results also demonstrate the need for substantial site and pesticide information to improve IFS strategies.

TI Assessment of the roles and farmer-preferred traits of sweetpotato in a
   crop-livestock farming system in Rwanda: implications for breeding
   dual-purpose varieties
SO OPEN AGRICULTURE
AB In Rwanda, sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas [L.] Lam) is a highly valued crop in a crop-livestock mixed farming system. The objective of this study was to assess the role of sweetpotato in the crop-livestock farming system, to identify farmer-preferred traits, and to establish farmer-led priorities in breeding dual-purpose varieties (DPVs) in Rwanda. A participatory rural appraisal (PRA) study was conducted in three selected districts of Rwanda, namely, Bugesera, Huye, and Nyagatare. Data on the uses of sweetpotato and farmers' trait preferences in sweetpotato varieties were collected and analysed. In Huye District, a high percent (56.7%) of respondents consumed sweetpotato every day, followed by Nyagatare with 53.3% consuming it at least twice a week. Most farmers (52.2%) used sweetpotato vines for livestock feed, depending on their availability. All respondents wanted to grow new sweetpotato varieties with improved root production combined with high aboveground biomass. About 87.7, 66.6, 56.6, and 51.1% of the respondents indicated that root-related traits of the crop such as high dry matter content (DMC), red skin colour, marketable root size, and yellow flesh colour were additional preferred traits, respectively. Therefore, farmers-preferred DPVs with improved root and green fodder yields could be developed to enhance the sustainable production and adoption of sweetpotato in a mixed farming system in Rwanda.

TI Assessing Spatial Variability of Soil Properties in Mediterranean
   Smallholder Farming Systems
SO LAND
AB Smallholder farming systems are typical of the European Mediterranean region. Small farms of less than 2 hectares cover approximately 15% of cropland in the southern EU and only 5% across the EU. The greater variability of cultivated species per unit of cropland (ha), the different approaches, and empirical application of cultivation practices by smallholder farmers increase the spatial variability of soil properties. Therefore, a decision support tool for effective management practices was formed based on a soil indicators set, which is sensitive to changes under agricultural management practices and different LUs. The data for this task were collected from 364 crop fields. The data were clustered and correlated based on (a) the existing soil units (SU): Fluvisols, Cambisols, Luvisols, and Calcisols, and (b) the LU: pastureland, annual, and permanent crops. Principal component analysis (PCA) identified up to seven main components that can better explain soil variability properties. The results indicated that the selected soil indicators can explain only 70.98% of soil variability. Clustering the parameters based on LU and SU can explain up to 80% and 82% of soil properties' variability, respectively. Factor analysis could function as a decision support tool for soil fertility management by farmers or policy makers, who aim to achieve higher yields, promote sustainable practices, maintaining, at the same time, a low cost of cultivation.

AB Organic farming which experienced a constant rise over the last two decades is a system based on sustainability and on a concept tending towards functional integrity. Legislation as well as the wish to produce separately from conventional farming raise the question whether organic farming should be conducted completely apart from conventional farming or not. This paper discusses the aspects that affect animal breeding under these circumstances, e.g., maintaining genetic diversity by using local breeds and possible G X E interactions which might occur when breeds adapted to conventional farming systems are used in organic farming. Ways of modelling G X E are presented, moreover examples of G X E in dairy cattle, swine, and poultry are given. Trends in selection index theory-designing multi-trait breeding goals including functional traits on one hand, and developing methods for using customised selection indices on the other hand-support breeding work for organic farming systems. It is concluded that before the technical issues can be addressed, all parties involved, farmers, consumers as well as legislators, have to agree on the socio-cultural conditions under which organic farming should be conducted.

AB The organic agricultural production is regarded as an important way to ensure food safety and achieve sustainable agricultural development. Presented in this paper is an emergy-based analysis of two typical chicken farming systems popular in China, i.e., family-operated organic rearing system and orchard-based field rearing system, from the perspective of production efficiency, environmental impact and the overall sustainability. In addition, the similar evaluation results conducted in Italy (scatter rearing system in grassland and conventional scale rearing system) was also introduced for reference and comparison. The results showed that the emergy yield ratio (EYR) was 1.10 and 1.11 for family-operated organic rearing system and field rearing system respectively. The values are approximately equal and very close to 1, indicating that each process of the two systems only converts resources from outside into product without much addition from local resources. However, the environmental loading ratio (ELR) of orchard-based field rearing system is 3.44, a little bit higher than the family-operated system 3.10, and correspondingly the sustainable index (ESI) is lower than that of family-operated organic rearing system. Despite being close to the concept of organic production practice with respect to rearing space for exercise and feeding patterns, the field chicken farming system has a relative poor performance with regard to environmental pressure and overall sustainability, which is attributable to the large amounts input of external purchased resources, e. g. the building material, drug, feed and so on. Compared with the other two production systems in Italy, the two systems in this study have higher economic cost and heavily rely on the nonrenewable resource inputs. It can be concluded that current so-called organic production model in China is far from the essence of real practice and therefore innovations in production techniques and institutional reforms associated with organic pattern are urgently needed in China.

TI Plant-microbial interactions in agriculture and the use of farming
   systems to improve diversity and productivity
SO AIMS MICROBIOLOGY
AB A thorough understanding of the services provided by microorganisms to the agricultural ecosystem is integral to understanding how management systems can improve or deteriorate soil health and production over the long term. Yet it is hampered by the difficulty in measuring the intersection of plant, microbe, and environment, in no small part because of the situational specificity to some plant-microbial interactions, related to soil moisture, nutrient content, climate, and local diversity. Despite this, perspective on soil microbiota in agricultural settings can inform management practices to improve the sustainability of agricultural production.

TI Maximising sustainability of Dutch dairy farming systems for different
   stakeholders: A modelling approach
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB A multi-attribute sustainability function is included into a dairy farm LP-model by using Weighted Goal Programming. The created Weighted Linear Goal Programming (WLGP)-model is used to maximise sustainability of different Dutch dairy fanning systems and to analyse the impact of. (1) maximisation of individual sustainability aspects (economic, social and ecological sustainability) and (2) maximisation of overall sustainability using references stakeholder Maximising the individual aspects of both dairy farming systems, i.e. conventional and organic, shows the trade-offs between different aspects of sustainability. For conventional as well as organic dairy farming maximum scores are highest for external social sustainability. The conventional dairy farm achieves a slightly higher score for overall sustainability than the organic dairy farm for all stakeholders (i.e. consumers and producers). This shows that it is possible for conventional dairy farms, similar to the conventional farm used in the analysis especially regarding the stocking density and under Dutch policy conditions, to achieve equal sustainability scores in comparison with organic dairy farms. it is concluded that the WLGP model is a suitable tool to analyse the sustainability of different dairy farming systems.

TI Farmer Field Schools (FFSs): A Tool Empowering Sustainability and Food
   Security in Peasant Farming Systems in the Nicaraguan Highlands
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Farmer field schools (FFSs) emerged in response to the gap left by the worldwide decline in agricultural extension services. With time, this methodology has been adapted to specific rural contexts to solve problems related to the sustainability of peasant-farming systems. In this study we draw upon empirical data regarding the peasant-farming system in the Nicaraguan highlands to evaluate whether FFSs have helped communities improve the sustainability of their systems and the food security of their residents using socioeconomic, environmental, and food and nutrition security (FNS) indicators. In order to appreciate the long-term impact, we studied three communities where FFSs were implemented eight, five, and three years ago, respectively, and we included participants and nonparticipants from each community. We found that FFSs have a gradual impact, as there are significant differences between participants and nonparticipants, and it is the community that first implemented FFSs that scores highest. The impact of FFSs is broad and long lasting for indicators related to participation, access to basic services, and conservation of natural resources. Finally, this paper provides evidence that FFSs have the potential to empower farmers; however, more attention needs to be paid to critical indicators like production costs and the use of external inputs in order to scale up their potential in the future.

TI Design of Farm Assessment Index (FAI) for a holistic comparison of
   farming practices: case of organic and conventional farming systems from
   two Indian states
SO AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB A holistic set of indicators using a stock and flow framework is used to assess farming practices across socio-economic and ecological dimensions. We design a methodology to estimate, normalize, and aggregate the indicators to form composite indices. The indicators under each dimension are aggregated using the progressive weighted average to give three-dimensional indices viz. economic, social, and ecological indices, which are aggregated to give a single holistic index called Farm Assessment Index (FAI). Unlike other approaches where the comparison of farming system is restricted within the sample under study, normalization of indicators using regional averages makes the FAI suitable for universal comparisons of farming systems across crops and regions. The methodology was applied to evaluate farming practices of 60 organic and 60 conventional farmers, from two Indian states over three years. The results from the application of the FAI demonstrates that the focus on yield or income as the sole indicator for policy decisions will not lead to sustainable farming systems. Policy makers need to shift toward holistic measures emphasizing human health, the livelihood of farmers and sustenance provided by agroecology. Case studies prove FAI to be a valuable tool for decision-makers in assessing farm practices and designing better agricultural policies and programs.

TI Response of Soil Microbial Communities to Different Farming Systems for
   Upland Soybean Cultivation
SO JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN SOCIETY FOR APPLIED BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Organic farming for sustainable agriculture depends on the effects of microbial activities in the soil. The present study evaluated seasonal changes in the soil microbial communities by fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) in an organic farming system (OFS) with rye rotation cropping management compared to those in a conventional farming system (CFS) with chemical fertilizers, pesticide and herbicide from May 2009 to October 2010 in an upland field. Concentrations of total bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, fungi, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the OFS were significantly higher than those in the CFS during soybean-growing stages (p < 0.001). The communities of total bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, actinomycetes and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the CFS soils were significantly higher than those in the OFS soils (p < 0.001), whereas the community of fungi was significantly lower in the CFS soils than in the OFS soils (p < 0.05) due to decreasing Gram-positive bacteria. OFS had a significantly lower ratio of cy19:0/18:1 omega 7c compared with CFS, indicating microbial stress decreased (p < 0.001). In principal component analyses of soil microbial communities, our findings suggested that Gram-positive bacteria should be considered as potential factor responsible for the clear microbial community differentiation observed between OFS and CFS in upland fields.

AB Sustainability of agricultural production systems is often evaluated in terms of their impacts on ecological, socio-cultural and economic aspects. Here it is presumed that each of these sustainability aspects is particularly associated with a system level. Ecological sustainability is associated with the system level of highest aggregation. Threats to biodiversity and the global climate act on continental or global scale. Economic sustainability, on the other hand, is the governing factor at relatively low aggregation levels (e.g. a farm). Socio-cultural sustainability has a relatively qualitative nature. It deals with collective human affinity with culture (which includes agriculture) and history, and it affects the way in which nature, landscape and agricultural production systems are appreciated. Socio-cultural sustainability is of particular importance at the regional level. A feature common to all kind of hierarchies is that higher system levels have priority of action over lower system levels. This implies that higher-system-level demands for ecological and socio-cultural sustainability should put constraints for development of lower system levels. Farm sustainability still depends largely on economics. Hence, sustainability implies that more collective system levels (global, national and regional) have the privilege of putting constraints on more individual levels (farms), but also the duty of securing the economic needs of individual farmers. It is concluded that organic farming systems incorporate to a large extent ecological and socio-cultural values, and presently for organic dairy farmers in the Netherlands this is not at the expense of farm-economic sustainability.

TI Ecosystem services from smallholder dairy based integrated farming
   system vis-a-vis double cropping
SO AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB The focus toward specialized double cropping in the recent past and the resultant stagnant farm productivity, natural resource degradation, improper by-product recycling, and declining resource use efficiency warranted renewed efforts toward dairy-based integrated farming systems (IFS) approach. The small holder dairy-based integrated farming system (IFS) under present study resulted in production of 323% more wheat equivalent yield (27358 kg ha(-1)) and diverse provisioning services (grains, fruits, straw, green fodder, milk) as compared to groundnut-wheat double cropping system. The dairy-based IFS generated 82.7% more net return (2501 US$ ha(-1)year(-1)) with 1.52 benefit cost ratio, resulted in uniform distribution of income throughout the year (US$ 529 to 909 every month) and generated 251% more employment (418 man-days ha(-1)year(-1)) than double cropping. It provided regulating services in the form of improved soil fertility (19% more soil organic carbon), enhanced saturated infiltration capacity, higher carbon sequestration (552%) and was more dependent on indirect and renewable energy sources. The dairy-based IFS recorded more soil biodiversity (earthworm, fungal, and bacterial count) and better nutrient (100 Kg N, 45 Kg P, and 80 Kg K ha(-1) year(-1)), and by-product recycling (20.4 tonnes farm yard manure and 1.98 tonnes farm-compost) vis-a-vis double cropping system (supporting services) besides providing many cultural services. The study concluded that systems transformation through greater crops-livestock integration provides number of provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural services, and leads to sustainable food systems.

TI SUSTAINABLE PINEAPPLE FARM PLANNING BASED ON ECO- EFFICIENCY AND INCOME
   RISK: A COMPARISON OF CONVENTIONAL AND INTEGRATED FARMING SYSTEMS
SO APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Considering the growing commitment of countries to sustainable agriculture, an integrated approach that considers environmental and economic performance or eco-efficiency (EE) was applied to compare two different farming systems of two pineapple cultivars, Nanglae and Phulae, produced in the northern region of Thailand. Environmental performance was assessed based on a life cycle approach. Thus, the total environmental load expressed as a single score was quantified and used as an environmental indicator of EE. Results showed that the integrated farming system of pineapple production was more sustainable than the conventional farming practice. The results of EE were then incorporated into a sustainable farm model to identify an optimal farm plan that corresponds to an objective function under available resources and constraints. In the model, income risk in terms of the variability of selling price was considered as a key factor in farmers' decision making. To maximize income and EE, the model suggested growing Phulae pineapple through integrated farming in an entire farm area to achieve the defined objective functions. However, considering risk, a new risk-efficient farm plan was recommended by replacing part of the area of the integrated Phulae with the integrated Nanglae. Diversification is an effective risk-reducing technique as a combination between the integrated Nanglae and integrated Phulae that have negative co-variances can help to stabilize farm income by lowering aggregate risk.

AB Plant breeding has been with humankind since the beginning of civilization. Modern plant breeding, however, is a relatively recent development-just over 100 years. Recently with the increase in popularity of organic farming and farm sustainability, there is a growing interest in breeding for organic or low-input farming systems. These endeavors are in their earliest stages bringing to bear both traditional and modern plant breeding techniques to address the specific needs of organic and low-input farming. This chapter gives an overview of these early efforts, some of the techniques involved, as well as some of the social and philosophical concerns with breeding and crop improvement for low-input farming.

TI Agro-Ecological Indicators (AEIs) for Dairy and Mixed Farming Systems
   Classification: Identifying Alternatives for the Cuban Livestock Sector
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB Attainment of acceptable levels of land and labor productivity and low external input use is not a mutually exclusive proposition. This study examines characteristics of a range of current specialized dairy farming systems (DFS) and mixed (crop-livestock) farming systems (MFS) in Cuba to determine their efficiency in the process of food and feed production. The central question was whether the favorable results of MFS realized in a small-scale experimental system were also attainable in larger, commercial farms. To this end, we collected data on 93 farms from around the country for a period of 1 year. The farms were classified according to four predictor variables: farm type, years since conversion from DFS to MFS, proportion of land allocated to crops in rotation and farm size. Farms were compared based on 12 pre-selected Agro-Ecological Indicators (AEIs) by using analysis of variance and Tukey's HSD tests. The 12 AEIs were also subjected to a principal components analysis and related to the four predictor variables by reduced-rank regression, also known as redundancy analysis. Three farm types were distinguished: mixed farming experimental (MFe), mixed farming commercial (MFc) and specialized dairy farming (DFS). Total energy output per unit of farm area was on average four to six times higher on the mixed farms than on the specialized dairy farms, while protein output three to four times higher. Milk yield per unit of forage area was highest on MFe (2.4 Mg ha-1 yr-1), followed by MFc (1.7), while it was much lower (0.7) on DFS. The redundancy analysis revealed that MFe did only slightly better than MFc and was most opposite to DFS in terms of AEIs. In conclusion, the previous experimental findings were confirmed nationwide, thus demonstrating the benefits of MFS for agro-ecological performance in Cuba.

TI Multi-objective economic-resource-production optimization of sustainable
   organic mixed farming systems with nutrient recycling
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB This paper addresses the optimal design of mixed crop-livestock farming systems for resource efficiency, economic profitability, and environmental sustainability. The trade-offs among profit, water productivity, and organic matter accumulation are considered. We propose a novel optimization model that accounts for economics, crop cultivation, livestock production, water requirement, soil organic matter, and nitrogen cycling, among other important elements of organic farming systems. The resulting problem is a multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear fractional programming (MINLFP) problem, which consists of fractional objective function and nonconvex nonlinear constraints. After reformulating the nonconvex constraints into convex ones, we propose a tailored global optimization algorithm to solve the resulting MINLFP problem. We further present a case study on a 100 ha organic mixed crop-livestock farm with 19 types of crops, 22 types of crop products, 3 type of livestock, and 2 types of animal products to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model and solution methods. Computational results suggest that it is more profitable to produce more high value cash crops and milk; it is more water efficient to grow cash crops than fodder; and it generates more soil organic matter accumulation by growing more crops with larger amount of root stubble and enlarging the heard size.

   Participatory Design
AB Analyses of transition towards a more sustainable agriculture often identify two different pathways that can be linked to either strong or weak sustainability. In this interdisciplinary work, we aim at overcoming this narrow choice between these two alternatives, by offering a socio-agronomic characterisation of multiple agriculture models that currently coexist in Western economies. We use an agronomic typology of farming systems based on the role of exogenous inputs and endogenous ecosystem services in agricultural production, and on the degree of embeddedness of farming systems within local/global food systems. This typology identifies six agriculture models that we analyse in socio-economic terms. We then clarify the structuring principles that organise these models, and the social values underpinning their justification. This analysis enables us to discuss the efficiency conditions of political instruments.

TI Community structures and substrate utilization of bacteria in soils from
   organic and conventional fanning systems of the DOK long-term field
   experiment
SO APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB Preservation or improvement of soil quality and productivity is of major importance for sustainable agriculture. Microorganisms strongly influence these soil characteristics as they are involved in nutrient cycling, transformation processes and soil aggregate formation, as well as in plant pathology or plant growth promotion. A profound understanding of structure, dynamics and functions of soil microbial populations represents one key to the understanding and description of soil quality. Therefore, we analyzed longterm effects of three farmyard manure (FYM)-based farming systems, i.e. bio-dynamic (BIODYN), bio-organic (BIOORG) and conventional (CONFYM), on microbiological soil characteristics and compared them to long-term effects of minerally fertilized (CONMIN) and unfertilized (NOFERT) control systems. Furthermore, we compared these long-term effects of farming systems to short-term effects of the crops winter wheat and grass-clover ley. The DOK field experiment in Therwil, Switzerland, which was established in 1978, represents in a unique long-term comparison, allowing to approach these questions. Effects on microbiological soil characteristics were assessed with a polyphasic approach by analyzing soil microbial biomass, soil DNA content, colony forming unit (CFU) counts, community level substrate utilization (CLSU) patterns with Biolog (TM) EcoPlates, and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiles of bacterial 16S rRNA genes. The soil biomass parameters, i.e. microbial biomass, DNA content and CFU, were all strongly influenced by the farming systems, whereas only CFUs were significantly affected by the two crops analyzed. Differences among the FYM-based farming systems BIODYN, 13100RG and CONFYM were only significant for microbial biomass and DNA content. CLSU and T-RFLP profiling, on the other hand, allowed for consistent differentiation of soil bacterial community structure in relation to the influence of farming systems and crops. The analyses revealed that the main and highly significant effect on microbiological soil characteristics was related to FYM applications. Less strong but significant effects were caused by the two crops, i.e. winter wheat and grass-clover. Effects of the farming systems BIODYN, BIOORG and CONFYM on soil bacterial community structure were relatively weak and not significant. These results suggest that for successful soil quality management fertilization regime and crop rotation are of major importance and that polyphasic approaches are needed to describe and assess microbiological soil characteristics.

   The treatments were arranged in a split-plot design where farming system was used as main plot, and cultivar was used as split-plot. Each treatment had four replications.
   Significant differences were found among cultivars alone. Head weight and diameter of Grato 2 were higher than those obtained by Grato 1, Castellammare, Campagnano and C3 varieties. Number of 1(st) order heads per plant was the highest in Grato 2, while Grato 1, Campagnano, and Castellammare had the highest number of 2(nd) order heads. Highest precocity was expressed by C3 cultivar. Characters studied were not significantly affected by the farming systems and its interaction with cultivars. The non significant differences between conventional and low input system suggested that sustained artichoke yield can be achieved by using limited chemical input.

TI Developing pathways to improve smallholder agricultural productivity
   through ecological intensification technologies in semi-arid Limpopo,
   South Africa
SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB Agriculture faces an enormous global challenge of feeding nine billion people by 2050. This means a comprehensive intensification of agriculture is required. Ecological intensification is gaining momentum as a clearly defined vision for increasing agriculture productivity and sustainability. How ecological intensification could be tailored to benefit smallholder farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remains the major question. In this study, we develop pathways relying on ecological intensification technologies and suiting different farm types of smallholder agriculture. This study relies on multiyear engagements with agricultural experts and smallholder farmers in Ha Lambani, South Africa and leads to the identification of farmer groupings. We analyse 40 in-depth semi-structured interviews with farmers which leads to the identification of farming patterns and constraints. We present how farming systems analysis of challenges and constraints helps to identify and link specific ecosystem services with suitable ecological intensification options. We conclude that the expert-based classification of farmers offered a more contextualized representation of farming system heterogeneity, where tailored ecological intensification technologies could play a major role in improving agricultural productivity. Beyond this community, it emphasizes the need to consider farmers type heterogeneity as a strong decision parameter for targeting ecological intensification.

AB A methodical way of prototyping integrated and ecological arable farming systems (I/EAFS) in interaction with pilot farms is presented. It concerns a comprehensive and consistent approach of 5 steps. Step 1 is establishing a hierarchy of objectives considering the shortcomings of current farming systems in the region. Step 2 is transforming the objectives in a set of multiobjective parameters, to quantify them and establishing a set of multi-objective farming methods to achieve them. Step 3 is designing a theoretical prototype by linking parameters to farming methods and designing the methods in this context until they are ready for initial testing. Step 4 is laying out the prototype on at least 10 pilot farms in appropriate variants and testing and improving the prototype (variants) until the objectives, as quantified in the set of parameters, have been achieved (after repeated layout). Step 5 is disseminating the prototype (variants) to other farms with gradual shift in supervision from researchers to extensionists. This methodical method is being elaborated and tested by a European network of more than 20 research teams, sponsored by the European Union (AIR-concerted action). The teams express their achievements in a consistent set of 6 parts of an identity card of their prototype. The 6 parts of the EAFS-prototype of the author's team are presented to illustrate the methodical approach. Part 6 presents the state of the art. it shows that the desired results are progressively being achieved, which may be considered as the best proof of the effectiveness of prototyping.

TI Soil and fertilizer constraints to wheat and rice production and their
   alleviation in six intensive cereal-based farming systems of the Indian
   sub-continent and China
SO FOOD SECURITY
AB The growth of food production from an intensification of cereal-based cropping systems in India and China has received great attention by domestic and international research in recent years. Heavy use of fertilizers on fertile soils has been a crucial factor in the increased crop production, contributing greatly to food security, but there is rising concern about the sustainability of such practices in those countries. Based on an extensive survey of 246 key informants, this paper assessed yield losses of rice and wheat associated with soil (physical and fertility) constraints and fertilizer constraints in three major cereal-based farming systems on the Indian sub-continent (India, Bangladesh and Nepal) and three in China where cereal yields and production have risen substantially in past decades. For rice, respondents considered soil constraints to be important causes of lower yields, contributing about 6 % of their estimated yield gap (where the yield gap is made up from the losses associated with a wide range of constraints to crop production) for each of the three Chinese farming systems and 7.8-14.6 % of the yield gap for the systems on the Indian sub-continent. Fertilizer constraints were also important for rice in some of these intensive farming systems, and were associated with 10.5 % of the yield gap in the Indian Rice wheat system. For wheat, the highest yield reductions were reported in the Chinese systems, with losses of 9.7-17.5 % from soil and fertilizer constraints combined. Overall, soil constraints (such as the depletion of soil fertility and N deficiency) usually accounted for larger yield reductions with rice while fertilizer constraints (including insufficient use of N fertilizer, high cost or short supply of N fertilizer, poor management of fertilizer and inappropriate use of other (non-N) fertilizers) were considered more severe for wheat. This study underlined the importance of soil and fertilizer constraints for rice and wheat in major Indian and Chinese cereal-based farming systems, alongside other important constraints such as drought for rice and late planting and poor crop rotations for wheat. Respondents proposed numerous interventions to address the constraints, with systematic soil fertility testing programs, appropriate government subsidies for fertilizer, and better management of fertilizer nutrients being among the most popular. Integrated measures, customized for the different systems, and involving combinations of improved crop management and inputs, better varieties and appropriate policy or socioeconomic support, need to be taken step-by-step, to increase land productivity and improve the efficiency of fertilizer use in these intensive cereal farming systems that are vital for global food security.

TI Role of Pigeonpea Cultivation on Soil Fertility and Farming System
   Sustainability in Ghana
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
AB The productivity of the smallholder farming system in Ghana is under threat due to soil fertility decline. Mineral fertilizer is sparingly being used by smallholder farmers because of prohibitive cost. Grain legumes such as pigeonpea can play a complementary or alternative role as a source of organic fertilizer due to its ability to enhance soil fertility. Despite its importance, the potential of pigeonpea as a soil fertility improvement crop has not been exploited to any appreciable extent and the amount of land cultivated to pigeonpea in Ghana is vey negligible. This paper synthesizes recent studies that have been carried out on pigeonpea in Ghana and discusses the role of pigeonpea cultivation in soil fertility management and its implication for farming system sustainability. The paper shows that recent field studies conducted in both the semi-deciduous forest and the forest/savanna transitional agroecological zones of Ghana indicate that pigeonpea/maize rotations can increase maize yield by 75-200%. Barrier to widespread adoption of pigeonpea include land tenure, market, and accessibility to early maturing and high yielding varieties. The paper concludes among other things that in order to promote the cultivation of pigeonpea in Ghana, there is the need to introduce varieties that combine early maturity with high yields and other desirable traits based on farmers preferences.

TI The sustainability indicator industry: where to from here? A focus group
   study to explore the potential of farmer participation in the
   development of indicators
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
AB In Australia, the work being carried out on sustainability indicators has become an industry on its own. This paper firstly provides an introduction that reviews the literature on indicator development and use, particularly in relation to agricultural production systems. A number of reasons for the limited use of indicators by farmers are mentioned. Secondly, a focus group study involving farmers from two dryland cropping areas in Queensland to investigate sustainability indicators and sustainable farming systems is presented. The indicators the participants identified during focus groups included indicators that reflect (i) farming system components, (ii) the management of these components, (iii) the management of all components and their interrelationships at the systems level, and (iv) the external factors that influence and interact with this systems level. Focus group analysis also showed that the participants perceived sustainability as an on-going process and a sustainable farming system as dynamic and emergent in nature. The implications of these findings are discussed. Three key issues were raised (i) the value of farmer knowledge with respect to the development of indicators has often been ignored; (ii) there are links between indicators developed through traditional science and those being used by farmers; and (iii) off-farm indicators used by farmers may be very useful in policy development at a variety of levels (e.g. catchment, regional, national, global). The focus group method involving farmers provided a useful way to gain insights about farmer perceptions and for farmers to learn from each other during the research process.

SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB This paper analyses the forms and adaptability of the assignment and management of farm territories in mountain areas of the French Massif Central, where permanent grassland and cattle farming predominate. The spatial management of 33 farms, and its links with cattle management and other farming system conditions, were investigated. In-depth analyses of four of those farms are presented. The case studies confirm the role of known factors influencing land use, but also reveal that more complex and interrelated factors, such as equipment, labour and buildings, affect the spatial management of farms. Spatial management emerges as a key element in the fodder security of the system.

TI Economic and environmental performances of dairy goat farming systems :
   the impact of pasture
SO FOURRAGES
AB Economic and environmental performances of dairy goat farming systems : the impact of pasture In France, there is a diversity of daily goat farming systems. Over the last decades, the number of farmers using pasture to graze goats has significantly been decreased. This is particularly true of goat farms in western France. However the ever-increasing cost of inputs and the increased awareness of environmental issues may well inverse this trend and promote a return to the use of pasture for grazing animals. Survey results of goat farming networks show that using pasture to graze animals could reduce the need for added concentrate feed and cut down global feeding costs. Gross margin is also increased when pasture is properly managed. These grazing systems, which are more reliable in a context of high price volatility, are more sensitive to climatic conditions. Using pasture for grazing animals changes the way farmers work and reduces energy consumption.

TI Assessment of social sustainability components in agriculture sector of
   Iran using a systemic approach
SO PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT
AB The present descriptive correlational study focused on assessing the social sustainability of intercropping-based family farming systems and agricultural cooperative systems with a systemic approach. The statistical population was composed of the villages in Shiraz County of Fars Province, Iran that were engaged in intercropping and production cooperative systems. In the first step, 186 farmers who were using intercropping-based family farming system were taken by enumeration technique. In the second step, 200 members of the agricultural cooperatives of this county were sampled by the stratified random sampling technique with proportional allocation. The research instrument was a self-designed questionnaire, and data were analyzed by the SPSS22 software package. The results showed that the components of existence and effectiveness were assigned with the highest weight in family farming systems and the components of coexistence and adaptability were allocated with the highest weight in the cooperative systems. The results of the assessment by Morris' model implied that none of the components of social sustainability was at a sustainable level. The results of discriminant analysis of farmers' characteristics in terms of social sustainability level revealed that nine components could account for social sustainability level: literacy level, coexistence, family size, income, freedom of action, existence, equality, accountability, and effectiveness.

TI Alternative Land Management Strategies and Their Impact on Soil
   Conservation
SO AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB Soil conservation is threatened by a number of factors, namely the effects of intensive agricultural practices, the increasing pressure for food production linked to the increasing human population, the consumption patterns in developed and emerging economies, and the conversion of agriculture from the production of commodities (which is itself a goal in need of discussion) to the production of biofuels. The extent of human pressure and the effects of conflicting land use systems need to be addressed. Alternative and conservative agricultural practices need to be explored and widely adopted in order to preserve the soil fertility, assessing their pros and cons. In this paper, the main potential alternative practices are reviewed, focusing in particular on organic farming. It is also argued that in order to better plan to preserve soil health a strategy considering the whole food system is required.

AB Organic farming systems contribute to enhance food security and agricultural sustainability. with the potential to increase farmer's income when external input costs are reduced. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the influence of organic farming on soil quality (respiration-CO2), yield and head quality (chlorogenic acid and cynarin concentration) of globe artichoke (Cynara cardunculus). Both experiments were conducted over two growing seasons, October 2014 to June 2016. In the first experiment, we compared organic and conventional farming systems while organic matter fertilizer source (plant- vs. animal-based) evaluation was considered in the second experiment. For the first experiment, eight cultivars were used; 'Deserto', 'Lulu', 'Romolo', '11-018', '12-179', 'Green Globe Improved' and 'Imperial Star'. The cultivar '12-179' was used for the second study in order to screen plant-based (alfalfa meal) and animal-based (fish meal, blood meal, and chicken manure) fertilizers for soil health, yield and head quality. Conventional farming had higher plant marketable yield compared to organic. Conversely, artichoke head from organic farming had 31% chlorogenic acid and 12% cynarin higher than conventional system. Interestingly, organic farming improved the soil health indicator (respiration-CO2) by 20-fold compared to conventional. Although cultivar response to soil farming system treatments was inconsistent across the study period (2015-2016), 'Imperial Star' had the lowest marketable yield and head quality. After two years of organic soil amended with animal-based fertilizers, marketable yield was higher than soil amended with plant-based fertilizer. However, alfalfa meal (plant-based) organic fertilizer increased soil respiration by about 3.5-fold compared to animal-based (fish meal, blood meal, and chicken manure) organic fertilizers at the end of the experiment. In addition, concentrations of phytochemicals (chlorogenic acid and cynarin) in artichoke heads grown in soil amended with alfalfa meal were higher than in those grown with animal-based fertilizers.

TI Exploring future changes in smallholder farming systems by linking
   socio-economic scenarios with regional and household models
SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB We explore how smallholder agricultural systems in the Kenyan highlands might intensify and/or diversify in the future under a range of socio-economic scenarios. Data from approximately 3000 households were analyzed and farming systems characterized. Plausible socio-economic scenarios of how Kenya might evolve, and their potential impacts on the agricultural sector, were developed with a range of stakeholders. We study how different types of farming systems might increase or diminish in importance under different scenarios using a land-use model sensitive to prices, opportunity cost of land and labour, and other variables. We then use a household model to determine the types of enterprises in which different types of households might engage under different socio-economic conditions. Trajectories of intensification, diversification, and stagnation for different farming systems are identified. Diversification with cash crops is found to be a key intensification strategy as farm size decreases and labour costs increase. Dairy expansion, while important for some trajectories, is mostly viable when land available is not a constraint, mainly due to the need for planting fodders at the expense of cropland areas. We discuss the results in relation to induced innovation theories of intensification. We outline how the methodology employed could be used for integrating global and regional change assessments with local-level studies on farming options, adaptation to global change, and upscaling of social, environmental and economic impacts of agricultural development investments and interventions.

TI Yield and bulb quality of storage onion cultivars as affected by farming
   system and nitrogen dose
SO SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE
AB The need of sustainable management system is connected both to environmental safeguarding and to the increasing consumers' demand for safety and premium-quality food. A research was carried out to assess the interactions between 2 farming systems (organic, conventional), 4 nitrogen doses (100, 133, 166.5, 200 kg center dot ha- 1 N) and 11 cultivars on yield, quality, antioxidants, elemental composition and heavy metals content of storage onion bulbs. The bulb yield of six out of eleven cultivars was significantly greater in the conventional farming than in the organic one, with Ramata di Montoro and Rossa di Tropea showing the best performances, even in terms of plant dry weight, under both farming systems; Tosca reached the highest leaf area index. The conventional farming system also led to higher bulb yield, dry weight, nitrate content and ascorbic acid compared to the organic one for most cultivars, whereas quercetin was better affected by the organic management. The 166.5 and 200 kg center dot ha- 1 N doses resulted in the highest yield as well as Leaf Area Index (LAI), and 200 kg center dot ha- 1 N also enhanced dry weight, nitrate content and ascorbic acid. The 100 kg center dot ha- 1 N supply elicited the highest bulb storability, whereas 166.5 kg center dot ha- 1 N led to the highest bulb dry matter, soluble solids, total sugars, macroelements and most microelements. The 133 kg center dot ha- 1 N dose resulted in the highest monosaccharides, titratable acidity, quercetin, polyphenols, and Antioxidant Activity (AOA). The cultivar Ramata di Montoro showed the highest values of soluble solids, total sugars, monosaccharides and pungency. The cultivar Rosies des Aries displayed the lowest bulb storability, along with Rossa di Tropea, and the highest dry matter together with Grenada, Tosca and Zolotnichek. Polanowska attained the highest levels of antioxidants, AOA and macroelements. The highest bulb accumulation of microelements and heavy metals differed with the cultivar, though Ramata di Montoro showed the lowest accumulation of most heavy metals. Based on the outcome of the present research, the conventional farming system is recommendable in terms of yield, for the 55% of the storage onion cultivars examined, whereas the organic management improves the overall bulb quality, and the 166.5 kg center dot ha- 1 N represents the most effective dose for achieving the best compromise between yield and quality.

SO ANNALS OF ARID ZONE
AB An attempt was made to study the alternative cropping systems in arid zone of Rajasthan, in comparison to arable farming; The silvopasture based livestock grazing system (silvopastoral systems), hortipasture and arable farming were compared. The silvopastoral and hortipasture systems were more profitable than arable farming system at 12 and 20% discount rates. Sensitivity analysis, further, confirm the results. However, the silvopastoral system with sheep grazing at 20% discount rate is not viable in most cases. Under new economic policy and GATT agreement, the alternative farming system is considered to be more viable, which would not only improve the living standard of the region but also improve the ecological balance and sustainability of the arid zone of Rajasthan.

TI AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO PRODUCE FORAGE CROPS: BARLEY FODDER IN
   VERTICAL FARMING SYSTEM
SO SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES A-AGRONOMY
AB The rapid growth of the world's population, limited natural resources and environmental challenges caused by climate change have had brought up global food security to the agenda. Scientific researches and new practices considering sustainable food production and efficient use of natural resources are getting more attention during last decades all around the world. Furthermore, advanced technological applications that enable new agricultural production systems such as vertical farm have been starting to emerge to provide a solution on this issue. Vertical farming which is the method of growing crops in vertically stacked layers under controlled environment is one of the promising techniques to protect environmental resources, provide continuous and sustainable plant production. Applications of vertical farming have already experienced in many countries such as Japan, Singapore, England, USA, Netherlands and the vertical agricultural market is expected to increase by 25% by 2024 to reach 11.4 billion Euro. Plant groups that are widely grown with vertical farming system are mostly; carrot, radish, potato, tomato, pepper, pea, cabbage, spinach, lettuce and strawberries. Although, cereal grain production in the vertical systems is not economically profitable today, considering remarkable increase in demands on forage crops, barley fodder production seems to have great potential for vertical farming systems. The benefits of the system such as less water use (about 90%), no herbicides, pesticides and fertilizer application relative to conventional production would be more pronounced for barley fodder in vertical system comparison to other conventional forage crops production systems. In this review, potential of barley fodder production in vertical farming system was discussed.

TI Conservation Agriculture farming systems in rainfed annual crop
   production in South Africa
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PLANT AND SOIL
AB South Africa is, relative to the rest of the world, a water scarce country with a limited amount of arable land, especially land with a long-term sustainable agricultural production potential. Agriculture should therefore focus on the implementation of soil and water conservation systems. Soil conservation is administered in the South African legislation under the Conservation of Agricultural Resources Act 43 of 1983. The objective of this paper is to summarise conservation agriculture (CA) systems practiced in South Africa. These include measures to control wind and water erosion as well as soil compaction through implementation of rip on the row, vertical mulching, controlled traffic, crusting control, mulching, water harvesting and crop rotation. No-tillage is not in the scope of this paper, although aspects of reduced and minimum tillage are covered. Integrating these with existing farming systems could be complex and should be considered with great care. It is proposed that CA specialists should be trained to assist farmers in the selection, adoption and implementation of appropriate CA systems.

TI Stakeholder perspectives to improve risk management in European farming
   systems
SO JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB The challenges faced by agricultural systems call for an advance in risk management (RM) assessments. This research identifies and discusses potential improvements to RM across 11 European Union (EU) farming systems (FS). The paper proposes a comprehensive, participatory approach that accounts for multi-stakeholder perspectives relying on 11 focus groups for brainstorming and gathering suggestions to improve RM. Data analysis is based on content analysis and coding of suggested improvements, and their assessment through the lenses of main challenges faced, farms' flexibility, and dependence on subsidies. First, the results show that necessary improvements differ depending on whether they have their origin in sudden shocks or long-term pressures. Second, farm dependence on direct payments determines a stronger need to improve financial instruments, whereas farm flexibility suggests a need for more accessible and tailored tools for low-flexibility FS, and increased know-what and know-how for high-flexibility FS. Third, our findings indicate a potential for extending stakeholder involvement in RM to new or unconventional roles. Underlying specific improvements, the paper suggests and discusses three main avenues to improve RM as a whole: i) a developed learning and knowledge network; ii) new forms of collaboration; and iii) integrated financial and policy instruments.

TI ECONOMIC-ASPECTS OF LEGUME MANAGEMENT AND LEGUME RESEARCH IN DRYLAND
   FARMING SYSTEMS OF SOUTHERN AUSTRALIA
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB Legumes have played an increasingly important role in Mediterranean farming systems of southern Australia. The paper describes and explains the key factors and interactions which affect a farmer's management decisions regarding legume crops and pastures. These management decisions include which species to grow, which soil types to grow them on, which rotations to practise, and which tillage practices to adopt. These decisions are affected by a wide range of factors which are discussed here under five headings: short-term profit factors, dynamic factors, sustainability factors, risk factors and whole-farm factors. The difficulty and complexity of integrating all these factors into management decisions is outlined. Numerical examples are drawn from experiences with the whole-farm bioeconomic model MIDAS.

TI Understanding transitions in farming systems and their effects on
   livestock rearing and smallholder livelihoods in Telangana, India
SO AMBIO
AB Increasing food demands are causing rapid transitions in farming systems, often involving intensified land and resource use. While transitioning has benefits regarding poverty alleviation and food outputs, it also causes environmental and social issues over time. This study aims to understand the transitions in farming systems in a region in Telangana, from 1997 to 2015, and their effect on livestock rearing and smallholder livelihoods. We also examine the impact of the transitions on lower caste groups and women in particular. We collected data using a combination of methods, i.e., a household survey, focus group discussions, and secondary data sources, to build a comprehensive picture of the transitions in the region. We found that subsistence mixed farming systems transitioned to market-orientated specialized systems over a short time span. As the transition process gained momentum, households either intensified their production or got marginalized. Technological interventions, development programs with integrated approaches, and market demand for certain agricultural produce triggered increased regional production but also led to the scarcity of water, land, and labor. The transitions marginalized some of the households, changed the role of livestock in farming, and have been inclusive of both lower caste groups and women in terms of increased ownership of large ruminants and access to technologies. However, for women specifically, further increase in workload in the context of farming is also found.

TI Strengths, weakness, opportunity and threats (SWOT) analysis for farming
   system businesses management: Case of wheat farmers of Shadervan
   District, Shoushtar Township, Iran
SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB Strengths, weakness, opportunity, and threats (SWOT) analysis indicates a framework for helping the researchers or planners to identify and priorities the business's goals, and to further identifies the strategies of achieving them. SWOT analysis is a technique to analyze the Strengths, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threats of business. In all countries, farming practices have vital role to food security. Population growth is the major reason for increased food demands and it puts additional pressure on the natural resource. Countries with rapid population growth face especially difficult challenges in ensuring food security. Therefore, using SWOT analysis identify strategies for agricultural development especially in farming systems and helping the researchers or planners to management and priorities them for achieving food security. The location of research was rural areas of Shadervan district of Shouahtar Township, Iran. The population of study was wheat farmers (N = 1950). The sample size (n = 165) selected by random sampling. Based on the results of SWOT, strategies for farming system management were prioritized. It include: development of poor local market opportunities and infrastructure, planting of crops with high economic values, development of governmental supports, preparing strategic plans to development organic farming, considering quality of crops, considering farm sustainability indexes, using sustainable water resources management and development of extension programs based on farmers needs.

TI Responsible Agricultural Mechanization Innovation for the Sustainable
   Development of Nepal's Hillside Farming System
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Agricultural mechanization in developing countries has taken at least two contested innovation pathways-the "incumbent trajectory" that promotes industrial agriculture, and an "alternative pathway" that supports small-scale mechanization for sustainable development of hillside farming systems. Although both pathways can potentially reduce human and animal drudgery, the body of literature that assesses the sustainability impacts of these mechanization pathways in the local ecological, socio-economic, cultural, and historical contexts of hillside farms is either nonexistent or under-theorized. This paper addresses this missing literature by examining the case of Nepal's first Agricultural Mechanization Promotion Policy 2014 (AMPP) using a conceptual framework of what will be defined as "responsible innovation". The historical context of this assessment involves the incumbent trajectory of mechanization in the country since the late 1960s that neglected smallholder farms located in the hills and mountains and biased mechanization policy for flat areas only. Findings from this study suggest that the AMPP addressed issues for smallholder production, including gender inequality, exclusion of smallholder farmers, and biophysical challenges associated with hillside farming systems, but it remains unclear whether and how the policy promotes small-scale agricultural mechanization for sustainable development of agriculture in the hills and mountains of Nepal.

TI Increasing land pressure in East Africa: The changing role of cassava
   and consequences for sustainability of farming systems
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB Increasing land pressure during the past three to four decades has transformed farming systems in the mid-altitude zone of East Africa. Traditional millet-, cotton-, sugarcane- and/or banana-based farming systems with an important fallow and/or grazing component have evolved into continuously cultivated cassava or cassava/maize-based systems. Within three to four decades, cassava cultivation increased from 1-11 to 16-55% of cropped fields in our six study sites. Declining soil fertility, and not labour or food shortage, was apparently the primary trigger for this transformation. The land use changes have increased nutrient offtakes and reduced nutrient recycling rates. Cassava and maize now account for 50-90% of nutrient removal, Whereas single-season fallows were the most important source of nutrient recycling on cropped fields in the past, currently cassava litterfall and maize stover contribute roughly 70% of nutrient recycling, with 50-70% of N, P and K recycled in cassava litterfall. This may explain why many farmers reason that cassava 'rests' the soil. With increasing land use pressure farmers progressively use cassava as an 'imitation fallow' throughout their farm, Farmers increasingly target cassava to poor fertility fields characterized by low pH and available P. High cassava intensities are nonetheless maintained on more fertile fields, probably to guarantee regeneration of soil fertility on all fields. Once cassava is targeted to poor fertility soils, farmers have run out of low-input management options and need to intensify management to maintain system productivity. As cassava is now used by more farmers and on a larger acreage than fallowing in the studied farming systems, cassava cropping could perhaps serve as an excellent entry point to strengthen system sustainability.

TI New challenges for cattle - grassland management in the light of
   agroecology
SO FOURRAGES
AB In a fast changing global context, intensive cattle farming systems are reaching their limits (environmental, economic, societal ...). The increasing tension between global food demand, the preservation of resources and job opportunities in rural areas calls into question intensive beef and dairy farming, and the fact that cattle is increasingly fed on grains. This is particularly true in the US, but also in France, Europe and Asia. From now on, new farming systems will have to be developed in a more coherent way, one that takes into consideration local forage resources and cattle type, makes the most of available grassland not needed for feeding humans, and promotes additional ecosystem services and local produce with a more typical flavour. Agroecology lays down new benchmarks and defines new challenges for cattle-grassland management and for tomorrow's cattle farming systems.

TI Biodynamic vs conventional farming effects on soil structure expressed
   by simulated potential productivity
SO SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
AB Effects of alternative farming systems on soil structure need to be quantified to judge the sustainability of the systems. This study was conducted to compare two farming systems by converting ''static'' basic soil properties into a ''dynamic'' assessment using simulation modeling. Increasingly popular biodynamic farming systems use no commercial fertilizers and pesticides but apply organic manure and compost. Soil conditions on four fields on two farms where biodynamic and conventional soil management had been practiced for about 70 yr were investigated with morphological and physical methods. Soils (loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Fluvaquents) were pedologically identical. Four procedures were used to express differences in soil structure as a function of different management: (i) morphological description; (ii) measurement of basic and static soil parameters such as bulk density, organic matter, and porosity; (iii) measurement of soil hydraulic characteristics; and (iv) determination of simulated water-limited yields. The latter procedure provides a criterion that is quantitative, is directly related to a practical aspect of soil behavior, and reflects the highly nonlinear soil-water processes. The WAVE simulation model was used to predict water-limited potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) yields with climatic data of 30 yr. Basic static soil parameters were not significantly different but simulated yields were significantly different and were 10200 and 10300 vs. 9400 and 9700 kg dry matter tuber yield ha(-1) yr(-1) for the biodynamic and the conventional fields, respectively. Simulation modeling of crop yields thus provides a relevant expression for the production potential of the two different farming systems.

TI Upper limits to sustainable organic wheat yields
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Current use of mineral nitrogen (N) fertilizers is unsustainable because of its high fossil energy requirements and a considerable enrichment of the biosphere with reactive N. Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) from leguminous crops is the most important renewable primary N source, especially in organic farming. However, it remains unclear to which degree BNF can sustainably replace mineral N, overcome the organic to conventional (O:C) yield gap and contribute to food security. Using an agronomic modelling approach, we show that in high-yielding areas farming systems exclusively based on BNF are unlikely to sustainably reach yield levels of mineral-N based systems. For a high reference wheat yield (7.5 t ha(-1)) and a realistic proportion of fodder legumes in the rotation (33%) even optimistic levels of BNF (282 kg N ha(-1)), resulted in an O:C ratio far below parity (0.62). Various constraints limit the agricultural use of BNF, such as arable land available for legumes and highly variable performance under on-farm conditions. Reducing the O:C yield gap through legumes will require BNF performance to be increased and N losses to be minimised, yet our results show that limits to the productivity of legume-based farming systems will still remain inevitable.

TI Fuzzy logic indicators for the assessment of farming sustainability
   strategies in a tropical agricultural frontier
SO AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Assessing the sustainability of agricultural systems encompasses complex and interchanging economic, environmental and social issues, and requires multi-criteria decision-analysis approaches. Various models have been proposed to assess agricultural sustainability considering these issues, based for example on programs for multi-attribute decision making or Fuzzy Interference Systems. However, we identify a lack of comprehensive models applicable to broad agricultural conditions in different environments and socioeconomic contexts. To fill this gap, we propose a novel, indicator-based fuzzy logic model for assessing the sustainability of agricultural systems. To test the model's suitability, we conducted twenty-two case studies over the 2018/19 cropping season in the Brazilian agricultural-forest frontier region; the farms chosen represent the three most common farming systems there: (i) pure crop farming (crop rotation only: soybean - corn), (ii) pure livestock, and (iii) integrated farming (crop - livestock and livestock - forest). Partial indicators were built to assess the economic, environmental, and social performances of those farming systems, then were further integrated in a sustainability index. The results show higher and better-balanced performance for integrated farms, which displayed the highest sustainability index values. In contrast, livestock farms performed poorly in all dimensions and showed the lowest sustainability index. Crop farms showed higher economic, but lower social and environmental performances. These results are in contrast to the oft-perceived trade-offs among different pillars of sustainability and show that integrated systems have the potential to balance multiple sustainability objectives, by leveraging multiple subsystem synergies. The innovative fuzzy inference model proposed is suitable to deal with information at the farm level, handling different types of farming systems, and applicable to different environmental or socioeconomic contexts. Moreover, the proposed indicators and associated indices offer relevant information to policy-makers to foster the sustainable intensification of farming systems, while promoting environmental protection and the coexistence of biodiversity and the agricultural sector.

TI Does certified organic agriculture increase agroecosystem health?
   Evidence from four farming systems in Uganda
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB Over the past decades, the number of certified organic farms have increased significantly in Uganda. One assumption is that certified organic agriculture contributes to economic, social and ecological health of agroecosystems. In the literature, however, there is thin empirical evidence to support such claims. We therefore developed health indicators and contrasted data from four Ugandan farming systems with principles and objectives of organic agriculture. We identified four health patterns (ecology-driven, economically struggling, socially-driven, and hanging in) demonstrating the impact of farm management on agroecosystem health and trade-offs between health domains. Ecological farm health is strengthened only if the conversion goes beyond organic by default'. Market-oriented specialization can create lock-in situations if production strategies cannot be changed easily. Food shortages occur when additional income from certified production does not compensate for the reduced area and effort devoted to food crops. We conclude that the positive effects of organic certification on agroecosystem health cannot be taken for granted. Interventions promoting organic agriculture should acknowledge risks smallholder farmers take by converting to cash crop-oriented certified organic farming. A challenging question will be how aspects of wellbeing and social health can be translated into certification standards and thus product attributes.

TI The LCA4CSA framework: Using life cycle assessment to strengthen
   environmental sustainability analysis of climate smart agriculture
   options at farm and crop system levels
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) seeks to meet three challenges: improve the adaptation capacity of agricultural systems to climate change, reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of these systems, and ensure local and global food security. Many CSA assessment methods that consider these three challenges have emerged, but to better assess the environmental resilience of farming systems, other categories of environmental impacts beyond climate change need to be considered. To meet this need, we propose the LCA4CSA method, which was tested in southern Colombia for family farming systems including coffee, cane and small livestock production. This methodological framework is based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and multi-criteria assessment methods. It integrates CSA-related issues through the definition of Principles, Criteria and Indicators, and involves farmers in the assessment of the effects of CSA practices. To reflect the complexity of farming systems, the method proposes a dual level of analysis: the farm and the main cash crop/livestock production system. After creating a typology of the farming systems, the initial situation is compared to the situation after the introduction of a CSA practice. In this case, the practice was the use of compost made from coffee processing residues. The assessment at the crop system level made it possible to quantify the mitigation potential related to the use of compost (between 22 and 41%) by taking into account operations that occur on and upstream of the farm. However, it showed that pollution transfers exist between impact categories, especially between climate change, acidification and terrestrial eutrophication indicators. The assessment made at the fanning system level showed that farms with livestock units could further limit their emissions by modifying the feeding of animals due to the large quantities of imported cereals. The mitigation potential of compost was only 3% for these farms. This article demonstrates the merits of using life cycle thinking that can be used to inform stakeholder discussions concerning the implementation of CSA practices and more sustainable agriculture.

TI Comparison of performance and feeding parameters in organic and
   conventional dairy farms in Germany
SO LANDBAUFORSCHUNG-JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AND ORGANIC AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB A considerable ratio of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions produced by German agriculture is caused by the enteric fermentation of dairy cows. Milk yield, performance and reproductive parameters, herd age and feeding system are important factors determining the product related GHG-emissions. In the study Climate effects and sustainability of organic and conventional farming systems", these parameters were analysed on 22 paired organic and conventional dairy farms.
   When looking at mean system differences milk yields, lifetime efficiency, percentage of maize silage and concentrates in the feeding ration are significantly higher in conventional farms. Whereas mean longevity and grazing time are higher in organic farming. In both farming systems lifetime efficiency significantly increases with increasing milk yields (p < 0.001) and decreases with increasing age at first calving (p < 0.001). Milk yield is positively correlated (p < 0.001) with the proportion of maize silage in the basic ration. High milking herds with high mean lifetime efficiency are existent in both farming systems.

AB Agricultural activity is a major source of nitrate in surface and ground waters. There has been a large research effort over the last 20 years to understand nitrate leaching processes and to develop 'best management practices' (BMPs) that can be adopted in farming systems to reduce losses to the wider environment. This paper reviews some of the issues relating to the development, use and adoption of these BMPs in farming systems. There is significant evidence from farming systems experiments and modelling studies that combinations of BMPs can decrease nitrate losses from agricultural land, though nothing is foolproof (the weather plays a key role in determining success). The challenges are greater in some regions (dry climate, 'leaky' soils) and in some enterprises (intensive animal farming systems). The adoption of BMPs on farms requires attention to detail and a high level of management skill, so providing advisory support to farmers is essential. Even with the progress that has been made in recent years, there is still work to do. This includes encouraging uptake on farms and dealing with potential conflicts between BMPs when they create 'pollution swapping' or where there is potential for a large economic penalty for the farmer. We also suggest that there is a need for more innovation in developing BMPs and a need to recognise that, in some situations, radical changes to farming systems may be the only solution.

TI Microbial biomass in relation to soil properties under integrated
   farming systems of Meghalaya
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
AB A study was conducted during 2003 to study on the microbial biomass and changes in soil properties after 20 years adoption of different integrated farming systems at Umiam, Meghalaya. It was found that the fertility status of the soil was relatively higher in agriculture, agri-horti-silvi-pastoral and livestock-based land-use systems over the other farming systems. The mean microbial biomass carbon was found highest in agriculture land use system (378 mg/kg), followed by agri-horti-silvi-pastoral system (291 mg/kg), while it was lowest in natural fallow (194 mg/kg). Highest microbial biomass N and P (32.4 and 17.07 mg/kg respectively) were recorded in agriculture, followed by agri-horti-silvi-pastoral system (26.8 and 15.18 mg/kg respectively). Microbial biomass C had significantly positive relationship with organic C (r = 0.30*), microbial biomass N (r = 0.69**) and biomass P (r = 0.57**), indicating that living part of soil organic matter involved in transformation of nutrients into labile pool and governs their availability to the plants. Long-term application of inorganic chemical fertilizers and organic manures along with soil amendments in agriculture-based land-use system contributed higher microbial biomass that led to higher biological activity attributed in nutrient transformations and also maintained the soil fertility for sustainable crop production. However the agri-horti-silvi-pastoral system also maintained highest microbial biomass that led to sustainable crop production and enhanced soil productivity.

TI Conceptualization of community-based integrated farming system model
   design with multi-objective optimization management
SO CURRENT SCIENCE
AB Effective utilization of land and water resources is attempted in the present study through an integrated farming system and multi-objective optimization management framework model using goal programming algorithm in a coastal waterlogged paddy area in Odisha, India. A methodology is developed to identify the water harvesting structure locations in the study area using spatial science tool. Due to the uncertainty of parameters and control variables, development of management framework was considered with 85% and 75% probability of rainfall occurrence and runoff generation. To incorporate the uncertainties, a multi-objective linear goal programming optimization model is developed considering the objective of maximizing the net annual return and production subject to optimal allocation of land. While evaluating the model for different water resources scenarios, the net annual return is found to be Rs 4,343,474 and maximum production is 10,424 q from scenario I, whereas maximum production of 10,980 q is obtained in scenario II. Tomato and rice cultivation area increased from 11.47 to 21.43 ha and 8.82 to 10.48 ha respectively in scenario II. The developed methodology shows the potential applicability in similar farming situations in other areas.

TI Climate Change Adaptation Research and Policy for Agriculture in

SO CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND CHANGE IN AFRICA: PERSPECTIVES, EXPERIENCES AND
   SUSTAINABILITY
SE Sustainable Development Goals Series
AB Sustainability of rainfed farming systems under climate variability and change conditions is a key concern for policy and adaptation planning processes to improve food and nutrition security. The challenge is to improve farming and tillage practices to enhance soil moisture availability and harvest excess runoff, thereby making the farming systems more reliable and resilient to the unpredictable risks of climate change and variability. In this short chapter, an assessment of climate change impact on the agricultural water availability for rainfed systems in southern Africa is discussed through a pilot project conducted recently as part of climate change adaptation integrated modelling of crop-climate-soil systems. We consider the Pandamatenga plains in north-eastern Botswana, which was undertaken with the main indicators of crop yield impact with respect to soil water availability and excess runoff harvesting potential, for the current climatology (1971-2000) and projected over the coming decades up to the 2050s. The indicators of rainfed practices of growing maize, sorghum and sunflower are discussed, which are likely influenced not only by climate, but also the response requiring local and regional adaptation investments for improved food security and increased productivity. This chapter recommends technical and policy interventions for incorporating climate change adaptation practices, with the view to outscale to national and possibly regional agricultural development planning processes.

TI Weather fluctuation can override the effects of integrated nutrient
   management on fungal disease incidence in the rice fields in Taiwan
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Both weather fluctuation and farming system influence the epidemiology of crop diseases. However, short-term experiments are difficult to mechanistically extrapolate into long-term ecological responses. Using a mechanistic model with Bayesian inference, long-term data spanning 10 years were used to construct relationships among weather fluctuation (temperature, relative humidity, wind, and rainfall), farming system (conventional and low-external-input farming), and crop disease in experimental rice fields in Taiwan. Conventional and low-external-input farming had similar influences on the disease incidence of rice blast. Temperature had a positive influence on the disease incidence only under high relative humidity. Rainfall positively affected the disease incidence until an optimum level of rainfall. Low-external-input farming, with a lower application of fertilizers and other sustainable nutrient management, achieved similar effects on the disease incidence to those achieved by conventional farming. This suggests that weather fluctuation may override the effect of the farming systems on fungal disease incidence in rice fields.

TI Crop-livestock integration in smallholder farming systems of Goromonzi
   and Murehwa, Zimbabwe
SO RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS
AB Poor productivity in smallholder farming systems has necessitated research on the potential of crop-livestock integration to sustainably improve productivity. The study hypothesized that improvement in individual agronomic and livestock systems and synergistic utilization of by-products of either system increases productivity, profitability and integration. Smallholder farming households were classified into: old and resource endowed (OR); part time (PT); and young, risk-taking and enthusiastic (YRE) following a survey conducted in Murehwa and Goromonzi districts of Zimbabwe. Crop-livestock systems' integration scenarios were developed for each farmer category. Expression of crop-livestock integration in physical terms, e.g., kg ha(-1), can be complex and confounding, hence the expression of integration in monetary values. Baseline scenario results indicate thatORhad the highest crop-livestock integration of $3981 compared withPTandYREdespiteORhaving the lowest manure usage compared withPTandYREfarmers. Moreover,ORhad the least legume yields of YREfarmers. Subsequent crop-livestock integration scenarios increased maize grain yields by at least 50%, thus increasing profitability to $1210, $3230 and $3100 yr(-1)for mucuna, cowpea and groundnut, respectively. Total income increased by 135, 132 and 101% translating to $9880, $2960 and $6290 yr(-1)inOR,PTandYREfarmers, respectively. Crop-livestock integration therefore has the potential to improve smallholder crop and livestock productivity, variable with socio-economic status.

TI Nutrient management for sustainable dryland farming systems
SO ANNALS OF ARID ZONE
AB Managing nutrients in sustainable dryland farming systems requires evaluation of all factors limiting crop yield potential before plant nutrients are applied. In semi-arid areas, plant-available water is generally the major factor limiting yield, followed by N and P fertility. Adaption of minimum-till (MT) and no-till (NT) crop production systems increase soil storage of precipitation during non-crop periods, enabling more intensive cropping (2 crops in 3 years, 3 crops in 4 years, or annual cropping). As cropping intensity increases, so does the need far additional plant nutrients. Soil testing and plant analysis an essential tools for managing crop nutrients in environmentally sound, sustainable farming systems. Banding of nutrients close to the seed at planting will improve nutrient-use efficiency, particularly in MT and NT systems. precision fanning technologies are being developed to apply variable rates of fertilizer across fields rather than a single rate. In addition, seeding equipment is now available to allow one pass variable rate seeding and fertilization with fertilizer placed with the seed, between seed rows, or in bands near the seed. Reduced tillage systems, combined with more intensive cropping and variable rate fertilizer applications, are contributing to a more sustainable dryland fanning system hi semi-arid areas of the North American Great plains.

TI INTEGRATING LIVESTOCK INTO FARMING SYSTEMS IN NORTHERN CAMEROON
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB Farming systems in West Africa's semi-arid zone consist of mainly purely nomadic pastoralism and purely sedentary crop production with a minor crop-livestock production system.  Farmers there are slow to integrate cropping and livestock and utilize their intermediate farm products of crop residues, draft power, and animal manure to tackle production constraints such as shortage of animal feed, labor bottlenecks, and soil degradation.  This paper uses a crop-livestock linear programming model to show that, apart from the adoption of crop technologies, by integrating and using crop-livestock farm linkages, farmers can make more efficient use of their marginal land with less chemical fertilizers, improve their economic gains substantially, and achieve a more sustainable agricultural production system.

TI A framework to assess the economic vulnerability of farming systems:
   Application to mixed crop-livestock systems
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB The main challenge for farmers is to maintain a high annual income within an ever-changing context of production (climate, prices, sanitation issues), i.e. to ensure low vulnerability. The vulnerability of a given system corresponds to its susceptibility to be harmed, reflecting its inability to cope with adverse effects. This paper presents a framework that can be applied to determine the economic vulnerability of farming systems considering their social dimension, and to identify farming management profiles that are likely to be less vulnerable. The framework defines vulnerability levels based on analysis of four quantitative indicators reflecting the 'behaviour' of the economic results per labour unit in the long term: the relative standard deviation of the economic result per worker, the relative mean distance of the economic result to a minimum threshold, the number of economic disruptions over a specified period, and the economic recovery time after disruption. The framework was applied to a sample of 208 French farms, and the results revealed that diversification alone is not enough to cope with risks. Less vulnerable mixed crop-livestock systems are characterized by more crop-livestock interactions, allowing for less dependency on markets and more flexibility. This kind of management allows farms to be larger and to have more livestock. These findings help clarify the vulnerability of farming systems and may encourage the development of policies to enhance market opportunities at the regional level to foster diversification strategies and flexibility.

AB In Western Europe, agricultural development strategies are increasingly taking account of the realities at farm level. The attitudes and strategies of farmers are accepted as important "bottom-up" pressures for change alongside the conventional top-down pressures from general socio-economic conditions and agricultural policies. To understand and give more information on the current challenges of livestock farming in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), a group of researchers from both Western and Eastern Europe carried out an initial study on the current diversity in livestock farming and management in selected regions in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and the Slovak Republic. This research; which for the first time applied the Livestock Farming Systems (LFS) approach developed in Western Europe to CEE conditions, was sponsored within the framework of a Food and Agriculture Organisation-European Association of Animal Production (FAO-EAAP) joint initiative.
   The research design applied to real-life-farms in CEE and the results obtained are reported in this paper. The first positive finding was the adaptability of the fundamentals of LFS research, developed within the framework of family-farm agriculture in the West, to a system based more on large-scale private, corporate and co-operative farms. The field observations made offer a first insight into these livestock farming systems and their management. Some key issues of the potential contribution of and future needs' for LFS research in the Central and Eastern European countries are discussed.

SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
AB The re-introduction of forages into the farming systems od central and southern Italy has been advocated by EU policies in order to reduce high inputs and favour more sustainable agricultural systems. Since legumes could certainly play a major role, landraces and natural populations of Trifolium alexandrinum (2), T. incarnatum (5) and T. squarrosum (3) were investigated. Two experiments were conducted during the 1991/92, 1992/93 and 1993/94 seasons in Perugia, central Italy. The objective of the first was to obtain the morphological and physiological characteristics of the entries, while the second assessed the biomass production, forage quality (stem:leaf: inflorescence ratio, protein, fibre, O.M. digestibility, milk and meat Forage Units) and seed yields. In T. incarnatum, flowering time, leaf area, stem length and diameter were important characteristics for discriminating between populations. Norcia and Rocca di Corno, two natural populations of T. incarnatum, flowered early, produced the most biomass and had high forage duality. Their potential as forage/pasture crops and/or cover crops in Mediterranean farming systems is discussed.

To turn this around requires clear evidence from ecologists about the nature of farming systems, the fundamental underpinning role of natural resources and ecological processes within them and the provision of feasible alternatives.

TI Environmental Assessment of an Urban Vertical Hydroponic Farming System
   in Sweden
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB With an expanding population and changing dynamics in global food markets, it is important to find solutions for more resilient food production methods closer to urban environments. Recently, vertical farming systems have emerged as a potential solution for urban farming. However, although there is an increasing body of literature reviewing the potential of urban and vertical farming systems, only a limited number of studies have reviewed the sustainability of these systems. The aim of this article was to understand the environmental impacts of vertical hydroponic farming in urban environments applied to a case study vertical hydroponic farm in Stockholm, Sweden. This was carried out by evaluating environmental performance using a life cycle perspective to assess the environmental impacts and comparing to potential scenarios for improvement options. The results suggest that important aspects for the vertical hydroponic system include the growing medium, pots, electricity demand, the transportation of raw materials and product deliveries. By replacing plastic pots with paper pots, large reductions in GHG emissions, acidification impacts, and abiotic resource depletion are possible. Replacing conventional gardening soil as the growing medium with coir also leads to large environmental impact reductions. However, in order to further reduce the impacts from the system, more resource-efficient steps will be needed to improve impacts from electricity demand, and there is potential to develop more symbiotic exchanges to employ urban wastes and by-products.

TI Participatory design of innovative farming systems
SO CAHIERS AGRICULTURES
AB Co-design of innovative agricultural systems is a promising way to meet the challenge of innovation, particularly for African family farms facing multiple changes. But we must think of the place and role of multiple stakeholders (farmers, advisors, researchers) to produce the desired change by all parties, so consider the issue of partnership in the process. This paper presents the process for the design of innovative farming systems (PDIFS) developed between 2005 and 2015 in western Burkina Faso, including the management of manure. PDIFS uses a formalized partnership system and a progressive approach in three iterative phases: (1) exploration and formalization of partnership; (2) co-designs and testing options for change; (3) review and disengagement. The results show that innovation is more effective and sustainable when it is the product of a collective and partnership work.

TI Integrated animal and cropping systems in single and multi-objective
   frameworks for enhancing the livelihood security of farmers and
   agricultural sustainability in Northern India
SO ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE
AB Fast degrading and declining land, water availability, biodiversity, environment and other natural resources, together with shrinking farm returns and reduced crop productivity caused by continuous and intensive cultivation of rice-wheat systems, necessitate diversification of farming in Northern India. Integrated farming systems (IFS) involving animals (livestock, fish, etc.) and cropping (cereals, trees, etc.) are recognised as an alternative for preserving ecosystems and enhancing livelihood security. A study was therefore undertaken under Northern Indian conditions to develop IFS models for various sizes of farm and to compare these models with the existing rice-wheat system for sustainability and profitability. The IFS models were developed in single objective (using linear programming) and multi-objective (using compromise programming) frameworks. Multi-objective analysis provides deeper insight into the problem as it caters directly for the multi-faceted needs of the farmers. These parallel methodologies offer a novel approach to modelling IFS to draw different farming scenarios for comparison. The IFS strategies developed show the potential to generate a greater farm income than with existing rice-wheat cropping for all sizes of farm. The study revealed that IFS offer more perspectives for an economically viable and sustainable agriculture for typical farms in Northern India.

TI Cultivar, soil type, nitrogen source and irrigation regime as quality
   determinants of organically grown tomatoes
SO SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE
AB Organic farming is claimed to be more sustainable and to produce fruits and vegetables that are healthier than conventional farming. However, scientific evidence in support of such claims is rather scarce. With respect to the nutritional aspects of organic products, there is a broad variability of responses in terms of accumulation of valuable molecules under organic cultivation so that it is not possible to establish unequivocal links between farming system and production of these metabolites. Considering that there is a physiological potential of organic products to systematically accumulate nutritional metabolites in response to this specific farming system, we began to categorize those cultural conditions that may facilitate the expression of such potential. In three different experiments carried out over three years, here we address the effect of cultivar, N fertilization, irrigation regime and soil texture on yield and quality parameters of organically grown tomatoes. Although yield was generally higher in conventional farming, there were not much yield differences between the two farming systems under low N fertilization and different irrigation levels. In addition, the sandy soil seemed to be more appropriate than clayey soil to obtain a competitive yield in organic tomato. Cultivars may respond differently in terms of accumulation of antioxidant molecules. Moreover, under organic farming, the level of these molecules was tightly dependent on the growing season. Overall, under limiting agricultural inputs (low N and water), organic farming may have a competitive advantage vs. conventional farming in terms of yield and nutritional quality. Nonetheless, in order to achieve significant qualitative improvements, soil type and proper cultivar selection should be considered as key determinants under organic farming. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI Participatory research and sustainable development in the
   Sahelo-Sudanian region
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
AB A participatory research programme was conducted in the groundnut basin of Senegal, where there was a need to intensify the local farming systems. The research yielded a set of technical references and profitable innovations, which were introduced through specific development actions. The technology transfer aims at the establishment of sustainable farming systems and takes into account the climatic risks and innovation costs. Identification of research themes and implementation of results was based on various analyses: climatic analysis at regional level (establishment of climatic zones) and identification of constraints at farm level. Farmers' interests and the research results were combined to define suitable interventions for each surveyed farm, with the aim of increasing farm income and restoring soil fertility. The research also yielded elements for formulating an appropriate and realistic agricultural policy for the region. Clearly, the development of livestock farming activities is essential in bringing new economic life into the region and increasing the sustainability of farming systems in erratic climatic conditions.

TI The Management of Lamb Heterogeneity is a Tool for Farmers' Marketing
   Strategies
SO ANIMALS
AB Simple Summary
   In a value chain, matching supply and demand is needed. Indeed, both vary widely in space and time. The first method of approaching this issue is homogenizing the supply of meat production. It depends on the possibility for farmers to limit the variability in biological processes by improving production conditions. Other marketing strategies are based on the management of animal heterogeneity. In these situations, farmers market a range of products and deal with several market channels.
   The technical processes used in sheep farming systems are elaborate and difficult to control. The result is a certain heterogeneity in marketed lambs. The aim of this study was to understand how farmers use their practices and modes of marketing to manage and exploit this heterogeneity. We analyzed livestock farming systems in Languedoc-Roussillon (South of France) through eight case studies. We characterize the heterogeneity of lambs during their growth and sale and how the farmers cope with this. Our analysis shows how this heterogeneity, whether intentionally created or merely endured, can be used to invest in different marketing chains. Heterogeneity not only offers adaptable farmers marketing opportunities, but also a method of managing production risks.

TI Long-term farming systems research in the central High Plains
SO RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS
AB In recent decades, there has been growing interest among farming and scientific communities toward integrated crop-range-livestock farming because of evidence of increased crop production, soil health, environmental services and resilience to increased climatic variability. This paper reviews studies on existing cropping systems and integrated crop-range-livestock systems across the USA which are relevant in the context of summarizing opportunities and challenges associated with implementing long-term crop-range-livestock systems research in the highly variable environment of the central High Plains. With precipitation ranging from 305 to 484 mm and uncertain irrigation water supply, this region is especially vulnerable to changing moisture and temperature patterns. The results of our review indicate that diverse crop rotations, reduced soil disturbance and integrated crop-livestock systems could increase economic returns and agroecosystem resilience. Integrating agricultural system components to acquire unique benefits from small-to medium-sized operations, however, is a challenging task. This is because assessment and identification of suitable farming systems, selection of the most efficient integration scheme, and pinpointing the best management practices are crucial for successful integration of components. Effective integration requires development of evaluation criteria that incorporate the efficiency of approaches under consideration and their interactions. Therefore, establishing the basis for more sustainable farming systems in the central High Plains relies on both long-term agricultural systems research and evaluation of short-term dynamics of individual components.

TI LEGU-MED: Developing Biodiversity-Based Agriculture with Legume Cropping
   Systems in the Mediterranean Basin
SO AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB Environmental degradation and the decrease of ecosystem service provision are currently of major concern, with current agricultural systems being a major driver. To meet our future environmental and sustainability targets a transformation of the agro-food systems and current agricultural value chain are crucial. One approach to redesign farming systems is the concept of biodiversity-based agriculture (BBA) which relies on sustainable diversification of biological components and their natural interactions in farming systems to maximize fertility, productivity, and resilience to external perturbations. Despite minimizing anthropogenic inputs, BBA is not yet able to meet all beneficial environmental objectives. BBA applied in the Mediterranean basin requires urgent innovation in approaches, methodologies, and models for small-holder traditional farming systems to ensure a stable provision of ecosystem services and better resilience to environmental stresses linked to climate change. Legumes are the backbone of the Mediterranean agro-ecosystems from ancient times, but their unique and wide biodiversity was not sufficiently valorized, especially by North-African countries. Here, we present LEGU-MED, a three-year international project funded by PRIMA initiative 2019. An international consortium was established involving five universities, 5 research institutes, and one private company from 8 countries: Italy, Germany, Spain, Algeria, Tunisia, Turkey, Lebanon, and Croatia. The main objective of this project is to put forward an international and well-integrated plan to valorize the legume agrobiodiversity of the Mediterranean in biodiversity-based farming systems and consequently enhance agro-ecosystem functions and services in the Mediterranean basin. The successful completion of LEGU-MED will have the following impacts on Mediterranean legume-based farming systems: (1) improve water use efficiency, (2) reduce the use of anthropogenic inputs through the maintenance of soil fertility, (3) enhance pollination and improve ecological connectivity with flora and fauna, (4) protect close-by wildland ecosystems, (5) enhance other ecosystem services (e.g., pest, disease, and weed suppression), and (6) provide healthier and safer protein-rich food.

TI Life cycle assessment modelling of complex agricultural systems with
   multiple food and fibre co-products
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Most agricultural products are produced on farms where there is a mix of activities, resulting in a range of co-products. This raises the issue of how best to model these complex production systems for Life Cycle Assessment, especially where there are benefits imparted by one activity in the mixed farming system to another. On the mixed farm studied, there were significant two-way reference flows (representing 288 t CO2-e/year or 10% of the total farm emissions) between activities producing distinct products (wool, meat, grain) and these were modelled using system expansion. Cropping and sheep activities were modelled as separate sub-processes in the farming system, with unique inputs and outputs identified for each. Co-production from the sheep activity was modelling using allocation, comparing biophysical and economic relationships. Using an economic allocation resulted in different estimates of global warming impact for sheep co-products, with figures varying by 7-52%. When compared to biophysical allocation, economic allocation shifted the environmental burden to the higher value co-products and away from the high resource use products. Using economic allocation, for every kilogram of wool produced there was an estimated 28.7 kg of CO2-e emitted. Amongst the live animal products, the stud rams had the highest estimated carbon footprint (719 kg CO2-e/ram). Amongst the crops, estimates of emissions for the cereal grains averaged 202 kg CO2-e/tonne grain, canola 222 kg CO2-e/tonne and lupins 510 kg CO2-e/tonne, when modelled to include the benefits of the mixed farming system.

TI Ecological-economic modelling to support multi-objective policy making:
   a farming systems approach implemented for Tuscany
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB Currently, there is a major concern regarding agri-environmental issues. Farmers are viewed not only as food suppliers but also as the custodians of the countryside. This role of farmers has been officially acknowledged in the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) through a number of regulations that enforce agri-environment schemes and cross-compliance. However, under some circumstances these regulations have proved to be ineffective. Organic farming can play an important role for agri-environment schemes. The main aim of this study is to show the relevance of the assessment of the environmental performance of conventional and organic farming systems for the development of efficient agri-environment schemes. An holistically designed ecological-economic model was applied under current EU regulations and different policy scenarios. The model is based on a standard linear programming farm model extended with emission and evaluation figures retrieved from ecological models. Spatial aspects, such as pedo-climatic conditions, were included in the model. The approach was implemented for the case of northern Tuscany. Results indicated that organic farming systems (OFSs) were environmentally more beneficial than conventional farming systems (CFSs) and that current CAP market and income support schemes gave cause for an intensification of farm production and for an increase of environmental harm. They also showed that conventional farmers willing to produce environmental performances comparable to those of organic agriculture or to comply with environmental sustainability thresholds (ESTs) incur opportunity costs due to the need of application of organic crop management and/or extensification of the crop plan. Conclusions were drawn on the environmental performances of OFSs and CFSs, the impact of EU policies on sustainability of agriculture, opportunity costs of environmental benefits and on the practical use of the modelling framework for policy design.

TI A multi-criteria evaluation of the environmental performances of
   conventional, organic and integrated olive-growing systems in the south
   of Spain based on experts' knowledge
SO RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS
AB The medium to long-term environmental performances of organic, integrated and conventional olive-growing systems in the average conditions of the south of Spain are evaluated and compared with respect to soil erosion, soil fertility, rational use of irrigation water, water contamination, atmospheric pollution and biodiversity, based on experts' knowledge. The aim of the research was to test the common implicit assumption of environmental superiority of the two alternative farming systems over the conventional system. For this purpose, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a widely used multi-criteria decision-making tool, has been implemented. AHP enables us to deal with complex decision-making problems with multiple criteria, stakeholders and decision-makers, high uncertainty and risk, such as in the case of multi-criteria environmental comparison of alternative farming systems. Twenty experts in olive production, clustered into three groups according to their professional field of interest, were involved in the analysis. The utilization of experts' knowledge is justified when information relevant for urgent decision-making is not available, is partial or is time and resource demanding, and a holistic perspective is required. Indexes and procedures are proposed for group decision-making, to detect variation in expert opinions and differences between alternative systems' performances. Despite bias in the judgments of the groups of experts in some topics, results confirm the holistic environmental superiority of organic and integrated alternatives over the conventional olive system in Andalusia in the medium to long-term. The results represent a scientific base to justify and endorse institutional support regarding the promotion and implementation of organic and integrated olive-growing systems in the region, which are likely to result in greater social welfare.

TI Integrated Farming Systems and the Livelihood Security of Small and
   Marginal Farmers in India and Other Developing Countries
SO ADVANCES IN AGRONOMY, VOL 138
SE Advances in Agronomy
AB Agriculture in India and other Asian countries is facing multiple and complex challenges which are expected to become more severe with the passage of time. Some of the major challenges are sustainability of natural resources, impact of climate change and decline in factor of productivity. Besides, the declining trend in size of land holding poses a serious challenge to the profitability and sustainability of farming. In view of the decline in per capita availability of land, it is imperative to develop strategies and agricultural technologies that enable adequate employment and income generation, especially for small-holders (farmers with < 2.0 ha of land) who constitute the vast majority of the farming community in the developing world. No single farm enterprise, such as a typical mono-cropping system, is likely to be able to sustain the small-holder farmer. Integrated farming systems (IFS) are less risky if managed efficiently, as they benefit from synergisms among enterprises, diversity in produce, and environmental soundness. On this basis, IFS have been suggested for the development of small and marginal farms across Asia, and researchers have developed strategies which have benefited small-holder farmers by providing additional income and employment and minimizing risk. However, these IFS have not been promulgated and promoted effectively. The present review helps to remedy this by providing comprehensive information on the concepts and advantages of IFS for small-holder farmers, which is lacking at present. The review covers the key literature on farming systems and allied aspects published over the period 1970-2015.

TI Integrated Sustainability Assessment of Divergent Mediterranean Farming
   Systems: Cyprus as a Case Study
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB A variety of indicator-based methods have been developed for the sustainability assessment of farming systems (FSs). However, many of them lack holisticity, focus on a specific agricultural sector/product, and do not provide aggregated results to better support decision-making process. The goal of this study was, for the first time, to assess, in a holistic manner, the sustainability performance of different FSs in southeastern Cyprus. The methodological framework involved three major steps. First, the sustainability context was set, and a list of 41 environmental, social, and economic indicators was created. The indicators were then calculated using data from 324 farms. Second, six FSs were identified using multivariate analysis. Finally, the sustainability of FSs was assessed by combining numerical (construction of four composite sustainability indices) and visual (presentation of indicator scores and values with graphs and tables) integration approaches. While the indices provided the "big picture", visual integration revealed the areas where policy interventions are needed. The analysis showed that sustainable agricultural practices are already used by some farmers in the area. The results could be used for benchmarking purposes and to aid decision-making process in Cyprus but might also be useful for other Mediterranean regions with similar agro-ecological conditions.

TI Free Range, Organic? Polish Consumers Preferences Regarding Information
   on Farming System and Nutritional Enhancement of Eggs: A Discrete Choice
   Based Experiment
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The main purpose of this study was to determine the structure of consumer preferences regarding information on farming system and nutritional enhancement of eggs to verify if consumers are willing to accept products combing sustainability and nutrition related claims. The data was collected within a CAPI (Computer Assisted Personal Interviews) survey on a representative sample of 935 consumers responsible for food shopping. A discrete choice-based conjoint method was selected in eliciting consumer preferences among different product profiles with varying levels of attributes. A hierarchical cluster analysis was used to identify four distinct clusters that differed significantly in terms of importance attached to production system attributes and socio-demographic profiles. The results of the experiment showed that price and farming system had the most significant mean relative importance in shaping consumers' preferences, while other attributes such as nutrition and health claims, egg size, package size and hen breed were far less important. Free range eggs had the highest relative importance for consumers despite the fact that organic egg production systems are governed by much stricter animal welfare standards. Our segmentation revealed that two of our four clusters may be more easily reached by information on animal welfare related attributes in egg production than the others. The results of our study provide the policy makers and marketing practitioners with insights applicable for communication and pricing strategies for eggs with sustainability claims.

TI Production systems of Creole goat and their implications for a breeding
   programme
SO ANIMAL
AB The Creole goat is a local meat breed well adapted to the tropical environment of Guadeloupe, a French island in the Caribbean. A survey of 47 goat farmers was conducted in May 2008 to describe the Guadeloupean goat farming systems. It was the preliminary step for the implementation of a breeding programme for Creole goats. Farmers had 31 does on average. A small number (4%) kept only Creole goats. Most of them (62%) had a mixed herd of Creole and crossbreds. One-third of them (34%) reared only crossbred goats. Farmers appreciate the rusticity and resistance of the Creole goat but consider its growth as too slow. The most desired traits for goat selection were conformation and growth for males (77% of the answers). These traits were also important for females (30% of the answers). Maternal qualities were also frequently cited (maternal behaviour 23%, reproduction 20% and milk production 17%). Disease resistance was not seen as an important trait (10% and 7% of the answers for bucks and does, respectively). A typology constituted of five groups of farmers was also created. Farmers of three groups were retained to participate at a selection programme. They kept Creole goats and have expressed a strong willingness to join a selection programme. The results of the survey suggest that a breeding programme should mostly focus on the Creole goat as a maternal breed. Real consideration should be given to disease resistance. The Creole goat has indeed a key role to play in the sustainability of local farming systems.

TI Influence of different manuring systems with and without biogas
   digestion on soil organic matter and nitrogen inputs, flows and budgets
   in organic cropping systems
SO NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS
AB Nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) cycles are closely linked in organic farming systems. Use of residues for biogas digestion may reduce N-losses and lead to higher farmland productivity. However, digestion is connected to large losses of organic C. It is the purpose of this paper (1) to compare farming systems based on liquid slurry and solid farmyard manure regarding the N, C and organic dry matter (ODM) inputs and flows, (2) to analyse the effect of digestion on soil N, C and ODM inputs and flows within the cropping system, (3) to assess the effects of organic manure management on biological N-2 fixation (BNF), and (4) to assess the effect of biogas digestion on the sustainability of the cropping systems in terms of N and C budgets. The BNF by clover/grass-leys was the most important single N input, followed by the BNF supplied by legume cover cropping. Growth of crops in organic farming systems is very often N limited, and not limited by the soil C inputs. However, balances of N inputs showed that the implemented organic farming systems have the potential to supply high amounts of N to meet crop N demand. The level of plant available N to non-legume main crops was much lower, in comparison to the total N inputs. Reasons were the non-synchronized timing of N mineralization and crop N demand, the high unproductive gaseous N losses and an unfocussed allocation in space and time of the circulating N within the crop rotation (e.g. allocation of immobile manures to legumes or of mobile manures to cover crops). Simultaneously, organic cropping systems very often showed large C surpluses, which may be potentially increased the N shortage due to the immobilization of N. Soil organic matter supply and soil humus balance (a balance sheet calculated from factors describing the cultivation effects on humus increasing and humus depleting crops, and organic manure application) were higher in cropping systems based on liquid slurry than in those based on solid farmyard manure (+19%). Simultaneously, soil N surplus was higher due to lower gaseous N losses (+14%). Biogas digestion of slurry had only a very slight effect on both the soil N and the soil C budget. The effect on the N budget was also slight if the liquid slurry was stored in closed repositories. Digestion of residues like slurry, crop residues and cover crops reduced in a mixed farming system the soil C supply unilaterally (approximately -33%), and increased the amounts of readily available N (approximately +70-75%). The long-term challenge for organic farming systems is to find instruments that reduce N losses to a minimum, to keep the most limiting fraction of N (ammonia-N) within the system, and to enhance the direct manuring effect of the available manures to non-legume main crops.

TI Nutrient Flows and Balances in Mixed Farming Systems in Madagascar
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Mixed farming systems are still prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa. In these systems, the recycling of nutrients through crop-livestock integration (CLI) practices is crucial for the sustainability of soil fertility and crop production. The objective of this study was to analyze nutrient (N, P, K) flows and balances of mixed farming systems to assess CLI contribution to the performance of those systems. We hypothesized that more intensive farms had a better nutrient balance at the farm level, and that improved biomass management methods improved their nutrient balance. Nine farms in the Madagascar highlands were selected, some corresponding to poor traditional farms with only draft cattle; some small or medium-sized, more intensive farms with a dairy herd; and some of the latter with some improvement to management methods of livestock effluents (manure composting, liquid manure collection). The nutrient balance of the farming systems was determined, and performance indicators were calculated at both farming, livestock, and CLI levels. Results showed that nutrient recycling through CLI is significant in the functioning of the systems studied, contributing primarily to circulating nutrient flows (up to 76%) and leading to greater efficiency and productivity. Nutrient flows resulting from these practices mainly concerned animal feeding (higher than 60% of nutrient flows), even if manure management was central for crop fertilization and that manure remained a desired animal product of these types of farms (up to 100% of animal products). Large negative balances of N and K (up to 80% of inputs) were observed in traditional livestock systems with draft cattle. They were smaller (39-68%) in more intensive dairy farms. Composting of manure did not decrease negative balances, whereas their magnitude was significantly reduced by the collection of liquid manure (19% for N; 42% for K). Better management of biomass at the farm level, in particular the collection of liquid manure, seemed to substantially reduce nutrient losses in MFS.

TI Regenerative farming and human wellbeing: Are subjective wellbeing
   measures useful indicators for sustainable farming systems?
SO ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
AB It is increasingly argued that indicators of sustainable agriculture should include measures examining the health and wellbeing of farm managers. Given the farmer plays a crucial role in farm-based decision making and management, good farmer wellbeing may indicate a level of functioning across all components of the farm system - a defining aspect of sustainability. Despite this, few agricultural sustainability indicator frameworks measure farmer wellbeing. A key challenge is lack of exploration of the linkages between farming systems and wellbeing, and identification of measures that can shed light on the wellbeing benefits of ecological and economically sustainable farming systems. We test the utility of subjective wellbeing (SWB) measures for inclusion as part of agricultural sustainability indicator frameworks, using regenerative agriculture (RA) as a case example. RA is a farming system which many claim has benefits for sustainability, and attempts to assess the sustainability of this approach has yielded conflicting results. Using a sample of Australian graziers, we examine the relationship between engagement in RA and several measures of SWB. Hierarchical regressions were conducted to assess whether engaging in RA predicted variance in SWB over and above age, gender and farm type. We found RA was associated with higher SWB for some, but not all, measures. The association was strongest for measures of eudaimonic wellbeing and satisfaction with health. Our findings suggest that SWB measures are sufficiently sensitive to provide meaningful insight into the wellbeing impacts of different agricultural systems, supporting the case for inclusion of such measures in sustainability frameworks.

TI Natural living - a precondition for animal welfare in organic farming
SO LIVESTOCK SCIENCE
AB This article discusses animal welfare in organic farming systems in relation to values and aims in organic farming. It sums up experiences from a 4-year interdisciplinary project. An important finding is that animal welfare is understood somewhat differently in organic fanning from what is common in conventional agriculture. It is interpreted in terms of natural living, which includes the possibility to perform a natural behaviour, feed adapted to the animal's physiology and a natural environment. Some of the criticism of animal welfare in organic farming may stein from different understandings of what "welfare" actually means. However, although welfare is an important aim in organic fanning, the overall concern is to develop sustainable farming systems. This causes some welfare dilemmas. For example, a healthy system does not automatically mean good welfare for the individual. Based on available literature the actual welfare situation in organic systems was scrutinized. Unfortunately little research has been done, but a careful conclusion was that animal health is as good or better than in conventional farming-with the exception of parasitic diseases. Organic farming systems have a "welfare potential", but organic farmers must deal with the dilemmas and take animal welfare issues seriously. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI No-till Farming Systems for Sustainable Agriculture: An Overview
SO NO-TILL FARMING SYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE: Challenges and
   Opportunities
AB No-till (NT) farming systems have revolutionized agriculture by improving erosion control, soil water storage, soil quality and, in many instances, yield and net farm income. The adoption of NT systems has increased at an exponential rate since the 1990s and they are now used on 12.5% of global croplands. However, while the development of NT systems has seen much success, there can be significant agronomic, economic and/or social challenges associated with their use that limit large scale worldwide adoption. In addition, where NT is not implemented as part of an integrated system that incorporates stubble retention and appropriate crop rotations to help manage weeds, diseases, pests and soil fertility, decreases in yield can be observed. A combination of research, education and good policy development to remove economic/institutional and social barriers to uptake are required to ensure the continued success of NT. In particular, the tailoring of NT farming systems according to individual locations and the introduction of some flexibility in approach to tillage management can provide an opportunity to manage some of the challenges of NT farming systems.

TI Agroecology and eco-agriculture, sustainable strategies in peasant
   farming systems
SO CUADERNOS DE DESARROLLO RURAL
AB The accelerated transformation of ecosystems, originated mainly by anthropic activities such as extensive cattle ranching and conventional agriculture, has helped to cause climatic variations, accentuating the loss of biodiversity. Under this premise, this research aims to characterize socioeconomic and biophysical aspects in the municipalities of Cabrera, Pasca, San Bernardo and Granada in the province of Sumapaz in Cundinamarca, to evaluate the coefficient of variation through the application of agroecological and eco-agricultural practices, under sustainability criteria and thus determine the degree of efficiency of twelve peasant farming systems -PFS-. The information was collected through surveys and participatory methodologies in the period between June 2018 and December 2019. The results obtained show differences s +/- 1, indicating a high dispersion in the application and implementation of agroecological and eco-agricultural practices, in addition, through the estimation criterion 3 peasant farming system obtained an index between 57 and 59%, qualified within the efficiency of the system as 'weak' with 'relevant' practices and 9 peasant farming system obtained an index of 61 to 73 %, representing a 'constant' efficiency of the peasant farming system with 'adequate' practices. It is evident that, under their traditional ways of life and cultural knowledge, the external influence of technology, socio-cultural changes, regional and national policies, as well as the lack of access to the market, generates a high external dependence on products or services, bringing with it ecological, economic and social consequences. It can be concluded that traditional agricultural practices tend to disappear and with them the diversity of crops, species, seeds, knowledge and cultural knowledge, as they are articulated with the implementation of modern agricultural techniques, based on specialization and mechanization of production, causing a decrease in biodiversity.

TI APSIM Next Generation: Overcoming challenges in modernising a farming
   systems model
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
AB From 1990, the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) has grown from a field-focused farming systems framework used by a small number of people, into a large collection of models used by thousands of modellers internationally. The software grew to consist of several hundred thousand lines of code in multiple programming languages. This has led to a large, complex software ecosystem that is difficult to maintain. In addition, systems modellers increasingly require software systems that integrate multiple disciplines, can represent evermore complex farming systems, can run on multiple operating systems (desktop, web, mobile), can operate at or be adjusted to multiple temporal and spatial scales (field, farm, region, continent, global) and run faster for larger simulation analyses. This is difficult to achieve in an aging framework.
   For these reasons, the APSIM Initiative is building the next generation of APSIM. This manuscript outlines the approach taken and lessons learnt. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI POPULATION-DYNAMICS AND DETERMINANTS OF STRIGA-HERMONTHICA ON MAIZE AND
   SORGHUM IN SAVANNA FARMING SYSTEMS
SO CROP PROTECTION
AB The population dynamics of the parasitic plant Striga hermonthica were analyzed on farmers' fields in the northern Guinea savanna of Nigeria. Soil seed density of Striga varied among farmers' fields between 0 and more than 80000 seed m(-2). Differences among fields were mainly due to cropping history. The number of emerged, surviving and reproducing Striga plants were analyzed on maize and sorghum and showed a large variability among fields. Differences among fields were larger for maize than for sorghum and were mainly due to differences in crop management practices being used by farmers. The number of newly produced Striga seed at the end of the season varied between 0 and 109,000 seed m(-2) and proved to be largely independent of the initial soil seed bank. Large differences were found in the contribution of sorghum and maize in mixed cropping systems to the overall reproduction of Striga. Sorghum is the major host for Striga reproduction. In an area with intensified maize-cropping, maize functions as a Striga-suppressive crop while in an area with extensive crop management maize contributes significantly to Striga reproduction. The analysis of the population dynamics of the parasite shows the importance of a farming systems approach to pest management and to the development of sustainable cropping systems for the savannas.

TI Using Local Agroecological Knowledge in Climate Change Adaptation: A
   Study of Tree-Based Options in Northern Morocco
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Communities in northern Morocco are vulnerable to increasing water scarcity and food insecurity. Context specific adaptation options thus need to be identified to sustain livelihoods and agroecosystems in this region, and increase the resilience of vulnerable smallholders, and their farming systems, to undesired effects of social-ecological change. This study took a knowledge-based systems approach to explore whether and how tree-based (i.e., agroforestry) options could contribute to meeting these adaptation needs. We analysed local agroecological knowledge of smallholders from the Meknes-Tafilalet region, to (i) characterise existing farming systems at local landscape scale; (ii) identify possible niches for farm-trees within these systems; and (iii) explore locally perceived barriers to tree-based diversification. An iterative cycle of qualitative interviews, with a purposefully selected sample of 32 farmers, revealed that socio-economic constraints and agroecological conditions in the area differed markedly along a relatively short altitudinal gradient. Agroforestry practices were already integral to all farming systems. Yet, many were at risk of degradation, as water scarcity, low profitability of production systems and uncontrolled grazing constituted critical barriers to the maintenance and diversification of farm-trees. We demonstrate the discriminatory power of local knowledge, to characterise farming conditions at the local landscape scale; and unveil adoption barriers and options for tree-based diversification in northern Morocco.

TI Tailor-made solutions for regenerative agriculture in the Netherlands
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB CONTEXT: Regenerative agriculture is a farming approach that uses soil health as the entry point to contribute to multiple objectives, such as improved nutrient cycling and climate regulation. To reach these objectives farmers can apply different practices. The objectives and practices, however, are not equally relevant or applicable for every farming system and local context.OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this paper, therefore, was to find out how tailor-made solutions towards regenerative agriculture can be identified and evaluated as such that they result in meaning-full advice for farmers.METHODS: In this study a well-established modelling framework to redesign farming systems was applied to three typical but diverse Dutch farming systems. The modelling framework combined the models Soil Navigator and FarmDESIGN to simultaneously assess five soil functions at field-level and general sustainability indicators (e.g. greenhouse gas emissions) at farm-level. We applied the modelling framework to an arable farm on clay soil, a dairy farm on peat soil, and a mixed farm on sand soil. We subsequently explored a multitude of tailor-made solutions composed of combinations of practices for these farming systems, each showing solutions that contributed in varying degrees towards the objectives of regenerative agriculture.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: In total, we created 4000 alternative solutions per case-study farm. For all farming systems, environmental performance was improved in the solutions dominated by the use of regenerative practices. For example, for the arable, the dairy, and the mixed case-study farm, greenhouse gas emissions were reduced by 50% (from 4 to 2 Mg CO2 eq. ha-1), 6% (from 30 to 28 Mg CO2 eq. ha-1), and 23% (from 21 to 16 Mg CO2 eq. ha-1), respectively, while maintaining soil functionality at high capacity for four out of the five soil functions. This overall improvement in environmental performance due to the application of regenerative practices, also resulted in reduced farm profitability for all case-study farms by on average 50%. We discuss that a mechanism to incentivize farmers for their tailor-made contribution to regenerative agriculture is for stake-holders to shift focus from solely primary productivity to also other ecosystem services.SIGNIFICANCE: This study contributes to the wider implementation of regenerative agriculture, by showing which regenerative objectives and farming practices can contribute to the transition towards regenerative agriculture in contrasting contexts. The modelling framework that is used, can underpin regenerative manage-ment for farmers and other stakeholders to help, for example, the valorization of multiple regenerative objectives in business models.

TI Advantages of an Orychophragmus violaceus-maize rotation in reducing
   greenhouse gas emissions and reactive nitrogen losses and increasing net
   ecosystem economic benefits on the North China Plain
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Introducing cover crops into crop rotation systems is widely practiced to enhance the sustainability of agricultural production, but comprehensive evaluations of farmlands in cover crop-maize rotations on the North China Plain (NCP) from environmental, economic and net ecosystem economic benefits (NEEB) perspectives have rarely been performed. Therefore, a field experiment was conducted to compare economic benefits (EB), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, reactive nitrogen (Nr) losses, soil nutrient cycling values (SNV) and NEEB in three farming systems. The farming systems included a conventional wheat-maize (WM) rotation system, a government-promoted monoculture maize (MM) system and an innovative Orychophragmus violaceus (O. violaceus)-maize (OvM) rotation system. The OvM rotation system achieved more EBs from the maize season but lower annual profits than the WM system, with 68.29% lower GHG emissions and 39.33% lower Nr losses. In addition, the highest SNV was achieved in the OvM rotation system, which was 700.18% and 116.97% higher than those in the WM and MM systems, respectively. Furthermore, the NEEB of the OvM rotation system was 61.92% and 29.31% higher than those of the WM and MM systems, respectively. In conclusion, the OvM rotation is recommended as a sustainable and cleaner maize production farming system for the NCP and other regions with similar ecological conditions because it led to lower annual GHG emissions and Nr losses, as well as higher SNV and NEEB than the other farming systems.

The study was carried out with before and after approach for the economics of diversification of existing farming systems. Before diversification, the results of crop component, animal component, product diversification and capacity building were (sic) 360670, (sic) 42,640, (sic) 47,860, and (sic) 451170. After diversification these were increased (sic) 586624 (62.65%), (sic) 71601 (67.92 %), (sic) 59510 (24.34%) and (sic) 717735 (59.08%). These results were because of providing improved varieties and inputs, arranging visit and training to farmers on field crop production, providing technical knowledge of improved package of practices, supply for semen and artificial insemination and mineral mixture and goat kids of improved breed, providing technical knowledge regarding animal health and providing equipments like grading sieve /ghee making equipments, etc. The study results revealed that the interventions at each aspect of crop, animal and product diversification were increases in employment, income and improved the standard of living of selected farmers. The sustainable diversified farming systems are seen highly profitable and the appropriate diversification of components increases the production per unit area, and reduced the costs of production.

TI Exploring Synergies Among Agricultural Sustainability Dimensions: An
   Empirical Study on Farming System in Almeria (Southeast Spain)
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB Measuring sustainability is a multi-attribute issue consisting of numerous variables that tend to be interrelated. The holistic perspective and the determination of said relationships, synergies and/or trade-offs, are aspects that have been receiving close attention in the literature on the subject. This paper aims to develop an analysis that considers these topics regarding the farming system in Almeria, utilizing primary data obtained from surveys of a sampling of farmers and secondary data from the sector. A series of ecological, social and economic indicators are determined, following the framework of the Sustainability Assessment of Farming and the Environment (SAFE), and its subsequent aggregation using synthetic indexes. The estimation of interrelationships is carried out by means of a multivariate analysis, considering the endogeneity between the sustainability dimensions and the influence of several features of the agrifood system. The results reveal that the increase in the economic and social indicators reduces environmental pressures on the use of resources; in parallel, it can also be observed how social and environmental improvements reveal positive effects on the economic dimension of the farmers. Overall, this study presents an analytical study that combines indicators at farm level and the effects related to the productive activities surrounding agriculture. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI ROTAT, a tool for systematically generating crop rotations
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
AB This paper reports part of a methodology for a model-based exploration of land use motivated by the lack of sustainability of small farming systems in southern Uruguay. Explorative land use studies aim to gain insight into future possibilities for agricultural development. They support strategic thinking during the design of new farming systems. The crop rotation plays a central role in a farming system and represents a logical starting point in the design process. The combination and sequence of crop species determine characteristics of farming systems such as crop yields, soil erosion, occurrence of soil-borne pests, diseases and weeds, and dynamics of nitrogen and labour. Here, we present a software tool called ROTAT, designed for generating crop rotations based on agronomic criteria in a transparent manner. The program combines crops from a predefined list to generate all possible rotations. The full factorial number of possible combinations of crops is limited by a number of filters controlled by the user. These filters are designed to eliminate crop successions which are agronomically unfeasible and for farm-specific reasons not practical or desirable. The filters represent expert knowledge in a quantitative and explicit way. The use of this computer program as a stand-alone tool in the process of designing crop rotations is illustrated with a published case study from an ecological pilot farm in Flevoland (The Netherlands). Using this software we were able to design 840 rotations based on the same crops and designing criteria that were used for the example farm. Many of these rotations might be interesting alternatives to the one actually implemented. Coupled with a sound procedure to evaluate the performance of such a large number of rotations 'a priori', ROTAT can reduce the risk of ignoring promising options and the arbitrariness present in previous studies dealing with design of rotations. The usefulness Of ROTAT for designing production activities in explorative land use studies based on linear programming is discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Long-Term Effects of Fertilization on Soil Organism Diversity
SO SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE REVIEWS 28: ECOLOGY FOR AGRICULTURE
SE Sustainable Agriculture Reviews
AB Fertilization applied in long-term farming systems exerts a crucial influence on soil organism diversity and soil properties. This chapter reviews the use of fertilizers for conventional and alternative farming systems in field experiments in order to improve our understanding of the temporal changes on soil organic carbon, soil total nitrogen, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi diversity and soil macroarthropods during their long-term utilization. We introduce what are the main effects of long-term fertilization systems on several agricultural farming systems around the world. We also present our experimental data about long-term utilization of mineral and organic fertilization from wheat and rapeseed field experiments. Published field studies show that the continuous use of mineral fertilizers might affect negatively soil organic carbon and total nitrogen, which in turn modifies the community composition of macroarthropods, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, whereas organic fertilizers might affect positively these soil properties and soil organism diversity. Our review shows that inputs of organic matter sources can change positively soil properties and annual crop development and yield. Our review also highlights the importance of considering the long-term effect of organic fertilization combined with agricultural management practices, such as stubble retention, fertilization with micronutrient, and inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and N-fixing bacteria on the maintenance of soil fertility and to improve the diversity of soil organisms.

CL LAKE BUENA VISTA, FL
SP Vegetable Crops Management Working Grp
AB Sales of organic products reached $8 billion in the U.S. in 2000, continuing the nearly decade-long trend of 20% annual growth. In Iowa alone, organic production for all crops was 5265 ha (13,000 acres) in 1995 but 60,750 ha (150,000 acres) in 1999. Despite the growth in organic agriculture, our knowledge of organic farming systems remains limited. We have adopted a systems theory approach in our current research program at Iowa State University (ISU) to help address this gap in understanding. Systems theory holds that biological systems, such as agroecosystems, consist of integrated units of people, plants, animals, soil, insects and microorganisms, and each subsystem provides feedback to the other. In order to obtain input on research questions and experimental design, the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture and ISU held six focus groups across Iowa in 1998 before long-term site establishment. Producers and agricultural professionals at the focus groups supported the need for long-term agroccological research (LTAR) sites in four distinct agroecological zones in Iowa. The goal of each LTAR is to examine the short- and long-term physical, biological, and socioeconomic effects of organic and conventional farming systems. By establishing long-term experiments, we are testing the hypothesis that longer crop rotations, typical of organic farms, provide yield stability, improve plant protection, and enhance soil health and economic benefits compared to conventional systems with shorter rotations and greater off-farm inputs. Examples of research results from two LTAR experiments in Iowa include similar pepper (Capsicum annuum) and soybean (Glycine max) yields in the conventional and organic systems. Organic systems used mechanical weed control and locally produced compost in place of synthetic fertilizers. Feedback from the local farm associations that are responsible for farm stewardship and farm finances is inherent in the LTAR process.

TI Sustainable livelihood security of small farmers improved through a
   resilient farming system in the semiarid region of India
SO LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB Improving the farming system to attain the household level self-sufficiency, land utilization efficiency and sustainable livelihood security depends on better socio-economic and ecological aspects of the systems practiced by the small farmers in the semiarid regions of India. The higher sustainable livelihood security index (SLSI) in the integrated crops-livestock system helps to restore economic and ecological sustainability. The aim of this study was to analyze how various modules of farming in different combinations have interacted with the diversification of existing systems. We used the ecological security index (ESI), economic efficiency index (EEI), and social equity index (SEI) to produce a SLSI of improved integrated farming system (IFS) compared with benchmark farming in semiarid regions. In this study, different existing IFS comprising of seven modules (field crops, dairy, goats, poultry, horticulture, fishery, and apiary) in different combinations were examined. Results revealed that 72.5% farmers preferred to integrate two modules, where as 95% of farmers adopted field crops + dairy (FC + D) in preference to other modules. The sustainability indicators: ESI (+43.3%), EEI (+16.0%), SEI (+11.6%), and SLSI (+6.0%) were improved in the FC + D farming system to a greater degree than other IFS module combinations. Similarly, improved IFS interventions also increased sustainability indicators over benchmark farming. Based on large scale household studies over 5 years, our findings suggest that the improved IFS succeeded in providing a wider array of livelihood security than existing practices. Hence, the paradigm shift from component approach to an IFS-based resilient system, which is economically viable, environmentally sustainable, and socially acceptable, is needed for development of semiarid regions.

TI Early stages of crop expansion have little effect on farm-scale
   vegetation patterns in a Cerrado biome working landscape
SO LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
AB In addition to protected areas, sustainable working landscapes are key to successful biodiversity conservation. Yet such landscapes are threatened by rapid crop expansion, in particular in Brazil. In this context, this study explores the influence of farming systems on farm-scale vegetation patterns around the Serra da Bodoquena National Park in Mato Grosso do Sul. To collect data on farming systems and how they are evolving, we conducted interviews at 40 farms covering 120,000 ha, including eight farms with land within the national park. To assess vegetation patterns, we conducted pixel-wise and landscape analyses based on MapBiomas land cover maps from which we calculated seven metrics over the 2009-2019 period. Using multivariate methods, we identified the activities that differentiated farming systems, isolating five farm types with contrasting involvement in crop cultivation and ranching. We found that most farm-scale landscape metrics were only weakly influenced by farming systems. Temporal analyses and interviews suggested that biophysical and legislative contexts limit crop expansion, which mainly occurred at the expense of old pastures and did not directly impact forest proportion within farms. As a consequence, crop expansion in the region seemed to mainly affect small tree patches in pasture areas, making its effect on vegetation patterns barely detectable with 30-m resolution imagery. These findings suggest that rather than focusing solely on deforestation, monitoring the dynamics of wooded pastures with high-resolution images is crucial to assess the early effects of crop expansion on vegetation patterns and to ensure the conservation of biodiversity-friendly agricultural matrices around protected areas in Brazil.

TI Modelling worker physical health and societal sustainability at farm
   level: An application to conventional and organic dairy farming
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB Farm-level modelling can be used to determine how farming systems and individual farm-management measures influence different sustainability indicators. Until now however, worker physical health and societal sustainability have been lacking in farm models. For this paper, we first selected attributes of physical health (working conditions) and societal sustainability (food safety, animal welfare and health, and landscape quality). Second, possible sustainability indicators for these attributes were identified, and those selected were included in an existing dairy farm LP-model that was subsequently used to analyse possible differences in societal sustainability within and between a conventional and organic dairy farming system. Results for physical health and societal sustainability were similar for conventional and organic dairy farming systems in the basis situation, as well as in the situation where additional management measures were applied to improve societal sustainability, but improved animal welfare did result in the organic system due to prescribed grazing, and due to assumed summer feeding in the conventional system. Results show that additional management measures considerably improved societal sustainability of the conventional as well as the organic system. LP-modelling appeared to be a suitable method for comparing fanning systems and determining the effect of management measures on physical health and societal sustainability. The level of societal sustainability is determined mainly by applied management measures, and is related to the particular farming system in only a very limited way. This implies that societal sustainability is mainly dependent on the cost-effectiveness of management measures and on the attitude of the dairy farmer. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The share of agriculture in gross domestic product has registered a steady decline from 36.4% in 1982-83 to 14.5% in 2013-14. Yet this sector continues to support more than half a billion people proving employment to 52% of the work force. It is also an important source of raw material and demand for many industrial products. Growth of agriculture over a period of time remained lower than the growth in non-agriculture sector. The gap began to widen since 1981-82 and more particularly since 1996-97, because of acceleration in the growth of industry and service sector. Survey on cropping system was carried out in tribal districts of Rajasthan. Using the stratified random sampling and probability proportion sampling, 450 farmers belonging to size groups, based on the size of holding were selected from five tehsils of tribal districts of Rajasthan. The secondary data has been taken from published records of state and central government. Data are interpreted as averages and percentages. The percentage of forest area to the total geographical area in Dungarpur and Banswara districts is more than double compared to forest area at the state level. It is evident that total cropped area in the state is 17,914,166 ha of which 55.76% (9,989,675 ha) kept under cereals and small millets, 24.84% (4,449,229 ha) under pulses, 18.82% (3,372,130 ha) under oilseeds crops and 0.58% (103,132 ha) under commercial crops. It is evident that of the total 577 lakh animals in the state, the population of goat is the highest (37.53%) followed by cattle (23.08%), buffalo (22.48%), and sheep (15.73%). In this study irrespective of the rain-fed and irrigated condition as well as location of the selected districts, four farming systems were observed. The study area is tribal dominating area where 50% tribal of the country are residing. An alternative farming system, which yields not only higher income but also utilizes family labor efficiency, needs to be evolved. Further, the system should help in restoration of ecological balance. The basic aim of integrated/ sustainable farming system is to derive a set of resource development, management, and utilization practices that lead to a substantial and sustained increase in agricultural production. It is evident that out of 30 farmers, the maximum number of farmers (40%) adopted FS-II (Crop + Dairy) followed by FS-I (Crop + Vegetable) and FS-III (Crop + Dairy + Goat) and only 13.33% farmers followed FS-IV (Crop + Goat + Poultry). The highest cropping intensity was observed in FS-II (C+ D), i. e., 94.44% followed by FS-I and FS-IV. The lowest cropping intensity was seen in FS-III (88.23%). In rain-fed area, cropping intensity was low due to non-availability of irrigation facilities and farmers were forced to take crops only in one season.

TI Evaluation of the environmental, economic, and social performance of
   soybean farming systems in southern Brazil
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Soybean production has a crucial role in the development of Brazilian agriculture and recently became the most important commodity in Brazilian agribusiness. Various soybean farming systems exist, which are claimed to differ in terms of sustainability performance. In this regard, evaluation of environmental, economic, and social performance of different soybean farming systems in Brazil, by consideration of variability in input parameters, is critically needed. In this context, we evaluated a number of environmental, economic, and social issues for the two main soybean farming systems in southern Brazil, the conventional system, which produces genetically modified (GM) or non-genetically modified (non-GM) soybeans, and the organic system. Data were collected for 2012 from three sources: soybean farms in Parana, Brazil (15 GM, 15 non-GM, and 15 organic farms), the Brazilian Enterprise for Agricultural Research (EMBRAPA), and expert elicitation. Monte Carlo simulation was used to account for the variation in input parameters. Five sustainability issues were evaluated in this study: global warming, land occupation, primary energy use, profitability, and employment. Results revealed that, compared with the GM and non-GM systems, organic systems had a higher probability (77%) to have a lower global warming potential. Land occupation was higher and energy use was lower for organic systems than for the GM and non-GM systems at every level of probability. Concerning profitability, organic systems had a higher probability (60%) to have higher profitability compared with GM and non-GM production, and employment was higher for organic systems at every level of probability. Overall, simulation results of this study illustrated the relatively high level of variation in the environmental, economic, and social performance of organic soybean farming systems. This study shows that accounting for variability in key system parameters provides not only insight in the most likely outcomes, but also in the robustness of system performance.

SO CURRENT SCIENCE
AB Mono-cropping of rice-wheat system in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) has resulted in natural resource degradation, decline in farm profitability, factor productivity and environmental security. Contrary to mono-cropping, biodiversity is considered as an index to agricultural sustainability. Accordingly, an integrated farming system (IFS) model involving land-based enterprises - crops, dairy, fishery, duckery, poultry, biogas plant and agroforestry was developed in 1 ha area at the ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi during 2015-16 to 2017-18. The objective of the present study was to find an alternative approach to replace rice-wheat system and enhance farmer's income in a sustainable manner. The IFS model had the potential to improve farmers' livelihood with a variety of produce, on-farm resource recycling and enhancing their income to INR 378,784 as against INR 68,200 from the rice-wheat system. The waste and by-products of one enterprise served as an input for the other, and reliance on off-farm inputs was reduced to a great extent aiding in strengthening environmental sustainability.

TI Farming systems in the Australian semi-arid tropics - A recent history
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
CT Workshop on Conservation Farming for the Semi-Arid Tropics
CY JUL 18-20, 1995
CL KATHERINE, AUSTRALIA
SP Austr Inst Agr Sci, No Territory Zone, Doug Peake Mem Trust
AB The recent history of dryland farming in the Australian semi-arid tropics is discussed briefly against the background of national and state policies, established following World War II, aimed at increasing the population and development of northern Australia. Some reference is also made to irrigation as a means of overcoming limitations imposed by rainfall and to complement dryland farming systems.
   The environmental and socio-economic constraints which have so far limited commercial agriculture in the Australian semi-arid tropics are highlighted. Efforts, particularly in north-west Australia, to develop sustainable fanning systems based on legume pasture leys and livestock production in conjunction with annual cropping, as a basis for closer settlement, are reviewed. These attempts, which began in the 1960s and stemmed from earlier post-war agricultural research in the region, initially relied on a pasture legume (Stylosanthes humilis cv. Townsville style) and conventional tillage. Farming system development continues today using new legume species (e.g. Stylosanthes hamata cv. Verano and Centrosema pascuorum cv. Cavalcade) and no-tillage cropping technology.
   This paper documents the history of agricultural and research development, and commercial practice in the Australian semi-arid tropics.

TI Overview of holistic application of biogas for small scale farmers in
   Sub-Saharan Africa
SO BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
AB Holistic farming systems provide designs for the whole farm that make long term sustainable use of nutrients, water, labour, finances and energy. In using organic residues to produce energy, and safely recycling the digested residues back into the farming system, a biogas digester could be a central component of many holistic systems. This paper discusses the influence of environmental, socioeconomic and cultural constraints on the use of biogas digesters in holistic farming systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. In higher altitude areas where maintenance of optimal temperature can constrain anaerobic digestion, floating drum or fixed dome digesters are a better option than flexible balloon digesters because they are less susceptible to temperature changes. If water is a key constraint, rainwater harvesting could be used to reduce the additional labour needed to collect water. If energy is the most limiting resource in the farming system, the optimum use of organic residues might be as a fuel for anaerobic digestion, whereas, if water is limiting, energy production by burning or pyrolysis might be a better option. The bioslurry from anaerobic digestion can be used in fish ponds to produce plankton to feed fish, and can be applied to fertile fields and fields of intermediate fertility, while biochar from pyrolysis is better used to improve the soil in infertile fields. If labour is limiting, it is particularly important that the system design minimises any additional labour needed to process the organic residues on a daily basis, considering trade-offs between labour and other resources.

CY SEP, 2005
CL CYPRUS
AB Most scientific approaches in research are done under objectified, controlled conditions. Such experiments do not reflect the everyday reality of farmers. Moreover, experimental research in agriculture does not always reflect the interests of Jordanian farmers. Another type of research is therefore needed. We need research that integrates Gamma and Beta sciences, farmers and scientists and the environment and agricultural production. Prototyping, a mix of experimental farm research and agronomic designing is an answer to those needs. Sustainable farming in practice has nothing to do with improved commodities or farming systems, only with skilled decision making. A sustainable development of a farm needs the farmer's opinions and experiences. This paper presents a method for concerted conversions by groups of farmers, facilitated by scientists and extension officers. The method happens in four steps: setting the general and specific objectives of the farmer, determination of quantified objectives, identification of optimised farming practices and creating theoretical prototype.

TI Organic Agriculture Supports Biodiversity and Sustainable Food
   Production
SO JOURNAL OF HUNGER & ENVIRONMENTAL NUTRITION
AB Biodiversity is vital to several important ecosystem services that ensure sustainability of food production. In organic agriculture, land management practices that promote biodiversity and soil quality are emphasized and the goal is to maintain a sustainable agricultural system. Soil quality or soil health is the foundation for all agriculture and natural plant communities and a primary indicator of sustainable land management. Soil quality is affected by farm management and land use decisions. This article presents a review of the literature on the question: How do organic agriculture and conventional agriculture differ in regard to their impact on biodiversity and ecosystem services? All of the 22 articles identified in this review reported a significant increase in at least one variable that indicated enhanced biodiversity and/or ecosystem services on sites farmed using an organic farming system compared to sites farmed using a conventional farming system. This review underlines the importance of biodiversity, particularly soil biodiversity, to sustainable food production and underscores the need for further ecological studies on the links between farm management systems and soil quality.

TI Farming systems in southeastern Nigeria: Implications for sustainable
   agricultural production
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB This study examines the farming systems in southeastern Nigeria. Using a structured questionnaire, 300 farmers were selected through multistage random sampling techniques. The data collected were subjected to descriptive analysis of simple proportions and percentages. Findings from the study revealed that 72% of the respondents engaged in both crop and livestock production. Intercropping was the dominant cropping system with cassava, yam, and maize as the principal arable crops, while cocoa, kolanut, oil palm, rubber, cashew, banana/ plantain and citrus were the main permanent crops. The dominant fallow period was found to be three to four years and most farm sizes were less than 2 hectares. The study also showed that 88% of the respondents knew of fertilizer, 61% knew of other agrochemicals, while 56% and 16% utilized them, respectively. Findings generally point to inefficiencies in some of the existing farming practices. Addressing the constraints identified in this study may improve the farming systems in the study area and thus increase agricultural production on a sustainable basis.

TI Effect of cover crops in smothering weeds and volunteer plants in
   alternative farming systems
SO CROP PROTECTION
AB Alternative farming systems such as sustainable and organic farming are used to produce premium price food products and retain the viability and fertility of soil. Field experiments were conducted at Joniskelis Experimental Station of the Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry in 2006-2012. The research objective was to investigate the competitive ability of plants cultivated as cover crops: narrow-leafed lupine (Lupinus angustifolius L) in mixture with an oil radish (Raphanus sativus var. Oleiferus Metzg.) (LUPRA); white mustard (Sinapis alba L.) (WM); white mustard in mixture with a common buckwheat (Fagopyrum exculentum Moench.) (WMBU) to smother weeds in organic and sustainable farming systems in soil with low (1.90-2.01%) (LH) and moderate (2.10-2.40%) (MH) humus content. Cover crops cultivated for green manure were investigated during the post-harvest period of winter wheat. This experiment showed that cover crops have a strong competitive ability to smother weeds and emerged volunteer plants. It also demonstrated that narrow-leafed lupine in combination with oil radish, cultivated in the organic farming system, was less effective at smothering weeds compared with white mustard cultivated as a sole crop or in combination with buckwheat. In a rotation without cover crop in soil with low and moderate humus content, the number and biomass of weeds was higher compared with the farming systems with cover crops. A correlation-regression analysis showed that the cover crops had a higher impact on the biomass of weeds and volunteer plants in soil with low humus content to compare with moderate humus content. The most effective inhibition of volunteer plant and weed biomass in soils with both humus contents was observed, when white mustard and a mixture of white mustard and buckwheat were used as cover crops. The practical implication of this research is suggestion, that cover crops could be successfully used as integrated weed control tool in farm fields. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Analysing production and environmental risks in arable farming systems:
   A mathematical approach
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
AB In response to a growing environmental concern in Dutch society, sustainable production systems in arable fanning have been developed. Amongst other things, a reduction of the dependency on chemical inputs is attempted. This paper addresses the role of risk in the adoption by farmers of new systems by means of a model that determines differences in production risks between conventional and sustainable farming systems (CAFS and IAFS).
   Timing of activities - setting out a management track - is particularly important in sustainable arable farming systems. Resource requirements of crop husbandry activities mainly depend on weather conditions. To assess risks caused by weather conditions, the major aspects of crop husbandry in various crops have been modelled. Using tactics in crop husbandry (decision rules) and weather uncertainty as input, crop husbandry models (HMs) calculate management tracks that require resources. The value distributions of resource requirements of crop husbandry according to different farming systems is calculated in different HMs represented by stochastic dynamic directed networks. Hence, production risks of CAFS and IAFS can be compared.
   On a farm, all the aspects of crop husbandry in the various crops are to be taken into account. Given the weather conditions, tactics for all the aspects are combined in an LP model of the whole farm where they compete for limited resources. In the LP model, tactics are re-assessed by means of the HMS, using information of the LP solution. This iterative procedure enables production risks of OAFS and IAFS to be compared, considering fixed, allocatable resources for the whole farm firm. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Assessment of energy use in arable farming systems by means of an
   agro-ecological indicator: the energy indicator
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB Efficient energy use by the agriculture sector is one of the conditions for sustainable agriculture because it allows financial savings, fossil resources preservation and air pollution decrease. We propose an Energy indicator (I-En) to evaluate environmental impacts due to energy consumption of arable farming systems to help farmers to manage their energy inputs at the field level according to the guidelines of integrated agriculture. I-En is based on the energetic analysis of four types of energy: two for indirect energy (pesticides and fertilisers) and two for direct energy (machinery and irrigation systems). In a second step, the assessed values of energy consumption are converted by means of an abacus into a mark between 0 and 10. I-En needs only data that are available on farms or easily assessed, and will be implemented with a set of seven other agro-ecological indicators to assess environmental sustainability of farms.

TI Can traders help farmers transition towards more sustainable maize based
   farming systems? Evidence from the Lao-Vietnamese border
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB Intensive maize cultivation in the uplands of North-west Vietnam has resulted in soil erosion leading to reduced maize yields along with negative impacts downstream. Despite the introduction of sustainable agricultural technologies over many years, adoption rates are low mostly due to their incompatibility with existing farming systems and lack of secure markets for alternative crops. In addition, the temporary nature of development programmes and limited capacity of government extension systems have resulted in limited spread of technology, and where they have been introduced, unable to secure long-lasting commitments from farmers. In this study, we explore an alternative model involving maize value chain actors for attaining more durable transition towards sustainable maize farming systems. We find maize traders operating at lower levels of the value chain with active engagement with the farming community to be best suited for engaging in technology dissemination. While their involvement may require additional incentives and oversight from the government it is imperative that support for commercialization through promising market links are established to achieve a more meaningful shift towards sustainable farming methods.

TI Crop-livestock integration determines the agroecological performance of
   mixed farming systems in Latino-Caribbean farms
SO AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Characterizing and understanding the complexity of numerous interactions occurring in mixed farming systems is still a methodological challenge. We hypothesize that farm functioning features in terms of crop-livestock integration practices impact the agroecological performance of the system, which will be also affected by the farm context. In order to analyze crop-livestock integration in a holistic way, a set of seventeen mixed farming systems from three contrasting socioeconomic regions of the humid tropics (Guadeloupe, Brazilian Amazonia, and Cuba) was selected in order to cover a wide range of crop-livestock integration situations. The ecological network analysis was applied to each farm in order to study the nutrient flow networks, expressed in nitrogen. The activity and flow organization of crop-livestock integration practices were characterized and the agroecological performance has been evaluated in terms of efficiency, resilience, productivity, and dependency of N flow networks. Here, we show for the first time that the range of crop-livestock integration is well characterized by the activity and organization of flows. Gradients of crop-livestock integration were well detected and described. Some agroecological performances were related to a particular socioeconomic context. Resource endowment influenced efficiency, according to the intensification level. The crop-livestock integration however contributed partially to the productivity of the system, being especially effective in promoting resilience. This study applies a suitable framework to analyze complex farming systems while linking their functioning and performance in an agroecological approach. Thus, comparison of contrasting systems was feasible here with the support of numerical and tangible figures for interpreting complex indicators (e.g., resilience), representing a useful tool for monitoring sustainability of agricultural systems in a dynamic and holistic way.

TI Farmer challenge-derived indicators for assessing sustainability of
   low-input ruminant production systems in sub-Saharan Africa
SO ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
AB The process of consulting stakeholders, particularly farmers, in developing appropriate indicators for sustainability evaluation of low-input ruminant systems is often compromised by limited awareness and understanding of the sustainability concept by farmers in developing countries. Insights from farmers' challenges present useful prospects for developing context-specific sustainability evaluation indicators for low-input ruminant systems. In the present review, a meta-analysis was used to develop farmer challenge-derived indicators for the sustainability evaluation of low-input ruminant farming system in sub-Saharan Africa. Key ecological challenges reported were low forage quality, poor soil quality, feed shortages and; economic challenges were low poor marketing structure, high cost of labour, and poor transport network, poor marketing infrastructure; and social challenges were rural to urban migration, lack of animal breeding management and inadequate access to information. The corresponding derived ecological indicators were biomass quality, soil quality, high winds; economic indicators were available marketing infrastructure, labour costs, transport networks; and social indicators were rural to urban migration, animal management training and access to information. The review shows that farmers' challenges can be transformed to indicators for assessing the sustainability of the low-input ruminant farming system in sub-Saharan Africa.

TI Comparative study of conventional and organic vegetable produce quality
   and public perception in Kuwait
SO KUWAIT JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
AB Kuwait, like other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, depends almost entirely on food imports for national food security with all the risks involved. There is a growing realization for the exigent necessity to enhance domestic production, and local farmers are adopting farming system they perceive as organic. Organic agriculture can be a proven solution for feeding people in a healthy and environmentally sustainable manner. This study was designed to investigate nutritive values and the safety of organic produce compared to conventionally grown vegetable crops sold in Kuwaiti supermarkets. Findings indicated slightly higher total nitrogen (TN) in organic than in conventionally grown crops, except lettuce (5.14% vs. 4.56% for broccoli, 4.5% vs. 1.34% for cabbage and 1.9% vs. 2.5% for lettuce). Total phosphorus (TP) levels, however, were lower in organic as compared to conventionally grown vegetable crops (3676.075 mg kg(-1) vs. 4545.2 mg kg(-1) for broccoli, 2416.3 mg kg(-1) vs. 2947 mg kg(-1) for cabbage and 4178.94 mg kg(-1) vs. 4555.31 mg kg(-1) for lettuce). With respect to heavy metals, the potential for arsenic (As), copper (Cu), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) transfer into vegetables was studied. Arsenic content was significantly (p < 0.05) greater in local organic lettuce (3.5 mg kg(-1)) than other farming systems. Cu was highest (10.38 mg kg(-1)) in local organic broccoli, and Zn content was highest in local organic lettuce (108.7 mg kg(-1)). An accompanying public perception survey in Kuwait indicated a willingness of most consumers to spend more premium on organic produce because of the perception of it being healthier than conventional produce. People showed a preference to consume more organic food if it were grown locally with a reasonable price. While local farmers perceive their production system as completely organic, internationally recognized certification standards and regulations are currently non-existent. Therefore, an existing domestic farming system can only be described as organic by traditional practices.

TI Socio-economic Impacts-Agricultural Systems
SO NORTH SEA REGION CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENT
SE Regional Climate Studies
AB Europe is one of the world's largest and most productive suppliers of food and fibre. In the North Sea region, agroecosystems vary from highly productive farming systems such as the arable cropping systems of western Europe to low-input and low-output farming systems with or without livestock. Climate change impacts on agricultural production will vary across the North Sea region, both in terms of crops grown and yields obtained. Given adequate water and nutrient supply, a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration could lead to yield increases of 20-40 % for most crops grown in the North Sea region. The high-input farming systems could also respond favourably to modest warming. Extreme weather events may severely disrupt crop production. Increased temperature and more frequent extreme weather events could affect animal production through changes in feed production, changes in the availability of grazing, direct heat stress, and increased risk of disease. Overall, there seems to be potential for agriculture in the North Sea region to adapt to the changing climate in such a way that productivity and profitability may both increase, particularly over the long term. The challenge will be to ensure sustainable growth in agricultural production without compromising environmental quality and natural resources.

TI The relations between city and agriculture in time and space: A systemic
   review in the city-region of Montpellier
SO CAHIERS AGRICULTURES
AB This paper deals with the relations between city and farming activities through long term history, spatial dynamics and analysis of public policies. The growth of Montpellier-city was historically linked to the expansion of the vineyard and wine economy. In the second half of the 20th century however, the city and farming drew apart: urban sprawl versus the wine industry. Over a decade, new relations have arisen: Montpellier city-region has linked high quality wines to its image and set up a Masterplan including planning tools for conservation of farmland and containment of urban sprawl. At the same time, the decline in the wine industry has released land for new farming systems that are better connected with growing urban demands for local food. Today, the future of agriculture is open: various combinations of farming systems are identified on the fringes of Montpellier. Public actors are better taking agriculture into account in land use planning and territorial projects. Further outwards from the city, areas of fast residential suburban growth are also experiencing new farming systems based on terroir production and short food supply chains. The case of the Montpellier city-region offers a large panel of the agri-urban trends that can be observed around Mediterranean cities of Southern Europe, which leads us to seek to clarify the scales of space and time of agricultural urban systems.

TI Evaluation of sustainability of organic, integrated and conventional
   farming systems: a farm and field-scale analysis
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB Agricultural researchers widely recognise the importance of sustainable agricultural production systems and the need to develop appropriate methods to measure sustainability. The principal purpose of this paper is to evaluate the financial and environmental aspects of sustainability of organic, integrated and conventional farming systems (OFS, IFS and CFS, respectively) at farm level and on more detailed spatial scales. This was achieved by applying an integrated economic-environmental accounting framework to three case study farms in Tuscany (Italy) covering different farming systems (FSs) and different spatial scales. The environmental performances of the FSs were measured through the application of an environmental accounting information system (EAIS) at field, site and farm level. The EAIS indicators were then integrated with: (1) a set of financial indicators to evaluate the economic and environmental trade-offs between different FSs and (2) with information on the regional and site-specific soil and climate conditions to study the impact of different pedo-climates on the environmental performances of the FSs. The gross margins of steady-state OFSs were found to be higher than the corresponding CFS gross margins. The OFSs perform better than IFSs and CFSs with respect to nitrogen losses, pesticide risk, herbaceous plant biodiversity and most of the other environmental indicators. However, on hilly soils, erosion was found to be higher in OFSs than in CFSs. The pesticide and the nitrogen indicators in this study showed a similar environmental impact caused by integrated and conventional farming practices. Regional pedo-climatic factors were found to have a considerable impact on nutrient losses, soil erosion, pesticide risk and herbaceous plant biodiversity, site-specific: factors on nutrient losses and soil erosion. Results at field level suggest that herbaceous plant biodiversity and crop production are not always conflicting variables. Results of the case study farms are discussed and compared with environmental sustainability thresholds reported from EU Directives on nitrate and pesticides in groundwater and the literature.

AB This paper examines the traditional farming systems and their sustainability, in terms of food security, and what measures to be adapted for enhancement of livelihood of the inhabitants in the Garhwal Himalaya. The Garhwal Himalaya is located in the centre of the Himalayan Mountain System. Characterized by harsh climatic conditions, rough, rugged and precipitous terrain, fragile landscape and economically backwardness, about 95% of the total population is inhabited in rural areas. Traditional cereal farming is the main occupation of the populace as about 80% population is engaged in the production of cereal crops and livestock farming. The farming system in Garhwal Himalaya is peculiar, which is based upon the centuries old practices and carried out mainly on the narrow patches of the terraced fields. The main crops grown are paddy, wheat barley, millets, pulses, and oilseeds. The economic viability of these crops is insufficient even to meet the food requirement of the populace but these crops are environmentally sound and suitable for this ecologically fragile terrain. The scope for further expansion and modernization of agriculture practices is not viable due to the fragility of terrain and precipitous slope. Therefore, an exodus of population emigrated to the foothills of Himalaya and major urban centres of country for the search of job or recruited in national Army. Enhancing and diversifying livelihood options, other than biomass-based production, will definitely raise the income and food-security of the rural mountain people, as the agro-climatic conditions in this region are very much feasible for the cultivation of cash generating crops. Therefore, the scope of cultivation of off-season vegetables, fruits, medicinal plants and collection of non-timber based forest products are tremendous. Cultivation of fruits will also manifest a way for ecological restoration of the fragi le terrain and will enhance the economic level and sustainable livelihood of the inhabitants. Thus, it is suggested that the optimum harnessing of these products will surely provide a base for sustainable livelihood in the region. Data on farming systems were gathered from the primary and secondary sources. Primary data were gathered through structured questionnaire and household survey was done to study of agricultural pattern and production trend. Case studies of the villages were also done for collection of data on horticultural practices.

TI The soil microbial hydrolytic activity, content of nitrogen and organic
   carbon were enhanced by organic farming management using cover crops and
   composts in potato cultivation
SO ACTA AGRICULTURAE SCANDINAVICA SECTION B-SOIL AND PLANT SCIENCE
AB Nowadays, in sustainable agriculture growing winter cover crops and using organic manure have been widely implemented to improve soil quality which leads to increase of microbial activity. Six-year study was performed to evaluate the effect of cropping system on soil microbial hydrolytic activity, content of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (N-tot) under potato cultivation by considering various management systems, while comparing the soil parameters after previous crop. The experiment consisted of five-field crop rotation with two different organic (Org 0 as control and Org II with winter cover crops plus added composted manure) and conventional (Conv 0 as control and Conv II with mineral N, 150 kg ha(-1)) farming systems. The results showed that hydrolytic activity of soil microbes decreased in every farming system under potato cultivation. Interestingly, after potato cultivation, the lowest and highest decrease in the soil microbial hydrolytic activity were seen in Org II and Conv II systems, respectively. The highest soil microbial hydrolytic activity was measured in system Org II where incorporation of biomass from winter cover crops and cattle manure was used. Finally, SOC and N-tot were higher in organic farming systems and there no significant changes after potato cultivation.

TI Methodological considerations for redesigning sustainable cropping
   systems: the value of data-mining large and detailed farm data sets at
   the cropping system level
SO FRONTIERS OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Redesigning cropping and farming systems to enhance their sustainability is mainly addressed in scientific studies using experimental and modeling approaches. Large data sets collected from real farms allow for the development of innovative methods to produce generic knowledge. Data mining methods allow for the diversity of systems to be considered holistically and can take into account the diversity of production contexts to produce site-specific results. Based on the very few known studies using such methods to analyze the crop management strategies affecting pesticide use and their effect on farm performance, we advocate further investment in the development of large data sets that can support future research programs on farming system design.

TI Impact of land use type and organic farming on the abundance, diversity,
   community composition and functional properties of soil nematode
   communities in vegetable farming
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB The excessive application of chemical fertilizers in intensively managed agricultural fields worldwide has resulted in soil degradation and biodiversity loss. This has contributed to a growing interest in sustainable management, such as organic farming. Until now, studies addressing the impact of conventional and organic management on soil biodiversity and functioning have mainly focused on arable farming and only a few reports are available on vegetable production. Vegetable farming is of particular interest, since management intensity is usually very high and there is an increasing demand for vegetable products. Soil nematodes are useful indicators of management intensity on soil ecosystem functioning because they occupy several trophic levels in soil microfood webs and play a crucial role in nutrient cycling, pest suppression, and the regulation of microbial communities. In this study, we assessed the impact of management intensity and farming system on the community structure and functional guilds of soil nematodes, comparing 20 conventional vegetable fields, 20 organic vegetable fields, and 20 extensive grasslands in Switzerland, analyzing over 30'000 nematode individuals and detecting 98 different nematode genera. We found significant differences in the community structure and functional composition across three farming systems. Extensive grasslands contained the highest nematode abundance, followed by organic vegetable fields, and conventional vegetable fields, indicating a decline due to land-use intensification. Organic farming led to a significant increase in the abundance of herbivores (+82%), bacterivores (+206%) and omnivores (+135%) in comparison with conventional farming. Organic management also enhanced composite (+195%) and herbivores (+451%) footprints, suggesting greater carbon and energy enrichment in soil food web through these functional groups. Community composition of soil nematodes varied significantly across the three farming systems, with each farming system fostering specific indicator taxa. In conclusion, our results show that farming system has a major impact on soil nematode communities with increasing nematode populations under organic vegetable farming. Although organic vegetable production may benefit from enhanced soil fertility due to increased population densities of microbe feeding and omnivorous nematodes, the threat from plant parasitic nematodes to vegetable production requires attention and control strategies should be developed further.

TI A second generation of annual pasture legumes and their potential for
   inclusion in Mediterranean-type farming systems
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
AB A second generation of annual pasture legumes and their root-nodule bacteria has been released to agriculture in Mediterranean-type environments. These new species emanate from selection activity focussed upon 'alternative legumes'. In 1992, in response to changing constraints upon production, a program was initiated which sought species with different ideotypic traits to the traditional annual medics and clovers used in agriculture in southern Australia. Traits sought in the new species were deeper root systems, improved persistence from higher hardseed levels, acid tolerant symbioses, tolerance to pests and diseases and ease of harvesting with conventional cereal harvesters. Several cultivars of species new to Australian agriculture such as biserrula (Biserrula pelecinus), French serradella (Ornithopus sativus), gland clover ( Trifolium glanduliferum) and improved varieties of arrowleaf clover ( Trifolium vesiculosum) and yellow serradella ( Ornithopus compressus) were developed and have had rapid adoption and impact in southern Australian ley- and phase-farming systems. This paper reviews the importance of ley farming for Australian agriculture, the shortcomings of the traditional medics and clovers and the imperatives for a second generation of annual pasture legume species to be developed. In addition to enhancing ley farming, the commercial availability of a second generation of annual pasture legume species has provided a much needed impetus for the development of more flexible and sustainable farming systems.

TI Linking trees on farms with biodiversity conservation in subsistence
   farming systems in Nepal
SO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB The Kingdom of Nepal extends 800 km east to west along the southern slopes of the Himalayas. Because of its biogeographical position, Nepal contains biological elements of both the Indo-Malayan and Palaearctic realms. Beside the trees in forest ecosystems, a large number of tree species are maintained on farms as part of subsistence farming systems. The role of these trees in ensuring the sustainability of agricultural production and the importance of traditional farming systems for the conservation of crop diversity have been well documented. However, the status of farm trees and their role in biodiversity conservation are poorly documented. This paper presents a case study of two villages in the western middle hills of Nepal. It highlights the role of traditional agroforestry practices for the conservation of tree diversity and argues that farms can be considered biodiversity reservoirs. Farm trees help to reduce pressure on community and government forests and create a favorable environment for many plant and animal species. Farm trees also provide social functions in that households with many farm trees no longer exercise their communal rights to extract grass products from community forests, which in turn benefits poor and disadvantaged households. The paper discusses possibilities to improve the role of farm trees in biodiversity conservation. It argues for the development of mechanisms such as tax exemptions and conservation credits that provide benefits to rural communities as compensation for their local and global environmental services including biodiversity conservation.

TI Life cycle assessment of biogas production through anaerobic
   co-digestion of nopal cladodes and dairy cow manure
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Nopal (Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Mill.) has the ability to grow in climatic conditions that are adverse for most conventional crops. It can be an alternative for biogas production by co-digestion with dairy cow manure, the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in dairy farms. To evaluate the feasibility of using nopal as a biogas source, the environmental impacts associated with the process need to be quantified. In this study, a life cycle assessment is carried out to evaluate the environmental impacts and energy balance of biogas production through co-digestion of nopal cladodes and dairy cow manure. A Baseline and three scenarios that had different farming systems and digestate storage management strategies were compared. Cropping system and direct field emission data were experimentally obtained from two plots using an organic farming system and a conventional farming system; biogas production and yield data were obtained in a 10-L anaerobic digester. Results indicated that the energy return on investment for biogas production ranged from 8.1 to 12.4. Organic farming system decreases the environmental impact by 22.5% in the global warming potential category but increases the acidification potential and eutrophication potential impact category values by 47.2 and 45% respectively, while covering the digestate tank results in a 2.3% reduction in global warming potential and in a 1.7% reduction in photochemical ozone creation potential. Based on these results, biogas production from nopal cladode and dairy cow manure co-digestion and digestate management offers cleaner energy production since the global warming potential has a lower value than that reported for similar feed-stocks. The use of these two biomasses combines the strengths of a plant that accumulates biomass efficiently and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by using one of the main wastes in dairy production.

TI Reconciling services rendered by grassland in order to ensure the
   sustainability of grassland farming systems
SO FOURRAGES
AB The emergence of new societal expectations plus the new challenges induced by global change, force us to reconsider the way in which we view livestock farming systems. The wide range of services and goods provided by grassland ecosystems offers a considerable opportunity for the future of grassland systems in the face of current challenges. Adopting a multifunctional approach makes it possible to reconcile environmental benefits and production services. Moreover, new opportunities will emerge if the functional role of biodiversity is integrated in the rationalization of management practices. This calls for the elaboration of a model of development which smoothly reconciles services. A new pluridisciplinary expert approach involving territorial players and all those benefiting from rendered services needs to be developed.

TI Sustainability of three apple production systems
SO NATURE
AB Escalating production costs, heavy reliance on non-renewable resources, reduced biodiversity, water contamination, chemical residues in food, soil degradation and health risks to farmworkers handling pesticides all bring into question the sustainability of conventional farming systems(1-4). It has been claimed(5,6), however, that organic farming systems are less efficient, pose greater health risks and produce half the yields of conventional farming systems. Nevertheless, organic farming became one of the fastest growing segments of US and European agriculture during the 1990s(7,8). Integrated farming, using a combination of organic and conventional techniques, has been successfully adopted on a wide scale in Europe(9). Here we report the sustainability of organic, conventional and integrated apple production systems in Washington State from 1994 to 1999. All three systems gave similar apple yields. The organic and integrated systems had higher soil quality and potentially lower negative environmental impact than the conventional system. When compared with the conventional and integrated systems, the organic system produced sweeter and less tart apples, higher profitability and greater energy efficiency. Our data indicate that the organic system ranked first in environmental and economic sustainability, the integrated system second and the conventional system last.

TI Integrated rice-fish farming in Bangladesh: meeting the challenges of
   food security
SO FOOD SECURITY
AB In order to meet the soaring demand for food, there is a need to increase rice and fish production in Bangladesh. In spite of the potential for rice-fish farming, rice monoculture remains the main farming system in Bangladesh. However, rice monoculture cannot provide a sustainable food supply without a cost to long-term environmental sustainability. We provide evidence that integrated rice-fish farming can play an important role in increasing food production as the integrated farming system is better than rice monoculture in terms of resource utilization, diversity, productivity, and both the quality and quantity of the food produced. The Cobb-Douglas production function model also suggests that higher yields can be achieved by increasing inputs in the integrated farming system. Integrated rice-fish farming also provides various socioeconomic and environmental benefits. Nevertheless, only a small number of farmers are involved in integrated rice-fish farming due to a lack of technical knowledge, and an aversion to the risks associated with flood and drought. We conclude that integrated rice-fish farming can help Bangladesh keep pace with the current demand for food through rice and fish production but requires greater encouragement if it is to realize its full potential.

TI Quantifying the sustainability of three types of agricultural production
   in China: An emergy analysis with the integration of environmental
   pollution
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Agriculture is currently confronted with the great challenge of feeding a soaring population given finite resources while simultaneously curbing negative environmental impacts. Thus, the sustainability of different types of agricultural production must be quantified to identify the best way to meet the associated challenges. Taking the Tongxiang region as a case study, emergy and economic analyses were used to evaluate the overall performance of three agricultural production types, including traditional rice monoculture, integrated farming (i.e., rice-fish and rice-duck), and non-grain production (NGP) systems (i.e., nursery plantation, pond fish farming, vegetable production and duck rearing). The environmental pollution caused by different types of agricultural production, which is usually neglected in other studies, was included in the emergy accounting. The results show that intensive NGP systems, especially duck rearing and pond fish farming, were not sustainable, as indicated by high non-point source pollution discharge, high environmental pressure and low ecological sustainability. While rice monoculture and integrated farming systems were both under benign development, they could not provide economic profits competitive with those from NGP systems. With economic benefits increasing by 2.32-2.35 times and the agricultural non-point source pollution decreasing by 10.21%-59.01% in comparison with rice monoculture, integrated agricultural production proved to be a promising pattern for sustainable agriculture. Some policy incentives were proposed to increase the financial attractiveness of integrated agricultural production and promote a virtuous cycle for future cleaner production. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Effect of ploughing and previous crop on winter wheat pests and their
   natural enemies under integrated farming system in Slovakia
SO ANZEIGER FUR SCHADLINGSKUNDE-JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE
AB The effects of ploughing and previous crop on winter wheat pests and their natural enemies under an integrated farming system was investigated in an experimental area in Slovakia. The experiment consisted of 4 small plots (50 m(2) each) to which both organic and inorganic fertilisers were applied. Moreover, there was one application of herbicide and a fungicide on each plot. The ploughing was either deep or ow, and either silage-maize or pea was used as a previous shallow crop. The effects of the ploughing and previous crop was studied by means of multivariate redundancy analysis (RDA) and subsequent Monte-Carlo permutation test. The results showed that there was a considerable temporal variation in the abundance of insect pests and their natural enemies. Of the two husbandry treatments, only ploughing caused significant difference in the composition and abundance of both pests and natural enemies. However, while most of the pests favoured deep ploughing, the majority of natural enemies occurred more abundantly on shallowly ploughed plots. The previous crop did not affect numbers of either pests or natural enemies. Two systems, integrated and organic, which have been surveyed previously, were mutually compared with respect to the abundance of insect pests. The organic farming system turned out to be more sustainable.

TI Farming Systems in High Nature Value (HNV) Farmland: a Case Study of
   Wigry National Park, Poland
SO POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
AB Our research was based on data obtained from a questionnaire administered in 2005 distributed to 80 farms in Wigry National Park in northeastern Poland. The questionnaire concerned agricultural production and the attitudes of farmers for future plans, especially connected with sustainable development, e.g. organic farming. The data were analyzed using a classification based on two-dimensional criteria: farm size (in ha of UAA) and type of production, as well as multivariate statistical methods such as cluster analysis and principal component analysis. From the analyses, six groups of farms were identified according to the characteristics of their farming systems, and the relationships between the examined variables were evaluated. A large percentage of the farms (approximately 32%) were classified as units that served primarily social functions, with an average area of approximately 10 ha. The other groups of farms identified were characterized by medium- or low-intensity agricultural production. Only one group, consisting of approximately 13% of the farms, performed intensive cattle production (LSU above 1 per ha) and used higher levels of fertilization (above 100 kg NPK per ha).

TI Perspectives and challenges in the future use of plant nutrients in
   tilled and mixed agricultural systems
SO AMBIO
AB Producing an adequate quantity of healthy food without polluting the environment is a serious challenge for future agriculture around the world. The Food 21 research program in Sweden has researched all aspects-economic, environmental, and social-of sustainable farming systems. This paper presents some of the research from that and other relevant international research programs that have focused on better nutrient-use efficiency, especially for nitrogen and phosphorus. It shows that a range of sustainable solutions to nutrient-use efficiency exists, some of which are complex but some very simple. Government policies, including subsidies; research and technology; and public acceptance of farming practices all combine to create these solutions. Participatory approaches to knowledge transfer are needed, in which scientists, policy makers, farmers, advisers, and consumers exchange information and together build sustainable farming systems.

SO FOURRAGES
AB Diversity of plant functional group composition within a single grassland and among different grasslands: characterization and analysis in grass-based livestock farming systems
   The method below helps analyze the function of perennial grassland in grass-based livestock farming systems by studying the relationship between environmental factors, farming practices and use value of grassland within the forage system. This method, based on the functional analysis of grassland, evaluates the individual contribution of 5 types of grasses (GFTs). Types A+B ratio appears to be a synthetic indicator of grassland productivity Implementation in 8 livestock farms in the area of Aubrac showed that GFT A+B ratio, whether considered on a local (parcel of land) or global scale (forage system) made it possible to determine plant specialization levels within a single grassland field and among different grassland fields, as well as help identify and analyze the factors responsible for stimulating diversity. Different results were observed: on the one hand, minor differences between the different parcels (intended for different uses) but with a significant diversity within the parcels themselves, and on the other hand significant differences between the parcels but with only a low diversity within the parcels themselves.

AB This paper summarises the key issues raised at a recent international conference entitled, 'Integrated Crop Protection: Towards Sustainability?' The British Crop Protection Council in association with the Sustainable Farming Systems initiative - a joint enterprise between the Scottish Agricultural College and the University of Edinburgh - organised during 1995 an international conference to address state-of-the-art studies in the theory and practice of weed, pest and disease management by integrated approaches. The conference also explored the contribution which sustainable fanning systems research can make to mainstream agriculture. The major recurring themes were: (i) are current crop protection practices sustainable?; (ii) the concept of sustainability; (iii) the biological roots of sustainability; (iv) anticipated developments in crop protection and sustainability; (v) food production and sustainability; (vi) experimentation on sustainable farming systems; and, finally, (vii) are integrated crop protection practices moving towards an increased sustainability? The key issues raised in theme (i) were: crop protection is of critical importance to all food production systems; and the way we protect our crops today has significant implications for future generations; theme (ii): the concept of degrees of sustainability, i.e. sustainability not as an absolute concept but with the potential for systems to be more or less sustainable; theme (iii): the essential nature of developing holistic knowledge of systems, and not simply by discipline only; theme (iv): the development of decision support technology, transgenic plants and semiochemicals as tools in future crop protection strategies; theme (v): the need for continued government funding to meet the twin, and often conflicting, demands of food production and sustainability; and themes (vi) and (vii): more emphasis must be given to systems experimentation and to technology transfer, respectively.

TI Integrated farming systems for prosperity of marginal farmers and
   sustainable agriculture: a roadmap for India
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
AB Agriculture in India and other Asian countries is facing multiple and complex challenges which are expected to become severe with the passage of time. Some major challenges are sustainability of natural resources, impact of climate change and decline in factor productivity. Besides, declining trend in size of land holding poses a serious challenge to the profitability and sustainability of farming. In view of the decline in per capita availability of land, it is imperative to develop strategies and agricultural technologies that enable adequate employment and income generation, especially for smallholders (farmers with < 2.0 ha land) who constitute the vast majority of the farming community in the developing world. No single farm enterprise, such as a typical monocropping system, is likely to be able to sustain the smallholder farmer. Integrated farming systems (IFS) are less risky if managed efficiently, as they benefit from synergisms among enterprises, diversity in produce, and environmental soundness. On this basis, IFS have been suggested for the development of small and marginal farms across Asia, and researchers have developed strategies which have benefitted smallholder farmers by providing additional income and employment and minimizing risk. However, these IFS have not been promulgated and promoted effectively. The present review helps solve this by providing comprehensive information on innovative concepts, approaches and strategies for promotion of IFS for small-holder farmers, which is lacking at present.

AB Freshwater is an essential resource which should be wisely used and shared between the different sectors especially in rapidly developing countries such as Vietnam. In Vietnam, agricultural production and farming systems have been intensified and diversified to follow the growing economy and food demands. However, intensification of agriculture resulted in environmental damage such as eutrophication of surface and ground water, and soil degradation. Sustainable management of soil and water is thus needed to share limited resources between farming systems such as rice, vegetables and animal husbandry. However, the diversified structure of the farming systems makes it difficult to evaluate the impacts from the integrated farming systems. To cope with the diversity and complexity, a mathematical model-based approach would be useful in describing these complex processes and their inter-actions. The present study aims to develop a mathematical model to simulate the dissolved nitrogen dynamics in a paddy field in the Red River Delta, Vietnam. A series of field experiments under different fertilization conditions was carried out in an experimental paddy field of Hanoi University of Agriculture, Vietnam. Ammonium and nitrate nitrogen were monitored in the paddy field water and adjacent canal water, based on which a mathematical model was developed to estimate the concentration of dissolved nitrogen in surface water of the paddy field. As a result, the present model could represent the dynamics of the dissolved nitrogen in relation to farming practices such as fertilizer application. Despite the applicability, further improvement of the model considering nitrogen budget on the soil-water interface would be necessary in order to better represent the nitrogen dynamics and optimize fertilizer applications in both timing and amount.

AB The introduction of winter wheat and its northward production expansion have promoted farming system reform in the Yellow River Ningxia Valley, a previously spring wheat production area. Winter wheat is better adapted to local conditions, and could increase yield 39% more than spring wheat, which had good quality. Early winter wheat cultivars could mature 20 days earlier than spring wheat. Winter wheat would be good for double or multiple cropping. Scientists have challenged traditional farming system and succeeded in the Valley. The new planting system will utilize Ningxia natural resources, such as sunlight, heat, water and land, etc. For double cropping, more than 15 ton per hectare grain yield, or 7.5 ton per hectare winter wheat and 15 thousand Yuan (1.8 thousand USD) per hectare income from multiple-cropped-vegetables have been achieved. These new cropping cycles could increase net income 42% to 80% per unit area compared to the traditional cycle. New winter wheat lines have been bred, which came from reciprocal crosses of winter wheat and local spring wheat.

SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB To evaluate the conservation farming system as an alternative to the traditional shifting cultivation system in the dry zone of Sri Lanka, benefit-cost analysis was used. The major environmental impacts have also been taken into consideration in this analysis. It is found that the 'chena' (shifting) cultivation system is profitable in the short run and becomes un-productive after three years. A conservation farming system is profitable and sustainable in the long run but it is not as profitable as the 'chena' system in the short rum Thus, some interventions as well as new break-throughs in conservation farming technology may be needed to economically motivate farmers to take it up as an alternative to the 'chena' system.

TI VAM FUNGUS SPORE POPULATIONS AND COLONIZATION OF ROOTS OF MAIZE AND
   SOYBEAN UNDER CONVENTIONAL AND LOW-INPUT SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB Spore populations of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi and formation of mycorrhizae in maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) were studied in three farming systems: a conventional maize-soybean rotation and two low-input systems. Spore populations were counted in soil samples obtained at planting and after harvest for two growing seasons. Maize and soybean root systems were sampled for mycorrhizae early in the growing season. Low-input plots tended to have higher populations of spores of VAM fungi than the conventionally farmed plots. Further, the readily identifiable species Gigaspora gigantea (Nicol. & Gerd.) Gerdemann & Trappe, was more numerous in low-input plots (up to 30 spores 50 cm-3 soil) than in conventional plots (0-0.3 spores 50 cm-3 soil), suggesting farming system affected species distribution as well. Colonization of plants in the field did not always reflect VAM fungus spore populations at planting. Greenhouse bioassays showed 2.5-10 fold greater colonization of plants growing in soil from low-input than conventional systems. The results indicate that conventional farming systems yield lower levels of VAM fungi whereas low-input sustainable agriculture, with cover crops planted between cash crops, has greater populations of VAM fungi and potential to utilize the benefits of VA mycorrhizae.

As an example, soils in the Purhepecha region in Mexico have been eroding for decades and crop residue retention has been suggested as an effective method to reduce soil loss; but it is not widely implemented. The effect of crop residue retention on systems' sustainability indicators have been investigated using trade-off analysis. The system used by most farmers (35% crop residue retention with free-grazing) reduced soil loss substantially, led to self-sufficiency in forage and maximized net income.

TI Farming Systems, Integrated Crop Management and Winter Oilseed Rape
   Production
SO BIOCONTROL-BASED INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT OF OILSEED RAPE PESTS
AB Farming systems for arable cropping, should, in the future, combine sustainability with environmental acceptability, be high-yielding yet energy efficient, providing a good net return. Integrated crop management aims to achieve a sustainable farming system by using natural resources and regulating mechanisms to replace polluting inputs. In oilseed rape production, nitrogen inputs to the crop and machinery use are greater than for many other crops and a system that reduces these inputs is desirable. The crop is attacked by more pests than most other arable crops and consequently pesticide inputs are also high; increased use of natural control provided by parasitoids, predators and pathogens would improve sustainability and environmental acceptability. An Integrated Crop Management (ICM) System can be designed to be more sustainable and resource-efficient and to enhance biological control of pests, by reduced tillage with no ploughing, use of a seed mix to provide an internal trap crop to reduce pest damage, plant density to increase parasitisation, and insecticide application using control thresholds. This IPM strategy is exemplified by the EU project MASTER (QLK5-CT-2001-01447).

TI Adding a soil fertility dimension to the global farming systems
   approach, with cases from Africa
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB The global farming systems (GFS) approach is extended by adding a soil fertility and nutrient management dimension for Africa's forest-based, maize mixed, cereal-root crop mixed, and agro-pastoral millet/sorghum farming systems. Use is made of sustainable livelihood concepts, translated into farmer capitals (natural, physical, financial, human, social), and the indicator-based DPSIR (driving force-pressure-state-impact-response) framework for environmental reporting. State and impact indicators show, for each GFS, levels of nutrient stocks and flows, respectively. In case of nutrient depletion, soils may (i) initially still be fertile enough to provide reasonable and stable yields, (ii) support declining yields, or (iii) support low yields at low fertility level. In the latter case, food security is generally at stake. Response indicators include the level of uptake of improved integrated nutrient management strategies at land user level, and the enforcement of new and enabling pro-agriculture and pro-environment policies. Although the extended GFS have no direct relevance for farm-level interventions, the approach can be used to frame soil fertility research priorities and policies at a regional level.

This papers reviews how soybeans are being utilised in three farming systems in Australia that are dominated by sugarcane, perennial pasture and rice. The farming systems, termed tropical coastal sugarcane, subtropical coastal beef and Murrumbidgee irrigated have had complete or extended periods of monoculture. Resultant soil health and disease problems have caused yield decline comparatively to uncultivated soil. Soybeans are an attractive "break" crop that is being used for green manure or grain production. As a grain crop it can provide an alternative income to subsidise the cost of land improvement techniques. With the adoption of no-till techniques establishment costs are reduced, crop frequency increased and land sustainability improved.

We recall the origin and the fundamentals of these integrated approaches in animal production, and their applications at the livestock production unit level, for assessing the relationships between farmer's management decisions-practices and herd performances. We illustrate how the concept evolves with the changes in livestock farming, due to the farmers' new expectations for work that is under control and with the society's demands for environmentally friendly agriculture. The LFS approaches are now engaged in a deep renewal in order to adapt the framework to the Sustainable Development issues: what is at stake is to analyse the adaptive capacities of socio-ecological systems at the territorial level.

TI DRIVERS OF LAND ABANDONMENT IN THE IRISH UPLANDS: A CASE STUDY
SO EUROPEAN COUNTRYSIDE
AB Land abandonment is a complex multi-dimensional process with interlinked economic, environmental and social aspects. This paper presents a case study of an isolated hill sheep farming community in SW Ireland, where a combination of low incomes, ageing population, lack of successors and strong environmental constraints are perceived to be among the main factors leading to their demise. However, the uplands they have grazed for generations are of high nature conservation value, and depend on active management to maintain both their ecology and landscapes. The research, which is based on a combination of interviews and farming systems research, highlights the misfit between what the mountain can produce, light hill lamb, and what the globalised market demands. The paper argues that if 'farming for conservation' is the new function of such farming systems, then we should consider decoupling public goods payments from agricultural subsidies, along with integrating agriculture in disadvantaged areas within a broader rural development framework. The research aims to fill the gap between macro policy and the micro reality of an upland community on a self-declared 'tipping point'.

TI Environmental and socio-economic performance of intensive farming
   systems with varying agricultural resource for maize production
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The challenge of meeting the rising food demand and the need for achieving this through environment friendly and socio-economically acceptable strategies has posed an unprecedented pressure on the current intensive farming sys-tems. Evidence for integrating the environmental burden and socio-economic profit is lacking. This study quantifies the yield performance, environmental burden (in terms of seven mid-point environmental impact categories, espe-cially for the global warming potential (GWP) in terms of greenhouse gas emissions), and economic benefits among different intensive farming systems with varying agricultural resource input in maize (Zea mays) production. The re-sults showed that seed yields increased with increasing resource inputs under intensive farming systems. Meanwhile, environmental burden in terms of GWP and integrated environmental impacts (IEI) based on per unit grain yield produced increased substantially with increasing resource inputs. The conventional planting accomplished the worst environmental performance (represented by the highest IEI), which was mainly attributed to higher agricultural resource input (such as fertilizer and diesel fuel consumption) per unit of grain yield produced, and thereby increased GWP, abiotic depletion-elements (Ade), ozone layer depletion (ODP), photochemical oxidation (PO), acidification po-tential (AP), and eutrophication potential (EP) by 22 %, 30 %, 36 %, 25 %, 32 % and 35 %, respectively. The relatively lower resource input under intensive farming coupled with water-saving technology could be highly recommended to local farmers; while extreme resource input planting patterns were not endorsed because of the yield penalty, low net revenue and high environmental burden. This study highlights the importance of an appropriate use of agricultural re-sources and innovative water-saving technology for mitigating environmental perils and ensuring global food supplies under intensive farming systems.

TI PRIORITY SETTING IN RESEARCH FOR SUSTAINABLE LAND-USE - THE CASE OF THE
   ADJA PLATEAU, BENIN
SO AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB The Projet Recherche Appliquee en Milieu Reel is situated on the Adja Plateau, Southwest Benin. The project is responsible for a FSR&D programme that aims at sustainable use of the so-called Terres de barre. Technologies tested in this context include seasonal fallowing, using Mucuna pruriens cv. group Utilis (weed control, green manure), planted fallows using fast-growing species such as Acacia auriculiformis and hedgerow intercropping systems (various woody auxiliary species). In this paper the local farming system is analyzed to identify key parameters that determine the possibilities for technology adoption. Parameters include: function and history of fields; tenureship; the field's position with regard to fertility flows in the farming system.
   The paper also aims at understanding the reasons behind low crop yields, in this case maize. An analysis of the soil's chemical fertility, using a computer-based fertility assessment model and data from literature, shows some anomalies with respect to the availability of nutrients from organic matter. Data presented on the use of green manures and oil palm fallow compared to cultivated fields make it likely that organic matter management is a crucial factor. in sustainable use of these soils (maintenance of soil structure and soil life). Given key parameters, a matrix is used to determine potential niches in the farming system for the various biomass production technologies mentioned previously, including the locally developed planted fallow based on oil palm.

TI AN INTEGRATED FARMING SYSTEM APPROACH TO UPLIFT THE RURAL POOR
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND STATISTICAL SCIENCES
AB The present study was conducted in Kalghtagi taluk of Dharwad district by selecting one fanner for Integrated Farming System (IFS) demonstrations. The IFS approach is considered to be not only a reliable way to obtaining fairly high productivity with considerable scope of recycling unused farm resources, the concept of ecological soundness leading to sustainable agriculture, protection of environment and efficient natural resource management, particularly in tropical climate. IFS represents an appropriate combination of farm enterprises like Field crops, Horticulture, Livestock, Fishery, Forestry, Dairy, Poultry etc., and the means available to the farmer to raise them for profitability. The success of IFS depends on selection of various components which are interrelated, interdependent and interlinking in nature. Its main aim is utilization of primary and secondary produce of one system as basic input for the other system. Thus making them mutually integrated as one whole unit. Thus in the present IFS approach the following technologies were introduced to uplift their standard of living. Introduction of African tall fodder maize, forestry component Tamarind (DTS-1), Fish culture, Vermicomposting by bricks and pit method and its use in Horticulture. and field crops, Azolla units and feeding schedule for dairy, fishery and poultry birds. By-following all these interventions the bench mark net returns was raised from Rs. 87,200 to 2,28,610. For this purpose the land use intensity under three crop season of respective years also increased from 2600 acres to 3300 acres. Finally, the benefit cost ration was stabilized at 2.51.

TI Risk and economic sustainability of crop farming systems
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB In economic terms, resilience in farming has to do with the capacity of a farm business to survive various risks and other shocks. Despite its importance, resilience has seldom been directly considered in evaluations of economic sustainability. A whole-farm stochastic simulation model over a 6-year planning horizon was used to analyse organic and conventional cropping systems using a model of a representative farm in Eastern Norway. The relative economic sustainability of alternative systems under changing assumptions about future technology and price regimes was examined in terms of financial survival to the end of the planning period. The same alternatives were also compared in terms of stochastic efficiency. To model the risk of business failure adequately there is a need to deal with the risk of bankruptcy, and a modification of traditional analysis was used for that purpose. The organic farming system was found to be somewhat less economically sustainable than the conventional system, especially if the organic price premiums and the organic area payments were to be phased out. The results illustrate possible conflicts between pursuit of risk efficiency and economic sustainability. The model developed could be used to support farmers' choices between farming systems as well as to help policy makers develop more sharply targeted policies. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Development of a broadened cognitive mapping approach for analysing
   systems of practices in social-ecological systems
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB This paper presents a new cognitive mapping approach for analysing systems of practices in social-ecological systems. These systems are mapped from people's views collected during open-ended interviews. Cognitive maps are made up of diverse variables (e.g., operations, drivers, constraints) linked to each other by a range of relationships: cause-effect, fluxes of matter, information flows and sequence of two operations. Individual cognitive maps heuristically model the practices and decision-making processes expressed by interviewees. The mathematical formulation of cognitive maps allows individual cognitive maps to be aggregated into a social cognitive map. The latter can be used to model the system of practices used by a particular group of people. Using this approach, we analysed the practices and decision-making processes linked to grassland management in a Belgian grassland-based livestock farming system. Our work confirmed that a social cognitive map could be drawn up for multiple locations. The results showed how this inductive cognitive mapping approach overcame two limitations frequently highlighted in previous studies: the diverse interpretations of variables and relationships; and the difficulty in revealing the rationale in cognitive maps.

AB Integrated farming system is an agricultural practice that must be done for sustainable agriculture. The objectives of the research were to compare the population and diversity of soil meso fauna in the oil palm plantations applying with integrated farming system of cattle and oil palm plantation (IFSCO) and without IFSCO (non-IFSCO) in Ultisols soil. The research was conducted in two oil palm plantations, i.e. oil palm plantation with IFSCO (5 ha) and without IFSCO (non-IFSCO) (5 ha) applications which were located in the Karya Makmur Village, Tulang Bawang District, Lampung, Indonesia. The research was arranged using surveys and with systematic methods for sampling soil, earthworm, and mesofauna. Population of earthworm and soil mesofauna were enumerated by hand sorting methods and trapped with Barlese-Tullgreen funnel, respectively. The results showed that the application of IFSCO had a higher population and biomass of earthworm as well as abundance and diversity of soil mesofauna than that non-IFSCO. There are two types of dominant earthworms and 12 species of mesofauna in IFSCO soil, and 9 species in that of non-IFSCO. Several physical and chemical properties of soils are positively correlated with the presence of these soil fauna.

AB The agricultural system in the watershed is mostly based on monoculture system. Where it has not been connected between farms that produce biomass, biomass processing industries, waste management, water utilization, energy generation, and soil conservation. This condition raises problems, for instance: (1) low productivity and quality of product, (2) un-used waste, and (3) dependence on external inputs. The coffee-livestock integration system is an approach that builds explicitly between biomass-producing agriculture, biomass processing industries, waste management, water use, energy generation, and soil nutrient conservation so that an integrated farming system (IFS) is sustainable. Even combines the crop farming system with livestock synergistically, that form an effective, efficient, and environmentally system, the level of its adoption is still low. The purpose of this study is to analyse the factors influenced adoption of the coffee-cattle integration system (CCIS) and formulate recommendations for its acceleration by using SWOT analysis. Result showed that the determinants of CCIS adoption are: farmer preference, financial resources, agro ecosystem, market incentives, as well risk and uncertainty. Acceleration of adoption at the farm level can be done through (1) assistance in implementation; and (2) provision of agricultural facilities and infrastructure as well as agricultural machinery equipment.

TI Culturable endophytic fungal communities associated with plants in
   organic and conventional farming systems and their effects on plant
   growth
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB As compared to organic farming system, conventional farming system relies on higher inputs of synthetic agrochemicals, which may reduce the abundance, diversity, and beneficial effects of plant endophytic fungal communities. This study compares the diversity and abundance of culturable endophytic fungal communities associated with four plant species - corn, tomato, pepper, and watermelon grown in separate organic and conventional fields. In all, 740 fungal isolates were identified, of which 550 were from the organic fields and 190 from the conventional ones. These fungal isolates were grouped into eight orders and 22 species, with the two most abundant species being Trichoderma sp. and Pichia guilliermondi. The fungal species diversity and abundance were both significantly higher in the organic than in the conventional fields. All the isolated endophytic fungi improved tomato plants' shoot growth and biomass significantly, as compared with the water control. Six fungal isolates also exhibited activity that enhanced tomato fruit yields. These results suggest that these endophytic fungi might be a considerable boost to sustainable agricultural production, while also reducing the agricultural application of chemicals and thus benefiting the environment and human health.

TI The potential for soil carbon sequestration in three tropical dryland
   farming systems of Africa and Latin America: A modelling approach
SO SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
AB Historically, agriculturally induced CO2 release from soils has contributed to rising levels in the atmosphere. However, by using appropriate management, soils can be turned into carbon sinks. Many of the dryland regions of the world are characterised by degraded soils, a high incidence of poverty and a low capacity to invest in agriculture. Two well-proven soil organic matter models (CENTURY 4.0 and RothC-26 3) were used two explore the effects of modifying agricultural practices to increase soil carbon stocks. The changes to land management were chosen to avoid any significant increase in energy input whilst using technologies that would be available without radically altering the current agricultural methodology. Case studies were selected from dryland farming systems in Nigeria, Sudan and Argentina. Modelling showed that it would be possible to make alterations within the structure of the current farming systems to convert these soils from carbon sources to net sinks. Annual rates of carbon sequestration in the range 0.08-0.17 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) averaged over the next 50 years could be obtained. The most effective practices were those that maximised the input of organic matter, particularly farmyard manure (up to 0.09 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)), maintaining trees (up to 0.15 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)) and adopting zero tillage (up to 0.04 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)). Verification of these predictions will require experimental data collected from field studies. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Strategies and agronomic interventions to improve the phosphorus-use
   efficiency of farming systems
SO PLANT AND SOIL
AB Phosphorus (P)-deficiency is a significant challenge for agricultural productivity on many highly P-sorbing weathered and tropical soils throughout the world. On these soils it can be necessary to apply up to five-fold more P as fertiliser than is exported in products. Given the finite nature of global P resources, it is important that such inefficiencies be addressed. For low P-sorbing soils, P-efficient farming systems will also assist attempts to reduce pollution associated with P losses to the environment. P-balance inefficiency of farms is associated with loss of P in erosion, runoff or leaching, uneven dispersal of animal excreta, and accumulation of P as sparingly-available phosphate and organic P in the soil. In many cases it is possible to minimise P losses in runoff or erosion. Uneven dispersal of P in excreta typically amounts to similar to 5% of P-fertiliser inputs. However, the rate of P accumulation in moderate to highly P-sorbing soils is a major contributor to inefficient P-fertiliser use. We discuss the causal edaphic, plant and microbial factors in the context of soil P management, P cycling and productivity goals of farms. Management interventions that can alter P-use efficiency are explored, including better targeted P-fertiliser use, organic amendments, removing other constraints to yield, zone management, use of plants with low critical-P requirements, and modified farming systems. Higher productivity in low-P soils, or lower P inputs in fertilised agricultural systems can be achieved by various interventions, but it is also critically important to understand the agroecology of plant P nutrition within farming systems for improvements in P-use efficiency to be realised.

AB Agriculture is the economic sector that benefited most from Romania's entry into the European Union, especially through the National Rural Development Program - PNDR 2014-2020 program, which was based on providing non-reimbursable funds to Romanian farmers in order to modernize and expand agricultural holdings. In total, since Romania's accession to the EU, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, has developed European and national funds for agriculture of over 26 billion euros, the average annual absorption rate being 96%. The paper presents the dynamics of cultivated areas, in a crop formed by wheat, barley, corn and sunflower crops, in the period 2015-2020, cultivated in an organic system compared to the conventional one. Because crop rotations play a key role in ensuring the sustainability of modern farming systems, they remain crucial in the practice of organic farming systems, as they combat diseases, pests, weeds, water shortages and soil nutrients.

TI Livelihood security of small holder farmers in eastern Himalayas, India:
   Pond based integrated farming system a sustainable approach
SO CURRENT RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB Farming in eastern Himalayan region of India is a high risk activity due to climatic uncertainty, lack of resources with small and marginal farmers and non-adoption of improved technologies. Pond based integrated farming system (IFS) is a whole farm approach aims at increasing production, employment and income through inte-gration of various farming enterprises (rice, vegetables, fruits, fish, pigs, poultry, goat and others) as per climate, social acceptability and market demand. Eleven farm pond based IFS models were evaluated in 150 farmers' field covering 22.5 ha area in South Garo Hills district of Meghalaya, India during 2009-14 in a participatory approach. The individual farming system unit considered in present study was 0.15 ha. The study revealed that productivity and income of farmers under pond based IFS improved substantially over farmers' practice. The maximum rice equivalent yield (REY) was obtained under model 6 (pond + rice + vegetables + pig integration, 4.04 Mg) followed by model 8 (pond + vegetable + pig + fruit integration, 4.02 Mg) and the lowest was recorded under farmers' practice (rice + vegetables, 0.53 Mg). IFS model 6 (74.3 kg unit- 1 year -1) followed by 8 (60.2 kg unit -1 year -1) had noticeably higher protein equivalent yields over rest of the models. The IFS model 6 emerged as the best model because of high net return (INR. 23,900 unit -1 year -1, 1$ = INR 67), employment generation (81 man-days unit -1 year -1) as well as higher productivity in terms of REY (4.04 Mg unit -1 year -1) whereas, farmers' practice registered low net return (INR. 4120 unit -1 year -1), employment (42 man-days unit -1 year -1) and productivity (0.61 Mg unit -1 year -1). The Sustainable Value Index and System Economic Efficiency of IFS models 6 and 8 were much higher than other models. The overall results revealed that pond based IFS has the potential to provide year round food, nutrition, employment opportunities and substantially increase income of resource poor rural house-holds of the study region in Eastern Himalayas, India.

With this legislation, the Ministry of Agriculture is going to finance sustainable farming systems. There are no specific financing plans currently in place. or indication of types of farms, arable farming and/or livestock farming that will be covered by this legislation. There are few livestock farm types in Korea that could be classified as sustainable farming systems. At present there are three different types of sustainable arable farming enterprises, including rice, vegetables, and orchard to be financed in sustainable farming systems, and three types of sustainable farming including, organic, no pesticide and low application of pesticide. Organic farming is utilised on 12.2 percent of rice farms, 8.7 percent in vegetable farms and 5.97 percent in orchard farms of the total sustainable farms. At present, there is no production cost survey of organic farm production. There is only production cost analysis for conventional production systems. Farm efficiency was analysed in constant and variable return to scale by application of Data Envelopment Analysis Programme: Apple production has a highest mean value of scale efficiency among rice, cabbage and spinach production during 1980-98.

SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB Expanding urban-industrialization in southern Ontario is out-competing agriculture for use of some of Canada's best farmland. On the remaining farmland, there has been a trend to consolidate into fewer and larger enterprises, to specialize production lines, to mechanize and automate, to increase usage of imported synthetic inputs, all at the expense of environmental protection, and natural resource stewardship. Sustainability of the agri-food system, including the dimension of rural farm community viability, should be questioned as a consequence. Widespread adoption of organic farming systems would do much to mitigate the stewardship and sustainability problems, but too many impediments exist to prevent this. Adoption of reduced-input farming techniques would offer a partial or second-best solution to sustainability problems. It is argued that additional measures in the form of public intervention should be employed. Public policies aimed at inducing farmers to expend more conservation effort on behalf of the environment and sustainable agri-food systems could encompass farmer education and extension assistance, financial assistance, cross-compliance measures, and compulsion backed by litigation and penalties. Such policies would best be targeted, especially when scarce public funds are earmarked for subsidizing farmers' conservation efforts, rather than universally applied. Targeting criteria should be not only high potential for achieving environmental protection and agri-food sustainability, but also positive net social welfare outcomes. To ensure efficient use of scarce public funds, those farm sites conferring highest positive net social welfare should be ranked first for targeting.

AB As a powerful tool, biodiversity can be applied for assessing sustainability levels in agroecosystems as well as assessing both positive and negative effects of different agricultural activities and management strategies on the environment. It is the variety of life, including variation among genes, species and functional traits, which can increase the productivity of farming systems in a range of growing conditions, and also can maintain and increase soil fertility and mitigate the impact of pests and diseases. More diverse farming systems are generally more resilient in the face of perturbations, thus enhancing food security. For agriculture, biodiversity can be also expressed as planned (agricultural) and associated (para-agricultural and extra-agricultural) biodiversity, which reflect different functions of plants, animals and micro-organisms in agroecosystems. This paper introduces the categories of biodiversity in agroecosystems, assesses the functional biodiversity in sustainable agroecosystems, and prospects the significant of biodiversity in sustainable agroecosystems.

TI Sustainability assessment of small dairy farms from the main cattle
   farming systems in the North of Tunisia
SO NEW MEDIT
AB Demand for animal products is expected to increase due to human population growth, resulting in a need for increased production. At the same time, climate change poses a major threat to the viability and sustainability of livestock production systems. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the sustainability of dairy cattle farms belonging to three farming systems (rainfed, irrigated, and mixed) at the northeast zone of Tunisia using the IDEA method (version 3). Collected data of 102 farms were subjected to an analysis of variance using the GLM procedure of SAS software (version 9.4). Results showed that the socio-territorial scale was the limiting factor for all systems and that the irrigated system had the lowest scores of agro-ecological and socio-territorial scales, compared to the other ones, but it recorded the highest score for the economic scale. The best agro-ecological and socio-territorial scores characterized the mixed system. However, it had the lowest score on the economic scale. Finally, the rain-fed system was exhibited medium performances of the three scales. It was concluded a difference between the three farm systems, but there was no disassociation between the three sustainability dimensions; thus, improvements should proceed across all scales simultaneously.

TI Distinct Root Microbial Communities in Nature Farming Rice Harbor
   Bacterial Strains With Plant Growth-Promoting Traits
SO FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB A nature farming system is an ecological farming practice that entails cultivating crops without using chemical fertilizers and pesticides. To understand the diversity and functions of root microbiomes associated with nature farming systems, we compared the root microbial community of rice under nature farming conditions with those under conventional farming conditions. High-throughput amplicon analysis demonstrated a higher abundance and greater diversity of the root microbiome under unfertilized nature farming conditions than under conventional conditions. The application of chemical fertilizers reduced the microbial diversity and abundance of some beneficial taxa important for plant growth and health. Subsequently, we isolated and identified 46 endo- and epiphytic bacteria from rice roots grown under nature farming conditions and examined their plant growth-promoting activity. Six potential isolates were selected for plant growth assessment in insoluble P- and K-containing media. Most of the isolates promoted rice growth, and Pseudomonas koreensis AEPR1 was able to enhance rice growth significantly in both insoluble P- and K-containing media. Our data indicated that nature farming systems create a distinct root microbiome that is comparatively more diverse and supports plant growth under low-input cultivation practices than under conventional practices. The potential isolates could be exploited as sources with potential applications in sustainable agriculture.

TI Agro-Livestock Farming System Sustainability during the COVID-19 Era: A
   Cross-Sectional Study on the Role of Information and Communication
   Technologies
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In the near future, the year 2050, agricultural production should expand to fulfill the needs of approximately 9.7 billion inhabitants. Such an objective should be harmonized with social, economic, and environmental sustainability aspects to maintain safe food production and food security worldwide. For more than a year, the COVID-19 pandemic has raised and is still strongly disrupting the agro-livestock production sector, similar to several other economic sectors. In this sector, the relationships between suppliers, producers, and consumers should always continue to maintain the activity of the production chain, which are impaired by social distancing decisions taken following the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, a global cross-sectional survey (translated into four languages: Arabic, English, French, and Spanish) was shared with people belonging to the agricultural sector to identify: (1) the role of the agricultural information and communication technologies (ICTs) in agro-livestock farming systems sustainability during the period of COVID-19 pandemic, (2) the need for such technologies in the agricultural sector, and (3) the factors that affect the use of such technologies. The results showed that the most frequently used agricultural ICTs were social media (Facebook and/or WhatsApp; 27.3%) and online platforms and Internet services (26.3%), whereas robotic vehicles and/or drones (6.6%) were less frequently used. During the emergence of the pandemic, the major reasons impacting agro-livestock farming systems' sustainability were social distancing (30.0%), shortage of labor (17.7%), maintaining precision farm management (14.8%), product marketing (14.2%), access production inputs (7.2%), and others (16.1%). Applying agricultural ICTs solved many obstacles related to the production process, such as maintaining precision farm management (25.6%), product marketing (23.6%), and access production inputs (16.1%). The subgroup analyses of the results considering the degree of country advancement, size of agribusinesses, and role/position of respondents in the farm highlighted the importance of supporting the use, availability, and awareness of agricultural ICTs at least for some groups of people such as those belong to developing countries, laborers, and small-scale agri-business holders. This cross-sectional study highlights the urgent need to turn to and to expand the use of new agricultural ICTs to meet the growing demand for food production in the world and to ensure the resilience and sustainability of farming systems, specifically under unexpected and extreme conditions.

TI AGRICULTURAL-RESEARCH IN DEVELOPED-COUNTRIES - PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE
   OF FARMING SYSTEMS RESEARCH AND EXTENSION
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE
AB In the developed countries, the conventional experiment station-based agricultural research system generally has served farmers well. In developing countries, however, the same model has had less success in addressing needs of many farmers, particularly those operating diversified farming systems in resource-poor and risk-prone environments. Hence, in the 1970s, the farming systems research and extension (FSRE) approach-which has a high degree of complementarity with experiment station-based research-evolved to address their needs. Prior to this was the development of some analogous farm-based approaches in the USA (e.g., balanced farming). In the USA, increasing concerns about limited research resources and ecological sustainability have sparked interest in harnessing the power of the farm-based and systems-oriented FSRE approach in a way that is complementary to other approaches and in a manner that produces results acceptable to all stakeholders (e.g., farmers, station-based researchers, extension/development staff, and planners of policy/support systems).

TI LIMITATIONS AND IMPACTS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION ON THE SAVANNA BELT -
   THE NIGERIAN CASE
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB It is not enough simply to identify the limiting factors to agricultural production, supply the appropriate inputs and then expect to be able to meet food demands, It is essential also to prefect the environment in which food is grown, especially in areas of fragile ecosystems and harsh climatic conditions, in order to ensure both increased production and stability of the production base. In the Nigerian savanna belt, traditional and mechanized large-scale farming systems are both practised, and they combine with unfavourable climatic conditions to exert a strong negative impact on the environment. Here, these interactions are examined and the case is made for incorporating fundamental ecological principles and concepts of sustainability into farming systems, in Nigeria and elsewhere.

TI What are the links between tree-based farming and dietary quality for
   rural households? A review of emerging evidence in low- and
   middle-income countries
SO PEOPLE AND NATURE
AB In most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), conventional agricultural policy promotes specialized production systems of carbohydrate-rich crops to address hunger and food insecurity. For rural populations, however, increased landscape uniformity can reduce both agrobiodiversity and wild biodiversity, which can contribute to diet uniformity. Although maintaining diversity in and around agricultural systems is far from a new approach, there is growing empirical attention on the contribution of trees on/around farms to dietary quality. While recent research suggests that forests can contribute to improved diets, there is only emerging evidence on how incorporating trees into farming systems not only benefits nature but also positively affects the diets of rural households. This review synthesizes the existing empirical research on the linkages between different types of tree-based farming systems and indicators of dietary quality in LMICs. The objective is to build a foundation for future research that supports sustainable production systems with dual benefits for people and the natural environment. The small, yet heterogeneous literature pool (n = 36 studies) reflects the high variance in how trees on/around farms are examined across cultural and geographical contexts. Our analysis identifies three major outcomes: (a) managing tree-based farming systems for both direct provision of wild and cultivated foods, as well as income used to purchase foods, may give households more strategies for dietary diversification and improve dietary quality; (b) the relationship between different tree-based farming systems and dietary quality is moderated by socio-economic and biophysical factors at the national, landscape and household levels; and (c) indigenous populations engaged in traditional forms of subsistence-oriented tree-based farming seem to maintain high levels of dietary diversity, indicating the importance of local knowledge and biodiversity stewardship to maintain these food sources in the face of commercial agricultural expansion. Our synthesis of existing evidence highlights a need for a more nuanced understanding of how different types of tree-based farming systems contribute to dietary quality. Combining research methods from the domains of agriculture, forestry and nutrition can lead to more precise measurement of tree-based farming/diet linkages, and in doing so, support programs promoting increased landscape and dietary diversity in LMICs.

   FROM THE WEST-AFRICAN GUINEA SAVANNA WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO RISK
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB The question of which cropping system is superior in the context of the farming systems of the West African Guinea savannah has not been answered yet. A methodological framework for the assessment of cropping systems is provided. Relevant indicators required in order to evaluate the performance of the systems, namely their productivity, stability and sustainability, are determined These parameters are computed from experimental data which are based on a five-year crop sequence trial Subsequently, the experimental data are used to conduct an ex-ante analysis from a farming systems perspective of 18 farm households. Results indicate that a portfolio of the three cropping systems seems to be optimal. However, the actual combination of cropping systems varies according to the relative resource endowment and risk preferences of the farm households.

TI Impact of best management practices on sustainable crop production and
   climate resilience in smallholder farming systems of South Asia
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB CONTEXT: A host of best water and soil management practices (BMPs) hold promise in addressing water scarcity and land degradation to enable sustainable crop intensification in smallholder farming systems.
   OBJECTIVE This study quantifies the effect of BMPs on crop productivity, income, water saving and water balance components and identifies gaps for future research.
   METHODS: This paper synthesizes the performance of BMPs and the existing data gap by reviewing 108 published studies from the Indian subcontinent which capture a diverse range of rainfall and cropping systems.
   RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: In situ conservation measures helped enhance crop yields by 200-1000 kg/ha, reduced cost of cultivation and enhanced incomes by US$ 10-200/ha/year. The BMPs were helpful in enabling annual water saving in the range of 50 mm to 300 mm by either conserving residual soil moisture or saving irrigation water resulting in enhanced water productivity. Interventions such as direct seeded rice and laser land leveling were found most effective in terms of water saving and in reducing cost of cultivation. On the other hand, ex situ rainwater harvesting interventions helped enhance groundwater recharge by harvesting an additional 50-150 mm of surface runoff which helped increase crop yields, led to sustainable crop intensification and strengthened the number of ecosystem services. Most of the published literature on in situ conservation measures are studies that were carried out at research stations, which show promise of sustainable intensification. However, greater efforts are needed to document learnings from farmer/community scale interventions for effective scaling up. There is also a gap in data availability that hampers a clear understanding of the impact of ex situ rainwater harvesting interventions and ecosystem trade-offs; moreover the data available covers short pe- riods and only covers an area of up to 10 km(2). We recommend the monitoring of long-term system-level impact indicators to realize the potential of ex situ rainwater harvesting interventions in a systems perspective and better grasp the ecosystem trade-offs.
   SIGNIFICANCE: More importantly, the review revealed the ample scope of integrating in situ and ex situ in- terventions to build system-level resilience in smallholder farming systems in order to accelerate progress to- wards achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

TI Role of livelihood capital in shaping the farming strategies and
   outcomes of smallholder rubber producers in southern Thailand
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB This paper assesses the role of livelihood capital in shaping farming strategies and determining farming outcomes for smallholder rubber producers in southern Thailand. The authors find a positive relationship between the access level of livelihood capital and levels of diversification. The diversification and integration of rubber-based farming systems result in higher production and farm income. Specialization in rubber monoculture derives from an overall low endowment of livelihood capital, which generates poor farming outcomes. The paper assesses the relative efficiency of farms' ability to maximize income and production using data envelopment analysis. Diversified, integrated rubber farming systems confirm higher techno-economic efficiency scores, thus supporting the need for further policy and support measures. Diversification and crop integration should be supported as a pathway for sustaining farmers' livelihood.

TI Cereal/grain legume intercropping in rotation with durum wheat in
   crop/livestock production systems for Mediterranean farming system
SO FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
AB Increasing home-grown production of legumes can contribute to the sustainable development of the agriculture in Europe. The adoption of mixed crop/livestock systems could be a tool to increase the cultivation of legume crops in cereal farming systems, particularly in the smallholder farming systems of Southern Europe. This study proposes cereal-legume intercropping as a sustainable intensification tool specifically suitable for crop/livestock mixed systems under rainfed condition. The cereal/grain legume intercropping is used in this study as an alternative to the sole crops in rotation with durum wheat with the assumption that this agronomic technique can still provide the benefits of legume crops in rotation sustaining the subsequent cereal crop production and overcoming the well-known limitations affecting grain legumes sown as sole crop.
   Pea (Piston sativum L.) and faba bean (Vicia faba L.) were respectively intercropped with barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) for grain production and grown in rotation with durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. subsp. durum) in an area in Southern Italy with typical Mediterranean climate. The present study has demonstrated that cereal legume intercropping can be a source of fodder (both pea and faba bean combinations) and still support yields of the following wheat cash crop. Pea-barley combinations (either additive or replacement design) enabled a better yield performance of the succeeding durum wheat as compared to faba bean-based intercropping. Pea-barley intercrops also reached a greater complementarity in the use of N sources and increased the overall sustainability of the rotation.

TI Evolution of smallholder mixed farming systems in the Harar Highlands of
   Ethiopia: The shift towards trees and shrubs
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB The paper reports on the major changes observed in the farming systems of the Harar Highlands of southeastern Ethiopia, with special emphasis on the shift towards trees and shrubs. The study was undertaken during two time periods, 1985-1987 and 1997-1998 with the objectives of characterizing the production systems and their trends, and utilizing information so gained to guide research and extension activities in the study area. It was observed that the farming population had increased, land and large stock holding had decreased slightly, and that crop production was under increasing threats from various scourges, notably pests, weeds, and diseases. In the face of these changes, farmers continued to search for alternative strategies, and the major trend noted was the shift towards naturally growing and cultivated tree and shrub species in general and khat (Chata edulis (Vahl) Forsk. ex Endl.) in particular. This shift increased farm income and promoted crop-livestock integration, thereby improving household food security and enhancing sustainability of smallholder mixed farm systems. The importance of khat to the regional economy was also found to be growing both in the livelihood systems of the people in the study area, and in terms of foreign currency earnings. Despite the critics against the ever-increasing culture of khat, it is argued that the shift towards a khat-based farm economy was unavoidable, and, in the absence of other feasible alternatives, khat production and marketing would remain important to the livelihood systems of people in the study area. In view of this, the roles of the tree component in the farming systems should be duly considered in planning research and extension undertakings in the smallholder farms of the Harar Highlands or Ethiopia.

TI Crop commercialization and adoption of gum-arabic agroforestry and their
   effect on farming system in western Sudan
SO AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB Increasing trend in the sole crops commercialization has questioned the sustainability of the traditional gum Arabic agroforestry (Bush-fallow) system in western Sudan. This shift in the farming system from a traditional sustainable system to more commercialized one has resulted in a drastic decline in soil fertility, decreased crop productivity and low gum Arabic production. Therefore, identification of alternative options and incentives are required to ameliorate the negative environmental effects of increasing commercialization trends. This paper takes this issue and empirically investigating the factors influencing the decision to adopt agroforestry using a binary probit model. The results show that farmers with less commercialization, access to credit, less fragmented land, more education, high gum Arabic gate price, located away from the markets, and with more years of experience in farming are more likely to practice the traditional gum Arabic agroforestry system. In contrast, the allocation of more working days for commercial sole crops production, more fragmented land, and higher commercialization index reduces the probability of gum Arabic agroforestry adoption. In conclusion, this dichotomy between sole crop commercialization and traditional gum agroforestry system may be solved through the encouragement of the adoption of the traditional intercropping system with gum tree (Acacia senegal). Production of gum tree (Acacia senegal) itself should be more commercialized and prioritized. Conservation programs should focus on more educated, experienced famers with less fragmentized land if the policy is to promote the sustainable farming system in the region to promote soil fertility and to improve the effect of sole crop commercialization on traditional gum Arabic agroforestry system.

TI Bottom-Up Transformation of Agriculture and Food Systems
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The global agenda for sustainable development includes the alleviation of poverty and hunger by developing sustainable agriculture and food systems. Intensive farming systems and its variations, such as sustainable intensification or ecological intensification, are currently being promoted as technologies that can improve agricultural productivity and reduce environmental impacts. However, these are focused only on per-hectare productivity with growing negative impacts on local culture and the environment. This study identifies the negative impacts of crop- and livestock-based farming systems on the Indo-Gangetic plains, as well as in the USA, China, and South America as an example of key challenges in global agriculture. These impacts are classified into environmental, social, economic, and health impacts. An alternative paradigm is proposed to overcome some of the shortcomings of current global agriculture. This new bottom-up paradigm is based on three indicators that are fundamental to achieve the environmental, economic, and social sustainability of agriculture and food systems. These are divided into technical, geographic, and social indicators and have been analysed for four farming systems-low-input, high-input, organic, and desired farming systems. Seven global geographic regions have been analysed in terms of their socio-economic indicators and status of agriculture in order to develop pathways for the implementation of the new paradigm. The pathway for change suggested in this paper includes a focus on research and training, policy and institutional changes, and an evaluation of the costs and benefits, and changes in production models that consider scale and sustainability metrics and include innovations in consultation with all stakeholders. This new paradigm has the potential to direct global efforts towards more local and regional solutions, which are community driven and constitute a 'bottom-up' approach.

TI Location-specific integrated farming system models for resource
   recycling and livelihood security for smallholders
SO FRONTIERS IN AGRONOMY
AB The present investigation was carried out in a holistic mode to study the interactions among the integrated farming system (IFS) components and to develop and design a sustainable IFS model which is technologically sound, economically viable, environmentally benign, and socially acceptable for the middle Indo-Gangetic Plains. For efficient utilization of farm resources and to enhance the income per unit area of land, 10 IFS models have been developed at the farmers' fields of Patna, Nalanda, and Vaishali districts of Bihar, India, during 2016-2021, involving components like crops, poultry, cattle, goat, mushroom farming, fishery, and duckery in different combinations. Out of 10 different integrations, three primary cropping systems prevailing in the state were undertaken and seven other components were integrated in a synergistic mode. Each system was allocated an area of 0.8 ha (2,000 m(2)), viz., (i) rice-wheat, (ii) rice-maize, (iii) rice-maize-moong (crop), (iv) crop + vegetable + goat, (v) crop + fish + goat, (vi) crop + fish + cattle, (vii) crop + fish + duck + goat, (viii) crop + fish + duck, (ix) crop + fish + mushroom, and (x) crop + fish + poultry. To sustain the productivity of soil health, inorganic fertilizers combined with organic wastes, obtained from various components of IFS, viz., recycled pond silts, poultry manure, duck manure, goat manure and cow dung as farmyard manures (FYMs), composted residues, and vermicompost were applied to crops grown under different IFS models. The nutrient content of manure increased manifolds after recycling as compost and vermicompost. Residue recycling revealed that integration of crops with fish and duck resulted in higher fish productivity and higher net returns (increased by USD13) in comparison to poultry dropping fed fishes. Due to the recycling of droppings, viz., poultry, duck, goat, cattle, and plant wastes, an additional quantity of 56.5 kg N, 39.6 kg P2O5, and 42.7 kg K2O was added to the soil during the study. Crop integrated with fish + duck + goat had the maximum rice grain equivalent yield (RGEY), net returns, and employment opportunity (467 man-days/year) from 0.8 ha of land, followed by crop + fish + poultry integration. The sustainability index (0.77) and net energy gain (95,770 MJ) were also found highest with crop + fish + duck+ goat integration indicating the optimum efficiency of all the farming system integrations for the region.

TI Current and Future Challenges and Opportunities for Livestock Farming in
   West Africa: Perspectives from the Case of Senegal
SO AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB Livestock farming is a livelihood activity and is critically important for the food and nutritional security of the majority of the population in West African countries, including Senegal. Nevertheless, livestock farming operates far below the optimum production potential, mainly due to demographical, biophysical, economic, environmental, and sociopolitical challenges. To address these issues, we conducted this review with an overall objective of characterizing different livestock farming systems and to identify challenges and opportunities to improve livestock production in West Africa through the broader perspectives from the case of Senegal. Pastoral, agropastoral, and off-land systems are the three major livestock production systems in this region, which are unique in terms of agroclimatology and degree of intensification and integration. The major challenges identified in livestock farming systems are lack of pasture and quality feed, scarcity of water resources, climate change, undeveloped breeding and management of livestock, poor marketing and trade, and socioeconomic constraints. Moreover, we contribute to the literature on crop-livestock farming in Senegal and West Africa by proposing plausible interventions to improve the productivity of the farming system to improve food and nutritional security. Concentrated efforts must be taken in co-designing effective management interventions for sustainable intensification of livestock sector in the region, considering site-specific approaches.

TI Genetic and Morphological Diversity of Indigenous Bradyrhizobium
   Nodulating Soybean in Organic and Conventional Family Farming Systems
SO FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB Organic farming systems are gaining popularity as agronomically and environmentally sound soil management strategies with potential to enhance soil microbial diversity and fertility, environmental quality and sustainable crop production. This work aimed at understanding the effect of organic and conventional farming on the diversity of soybean nodulating bradyrhizobia species. Field trapping of indigenous soybean Bradyrhizobium was done by planting promiscuous soybeans varieties SB16 and SC squire as well as non-promiscuous Gazelle in three organic and three conventional farms in Tharaka-Nithi County of Kenya. After 45 days of growth, 108 nodule isolates were obtained from the soybean nodules and placed into 13 groups based on their morphological characteristics. Genetic diversity was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting 16S rDNA gene using universal primers P5-R and P3-F and sequencing was carried out using the same primer. High morphological and genetic diversity of the nodule isolates was observed in organic farms as opposed to conventional farms. There was little or no genetic differentiation between the nodule isolates from the different farms with the highest molecular variation (91.12%) being partitioned within populations as opposed to among populations (8.88%). All the isolates were identified as bradyrhizobia with close evolutionary ties with Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Bradyrhizobium yuanminense. Organic farming systems favor the proliferation of bradyrhizobia species and therefore a suitable environmentally friendly alternative for enhancing soybean production.

TI Smallholder peri-urban organic farming in Nepal: A comparative analysis
   of farming systems
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE FOOD SYSTEMS AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
AB Farming in the peri-urban areas of Nepal is increasingly characterized by monocropping and the imprudent use of agrochemicals. This intensification has raised questions about the sustainability of farming systems in the region. In this paper, we do a comparative assessment of these farming systems, focusing on organic production in the densely populated Kathmandu Valley. The relative inaccessibility of farming accessories and of modern farming technologies usually leads rural farmers to follow traditional farming methods, sometimes referred to as "default organic." In contrast, access to infrastructures opens avenues for further development of ecological farming in peri-urban areas. Gross margin analysis indicates that organic vegetable production is a lucrative endeavor in the area under study. Urbanites are willing to buy organic vegetables, but the higher price and lack of certification of organically produced vegetables are factors that should be taken into account by producers and organizations working in organic production. We suggest that nongovernmental bodies, along with government-run institutions, cooperatives, and community-based organizations, can play a facilitating role for a smallholder organic growers certification program. They should also support peri-urban farmers in their efforts to enhance the environment and agrobiodiversity.

TI Soil compaction and controlled traffic considerations in Australian
   cotton-farming systems
SO CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE
AB A literature review was conducted to collate best practice techniques for soil compaction management within cotton-farming systems in Australia. Universally negative effects of traffic-induced soil compaction on the whole-farm system and the wider environment include: (i) increased gap between attainable and potential yields, (ii) increased costs of energy and labour, (iii) reduced fertiliser-use efficiency, (iv) reduced water use efficiency (irrigation and rainfall), (v) increased tillage intensity. Knowledge gaps that merit research priority, and research strategies, are suggested. These include: (i) identifying wider impacts on farm economics to guide decision-making and development of decision support systems that capture the effects of compaction on fertiliser, water, and energy use efficiency; (ii) predicting risks at the field or subfield scale and implementing precision management of traffic compaction; (iii) canopy management at terminal stages of the crop cycle to manipulate soil-moisture deficits before crop harvest, thereby optimising trafficability for harvesting equipment; (iv) the role of controlled traffic farming (CTF) in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and loss of soil organic carbon, and in enhancing fertiliser and water-use efficiencies; (v) recent developments in tyre technology, such as low ground-pressure tyres, require investigation to assess their cost-effectiveness compared with other available options; and (vi) catchment-scale modelling incorporating changes in arable land-use, such as increased area under CTF coupled with no-or minimum-tillage, and variable rate technology is suggested. Such modelling should assess the potential of CTF and allied technologies to reduce sediment and nutrient losses, and improve water quality in intensively managed arable catchments. Resources must be efficiently managed within increasingly sophisticated farming systems to enable long-term economic viability of cotton production. Agronomic and environmental performance of cotton farming systems could be improved with a few changes, and possibly, at a reasonable cost. Key to managing soil compaction appears to be encouraging increased adoption of CTF. This process may benefit from financial support to growers, such as agri-environmental stewardships, and it would be assisted by product customisation from machinery manufacturers.

TI Disentangling the diversity of small farm business models in
   Euro-Mediterranean contexts: A resilience perspective
SO SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS
AB With growing concern for the unsustainability of food systems, the international research community has turned its attention to small farms as key actors to potentially face the global food crisis. This study aims to support a policy design that values the diversity of small farms business models vis-a-vis environmental, economic, social and institutional challenges affecting European farming systems. Building on the existing classification of five small farm types in the EU, our analysis targets the business model dynamics of small farms in four Euro-Mediterranean countries: Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain. For this analysis, we applied resilience thinking to the Business Model Canvas framework. This innovative conceptual framework allows us to depict the architecture of small farms business models and their role in farming systems. The diversity of small farms business models and their continuous adaptation to changing conditions allows for the identification of a strongly heterogeneous assemblage of farms that contribute to the resilience of food systems at local, regional and multiple other scales.

TI Green farming systems for the Southeast USA using manure-to-energy
   conversion platforms
SO JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
AB In the southeastern USA, livestock operations face issues with both manure management and energy. Both issues can be advanced by implementing holistic solutions to manure treatment that involve (1) resourceful energy management and (2) green farming systems. In such systems, current and emerging waste-to-energy conversion platforms can contribute to renewable energy solutions, improved crop yields, and sustained natural resources. System-component technologies can manage both wet and dry manures to provide recycled nutrients to crops while minimizing air and water quality impacts. Relative to energy, anaerobic digestion (AD) is the prevalent biochemical platform. It is a mature technology that readily processes wet manure, and it is used on many levels of sophistication throughout the globe. Thermochemical conversion (TCC) processes with smaller physical footprints are versatile, capable of handling wet and dry feedstocks to yield multiple byproducts. They need (1) manure feedstock conditioning to lessen the effects of salts, metals, and sulfur and (2) heat recovery for energy conservation. Additionally, with appropriate downstream processing, the TCC gases and bio-oils can aid in farm energy management to include liquid fuel. The TCC processes also produce a reasonably transportable, nutrient-dense biochar. While AD provides a digestate suitable for land application, wastewaters within these systems can also be treated at different stages with solids-separation and nitrogen-phosphorous recovery technologies. This cleaner effluent offers more options for its use in meeting crop water needs via irrigation. Thus, through holistic thinking coupled with dynamic agribusiness, there are significant opportunities for future livestock farming systems to improve the sustainability of natural resources including energy.

TI Carbon and Nitrogen Stocks and Nitrogen Mineralization in Organically
   Managed Soils Amended with Composted Manures
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
AB The use of composted manures and of legumes in crop rotations may control the quality and quantity of soil organic matter and may affect nutrient retention and recycling. We studied soil organic C and N stocks and N mineralization in organically and conventionally managed dryland arable soils. We selected 13 extensive organic fields managed organically for 10 yr or more as well as adjacent fields managed conventionally. Organic farmers applied composted manures ranging from 0 to 1380 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) and incorporated legumes in crop rotations. In contrast, conventional farmers applied fresh manures combined with slurries and/or mineral fertilizers ranging from 200 to 1900 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) and practiced a cereal monoculture. Despite the fact that the application of organic C was similar in both farming systems, organically managed soils showed higher C and similar N content and lower bulk density than conventionally managed soils. Moreover, organic C stocks responded to the inputs of organic C in manures and to the presence of legumes only in organically managed soils. In contrast, stocks of organic N increased with the inputs of N or C in both farming systems. In organically managed soils, organic N stocks were less mineralizable than in conventional soils. However, N mineralization in organic soils was sensitive to the N fixation rates of legumes and to application rate and C/N ratio of the organic fertilizers.

TI Changing gender role declines maize yield, but remittances offset:
   Findings from migrant households in the central Himalayas, Nepal
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB In this paper, we investigate the interplay between labor out-migration, changes in gender roles, and their effects on the maize farming system. The paper unravels these interactions using the data collected from 1053 migrant households in the mountains of Nepal. The result shows that household size positively and the number of 17-60-year-old household members negatively influence maize yield. Remittance income and raising farm animals enhanced maize yield. Geography, especially maize farming in the mountains, showed a reduction (25.6%) in yield. The migrants' wives stated less maize yield (5%) compared to the other household members. In addition to these contextual factors, women's increased participation in the household chores, rearing and caring of farm animals, and community activities significantly compromised maize yield. However, the remittance income offsets the loss. As women's role in agriculture is central, especially in the context of male labor out-migration, gender-transformative approaches to research and development practices would ensure social justice and equitable benefit sharing. Accounting for their choices and preferences in developing and designing agricultural interventions is thus vital for the long-term sustainability of the mountain farming systems.

TI Impact of Natural Farming Cropping System on Rural Households-Evidence
   From Solan District of Himachal Pradesh, India
SO FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB Natural farming, popularly known as zero budget natural farming, is an innovative farming approach. It is low input based, climate resilient, and low cost farming system because all the inputs (insect repellents, fungicides, and pesticides) are made up of natural herbs and locally available inputs, thereby reducing the use of artificial fertilizers and industrial pesticides. It is becoming increasingly popular among the smallholder farmers of Himachal Pradesh. Under the natural farming system, 3 to 12 crops are cultivated together on the same area, along with leguminous crops as intercrop in order to ensure that no piece of land is wasted and utilized properly. This article focuses mainly on the different cropping systems of natural farming and comparing the economics of natural farming (NF) with conventional farming (CF) systems. Study shows that farmers adopted five major crop combinations under natural farming system, i.e., vegetables-based cropping system (e.g., tomato + beans + cucumber and cauliflower + pea + radish), vegetables-cereals-based cropping system, and other three more cropping systems discussed in this article. The results indicated that a vegetable-based cropping system has 19.68% more net return in Kharif season and 24.64% more net return in Rabi season as compared to conventional farming vegetable-based monocropping system. NF maximizes land use and reduces the chance of crop yield loss. NF has resulted in increased returns especially in the vegetable cropping system where reduction in cost was 30.73 per cent (kharif) and 11.88 per cent (rabi) across all crop combinations in comparison to CF. It is found in study that NF was cost savings from not using chemical fertilizers and pesticides, as well as higher benefit from intercrops.

TI DOC trial: nutrient supply in winter wheat - where is the deficit?
SO AGRARFORSCHUNG SCHWEIZ
AB The nutrient supply of winter wheat was one of the topics investigated by the DOC long-term system comparison from 1978 to 2003. The aim of this trial is to provide evidence of nutrient-related yield limitations in organic farming systems. Substantial differences in yield between organic and conventional farming systems and different fertilisation intensities were primarily attributed to the delivery of nutrients - in particular, nitrogen - to the plants. Because the soil phosphorus supply was adequate in all DOC systems over the entire trial period, phosphorus was ruled out as a co-limiting factor. The plant analyses of straw and grain exhibited high figures and a low differentiation for phosphorus, thus confirming the soil findings. By contrast, potassium was identified along with nitrogen as a co-limiting factor in the organic systems at the low fertilisation intensity and in the unfertilised control. This was indicated by the differentiation of potassium content in the above-ground biomass and the available soil potassium content. Despite this, both the biodynamic and bin-organic system exhibited a balanced potassium supply at the high fertilisation intensity. Both bin-systems may therefore be considered sustainable at this fertilisation intensity.

In the present study we aimed to compare the abundance, richness, and diversity of AMF communities under organic farming of a desert ecosystem in the Arabian Peninsula with those of an adjacent conventional farming system and native vegetation. In total, 12 sites, including six plant species, were sampled from both farming systems and the native site. Spore morphotyping revealed 24 AMF species, with 21 species in the organic farming system, compared to 14 species in the conventional site and none from rhizosphere soil of a native plant (Tetraena qatarensis). The AMF spore abundance, species richness, and Shannon-Weaver diversity index were high under organic farming. In both systems, the AMF community composition and abundance associated with different crops followed similar trends, with pomegranates having the highest values followed by limes, grapes, mangoes, and lemons. Our results show that organic farming in such a desert ecosystem promotes AMF diversity. These data imply that AMF might play an important role in the sustainable production of food in resource-limited desert habitats.

TI Pest management science often disregards farming system complexities
SO COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
AB Since the 1940s, pesticide-intensive crop protection has sustained food security but also caused pervasive impacts on biodiversity, environmental integrity and human health. Here, we employ a systematic literature review to structurally analyze pest management science in 65 developing countries. Within a corpus of 3,407 publications, we find that taxonomic coverage is skewed towards a subset of 48 herbivores. Simplified contexts are commonplace: 48% of studies are performed within laboratory confines. 80% treat management tactics in an isolated rather than integrated fashion. 83% consider no more than two out of 15 farming system variables. Limited attention is devoted to pest-pathogen or pest-pollinator interplay, trophic interactions across ecosystem compartments or natural pest regulation. By overlooking social strata, the sizable scientific progress on agroecological management translates into slow farm-level uptake. We argue that the scientific enterprise should integrate system complexity to chart sustainable trajectories for global agriculture and achieve transformative change on the ground.
   Pest management studies usually underestimate the complex ecological interactions and social-ecological strata of farming systems, according to a meta-analysis of 3,407 studies from a range of developing countries.

TI Quality Research of the Beetroots (Beta vulgaris L., ssp. vulgaris var.
   conditiva Alef.) Grown in Different Farming Systems Applying Chemical
   and Holistic Research Methods
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB For consumers who care about food sustainability, sustainable food seems to be at least organic, local, and seasonal food. Our research aimed to compare the differences between beetroots grown conventionally and organically using chemical and electrochemical research methods demonstrating life processes in products. Three beetroot (Beta vulgaris L., ssp. vulgaris var. conditiva Alef.) cultivars, 'Joniai', 'Jolie' H, and 'Grenade' H, were grown using organic and conventional farming systems. The total yield, diameter, and root length were measured after harvesting. The main chemical composition and color coordinates were determined. Holistic electrochemical research methods were applied to demonstrate the vitality of the products. It was found that the yield of conventionally grown vegetables depending on cultivars was from 4 to 19% higher than that of organically grown vegetables, and the dependence of the chemical composition on the farming system was ambiguous. Although the higher amounts of DM (13.70-15.90%), TSS (10.50-12.20%), and sugars (8.47-8.98%) were found in organically grown beetroots, higher contents of betalains (647-1408 mg kg(-1) fw) were accumulated by conventionally grown plants. The highest amount in the fresh weight of Ca (310 mg kg(-1)) and Mg (470 mg kg(-1)) was accumulated in conventionally grown cv 'Joniai'; only organically grown cv 'Jolie' H beetroots accumulated the highest amount of Fe (17.40 mg kg(-1)). However, lower values of the electrochemical parameters rH and P showed a better quality of ecologically grown beetroot, better vitality, and better suitability for human consumption.

TI An assessment of the environmental impacts at the farm scale of three
   organic dairy systems
SO BIOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE & HORTICULTURE
AB The local environmental impacts of three typical organic dairy farming systems were assessed using simulated models of 100 ha, organic dairy farming units. Environmental impacts on soils, the atmosphere and waterways were estimated using published and calculated relationships. In brief, the three organic dairy farming systems were: GRS, an all grassland system where a feed concentrates were imported onto the farm: GFC, a grassland based system supported by additional forage crops and some concentrates imported onto the farm: GFF, a grassland based system with additional forage crops but with no concentrates imported onto the farm and only home-grown cereals and protein feeds used. No detrimental effects on soil organic matter, biological activity, structure or erosion risk were envisaged with any of the three systems since they all maintain at least 70% of the land as grassland. The impact of local activity on the global atmosphere was estimated at 385, 420 and 337 t of CO2 equivalent release for GRS, GFC and GFF, respectively. Since all three systems were considered low-risk management strategies, few problems were estimated with regard to nitrate leaching, phosphorus release or human pathogen contamination of waterways from any of the systems. It is concluded that in general there is little to choose between the organic dairy farming systems assessed with regard to their environmental impact. However, as systems become more intensive with higher stocking rates and more imported nutrients, then there is greater potential for nutrients to 'leak' from the system and adversely impact both the local and wider environment.

AB The mapping of agro-ecological zone, which is integrated with the suitability of land evaluation, will determine the ideal farming system. The ideal farming system including sustainable land management will support the food security scenario of a region. In this chapter, the implementation of fuzzy logic for mapping the agro-ecological zone is discussed. The agro-ecological zone in Boyolali is used as case study in which the mapping considers its physiographic characteristics and climate. Two physiographic characteristics are involved: slope of the land and elevation. Rainfall is used as representative of climate. The experiment results reveal that simple membership function with the Mamdani inferences system could help decision makers to classify the agricultural land in Boyolali.

TI Measurement of sustainability of model arable farming systems
SO ROSTLINNA VYROBA
AB Nine model arable farming systems, long-term stationary field trials (Norfolk crop rotation, spring barley continuous cropping, winter wheat continuous cropping, both in four variants of organic manuring), were analysed for their sustainability using the following parameters: total factor productivity trend of the TFP index, production stability and changes of selected soil properties - humus content and soil pH. A method for energy balance was used to calculate total factor productivity. Summarised data were analysed graphically, Among the examined long-term trials there was none that would have met all selected criteria of sustainability. Four systems failed in one of the studied parameters only as follows: Norfolk crop rotation - a decreasing trend of the TFP index was determined; spring barley continuous cropping, variant B (straw incorporation + green manure) - a considerable decrease in soil pH was assessed; winter wheat continuous cropping, variant C (green manure) and D (a check without organic manuring) - the systems show an unstable level of production. In variant D of spring barley continuous cropping, degradation of resource base (due to deficient nutrient balance and an inappropriate farming practice) affected productivity of the system in the delay of about 15 years. Development of productivity in all systems was affected by replacement of grown varieties.

TI Ecological and social outcomes of urbanization on regional farming
   systems: a global synthesis
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB Though urban land covers only around 0.5% of the Earth's terrestrial surface, urbanization often leads to significant changes in land use and land cover. However, knowledge on the ecological and social outcomes of urbanization is largely fragmented across a multitude of local-level studies. We synthesized the outcomes of urbanization on 15 ecological and social variables associated with regional farming systems, namely water quality, agro-biodiversity, carbon sequestration, control of invasive species, soil fertility, control of soil erosion, pollination, cultural identity, food security, income and employment, demographic stability, conflict mitigation, social network, health and education, and equity. From 246 cases, positive, negative, and non-conclusive urbanization outcomes were extracted. Additionally, distributions of these outcomes by continent, population size of towns/cities, national per-capita GDP, and dominant farming systems were assessed. As a result, more negative than positive outcomes were found. Although ecological outcomes were largely negative, social ones were mostly positive. Threats to water quality, demographic stability, and cultural identity arose as particularly pressing issues. The ecological outcomes related to pollination were largely positive but all other ecological variables reported higher negative outcomes. The social outcomes related to the economic viability of farming and employment were largely positive, whereas those related to cultural and equity aspects were predominantly negative. The ecological outcomes were frequently negative in the Global South, medium-large cities, poor countries, and for livestock or fishery systems. The social outcomes were more frequently negative in the Americas, highly populated cities and megacities, wealthy countries, and for livestock and fishery systems. The threats and opportunities of rural-urban transformations in different dimensions and contexts of farming systems should be considered in any urban planning strategy.

TI Phosphorus balance of contrasting farming systems, past and present. Can
   food production be sustainable?
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB 1. Phosphorus inputs and losses are calculated for contrasting farming systems. In all of them cereals were a major product.
   2. In typical modern British wheat farming, P input in fertilizer and removal in crop harvested exceed all natural inputs and losses by more than an order of magnitude.
   3. Net natural inputs (i.e. inputs - losses) to farms not receiving inorganic fertilizer would be expected to support grain harvest of the order of 0.1 ton ha(-1) year(-1). However, yields about an order of magnitude higher than this have been achieved in various fanning systems in the past which did not use inorganic fertilizer.
   4. Phosphorus balances are calculated for four such farming systems. Of these, only fields along the Nile in ancient Egypt, which received flood water annually, were probably in long-term P balance. In the USA mid-west in the nineteenth century, decomposition of soil organic matter supplied P to crops, but at a declining rate. In a medieval English farm and in early twentieth century China, too, crop yield was probably dependent on soil P stores and so was not sustainable long-term.
   5. These case studies draw attention to the limits that phosphorus supply can place on sustainable crop yields because of slow rates of natural P input.

TI Biomass harvesting leads to soil acidification: a study of mixed
   crop-livestock farming systems in Madagascar
SO CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE
AB Soil acidification and declining fertility are widespread in sub-Saharan Africa. Nutrient depletion is mainly related to nutrient mining driven by biomass removal without replenishment of nutrients through use of fertilisers. Concomitant acidification is due to the high ash alkalinity of harvested biomass. We determined the nutrient content and ash alkalinity of biomass of the main crops produced in smallholder mixed crop-livestock farming systems in the Malagasy Highlands of Madagascar and calculated the soil acidification/alkalinisation occurring through biomass transfer. Samples of rice and forage were collected from 70 rice plots and 91 cultivated forage plots, and 70 manure samples were collected from farms. Nutrient exports induced by crop harvesting resulted in annual losses of 57 kg nitrogen (N), 6 kg (phosphorus) P and 33 kg potassium (K) ha(-1) for rice (grain + straw), and 31-51 kg N, 8-9 kg P and 29-57 kg K ha(-1) for each forage cut ( with three cuts per year on average). The ash alkalinity of samples, calculated as the difference between cation and anion contents, was 49-100 cmol(c) kg(-1) for forage crops, 31 cmol(c) kg(-1) for rice straw, and only 4 cmol(c) kg(-1) for rice grains. Biomass removal caused a loss of nutrients and an increase in soil acidity. Owing to low nutrient retention efficiency during the handling and storage of manure, the traditional input of manure at 5 t fresh matter ha(-1) is insufficient to balance nutrient and alkalinity losses in Malagasy mixed crop-livestock farming systems. Maintaining productive and sustainable mixed crop-livestock farming systems requires greater attention to ensuring a nutrient balance at both plot and farm levels.

SO INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB Since the research agenda on agroholdings and mega- farms was elaborated in the 2017 special issue of IFAMA, much has been learned about structure, performance and management of these farming systems. Despite doubts about the sustainability of these farming systems, they have evolved and even flourished under a wide variety of governance and geographical conditions. It remains to be seen if these systems will be successful in the long run, but continued research is warranted to understand their evolution, functional forms and impacts. This special issue includes four papers examining acquisition, growth and restructuring processes under differing conditions in Brazil, Russia, and Ukraine to gain a deeper and broader understanding of these management forms. A second major focus of this special issue is in the socio-political sphere with three papers to document and better understand the corporate social responsibility of such firms in Argentina, Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine. The new knowledge and understanding gained from these papers leads to a reformulation of the research agenda on the development of agroholdings and mega-farms in transition and emerging market economies.

SP IFSA
AB The northern Australian milk market was fully deregulated in July 2000 resulting in a decline in milk prices received by farmers of c. 20%. It was anticipated that median farm production would need to at Least double over the next 5 years for sub-tropicat dairying enterprises to remain internationally competitive. At a farm Level these changes were expected to have significant socio-economic and environmental impacts. A farming systems research project was established to address the impact of market deregulation on three main parameters; farm economics, the social well being of farming families and the farm's natural resource base. Five production systems were identified, through desktop modelling and iterative review, as having the economic capacity to provide a way forward for faming families in the new deregulated environment. To further assess these systems, field investigations were conducted over a four year period using physical models (farmlets) Linked with commercial farms.
   Adverse climatic conditions were experienced during the period of field investigations, compounding the impact of reduced milk price on farm profitability and farmer confidence. Three of the five farming systems demonstrated the potential to achieve satisfactory economic goals under these environmental conditions. However all three required significant investment in dairy specific plant and equipment to achieve goals in a manner that was socially and environmentally acceptable. Sociological studies showed an unwillingness of farming families to make these investments during this period post deregulation due to uncertainty they would continue in the industry, and, that the value of these dairy specific investments would not be able to be realised if they withdrew. In conclusion, in intensifying farming operations, incremental changes are relatively easy to manage but Large rapid changes, still necessary at particular junctures in the expansion process, carry inherent risk. Contributing significantly to this risk is the historically variable rainfall regime of northern Australia.

TI Grassland-based ruminant farming systems in China: Potential, challenges
   and a way forward
SO ANIMAL NUTRITION
AB With an increasing demand for high-quality, eco-friendly food products and growing concerns over ecological conservation, the development of ecology-based alternatives for ruminant production in China is urgently needed. This review discusses the capabilities for integrating grassland grazing into existing livestock farming systems to meet the contemporary human needs for high-quality foods and ecologi-cally stable environments. Additionally, this review provides a critical analysis of the challenges and future directions associated with grassland-based ruminant farming systems. Integrating nutritional manipulation with grazing manipulation is critical for improving the productivity of grassland-based ecosystems and natural ecological functions. Biodiversity is the primary determinant of grassland ecosystem functions, while the composition and function of rumen microbiomes determine ruminant production performance. Future studies should focus on the following aspects: 1) how livestock grazing regulates grassland biodiversity and the mechanisms of grassland biodiversity maintenance, offering an important scientific basis for guiding grazing manipulation practices, including grazing intensity, live -stock types, and grazing management practices; to 2) characterize the microbial ecology within the rumen of grazing ruminants to offer clarified instruction for the nutritional manipulation of grazing ruminants. Our recommendation includes creating a transdisciplinary system that integrates ecology, animal nutrition, and animal behavior to develop grassland-based ruminant farming systems sustain-ably, thereby achieving high-quality animal production and environmentally sustainable goals.

TI Optimization of hatchability and survivability traits of indigenous duck
   managed under backyard farming system
SO AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB An extensive field study was made in subtropical hot humid climate of north-east India to identify the most influencing climatic and human-made environmental factors and their effects on hatchability of eggs and survivability of indigenous ducklings hatched through indigenous broody hen (chicken) managed under a backyard farming system. Hatchability and survivability ratio was estimated from 858 batches duck eggs recorded from 220 marginal/landless duck farmers over a period of 24 months. Statistical analysis by fitting fixed effect general linear models revealed that the ambient temperature and relative humidity were the most critical climatic factors that affect the hatchability ratio of duck eggs and survivability ratio of ducklings. Besides, the human-made factor was also found to be associated with variations of the hatchability and survivability performances of duck under broody hen incubation. Thus identification of these factors and their effects on the studied traits would be helpful to provide appropriate season-based management strategies for economic and sustainable duck production in rural backyard farming systems. The present finding could be a valuable insight for duck farmers not only in north-east India but also in other developing countries with a subtropical hot humid climate with prevailing backyard duck production systems.

TI Exploiting genotype x management interactions to increase rainfed crop
   production: a case study from south-eastern Australia
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
AB Crop yield must increase to keep pace with growing global demand. Past increases in crop production have rarely been attributable to an individual innovation but have occurred when technologies and practices combine to form improved farming systems. Inevitably this has involved synergy between genotypic and management improvements. We argue that research focused on developing synergistic systems that overcome clear production constraints will accelerate increases in yield. This offers the opportunity to better focus and multiply the impact of discipline-focused research. Here we use the rainfed grain production systems of south-eastern Australia as a case study of how transformational change in water productivity can be achieved with research focused on genotype x management synergies. In this region, rainfall is low and variable and has declined since 1990. Despite this, growers have maintained yields by implementing synergistic systems combining innovations in (i) soil water conservation, (ii) crop diversity, (iii) earlier sowing, and (iv) matching nitrogen fertilizer to water-limited demand. Further increases are emerging from synergies between genetic improvements to deliver flowering time stability, adjusted sowing times, and potential dual-purpose use. Collaboration between agronomists, physiologists, and crop breeders has led to development of commercial genotypes with stable flowering time that are in early phases of testing and adoption.

TI No-Till Farming Systems for Sustainable Agriculture in South America
SO NO-TILL FARMING SYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE: Challenges and
   Opportunities
AB A high demand for food production has placed tremendous pressure on the finite land area and natural resources for agricultural production in different South America (SA) countries. Traditional agriculture in almost all SA countries places an emphasis on intensive tillage and monoculture, which has led to a severe environmental degradation and loss of soil productive capacity. This has led to declining crop performance and yield, which has created a risk to food security for future generations. The no-till (NT) farming system can bring a real opportunity to create a legacy of healthy farms and healthy, living soils that will form the base for future food security. The evaluation and history of soil and water management in different SA countries and the strategies developed by researchers, farmers, and organizations in order to test, validate, and promote the diffusion of the sustainable technologies that make up the NT system (NT, suitable machinery, cover crops, crop rotation, enhancing biological, physical and chemical soil attributes) are detailed in order to highlight the lessons and learning for other regions and countries.

TI Sustainability of fish pond culture in rural farming systems of Central
   and Western Cameroon
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB In Sub-Saharan Africa, fish ponds are often an integral part of farming systems but have suffered from a lack of viability and sustainability. The present study aims to understand the strategies used by fish farmers to overcome economic and environmental constraints. In 2008 and 2009, fish farmers were surveyed in Central and Western Cameroon, and the fish production systems were classified by cluster analysis. Four broad types were identified according to the complexity of household operations. The development of extensive systems (large-scale and low-input) in rural areas of central Cameroon is induced mainly by abundant available land. For semi-intensive systems in both regions (small-scale and highinput in the Western Region, large-scale and high-input in peri-urban areas of the Central Region), horizontal integration is not sufficient to make fish production profitable and sustainable. More intensive fish farms tend towards vertical integration, in which farmers establish close links with input suppliers. Main causes of low productivity of semi-intensive systems (1-2 t/ha/yr) are both lack of knowledge of fish farming principles by farmers and lack of technical improvement by extension agents and researchers which need to consider the local complexity of farming systems to develop and intensify fish production. The adaptation of development strategies to socio-economic and environmental contexts is a necessity to hope for an increase in fish pond aquaculture production in Africa.

TI Lucerne (Alfalfa) in European Cropping Systems
SO LEGUMES IN CROPPING SYSTEMS
AB This chapter reviews knowledge on the agronomy, genetics, feeding value and harvesting methods used for lucerne (alfalfa; Medicago sativa), which is the temperate climate legume species with the highest protein yield. It has agronomic advantages (high forage production, adequate persistency and drought tolerance) and provides a high-quality feed for ruminants. Lucerne also has positive impacts on the environment such as soil structure, nitrogen fertility, carbon storage, and plant and animal biodiversity. Lucerne production supports sustainable farming systems. Besides seed production that generates significant economic activity, novel uses of lucerne for human or animal health or energy production are also being investigated. Proposals for measures to increase lucerne cultivation in European farming systems are provided.

TI Sustainability of Smallholder Livelihoods in the Ecuadorian Highlands: A
   Comparison of Agroforestry and Conventional Agriculture Systems in the
   Indigenous Territory of Kayambi People
SO LAND
AB Smallholder farming constitutes an important but marginalized sector, responsible for most of the world's agricultural production. This has a significant influence in the land use/cover change process and agrobiodiversity conservation, especially in mountainous regions of the developing world. Thus, the maintenance of sustainable smallholder farming systems represents a key condition for sustainable land management and to safeguard the livelihoods of millions of rural households. This study uses a combination of biophysical and socioeconomic data based on household interviews to compare 30 highland agroforestry systems and 30 conventional agriculture systems, to determine which system provides better conditions to support sustainable livelihoods for smallholder farmers. The interview data is based mainly on the perceptions of Kayambi indigenous farmers who use these farming systems to support their livelihoods. Independent-Samples t Test and descriptive statistics were applied to analyse the data from 60 farms. The results indicate that agroforestry systems contain greater agrobiodiversity; more diversified livelihoods; better land tenure security and household income; more diversified irrigation sources and less dependency on rainfall than conventional systems. These findings highlight the role of agroforestry systems in supporting sustainable livelihoods of smallholder farmers in mountainous areas.

TI The environmental impact of intensive systems of animal production in
   the lowlands
SO ANIMAL SCIENCE
AB Environmental issues, linked to the production of animals in lowland farming systems, are reviewed, using pigs, poultry and dairy cattle as examples. The principal livestock production factors influencing their environmental impact are identified as the balance between different farm animal types and the husbandry practices used for these species, the variable potential which exists for the recycling of wastes and the modification of inputs to systems, the extent to which animal production can be integrated into move holistic farming systems and the impact of livestock on 'wildlife' (plant and animal) biodiversity. The production of large quantities of nitrogenous waste, resulting from the importation of large quantities of nitrogen to intensive animal production units, is identified as the major environmental problem for lowland animal production. The development of systems which allow these waste products to be re-used at sites of primary crop production is seen as a sustainable solution to this problem.

TI Optimal management of perennial energy crops by farming systems in
   France: A supply-side economic analysis
SO BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
AB This paper aims at analysing the sensitivity of supply of a perennial energy crop, i.e. Miscanthus x Giganteus, in France, to yield and economic parameters. We use a decision-making method over natural resources, commonly applied in sustainable forest management, to evaluate the economic potential of the crop at plot level. The method allows us to determine the optimal rotation period (ORP) and the net present value (NPV) of Miscanthus in different farming system types when growth function is accounted for in a non-stochastic way as well as when it is governed by a random process. The short-term agricultural supply model, AROPAj, is used to highlight the competitiveness of Miscanthus regarding other crops within the 157 French farm groups portrayed in the model. We also detail the impact assessment regarding NPV and ORP, land use, Nitrogen (N) fertiliser demand and losses. We find that yields, price, renewal cycle costs and the discount rate may interact with yield randomization and significantly affect the future profitability of Miscanthus. As a result of our economic optimization, and in contrast to the common view of Miscanthus grown on marginal land, this crop could be profitable on the most productive land, generally devoted to food crops. For a price contracted at 70 tons of dry matter and fixed rotation cost given at 3000 per hectare, farming systems are predicted to grow Miscanthus on more favourable areas when its yield potential is high, thus leading to a substantial decrease in N input levels and losses.

TI Exploiting diversity to promote arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis and
   crop productivity in organic farming systems
SO AIMS AGRICULTURE AND FOOD
AB Beneficial soil microbiota especially arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) deliver essential agroecosystem services in organic farming systems, where the application externalities is often limited. Undoubtedly, organic farming provides optimal conditions for agroecological functioning due to minimal soil disturbance and limited use of agrochemicals. In this context, beneficial soil microbiota are expected to deliver optimal ecosystem services. Nevertheless, the composition, diversity and function of beneficial rhizospheric microorganisms including AMF communities vary upon agronomic practices and soil conditions. Moreover, it is well known that some modern crop cultivars are less responsive to AMF, since they are bred for high intensive agricultural systems where there is sufficient supply of nutrients especially P. Until now, the establishment and function of AMF in organic cropping systems is still poorly understood. Such information is a prerequisite for the implementation of efficient cropping systems that capitalize on biological processes, a key step towards agricultural sustainability. The overall aim of this review is to provide insights on increasing mycorrhizal symbiosis and crop productivity in organic agroecosystems through innovative, temporal and spatial manipulation of species and genetic diversity at the crop cultivar, AMF species and cover crop management levels. The bulk of this review underscores the importance of examing different levels of diversification in organic farming systems, considering functional identity (single species), composition (mixed species) and diversity (heterogeneity within species) and how such components contribute to delivery of multiple agroecosystem services.

SO AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB Diversification through agroecological principles may maintain and stabilize yields in an increasingly more unpredictable climate, including market price fluctuations, as well as preserve and enhance the threatened natural resource base and the environment. Based on a participatory interview process this article identifies the barriers encountered by a group of Danish biodynamic farmers striving for self-sufficient farm systems with no or very little dependency on imported materials by developing biologically, economically and socially diverse farms. Through an iterative interview process the study found that barriers outside farm management are hindering the transition toward diverse farming and that a further exploration of the need for and implications of food sovereignty in the Global North might generate the discussions needed to support implementation of more agroecological farming system practises.

TI Smallholders' soil fertility management in the Central Highlands of
   Ethiopia: implications for nutrient stocks, balances and sustainability
   of agroecosystems
SO NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS
AB Low agricultural productivity caused by soil degradation is a serious problem in the Ethiopian Highlands. Here, we report how differences in soil fertility management between farming systems, based either on enset (Ensete ventricosum) or on teff (Eragrostis tef) as the major crops, affect the extent of nutrient stocks, balances and ecosystem sustainability. We collected information on farmers' resources and nutrient management practices from stratified randomly selected households in two watersheds in the Central Highlands of Ethiopia. In addition, we collected soil samples from each land use and calculated nutrient stocks, partial and full nutrient balances (N, P and K) for one cropping season. Our results show that farmers in the two farming systems manage their soils differently and that nutrient inputs were positively related to farmers' wealth status. The watershed with the enset-based system had higher soil N and K stocks than the watershed with the teff-based system, while P stocks were not different. Management related N and K fluxes were more negative in the teff-based system (-28 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and -34 kg K ha(-1) yr(-1)) than in the enset-based system (-6 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and -14 kg K ha(-1) yr(-1)) while P fluxes were almost neutral or slightly positive. Within the enset-based system, a strong redistribution of N, P and K took place from the meadows and cereals (negative balance) to enset (positive balances). Although in the teff-based system, N, P and K were redistributed from meadows, small cereals and pulses to maize, the latter still showed a negative nutrient balance. In contrast to nutrient balances at land use level, nutrient balances at the watershed scale masked contrasting areas within the system where nutrient oversupply and deficiencies occurred.

TI Does intensification result in higher efficiency and sustainability? An
   emergy analysis of Mediterranean sheep-crop farming systems
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The embodiment of resources in agricultural products depends on the way they are made, i.e., the production system. We applied emergy analysis on three contrasting sheep-crop farming systems according to different degrees of specialization, integration and intensification of production in Mediterranean Spain. We studied emergy flows, transformity values and emergy indices at the system level and per product (lamb meat; permanent crops: rainfed olive and almond; arable crops: rainfed barley, irrigated barley, alfalfa and sunflower). We found that the specialized pasture-based sheep system had the lowest intensity and efficiency and the highest sustainability, as opposite to the partially- integrated mixed system, while the fully-integrated mixed system obtained a balanced position. Lamb meat production was 1.9 and 1.3 times more intensive and efficient, respectively, in the partially-integrated mixed system than in the pasture-based sheep system, but 5.1 times less sustainable. All sheep sub-systems had comparatively lower intensity and higher sustainability than crops due to their higher capacity to use local and renewable natural resources. Our findings suggest that further support of agricultural development based on local and renewable natural resources and best practices is necessary to ensure long-term farming sustainability and social welfare.

TI A participatory method for the design and integrated assessment of
   crop-livestock systems in farmers' groups
SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB Crop-livestock integration promises more sustainable farming systems, but is constrained by organizational and technical issues at the farm level. Developing locally-adapted crop-livestock systems between specialized farms remains theoretical due to a lack of methods for their design and of analysis of benefits and limits for their monitoring. This article presents a method for participatory design and assessment of territorial crop-livestock systems and its application to a group of organic farmers specialized in crop or livestock production in southwestern France. We developed an adapted assessment framework for territorial crop-livestock systems. We used it firstly to produce a diagnosis of strengths and weaknesses of farming systems then to identify the potential for new crop-livestock interactions between farms and finally we designed and assessed crop-livestock integration scenarios with farmers. The technical and organizational options for change were selected to satisfy objectives of partners, illustrated by specific performance criteria (biological regulation, work management economic viability, social learning and capacity building, embeddedness of agriculture in the territory, integration in public policies). This study shows the crucial role of an adaptive methodology that includes ad hoc indicators to support the design of sustainable farming systems that considers specific agroecosystem, constraints and objectives of farmers.

TI Performance of common pool resources management in the mixed farming
   system in Goncha district, northwest highlands of Ethiopia
SO ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB Common pool resources, such as forests, shrubs, and grasslands, have been and continue to deliver a valuable contribution to the livelihood of millions of smallholder farmers in the mixed farming system areas. However, these resources are threatening by the overuse of the local community in the Ethiopian highlands. Studies accommodating sustainable management of ecological, economic, social, and institutional criteria on common pool resources are very limited over those highlands. The study is aimed at evaluating the performance of common pool resources management schemes in Goncha district, in the northwestern highlands of Ethiopia. It was developed as an alternative management scenario of common pool resources. Participatory key informant interviews were conducted with purposely selected twenty-four farmers, twelve practitioners, and three experts to generate the data. The data were analyzed by using a multi-criteria analysis (weighted score) method. The study indicated that complete enclosure management of forests and shrublands was highly contributed to enhancing biodiversity and curb gullies expansion, while poorly performed in harvesting and fair distribution of fodder and fuelwood. Alternatively, grasslands management in the periodic enclosure without rotation was largely emphasized on the fair distribution of fodder. Natural forests and shrublands in the semi-open-access management and grasslands in the open-access management were performed between very weak and poor performance to almost all criteria/indicators. Therefore, the management schemes of common pool resources should reformulate to the integrated premise of ecological, economic, institutional, and social criteria for sustainable management and productive crop-livestock mixed farming systems.

AB There is an increasing public call to produce food and fibre products using sustainable methods or systems. In our case study, the research and extension team used a holistic farming systems approach with banana producers to identify key environmental issues and explore management options for addressing these issues. Our experiences show that production research and technology can provide answers to some of the environmental problems identified, including research outcomes in plant nutrition and irrigation management, soil conservation, and integrated pest management. As a result group members have successfully reduced fertiliser use, pesticide use and soil erosion without reducing productivity. Using a participative approach highlighted the importance of integrating and adapting research outcomes to meet grower needs, and illustrated the value of combining 'smart science' with the practical 'knowhow' of farmers.

AB In India, four organic farming systems (Biodynamic, Panchgavya, Rishi Krishi and Homa farming) are prevalent in different parts of the country for production of horticultural and other crops. In BiodYnamic farming system, maximum reliance is placed on self-regulatory agro-ecosystem locally or 'farm derived' renewable resources. Use of external inputs is as minimized as possible. Experiments were conducted on 3-yrs-old plant of guava cv. Allahabad Safeda using biodynamic preparations, biofertilizers and composts. Maximum number of fruits and yield (92 & 13.69 kg tree(-1) & 283 & 40.11kg tree(-1)) were consistently recorded for 2 years from the trees, applied with 20kg FYM inoculated with Azotobacter in comparison to 21.37kg tree(-1) fruit with recommended doses of fertilizer application. Fruit quality parameters, particularly TSS (16.20 degrees Brix) were improved with application of 10kg FYM along with celrich. On the basis of these observations an experiment was further conducted by integrating, four organic farming systems on guava. Fruit yield was maximum (38.88kg tree(-1)) in trees, which were exposed to Homa atmosphere followed by 29.28kg, with Homa+Rishi Krishi and Homa+Panchgavaya. TSS was maximum (12.0 degrees Brix) with Homa + Rishi Krishi and Homa + Panchgavaya, while ascorbic acid was more (165mg100g fruit(-1)) with FYM treated plants.

TI ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL-DEVELOPMENT IN ZIMBABWE
SO GROWTH AND CHANGE
AB Zimbabwe's 1992 food crisis revealed both spatial and social contradictions associated with post-independence agricultural growth. Zimbabwe's pattern of agricultural restructuring demonstrates the need for agrarian reform programs that are more socially and environmentally sustainable. This paper examines one aspect of agricultural sustainability-the use of energy. Post-independence patterns of agricultural energy consumption are analyzed and traced historically, and the social relations of agricultural energy utilization are investigated. The energetic efficiencies of the primary farming systems are calculated as are the macro-flows of energy to agriculture generally. The data and historical analysis point to the need for a restructuring of agriculture that involves greater reliance on local renewable energy in all farming systems, and the continued resettlement of black smallholders onto former white-settler estates.

SO AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
CT Symposium on the Role of Agroforestry and Perennial Pasture in
   Mitigating Waterlogging and Secondary Salinity
CY JUN 13-14, 2000
CL ALBANY, AUSTRALIA
AB Much of the hoped-for success of deep-rooted perennials in reducing the eventual extent of dryland salinity in Australia will depend on the farm-level economic performance of the available perennial-based farming systems. A diverse range of factors contributes to this economic performance, including short-term production-related issues, dynamic factors, sustainability factors, risk factors and whole-farm factors, Although some examples of profitable perennial-based farming systems can be identified, they are limited to particular niches in particular regions, which tend to be higher rainfall regions. For the great majority of land that is at risk of salinisation, no profitable perennial plant options are currently available, The benefits of perennials for on-farm salinity prevention are likely to be of secondary importance in determining their economic attractiveness to farmers. A case study is presented for lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) in the southern region of Western Australia. Lucerne appears likely to be profitable in suitable environments, even without considering salinity-related benefits. However, further improvements to its economic performance are needed if it is to be adopted voluntarily on a scale that would address the bigger, catchment-level problems such as river salinity and flooding risk. Policy implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Resource flows, crops and soil fertility management in smallholder
   farming systems in semi-arid Zimbabwe
SO SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
AB Poor soil fertility and erratic rains are major constraints to crop production in semi-arid environments. In the smallholder farming systems of sub-Saharan Africa, these constraints are manifested in frequent crop failures and endemic food insecurity. We characterized a semi-arid smallholder farming system in south-western Zimbabwe to assess crop production, nutrient use and factors that constrain productivity. The farming system was studied using resource flow mapping, farmer interviews and calculations of crop production over three cropping seasons (2002/2003, 2003/2004 and 2004/2005) to capture variability between years. Farmers were categorized into three groups: better resourced, medium resourced and poorly resourced. Better resourced farmers produced adequate grain for basic household consumption, except in the drought year (2002/2003). Poorly resourced farmers had large grain deficits, whereas the medium resourced class had smaller deficits. Better resourced and medium resourced farmers produced adequate amounts of staple cereal in two of the seasons, while poorly resourced farmers produced inadequate amounts of food in all three seasons. All farmers produced less than 300 kg/ha of legumes per season. Lack of seed was cited as the main reason for poor legume production. Better resourced farmers used animal manure (2000-5000 kg per season) and some fertilizer on their cereal crops, while the medium resourced group used less manure (1000 kg or less) and no fertilizer. The use of manure varied strongly across the years. Poorly resourced farmers used no nutrient inputs on any of their crops. All groups had negative nitrogen balances during the three cropping seasons, although the values varied strongly between seasons. Investigation of the potential strategies for developing sustainable production systems are required to address the problems of food security in the semi-arid parts of the country and the region.

TI Climate change-related risks and adaptation strategies as perceived in
   dairy cattle farming systems in Tunisia
SO CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT
AB The perception of risks due to climate change by farmers and the measures they take to address those risks are of paramount importance in policy-making if the implementations of targeted adaptation and mitigation strategies are to be economically and environmentally sustainable. This study focused on Tunisian dairy farmers' perceptions of the risks and the actions taken to cope with changes attributable to climate change. Using a bottom-up approach, 566 surveys were carried out randomly among dairy farmers throughout Tunisia. A total of 70 diagnostic variables relating to farm characteristics, resources, management, performances and profit, in addition to climate change risk perception and adaptation strategies, were identified and analyzed. Using multivariate statistical analysis, four dairy farming groups were identified. The largest proportions of farmers belonged to the two above-ground dairy systems: without utilized agricultural areas; and with non-dairy utilized agricultural areas (Clusters 1 and 2). A minority of farmers belonged to medium-sized and large farms that specialized in milk production (Clusters 3 and 4) and has access to sufficient land, water and capital resources. In all the clusters, almost all the farmers perceived that the greatest impact of climate change would be on cow performance and forage production. The attitudes of the farmers towards adaptation to climate change are associated with farm typology. They focused mainly on increasing water capacity for livestock and crop production and improving livestock and housing conditions. The knowledge obtained from this study could be helpful for decision-makers and stakeholders in efforts to develop policies for farm management practices that address climate change and can be adapted to the country's diverse farming systems.

TI Review: Make ruminants green again - how can sustainable intensification
   and agroecology converge for a better future?

   Approaches
CY SEP 02-06, 2018
CL Clermont Ferrand, FRANCE
AB Livestock farming systems provide multiple benefits to humans: protein-rich diets that contribute to food security, employment and rural economies, capital stock and draught power in many developing countries and cultural landscape all around the world. Despite these positive contributions to society, livestock is also the centre of many controversies as regards to its environmental impacts, animal welfare and health outcomes related to excessive meat consumption. Here, we review the potentials of sustainable intensification (SI) and agroecology (AE) in the design of sustainable ruminant farming systems. We analyse the two frameworks in a historical perspective and show that they are underpinned by different values and worldviews about food consumption patterns, the role of technology and our relationship with nature. Proponents of SI see the increase in animal protein demand as inevitable and therefore aim at increasing production from existing farmland to limit further encroachment into remaining natural ecosystems. Sustainable intensification can thus be seen as an efficiency-oriented framework that benefits from all forms of technological development. Proponents of AE appear more open to dietary shifts towards less animal protein consumption to rebalance the whole food system. Agroecology promotes system redesign, benefits from functional diversity and aims at providing regulating and cultural services. We analyse the main criticisms of the two frameworks: Is SI sustainable? How much can AE contribute to feeding the world? Indeed, in SI, social justice has long lacked attention notably with respect to resource allocation within and between generations. It is only recently that some of its proponents have indicated that there is room to include more diversified systems and food-system transformation perspectives and to build socially fair governance systems. As no space is available for agricultural land expansion in many areas, agroecological approaches that emphasise the importance of local production should also focus more on yield increases from agricultural land. Our view is that new technologies and strict certifications offer opportunities for scaling-up agroecological systems. We stress that the key issue for making digital science part of the agroecological transition is that it remains at a low cost and is thus accessible to smallholder farmers. We conclude that SI and AE could converge for a better future by adopting transformative approaches in the search for ecologically benign, socially fair and economically viable ruminant farming systems.

TI Emergy evaluation of environmental sustainability of poultry farming
   that produces products with organic claims on the outskirts of
   mega-cities in China
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB With increasing concerns about food safety and the enhanced purchasing power of people in China, organic agricultural production for domestic consumption is booming, primarily on the outskirts of megacities. The aim of this study was to perform an emergy evaluation of the environmental sustainability of two typical kinds of poultry farms with organic claims in a suburb of Beijing, i.e., a backyard rearing system and an orchard rearing system. The results of a similar evaluation conducted in Italy were also used for reference and comparison. The results show that the two poultry farming systems in China had poor environmental sustainability, with ESI values less than 1, despite the fact that they had used no antibiotics and chemicals, and were trying to increase free range for chickens. The two systems in China were superior to conventional production systems, but inferior to the grass organic farming system used in Italy, as demonstrated by the indicator comparisons of EYR, ELR and ESL In light of the potential for decreasing environmental pressure, enhancing ecological complexity (indicated by EmExR) and increasing overall sustainability, raising poultry in forests or orchards is a good alternative choice in rural China. Nevertheless, organic farming practices in China are experiencing challenges on many levels: (I) they conflict with China's food safety strategy; (2) they are often having small scale operations; (3) they lack knowledge of best production practices; and (4) they have a bad reputation with the credit system.

AB No-till farming is farming technics that could better conserve the fertility of the farmland than till farming. Technically, it is greatly linked with the global sustainable agriculture framework. However, it needs to be economically sound for adoption by farmers. Scientific analysis of this aspect is rarely reported in the literature, accessible to the authors. This paper attempts to fill the gap by taking as a case study: the efficiency of tobacco Virginia farms in East Lombok (Indonesia), involving 15 no-till farming farmers and 15 till farming farmers as the sample. This sample was randomly selected from the population of Virginia farmers in purposively selected two villages in the research areas. Data collection was carried out during 2018 planting session using an individual structural interview technique. Farm efficiency was measured as Return to Cost (R/C) ratio. The significance of the efficiency difference between no-till and till farming was analyzed using a t-test. The analysis found that the R/C ratio of Virginia tobacco farms using no-till farming system (mean = 2.21) was significantly lower at 95% degree of confidence than the R/C ratio of virginal tobacco farms using till farming system (mean=3.47). In spite of this significant difference, the value of the R/C ratio was larger than one, indicating each of the systems was financially feasible. This explained the adoption of no-till farming by some of the Virginia tobacco farmers in the study areas. However, the wider adoption of the no-till farming system needed some improvements to reduce farm cost and increase revenue.

TI Livestock farming systems research in Europe and its potential
   contribution for managing towards sustainability in livestock farming
SO LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION SCIENCE
AB Livestock farming systems (LFS) research in Western Europe has been mainly conducted by 'generalist' animal production researchers. It involves strong interaction with a wide range of disciplines outside animal science to provide an improved understanding of the potential for the integrated development of LFS. LFS researchers have developed concepts, methods and tools to address the livestock farming activity as a whole. The approach is primarily based upon a dual concept of a farm which integrates human objectives and constraints with technical knowledge derived from 'conventional' animal and other biological sciences. Progress is achieved through the application of systems modelling. The need for such a systems approach has increased with recent political pressures in Europe to limit agricultural production, reduce pollution, enhance the environment, meet new societal concerns such as product quality and animal welfare, and maintain rural infrastructures. The objective of the LFS Working Group of EAAP is to improve the basis of this systems approach within the animal production scientific community. We consider that LFS research can contribute support for improving the sustainability of livestock systems provided that: (i) the interdisciplinary nature of the research is maintained and (ii) the approach maintains its roots in the community of animal scientists. These themes are developed in the paper. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes a study to construct narrative-based scenarios to complement models for exploring the sustainability of cherry production in South Patagonia. The study is part of a European-funded project (EULACIAS) which focuses on the co-innovation of farming systems in Latin America. The authors' approach involves stakeholders analysing the present state of the farming system and then identifying driving forces for change. Finally, the impact of drivers on the farming sector is assessed via a Delphi exercise to capture expert opinion. The outputs from this exercise describe three possible future scenarios, representing 'opening to new markets', 'quality' and a 'regional market'. The characteristics of each of these are described in the context of cherry production.

SO FISHPONDS IN FARMING SYSTEMS
AB There is a need to use a systems approach to complement the traditional reductionist approaches of conventional science to ensure that development is both socially and environmentally sustainable. The systems approach is essentially three things: the philosophy or concept of holism, a study of the whole system; a physical system such as an aquaculture system located in a hierarchy of systems from organism, through enterprise and farm, to community, region, nation and the world; and methods for identifying and solving problems or identifying and exploiting opportunities. As most real world problems are complex, they require interdisciplinarity, most effectively provided by teams of natural and social scientists. A general, seven step systems methodology is outlined and a discussion of farming systems research and extension, with examples from aquaculture.

TI Emergy evaluation for decision-making in complex multifunctional farming
   systems
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB In a montado farm, commonly found in the South Portugal, human activities benefit from important fluxes of renewable resources. In this study, traditional economic and emergy evaluations are compared to determine their potential contributions to understanding this complex system and applied to a case study of a farm. This allows us to determine how each method values local natural resources and purchased factors of production and services in an empirical context. Results show that the montado farm has a renewable component evaluated at 27% of the total social costs of the system and that the work of natural resources is undervalued in economic budget accounting. Economic evaluation's relative value of purchased factors and services is three and half times higher than their emergy share. We propose that complementing economic budget accounting with emergy accounting provides a benchmark to evaluate the environmental contribution to agricultural and farming systems. In this way, factors external to markets can be evaluated for farming systems, bringing to economic analysis a full evaluation of resources, including the bio-geophysical system's contributions to wealth, enlarging total economic value of resources with a donor perspective enabling a better informed and comprehensive accounting to attain sustainable economic decisions and public policies.

TI Distribution of Soil Microorganisms in Selected Farming Systems in
   Laguna, Philippines
SO PHILIPPINE JOURNAL OF CROP SCIENCE
AB Soil management practices must be aimed at improving and sustaining the quality of the soil physical, chemical, and biological properties. An understanding of the management of soil through the enhancement of the microorganisms in the soil is essential in the development of sustainable land management system. This study evaluated the populations of microflora in three major soils with different farming systems in Laguna, Philippines. Soil samples were collected and soil chemical properties such as pH, organic C, total N, available P, exchangeable K, Ca, and Mg were determined. Populations of bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi, vesicular-arbuscular (VA) mycorrhiza, and nematodes were determined. The study revealed that soil with higher soil available P, exchangeable bases, and pH favored the growth of soil microflora. The same parameters are generally affected by farming practices. Microbial population generally decreased with increasing soil depth, that followed the changing amount of organic C at the different layers within the 50 cm soil depth. In contrast to the general microflora, Luisiana clay had higher populations of Glomus, Gigaspora, and Acaulospora than Calumpang clay. The results showed that acidic and less fertile Luisiana clay is more favorable for the growth of the group of VA mycorrhiza. As in the case of VA mycorrhiza, the nematode populations were higher in Luisiana clay than in Calumpang clay.

AB Climate change due to global warming has incredibly contributed potential risk to the agricultural farming system. The collective responsibility to advocate food security and sustaining the farming system is a key issue. While the conventional farming techniques have combated to meet global food demands, however sustaining food security to provide access to safe and nutritious food is at probable risk to the growing population. At present, people are concerned more on the importance of diet and health since easily available inorganic farm products give threats to people's health by triggering unsolicited diseases. Organic farming is an approach that would guarantee environmental friendly, sustainable and safe nutritious foods with low impact to the soil biodiversity. One of the main challenging dispute of organic farming is the low yield as compared to rapid inorganic farming methods. To increase organic farm produce yield, monitoring soil organic abundance plays a key role in organic farming system. To uncover this issue, a real time smart electronic system was designed to monitor soil organic richness online in the farm to support farmers in making informed decision. The system was capable of archiving real time soil data based on soil organic volatile. Software application were integrated to analyze soil data and display soil information online including weather parameters in line with the soil status. Base station installed in the farm transmitted soil data to the control station for analysis and uploading data into a cloud database for end user's information. Data were analyzed by principal component analysis to grade organic abundance in soil and linear discriminate analysis to segregate soil volatile variation.

TI Comparison of multi-criteria decision models to approach the trade-off
   between environmental sustainability and economical viability - a case
   of nitrogen balance in dairy farming systems in Reunion Island
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
AB In the context of market liberalization and in order to avoid trade distortions, European farmers risk experiencing a restriction of subsidies for market products. Moreover, policy makers cannot underestimate the public concerns about the non-productive functions of agriculture, such as environmental management. The current study illustrates different ways of modelling the trade-offs between environmental sustainability and economic viability for dairy farming systems in Reunion Island. Nitrogen (N) balance at the farm level is the result of complex interactions between pasture and animal management and between bio-technical and socio-economic management. Therefore, different multi-criteria models were tested using a common dynamic bio-economical model that integrated the different sub-systems of the farm and their interactions. Nitrogen excess mitigation in Reunion Island dairy farming systems was used as an illustration of a non-productive objective taken into account in the decision process modelling.
   The simulations highlighted the necessity to adapt the nitrogen mitigation objective to the technical level of local territories in order to adopt environmentally friendly practices, without jeopardizing the local dairy sector. Moreover, the models generated a different set of solutions that varied according to how non-production functions are integrated in farmers' decision-making processes. This constitutes a relevant basis for discussions between farmers and decision makers.

TI Promoting generalist predators of crop pests in alley cropping
   agroforestry fields: Farming system matters
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB Developing agroecological practices that enhance biological control of crop pests is a major issue for the transition of agriculture towards sustainable and biodiversity-friendly systems. Agroecological infrastructures (AEI) are devoted to the support of ecosystem service providers, although they have mixed effects on natural enemies of crop pests. In temperate regions, alley cropping agroforestry involves within-field AEI, in the form of tree rows and associated understory vegetation strips. The objective of this study was to assess the potential of generalist predators (carabid beetles and cursorial spiders) to control weed seeds and invertebrate pests in alley cropping vs pure crop systems, under two contrasting farming systems (conventional vs organic). Predator surveys were carried out in May and June 2017 in South-Western France over 12 winter cereal fields. Our study revealed that the effect of alley cropping was modulated by the farming system. Under conventional farming, alley cropping had a negative effect on the activity-density and species richness of generalist predators, especially regarding carnivorous carabids whose activity-density was reduced by nearly 50%. Under organic farming, alley cropping enhanced both the activity-density and complementarity of generalist predators, with a two-fold increase in the activity-density of seed-feeding carabids (predominantly granivorous and omnivorous), potentially promoting weed seed and invertebrate pest control. Our results suggest that the effectiveness of AEI in promoting natural enemies depends on the farming system at the field scale, which affects resource availability and determines spillover intensity between habitats. AEI are often perceived as sources of natural enemies. However, sink and retention effects (i.e. reduced or delayed spillover into crop fields due to higher attractiveness of AEI) should not be overlooked as they can explain the mixed impacts of AEI on natural enemy communities.

TI Climate change adaptation and mitigation in smallholder crop-livestock
   systems in sub-Saharan Africa: a call for integrated impact assessments
SO Regional Environmental Change
AB African mixed crop-livestock systems are vulnerable to climate change and need to adapt in order to improve productivity and sustain people's livelihoods. These smallholder systems are characterized by high greenhouse gas emission rates, but could play a role in their mitigation. Although the impact of climate change is projected to be large, many uncertainties persist, in particular with respect to impacts on livestock and grazing components, whole-farm dynamics and heterogeneous farm populations. We summarize the current understanding on impacts and vulnerability and highlight key knowledge gaps for the separate system components and the mixed farming systems as a whole. Numerous adaptation and mitigation options exist for crop-livestock systems. We provide an overview by distinguishing risk management, diversification and sustainable intensification strategies, and by focusing on the contribution to the three pillars of climate-smart agriculture. Despite the potential solutions, smallholders face major constraints at various scales, including small farm sizes, the lack of response to the proposed measures and the multi-functionality of the livestock herd. Major institutional barriers include poor access to markets and relevant knowledge, land tenure insecurity and the common property status of most grazing resources. These limit the adoption potential and hence the potential impact on resilience and mitigation. In order to effectively inform decision-making, we therefore call for integrated, system-oriented impact assessments and a realistic consideration of the adoption constraints in smallholder systems. Building on agricultural system model development, integrated impact assessments and scenario analyses can inform the co-design and implementation of adaptation and mitigation strategies.F.

TI A participatory farming system approach for sustainable broomrape
   (Orobanche spp.) management in the Near East and North Africa
SO CROP PROTECTION
AB Broomrapes (Orobanche spp.) are aggressive and damaging parasitic weeds which have a tremendous impact on agriculture in East Africa, the Mediterranean region and the Middle East. Despite the availability of technologies to control broomrapes in economically important crops, Orobanche infestation continues to increase, threatening the livelihoods of millions of farmers. Many of the technologies developed have not been effectively disseminated and there has been little or zero adoption by farmers-who continue to use ineffective management practices that exacerbate the problem. The adaptation and dissemination of appropriate management practices are major priorities in broomrape control. However, such work must take into consideration the specific socio-economic characteristics of individual farming systems. Orobanche is a community threat and effective management requires a community-based integrated management approach. Recognizing the central role of farmers in parasitic weed management, a technical cooperation project (TCP) involving FAO, ICARDA and seven countries in the Near East and North Africa (NENA) region was implemented to improve the dissemination of knowledge and skills by using a farmer field school approach: a form of education that uses experiential learning methods to build farmers' expertise. This paper reviews conventional Orobanche research and development approaches, and highlights weaknesses in the management of the parasitic weed using these approaches as opposed to participatory approaches. The benefits and challenges of participatory farming system approaches in relation to integrated broomrape management (IBM) are also discussed. Lessons learned from achieving community ownership of, and institutional support for, IBM could be applied to other sectors (e.g. public health) in which there is a need for institutional learning and reform. Recommendations are made that include regional collaboration within the framework of a proposed Near East and North Africa Orobanche Management Network (NENAOMAN). (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Effects of land use on soil total and light fraction organic, and
   microbial biomass C and N in a semi-arid ecosystem of northwest China
SO GEODERMA
AB There is limited information about the influence of farming systems in soil organic carbon (C), total nitrogen (N) and microbial biomass in drought-prone environments. This study aimed at comparing responses of these soil parameters to alfalfa grassland, alfalfa-crop rotations (9-year alfalfa followed by 3-year annual crops), and conventional farming (long-term annual crops) in the semiarid Loess Plateau region of northwest China. It was found that the farming systems had little effect on soil organic C (SOC), but alfalfa-crop rotations decreased soil total N (STN) by 5.9-21.7% and thus increased the SOC/STN ratio from 7.85 in alfalfa grassland to 9.63 over a period of 3 years. By comparison, a SOC/STN ratio of 11 in conventional farming was largely due to its low STN. Light fraction organic C and N in alfalfa grassland were significantly lower than in conventional farming and alfalfa-crop rotation systems. Microbial biomass C (MBC) and MBC/SOC ratio did not differ between alfalfa grassland and alfalfa-crop rotation systems, but microbial biomass N (MBN) and MBN/STN ratio were increased in alfalfa grassland. Conventional farming had lowest MBC, MBN, MBC/SCC and MBN/STN ratios. Alfalfa-crop rotations increased moisture content in the dry layers of soil profile that often occur in alfalfa grassland. As alfalfa grassland had low SOC/STN ratio and alfalfa-crop rotations increased the ratio mainly through reducing STN. a long-term practice of these two farming systems like conventional farming may not be sustainable in the dry and fragile agro-ecosystem, with annual rainfall of about 300 mm, on the semiarid Loess Plateau of northwest China.

TI Rethinking mixed crop-livestock systems to reduce pesticide use
SO FOURRAGES
AB Like cash crop farms, livestock farms will need to make changes to reduce pesticide use by 50%, a requirement established by the Ecophyto Plan. These changes go beyond modifying agricultural practices. It will be necessary to rethink farming systems as a whole and to combine expertise in agricultural animal and economic performance to work with farmers to co-design new systems that are cost-efficient, sustainable, and appropriate to their needs. In general, these new systems are less productive and more complex They also require a profound shift in how work is carried out. While their economic performance is essentially the same, these systems are more environmentally friendly. However, because each farm is unique, reductions in pesticide use can be highly variable.

TI Method for Analyzing Trade-offs in Biomass Management in Smallholder
   Farming Systems Based on Mass Balance
SO MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB In smallholder farming systems, especially in mountainous areas, households face tradeoffs between meeting short-term human needs and ensuring long-term soil productivity. Improved biomass management can help break the downward spiral of overexploitation of natural resources, land degradation, and productivity decline, and support more sustainable use of marginal land. Mixed crop/livestock systems are often carefully balanced to minimize risks. Thus, when planning interventions, profound systems knowledge is crucial. However, the data required for system characterization are often scarce, and original field studies are thus necessary. The aim of this research, a case study in Tajikistan, was to improve systems understanding of the biomass cycle in crop/livestock systems in order to quantify the obstacles to the spread of sustainable land management technologies to farming households. It aimed to establish a database and methods of rapid data collection to quantify the stocks and flows of biomass, with a focus on mass balances, and to evaluate smallholders' biomass management options and trade-offs. Data collection included household interviews, secondary literature, and reference data sets from global sources. Trade-off analysis focused on household-level self-supply of food, fodder, and fuel by farmers with different sizes of smallholdings, and their potential for on-farm recycling of organic matter. Results indicate that food self-supply by small and medium smallholders is insufficient and fodder sources are scarce. Fodder scarcity means that application of crop byproducts to soils is unlikely. Animal dung is largely used as fuel. Firewood needs exceed on-farm wood production, leading to deforestation. The approach presented facilitates an understanding of current and potential agricultural land interventions in the crop/livestock farming systems prevailing in mountainous areas.

TI A traditional agroforestry system under threat: an analysis of the gum

SO AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB The main aim of this study is to review the environmental and socioeconomic sustainability of the gum arabic farming system in central Sudan. A further aim is to analyse some of the main factors influencing production in recent decades in order to understand the future trade potential and consequently the smallholder livelihood. The study shows that end-user imports of gum arabic have increased during recent decades. Gum arabic is mainly for uses such as soft drinks, confectionary, and pharmaceuticals. However, even with this increased demand the production in Sudan, the main country of production, is declining. The producers, mainly smallholders, suger from fluctuating prices. If the gum arabic farming system should be able to provide the environmental benefits of improved soil fertility and the socioeconomic benefits of risk spreading and dry season income opportunities, the prices paid to smallholders must be stabilized at a fair level, otherwise a shift to other crops or practices might take place.

TI Wheat yield gaps across smallholder farming systems in Ethiopia
SO AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Wheat yields in Ethiopia need to increase considerably to reduce import dependency and keep up with the expected increase in population and dietary changes. Despite the yield progress observed in recent years, wheat yield gaps remain large. Here, we decompose wheat yield gaps in Ethiopia into efficiency, resource, and technology yield gaps and relate those yield gaps to broader farm(ing) systems aspects. To do so, stochastic frontier analysis was applied to a nationally representative panel dataset covering the Meher seasons of 2009 and 2013 and crop modelling was used to simulate the water-limited yield (Yw) in the same years. Farming systems analysis was conducted to describe crop area shares and the availability of land, labour, and capital in contrasting administrative zones. Wheat yield in farmers' fields averaged 1.9 t ha(- 1) corresponding to ca. 20% of Yw. Most of the yield gap was attributed to the technology yield gap (> 50% of Yw) but narrowing efficiency (ca. 10% of Yw) and resource yield gaps (ca. 15% of Yw) with current technologies can nearly double actual yields and contribute to achieve wheat self-sufficiency in Ethiopia. There were small differences in the relative contribution of the intermediate yield gaps to the overall yield gap across agro-ecological zones, administrative zones, and farming systems. At farm level, oxen ownership was positively associated with the wheat cultivated area in zones with relatively large cultivated areas per household (West Arsi and North Showa) while no relationship was found between oxen ownership and the amount of inputs used per hectare of wheat in the zones studied. This is the first thorough yield gap decomposition for wheat in Ethiopia and our results suggest government policies aiming to increase wheat production should prioritise accessibility and affordability of inputs and dissemination of technologies that allow for precise use of these inputs.

TI Are peatland farming systems sustainable? Case study on assessing
   existing farming systems in the peatland of Central Kalimantan,
   Indonesia
SO JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB Economically, peatland plays an important role since they can be reclaimed for agriculture. Shallow peat (<100cm) can be used to grow food crops including vegetables. Peatland has also become attractive for development of large-scale oil palm and rubber plantations. However, peatland has a number of constraints in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, especially CO2 emissions in the degraded peatland. These arise from decomposition of peat. Common sense suggests three alternatives to manage GHG emissions from degraded peatland: conservation and restoration, natural recovery, and agricultural use. In this context, the challenge is to utilize degraded tropical peatland for agriculture while avoiding the negative impacts, and ensuring its environmental sustainability. This research attempts to contribute toward developing better management plans. Results of this study show that rice farming has highest sustainable score in degraded peatland. Rice farming secured a 52.14% sustainability score, while oil palm and rubber farming exhibited 47.55 and 47.67% sustainable scores, respectively. Therefore, rice farming can be considered as the first alternative for development of degraded peatland. Improved oil palm and rubber farming systems may also be subsequently considered if their sustainability can be improved.

CY JUN 03-07, 2002
CL IZMIR, TURKEY
SP Univ Ankara, Fac Agr, Dept Soil Sci
AB In the dry areas of Central and West Asia and North Africa (CWANA), the factor, ultimately limiting the crop yield is the shortage of water. A variable supply of water due to seasonal differences in precipitation leads to equally variable crop yields. With water being the most limiting to production, agricultural priority across all dry-area farming systems is to increase production per unit of water. Water use efficiency in current farming systems is often low. The challenge is to understand why this is so, and to devise relevant solutions in the context of both biophysical and socioeconomic constraints.
   Research at ICARDA has shown that improved soil and crop management practices together with suitable germplasm material can considerably increase the efficiency with which the limited amount of water available from precipitation is used. That is, more production from each mm of precipitation can be achieved if crops are well established and adequately fertilized, weeds are controlled, and appropriate crop rotations are used. Proper management of soil should be considered for sustainable production and long-term conservation of natural resources. However, where water resources are available, agricultural productivity and water use efficiency has been increased through irrigation. Supplemental irrigation in rainfed areas can substantially increase and stabilize field crops production, using only limited amounts of water. Furthermore it was found that water use efficiency with supplemental irrigation is higher than with full irrigation. In areas with limited water supply, deficit irrigation provides additional increase in water use efficiency and in total farm production. Water productivity in fully irrigated areas may be increased by new technologies that integrate proper cropping patterns, improved verieties, suitable cultural practices and more efficient irrigation scheduling.

In this review, we present promising legume options by farming system niche, thus providing an ecological as well as socio-economic lens for better policy decision making. We focus on multipurpose legumes with complementary growth habits that can be grown in conjunction for enhanced agriculture sustainability. We also show the region's spatially-explicit distribution of chickpea, common bean, cowpea, groundnut, and pigeonpea, and define the climate niche for expansion of these crops through Google Earth Engine. Multipurpose legumes provide 'scale out' opportunities for smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa, but not without considerable investment.

TI ADAPTED FARMING SYSTEMS FOR A RURAL LANDSCAPE - A SOCIAL TYPOLOGY OF
   DUTCH FARMERS
SO SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS
AB Agricultural practices in The Netherlands are based on a strong socio-economic sector. Current production methods have an immense and often unwanted impact on the environment and threaten its function for urban and rural populations in a nation that is densely populated, industrialized and urbanized.  A comparative qualitative study was carried out in five different regions, each region representing a particular rural landscape of great value.  The study assessed the willingness and capability of full-time farmers in land-based agriculture to modify their farming practices and farm organization in favour of a multi-functional rural landscape.  According to their perceptions and ideas about the use of rural land, in each region only one (dominant) type of farmer was to be found, with a few individual 'exceptions'.  By investigation their orientation to adapted farming systems (i.e. sustainable agriculture and landscape management), several groups were identified within the dominant type.  However, these groups cannot be considered as sub-types: the differences were too minimal, due to the preoccupation of many respondents with optimum agricultural production and the unavailability of equivaler.

TI DRYLAND MEDITERRANEAN FARMING SYSTEMS IN AUSTRALIA
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
AB The mediterranean region of Australia extends from Geraldton in Western Australia across southern Australia into western and northern Victoria. This region experiences hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters, with 300-600 mm annual rainfall. In the dryland farming zone, the cereal-livestock farming system dominates and produces 30-35% of Australia's total agricultural production. The major soils in the region are deep, coarse-textured sands and sandy loams, duplex soils with coarse-textured sands over clay (generally low in nutrients and organic matter), and fine-textured red-brown earths of low hydraulic conductivity.
   Major soil problems in the region include sodicity, salinity, soil structural degradation, nutrient deficiencies, boron toxicity, acidity, waterlogging, inadequate nitrogen nutrition, water-repellence, and root diseases. These problems have been exacerbated by excessive clearing of trees, increased frequency of cropping, reduced area sown to pastures, declining pasture production, and a decline in nutrient levels. With improved soil management there is potential for increased productivity from dryland farming areas of the region and improved ecological sustainability.

In this paper, we present a model that was developed and used with farmers as a discussion support tool to address the impacts of farming management strategies on farm resources. We assumed that the characterization of biomass flows at the farm level would provide a simple framework for designing a discussion support tool for farmers. The study was carried out in the semi-arid region of Brazil, where areas of native vegetation of the Caatinga Biome have been reduced in recent decades due to population pressure. In this region, simulation models are not used to discuss the impact of practices. We decided that a model for this purpose should: (1) be simple enough to be used by farmers, (2) be consistent with existing data, and (3) take into account the three main biomass management strategies. The model we built simulates biomass exports (harvest, animal intake, clearing vegetation of Caatinga), imports (purchase of fodder), and returns (animal manure) for farms with different vegetation types (Cenchrus ciliaris, Sorghum bicolour, Opuntia sp. and Caatinga native vegetation). We used the model to compare three management strategies over a 15-year period and found that the strategy that allows for the preservation of Caatinga vegetation is less sensitive to bad years but results in a reduced herd size. We validated the use of this model by testing it with farmers. We found that farmers were interested in using the model as a learning (38%), management (33%), or prospective tool (24%). This study shows that the dynamic modeling of biomass flows provides a simple and operational framework to analyze the impact of farming systems on farm resources with farmers. Contrary to current dynamic biophysical models that are based on extensive experimental data, this model does not give accurate predictions but allows both farmers and researchers to learn the impacts of farming systems. The complexity of the model should be increased progressively as farmers improve their understanding of the underlying processes.

AB Strong social ovements are increasingly being built on concrete experiences such as organic market gardening microfarms to promote alternative food systems. The study of 12 French microfarms, based on semi -structured interviews and cross disciplinary analysis, revealed that alternative microfarms rely upon access to available material and intangible resources in their social environment. Involvement in the community is a necessity and, at the same time, the way to solidify ecological and social aspirations that are essential in the farmers' projects. Classical technoeconomic frameworks do not account for these non -market inputs. A larger conceptual framework based on concepts such as multifunctionality of agriculture, ecosystem services, and "double" sustainability is thus needed to analyze and assess the strategic choices of alternative organic microfarms.

   climate change adaptation strategies: The case of a New Zealand dairy
   farming system
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
AB The development of effective climate change adaptation strategies for complex, adaptive socio-ecological systems such as farming systems, requires an in-depth understanding of both the dynamic nature of the systems themselves and the changing environment in which they operate.
   To date, adaptation studies in the New Zealand dairy sector have been either bottom-up, qualitative social research with farmers and communities, or top-down, quantitative biophysical modelling. Each of these approaches has clear benefits as well as significant limitations. This review considers concepts and approaches that support the potential for different disciplines to complement each other in developing a more in-depth understanding of farming systems and their adaptive potential. For this purpose, a Mixed Methods Framework is presented, using examples from a pilot study of a New Zealand dairy farm to illustrate the complementarities between the two current approaches.
   By presenting this methodology in a specific context, the review provides the theoretical basis for a practical way to integrate quantitative and qualitative research for climate change adaptation research. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO QUALITY-ACCESS TO SUCCESS
AB In 2017, the food and beverages industry was reconfirmed as the European Union's biggest manufacturing sector, in terms of employment, turnover and added value. However, almost all the companies are small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) showing a slow rate of adoption of innovations and precision agriculture technologies. With the advent of the digital age, new opportunities are opening for the agri-food SMEs to enhance their competitiveness through the application of technological innovations in the supply chain, from farm to fork. Given the wide range of available technology and its increasingly rapid development, the paper presents an overview of worldwide development and status of precision agriculture, starting from 2000 until to date. In dealing with the state-of-the-art, the paper confirms that technological applications in food production are of relevance in ensuring sustainable management of farming systems.

TI Institutional and Policy Related Research Gaps for Climate Resilient

SO CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE IN SOUTH ASIA: TECHNOLOGIES, POLICIES AND
   INSTITUTIONS
AB This chapter analyzes research and capacity gaps in policies, institutions and markets in Eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain (Eastern IGP), including the states of Bihar and West Bengal in India, Nepal and Bangladesh. The analysis is based on a review of existing policies, institutional framework and farmers group discussion (FGD) from selected villages in identified districts located across the Eastern IGP. A review of the existing policies and institutions indicated that a good number of required policies and institutional framework were in place, but the informal transaction cost of availing benefits of those policies by the smallholders from formal channels (banks, government departments, insurance companies, etc.) was very high. This reflected poorly on the level of governance, as the global percentile ranking of Eastern IGP states in respect of governance was in the range of 15-45%. Therefore, major reforms are required for promoting equitable access to technology and financial services; public resources management (reducing leakages) and addressing gender issues.

TI Enhancing nitrogen and rainwater use efficiency through rainwater
   harvesting in semi-arid smallholder sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) farming
   systems
SO COGENT FOOD & AGRICULTURE
AB Nitrogen and rainwater use efficiency in semi-arid smallholder farming systems is low due to low soil fertility and unreliable rainfall. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of rainwater harvesting and mineral nitrogen fertilizer on nitrogen and rainwater use efficiency under two sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) varieties. A split-split plot experiment, replicated three times, was conducted in Mt Zonwe smallholder farming area from 2016/17 to 2018/19. The results showed that water content under tied contour (TC) and infiltration pits (IP) had significantly higher water content compared to standard contour (SC) and moisture content significantly decreased with an increase in distance from RWH practices. TC and IP had higher agronomic efficiency than SC across all nitrogen applications, distance from RWH practice, and seasons. Sorghum variety Macia had higher nitrogen use efficiency indices than Sc Sila at nitrogen application of 50 and 70 kg N/ha while nitrogen application >100 kg N/ha had no difference in nitrogen use in both varieties. A decreasing trend in nitrogen productivity with an increase in nitrogen application was shown in both varieties. Mineral nitrogen fertilizer application increased rainwater productivity up to 100 kg N/ha beyond which there was no significant difference. Regardless of sorghum variety and season, TC and IP had higher rainwater use efficiency than SC at each distance from RWH practice. This study recommends the integrated use of TC and IP rainwater harvesting practices and mineral nitrogen fertilizer sustainably to improve N and rainwater productivity in semi-arid smallholder sorghum farming systems.

TI Weed Management in Autumn Fresh Market Spinach: A Nonchemical
   Alternative
SO HORTTECHNOLOGY
AB Physical rather than chemical treatments are preferred for integrated production and are required for organic production to ensure a sustainable production. Weed management in many horticultural crops is heavily constrained by the limited number of herbicides available. Physical weed control strategies, on the other hand, are essential to organic vegetable production and greatly assist conventional vegetable farmers. A physical weed control strategy was developed and compared with a standard chemical strategy within an integrated farming system in fresh market spinach (Spinacia oleracea). The experiment was conducted on a farm in the Serchio Valley (Tuscany, central Italy) in 2004 and 2005, where spinach is one of the most important crops. The physical weed control strategy consisted of a stale seedbed technique and postemergence treatments using various mechanical and thermal machines. The chemical weed control strategy consisted of a single postemergence herbicide treatment using phenmedipham at 15.8% in compliance with integrated production norms in Italy. Strategy performance was assessed in terms of weed density and biomass, total labor requirement, and crop yield. Compared with the chemical system, the physical system required a substantially larger labor input (19 vs. 6 h.ha(-1)), but like the chemical system, did not require hand weeding. In addition, the physical system reduced weed dry biomass at harvest by 50% and increased spinach fresh yield by 35%. Physical strategies therefore are a valid alternative to the use of herbicides in fresh market spinach and may be especially desirable given the increasing importance of nonchemical weed control in integrated, organic, and conventional farming systems in Europe and the United States.

TI Achieving Food and Livelihood Security and Enhancing Profitability
   through an Integrated Farming System Approach: A Case Study from Western
   Plains of Uttar Pradesh, India
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The integrated farming system (IFS) is a comprehensive farm practice to improve small and marginal farmers' livelihoods. The IFS enhances nutrient recycling and food security and promotes greater efficiency of fertilizers and natural resources. To improve livelihood, profits, and employment generation holistically through an IFS method, a study was conducted over four years, from 2016 to 2019, to define the farming condition in 1036 households in the Muzzafarnagar district of Western Uttar Pradesh. Crop + dairy was the most frequent farming method (68%) followed by crop + dairy + horticulture + goatary. Compared to older cultivars, improved rice, maize, wheat, and barley cultivars enhanced crop yield by 17 to 42%. Transplanting sugarcane and intercropping of mustard increased system yield from 58.89% to 86.17% compared to the sole sugarcane crop. Nutritional kitchen gardening resulted in an average saving of $20 to $25 during the Kharif season and $20 to $27 during Rabi season. Exotic vegetables such as broccoli, Chinese cabbage, cherry tomato, kale, parsley, and lettuce were introduced, which increased regular income. With the adoption of a multi-tier-based system, the net returns from the system improved from 0.6 lakh to 2.20 lakhs per ha. Enhancing the fodder availability resulted in a 27.5% milk yield improvement. The study's outcomes demonstrated that a five-member family's annual protein (110-125 kg) and carbohydrate (550 to 575 kg) requirements can be easily met using the IFS technique. According to the study, IFS approaches combined with better technical interventions can ensure the long-term viability of farming systems and improve livelihoods.

TI Climate variability drives livestock farmers to modify their use of
   collective summer mountain pastures
SO AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB It is essential for grass livestock farming to cope with climate variability and, particularly, drought. A potential solution is to use collective mountain pastures, which are colder and wetter, in the summer. However, there is little knowledge on such collective pasture management. Therefore, we surveyed three collective sheep summer mountain pastures and three small and one large cattle summer mountain pastures in 2012 in the Auvergne region, France. Farmers using and managing the pastures were interviewed. We also analysed regional statistics, an economic report and a shepherd journal. Our results show that drought has incited farmers to use collective pastures. Beginning and ending dates of the summer grazing season and animal transfers have been modified by collective decisions and individual farmer strategies. We conclude that collective summer mountain pastures is a unique source of flexibility for livestock farming.

TI A multi-field bio-economic model of irrigated grain-cotton farming
   systems
SO FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
AB We present a participatory modelling framework that integrates information from interviews and discussions with farmers and consultants, with dynamic bio-economic models to answer complex questions on the allocation of limited resources at the farm business level. Interviews and discussions with farmers were used to: describe the farm business; identify relevant research questions; identify potential solutions; and discuss and learn from the whole-farm simulations. The simulations are done using a whole-farm, multi-field configuration of APSIM (APSFarm). APSFarm results were validated against farmers' experience. Once the model was accepted by the participating farmers as a fair representation of their farm business, the model was used to explore changes in the tactical or strategic management of the farm and results were then discussed to identify feasible options for improvement.
   Here we describe the modelling framework and present an example of the application of integrative whole farm system tools to answer relevant questions from an irrigated farm business case study near Dalby (151.27E - 27.17S), Queensland, Australia. Results indicated that even though cotton crops generates more farm income per hectare a more diversified rotation with less cotton would be relatively more profitable, with no increase in risk, as a more cotton dominated traditional rotation. Results are discussed in terms of the benefits and constraints from developing and applying more integrative approaches to represent farm businesses and their management in participatory research projects with the aim of designing more profitable and sustainable irrigated farming systems.

TI The adaptive capacity of smallholder mixed-farming systems to the impact
   of climate change: The case of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa
SO JAMBA-JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK STUDIES
AB Climate change poses a serious threat to efforts by developing countries to ensure food security and poverty reduction. The National Development goals of South Africa envisage the agricultural sector as a key driver for job creation and economic growth. This article seeks to investigate the adaptive capacity of the Ncunjane farming community in Msinga, KwaZulu-Natal in response to drought spells of 2010 and 2014. This article draws on data collected using both qualitative and quantitative methods in 2011 and later in 2015 with the data analysed through the Statistical Package for Social Science to determine significant correlations between variables. Analysis of the vulnerability and adaptive capacity is performed using conceptual framework. This study found that both smallholder farmers who engaged in livestock and crop production have experienced high cattle mortalities and stagnant crop productivity, which in turn put pressure on already constrained disposable household income because of increased food costs and agricultural input costs, particularly supplementary animal feed. Cattle owners were more vulnerable to drought because of poor risk management and thus became highly dependent on government to provide drought relief. Application for government drought relief was found not to be effective in cases of large herds of cattle. Variability of rainfall and prolonged heat spells has a significant impact on the sustainability of smallholder mixed-farming systems, leaving agriculture as a highly questionable form of livelihood for rural farming communities such as Msinga. The article recommends strengthened institutional mechanisms so that stakeholders should play a more meaningful role within provincial and local agriculture in leveraging government support but places emphasis on the adoption of innovative strategies that can potentially yield significantly resilient smallholder mixed-farming systems in the wake of climate variability.

TI Comparison of European Olive Production Systems
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB (1) Background: Spain, Italy, and Greece are the world's top olive oil producers. In recent decades, these countries have gradually diversified their farming system in the olive groves. The element of innovation with respect to the state of the art is that this paper aims to compare the environmental performance of different farming systems in a European context by performing a simplified Life Cycle Assessment; (2) Methods: Environmental performance was calculated according to the methodology of Life Cycle Assessment and the "Guidance for the implementation of the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF)". Average data were considered in order to describe a system with a great degree of complexity and high spatial heterogeneity; (3) Results: The study highlights the difficulty of identifying the farming method that presents the best environmental performance in each of the impact categories considered. In Greece, the lowest use of diesel, electricity, and water brings about advantages for many impact categories, albeit with low yields. While the highest olive yield obtained in Italy has positive consequences in terms of global warming, the highest use of fertilisers, in many cases, entails higher environmental impacts. On the other hand, in Spain the highest use of organo-phosphorous pesticides entails the highest impacts of eco-toxicity; (4) Conclusion: the reduction of the use of fertilizers and pesticides, as well as water conservation, are important issues which require the optimization of timing and techniques in order to achieve environmental advantages.

TI AN INTEGRATED FARMING SYSTEM APPROACH TO UPLIFT THE RURAL POOR
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND STATISTICAL SCIENCES
AB Theh present study was conducted in Kalghtagi taluk of Dharwad district by selecting one farmer for Integrated Farming System (IFS) demonstrations. The IFS approach is considered to be not only a reliable way to obtaining fairly high productivity with considerable scope of recycling unused farm resources, the concept of ecological soundness leading to sustainable agriculture, protection of environment and efficient natural resource management, particularly in tropical climate. IFS represents an appropriate combination of farm enterprises like Field crops, Horticulture, Livestock, Fishery, Forestry, Dairy, Poultry etc. and the means available to the farmer to raise them for profitability. The success of IFS depends on selection of various components which are interrelated, interdependent and interlinking in nature. Its main aim is utilization of primary and secondary produce of one system as basic input for the other system. Thus making them mutually integrated as one whole unit. Thus in the present IFS approach the following technologies were introduced to uplift their standard of living. Introduction of African tall fodder maize, forestry component Tamarind (DTS-1), Fish culture, Vermicomposting by bricks and pit method and its use in Horticulture and field crops, Azolla units and feeding schedule for dairy, fishery and poultry birds. By following all these interventions the bench mark net returns was raised from Rs. 87,200 to 2,28,610. For this purpose the land use intensity under three crop season of respective years also increased from 2600 acres to 3300 acres. Finally, the benefit cost ration was stabilized at 2.51.

TI Assessment of potential impacts of agricultural practices on the
   environment: the AGRO*ECO method
SO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW
AB A method is proposed for the evaluation of potential impacts of arable farming systems on the environment. The first step is the calculation of evaluation modules that estimate the impact of each agricultural technique on each environmental component. These modules are aggregated either to rank or classify cropping systems by means of multicriteria methods or to generate an agro-ecological indicator (AEI). Nine agro-ecological indicators have been tested: nitrogen fertilisation, phosphorus fertilisation, pesticides, irrigation, crop succession, cropping pattern,crop covering, organic matter, and ecological structures; two others are in development: energy and soil management. Together, the AEIs provide a 'control panel' for the farm. These agro-ecological indicators are calculated mostly at the field level and then averaged over the whole farm. As input, few parameters used in the calculation of these indicators are region-specific (e.g., reference of sowing dates, leaching periods). Since 1994, the indicators are established with data from a network of 17 arable farms in the Rhine plain (France and Germany) to characterise the degree to which the objectives of sustainable agriculture have been reached by these farms.

AB Agricultural management of soils has led to severe losses of soil organic matter (SOM), accompanied by an increased release of CO2 into the atmosphere and a reduction of soil fertility. Especially under the aspect of global warming and the increasing demand for food, there is a need for sustainable management options increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in agricultural soils, but knowledge gaps exist regarding C persistence in, and its transfer between functional SOC pools, within different farming systems. Here we report on impacts of different farming systems on the temporal dynamics of SOM fractions within the DOK long-term trial (Switzerland), from 1982 to 2017. A purely minerally (CONMIN), a minerally and organically (CONFYM), and a purely organically fertilized farming system (BIODYN) were compared with an unfertilized control (NOFERT). We separated archived soils from the Haplic Luvisol (0-20 cm depth) into particulate (POM) and mineral-associated OM (MAOM) fractions, via physical fractionation, and analyzed the chemical composition of selected fractions via solid-state C-13 CPMAS-NMR spectroscopy. We demonstrate that under none of the analyzed farming systems, additional SOC was sequestered in the clay-sized MAOM fraction (< 6.3 mu m) over a period of 36 years. In all fertilized systems, the amount of SOC in this pool did not change, but strongly decreased in NOFERT (-27%). Bulk SOC increased in BIODYN (+13%) and CONFYM (+5%), but decreased in CONMIN (-8%) and NOFERT (-20%). As no additional SOC accumulated in the clay-sized MAOM fraction, this implies that bulk SOC increases were solely stored within labile POM fractions. NMR spectra showed comparable POM chemical compositions between different systems. Differences in fertilizer quality (BIODYN = composted farmyard manure vs CONFYM = stacked farmyard manure + mineral fertilizer) and the omission of pesticides resulted in better conditions for POM stabilization and consequently significantly higher C contents of occluded POM (oPOM) within aggregates, in BIODYN. However, this labile fraction is at high risk of being lost within a few days, as illustrated by the strong annual oPOM-C content fluctuations depending on the timing of soil sampling after harvest. The highest post-harvest oPOM-C losses in BIODYN indicate the higher dynamics compared to CONFYM. It is anticipated that only sustainable fertilization methods with continuous application of solely organic fertilizers in the long-run can maintain SOC in the labile POM fractions at elevated levels, thereby ensuring soil fertility. It also illustrates the need for prevention of major losses by careful management of the labile POM fractions, as this OM could associate with fine mineral particles at a later stage and thus contribute to OC sequestration in the stable SOC pool. Overall, the potential of arable soils to accumulate stable OC for long-term sequestration is questioned.

TI The technology adoption behavior of women farmers: The case of alley
   farming in Nigeria
SO RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS
AB The indigenous system of crop production in Nigeria, the bush fallow farming system, which is known for its stability and biological efficiency, can no longer be operated effectively, due to a shortage of land. In order to increase farm productivity, researchers have devised alley farming, a low-input farming system which sustains crop and livestock production, can reduce competition from weeds, and conserves soil by reducing soil physico-chemical degradation and the decline of soil organic matter. The mobilization of women to adopt agricultural innovations is an important topic in development studies. Due to the important role of Nigerian women farmers in crop and livestock production, they are encouraged to adopt alley farming. Contrary to some of the literature, which claims that women are slow innovation adopters, this study argues that women farmers easily adopt innovations that can enhance their economic status. The paper argues that the characteristics of alley farming influence women farmers' adoption or rejection of the farming system. It was observed that the land tenure system is not an inflexible constraint on alley farming adoption. It is argued that low participation of women in agricultural innovation adoption is caused by lack of information about the advantages of the innovations, because meetings are fixed at times when women are not able to attend. This paper points out that the adoption of alley farming has increased the agricultural production and the quality of life of women farmer adopters.

TI Ridge-furrow with grass straw mulching farming system to boost rainfed
   wheat productivity and water use efficiency in semiarid Kenya
SO JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE
AB BACKGROUND Ridge-furrow mulching farming systems (RFMs) aim to increase field productivity and improve water use efficiency. To explore environment-friendly and efficient farming systems is a central aspect of rainfed wheat field management in Kenya where rainfall utilization is at a low level. We introduced RFMs (including plastic film and grass straw mulching) to semiarid Kenya to evaluate the effects on field productivity, rainwater utilization, soil quality and economic profitability using old and modern wheat cultivars from 2012 to 2013.
   RESULTS Across the cultivars, the RFMs increased grain yield, aboveground biomass and water use efficiency by 74-163%, 36-104% and 89-273%, respectively, compared with conventional flat planting (control). RFMs significantly shortened the vegetative period while prolonging the reproductive period. The net economic output under RFMs was 74-165% higher than that of the control. Grass straw mulching achieved the highest economic output to input ratio, almost 45% higher than plastic film mulching, despite the former harvested only 82% of the maximum field productivity of the latter. Compared with the control, grass straw mulching promoted the contents of soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and C:N ratio by 14%, 8% and 5%, respectively, while obviously decreased values of these parameters were observed under plastic mulching.
   CONCLUSIONS Through reducing soil water loss, and improving rainwater use efficiency and soil quality, ridge-furrow grass straw mulching would be a sustainable option for boosting field productivity and thus ensuring local food security in rainfed agricultural areas of Kenya.

TI Fonio (Digitaria exilis (Kippist) Stapf): A Socially Embedded Cereal for
   Food and Nutrition Security in Senegal
SO ETHNOBIOLOGY LETTERS
AB Agricultural diversification with neglected and underutilized species is a viable way to sustainably increase the productivity of agrosystems. Understanding the social, cultural, and ecological roles of these species is crucial for their promotion. White fonio (Digitaria exilis), a neglected cereal endemic to West African Sahelian countries, is recognized as a crop for the future due to its cultural, nutritional, and economic values. In this study, we described fonio farming systems in Senegal through an ethnobotanical approach. As expected in family farming systems, farmers largely practiced diversified subsistence agriculture on small plots and relied on local seed exchange networks. The importance of fonio varied among agroecological zones, ethnic groups, and gender. In the Groundnut Basin, where agriculture is more mechanized, late-maturing landraces of fonio are cultivated as a cash crop rather than a staple crop. However, in southern Senegal, where food shortages are recurrent, fonio is more widespread and the cultivation of both early- and late-maturing landraces contributes to local food security. These differences also reflect the cultural status of fonio: different among ethnic groups and more important for women than for men. Finally, the regressive dynamics of fonio cultivation in most regions emphasizes the need to develop integrated conservation and promotion strategies that take into account the diversity of social and agronomical roles of the plant.

AB The grain and sugarcane industries are the dominant cropping enterprises in Australia. Both are facing similar problems in maintaining productivity and profitability, although the management practices employed to achieve these objectives in the two industries differ markedly. The farming systems of both industries have evolved in recent years as our understanding of the physical and chemical benefits of practices like residue retention, reduced tillage and controlled traffic have improved. However the impact of such practices is often evaluated in terms of cost savings, operational efficiencies and efficient capture and use of water.
   Soil health has not always been an important consideration in system change in either industry, with the exception that crop rotation has always been recognised as important in minimising the impact of soil-borne pathogens. Rotations have been a key feature of grain cropping systems and short duration legume fallows are becoming more prevalent in the sugar industry after more than 25 years of monocultures. However, intensification of cropping in recent years has meant that the pasture leys that were once a dominant component of the grain rotation systems are increasingly being supplanted by short duration cropping breaks with grain legume or other non-cereal crops.
   Soil organic C has generally been recognised as an important component of soil fertility, but more for the role it plays in soil physical and chemical fertility. Links between organic matter status and soil biological health, and particularly to farming system viability and sustainability, have proven difficult to quantify. This has been partly due to a lack of tools or criteria for monitoring relevant soil properties and also to our limited understanding of the interactions between soil health and other system components. However recent studies are suggesting that the amount and quality of organic matter returned as roots and residues, and the placement of that residue relative to areas of future crop root activity, may be significant factors in the sustainable farming systems of the future.
   This paper identifies key issues associated with current and developing fanning systems in the grain and sugar industries in Australia, and assesses the impact of management practices employed in those systems on soil health. It also identifies some key challenges facing soil biologists and farming systems researchers who are trying to achieve improvements in soil health and sustainability. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI Integration of conservation agriculture in smallholder farming systems
   of southern Africa: identification of key entry points
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB A component-omission experiment based on the principle of conservation agriculture (CA) was established on smallholder farms for three seasons in Murehwa and Hwedza districts, Zimbabwe; Barue district in Mozambique; Balaka district and Chitedze Research Station in Malawi, and Monze district in Zambia to identify strategies for improving crop productivity and livelihoods for smallholder farmers. The objective of the experiment was to evaluate the effect of tillage, residue retention, fertiliser application and weed control on maize yield. In addition, the study analysed possible combinations of these factors that could provide a sustainable entry point for intensification through CA. Results showed that fertilisation had the strongest effect on crop yield in both tillage systems; adequate fertilisation is therefore key to success in CA. Retention of crop harvest residues increased yield in no-tillage systems; no-tillage without residues depressed yield by 50% when compared with yields of conventional tillage. A step-wise integration of CA into the smallholder farming systems is proposed as a possible strategy to avoid new constraints on smallholder farms. If resources are limiting, farmers may apply all principles on small areas to overcome the initial demand in resources (labour, fertiliser and residues), and once productivity is raised, they can expand.

TI Typology, Structural Characterization and Sustainability of Integrated
   Broiler Farming System in Epirus, Greece
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The aim of this study was the detailed characterization of the existing zootechnical and financial management applied in broiler poultry farms in the Region of Epirus, Greece. The current situation was captured through the formation of a typology on the structural characterization of broiler farming system. The variables were recorded based on data from a stratified random sample according to Neyman's methodology of 110 poultry farms. In the typology, hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to identify differences between farms and to support most of this differentiation. Chebyshev distance was used to maximize the effect of the cluster elements distance, as well as Ward's clustering method, which aims to achieve greater homogeneity within the clusters. Bonferroni multiple comparison tests were used to evaluate the differences. Four clusters of different farm types were identified from the hierarchical cluster analysis. In conclusion, the production system of broiler farms in Epirus is intensive, especially in large farms that have made significant investments in fixed capital and implement successful management. However, the poultry sector in Epirus has further margin for improvement in both its productivity and profitability.

TI Technological Approaches to Sustainable Agriculture at a Crossroads: An
   Agroecological Perspective
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Most efforts to improve agricultural production remain focused on practices driven by an intensification agenda and not by an agroecological one. Agroecology transcends the reformist notion of organic agriculture and sustainable intensification proponents who contend that changes can be achieved within the dominant agroindustrial system with minor adjustments or "greening" of the current neoliberal agricultural model. In the technological realm, merely modifying practices to reduce input use is a step in the right direction but does not necessarily lead to the redesign of a more self sufficient and autonomous farming system. A true agroecological technological conversion calls into question monoculture and the dependency on external inputs. Traditional farming systems provide models that promote biodiversity, thrive without agrochemicals, and sustain year-round yields. Conversion of conventional agriculture also requires major social and political changes which are beyond the scope of this paper.

   Potential Maize Yield under Maize-Legume Farming Systems in East Africa
SO AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB Agroecological farming systems such as maize-legume intercropping (MLI) and push-pull technology (PPT) have been introduced to mitigate losses from pests. Nevertheless, the regionwide maize yield gained from practicing such farming systems remains largely unknown. This study compares the performance of two uncomplex and interpretable models, namely the hybrid fuzzy-logic combined with the genetic algorithm and symbolic regression, to predict maize yield. Specifically, the study adopted the best-fitting model to map the potential maize yield under MLI and PPT compared to the monocropping system in East Africa using climatic and edaphic variables. The best model, i.e., the symbolic regression model, accurately fitted the maize yield data as indicated by the low root mean square error (RMSE < 0.09) and the higher R-2 (>0.9). The study estimated that East African farmers would increase their annual maize yield by about 1.01 and 1.96 rates under MLI and PPT, respectively. Furthermore, the results showed a fairly good modelling performance as indicated by low standard deviations (range of 0.70-1.1) and skewness (absolute range of 0.03-0.09) values. The study guides the upscaling of MLI and PPT systems through awareness creation and public-private partnerships to ensure increased adoption of these sustainable farming practices.

TI Geographic distribution and environmental characterization of livestock
   production systems in Eastern Africa
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB The central role played by livestock in the livelihoods of rural households in the developing world is seldom fully appreciated by policy makers, development agencies and donors. Knowledge gaps in the geographic distribution and environmental determinants of farming systems, especially if viewed through the livestock lens, compound this problem. We have produced a map of pastoral, agro-pastoral and mixed farming systems across Eastern Africa, by analysing datasets collected in the framework of livelihood analysis. Input data were gathered between 2000 and 2007 by various emergency and development agencies for Djibouti, Eritrea, Kenya. Somalia, Uganda and parts of Ethiopia and Sudan. A quantitative definition of the production systems is adopted, based on the ratio of livestock- to crop-derived income. The resulting livelihood-based map of livestock production systems was compared through correspondence analysis to an alternative livestock production systems map, produced independently from environmental data. Convergence between the two mapping approaches was evident. The geographic distribution of the livestock production systems was also modelled using multivariate analysis of remotely sensed and other geospatial datasets. Models show high statistical accuracy, and were thus used to fill the gaps in the observed distribution of livestock production systems. Finally, selected environmental factors underpinning the systems (agro-climatology, human and livestock populations and land cover) were analysed in detail, enabling the livestock production systems to be characterized in terms of them. The regional scope of the map, as well as its direct link with a vast amount of livelihood information, render it a valuable tool for a range of development and research applications, including those related to global change.

SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB The Sustainable Agriculture Farming Systems project (SAFS) was established in 1988 to study the transition from conventional to low-input and organic crop production practices. The project includes four-year crop rotations under conventional (conv-4), low-input, and organic management and a conventionally managed, two-year rotation (conv-2). Positive effects on soil quality resulting from low-input and organic management include increased soil organic matter, a reduction in soil-borne diseases, increased pools of P and K, higher microbial biomass and activity, an increase in mobile humic acids and increased water infiltration rates and soil water-holding capacity. Pesticide use in the low-input cropping system is about 25% of that used in the conventional systems. The most profitable farming system continues to be the conv-2 system due to the greater frequency of tomato in that rotation. Among the four-year rotations, the organic system, in which the produce commands premium prices, is the most profitable, although least profitable if premium prices are not applied. Information generated from SAFS research has been disseminated via videotape, workshops, annual field days, field tours, educational materials, peer-reviewed articles and an Internet homepage. Future challenges for the SAFS project include development of reduced-tillage and cover crop management strategies to optimize N availability following cash crops; weed management in organic and low-input systems, improvement of water-use efficiency in alternative systems and sequestration of C in the soil.

TI Food and Energy Production from Biomass in an Integrated Farming System
SO SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE REVIEWS 14: AGROECOLOGY AND GLOBAL CHANGE
SE Sustainable Agriculture Reviews
AB This chapter describes experiences in a small farm in the Colombian foothills, in which the aim was to demonstrate - and at the same time to research - the major components of the strategy that should underpin all future farming systems: namely the need to "decarbonize" the system, by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, generating electricity locally from natural resources, making maximum use of solar energy and ensuring there is no conflict between use of available resources for both food and fuel production. The inevitable decline in the production of oil (peak oil), which will have negative effects on all features of contemporary lifestyles, is viewed from the positive standpoint of the opportunities that will be created for more sustainable farming systems when solar energy, via the production of biomass, will be the basis of the required needs for food, feed and fuel energy.
   It is argued that in such a scenario, small scale integrated family farms, will have comparative advantages - economic, social and environmental - in a world in the decline phase of the oil age and increasing dependence on solar energy. Transport is the major end user of fossil fuel, thus as the supply of this resource diminishes and the price increases, there will be advantages in decentralization and localization of both production and processing of the immediate products of photosynthesis which are of low bulk density and therefore expensive to transport. An analysis of the alternative technologies for production of fuel energy from biomass, as a component of a farming system, leads to the conclusion that gasification is the most appropriate route. The advantages of this process are that: the feedstock is the fibrous parts of plants which are not viable sources of food or feed. The energy used to drive the process is derived from the combustion of the feedstock and there is minimal input of external sources of energy, (mainly for the construction of the gasifier and associated machinery). The products of gasification are a combustible gas and a carbon-rich residue (biochar). The gas can be used to drive an internal combustion engine linked to an alternator producing electricity; while the biochar when returned to the soil can be a sink for sequestering carbon and a means of improving soil fertility.
   The role of livestock in the farming system is emphasized as the means of optimizing the use of highly productive perennial crops such as sugar cane and multi-purpose trees. Sugar cane is easily separated into energy-rich juice which can replace cereal grains in feeding of pigs and residual bagasse which is one of the feed-stocks of the gasifier. Forage trees are the natural feed resources for goats which selectively consume the leaves, leaving the fibrous stems as another feedstock for gasification. Sugar cane juice contains no fibre and almost no protein which creates opportunities for use of vegetative sources of protein such as the foliage of perennial plants, among which Taro (Colocacia esculenta) and New Cocoyam (Xanthosoma sagittifolium) have been found to have many advantages. It is concluded that integrated, small scale, farming systems based around multi-purpose crops and livestock, can provide food, feed and fuel energy with no conflict among these end uses. Gasification of fibrous crop residues produces electricity and a soil conditioner (biochar) that is also a sink for sequestration of atmospheric carbon. Bio-digestion of all liquid wastes produces a gaseous fuel for cooking with alternative use as a complement to the gaseous fuel from the gasifier. The system delivers real benefits for the environment as a negative carbon footprint through carbon sequestration and improvements in soil fertility.

TI Abundance and diversity of Carabidae (Coleoptera) in different farming
   systems
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB Commercial farms were examined in western Canada to assess the impact of two cropping systems (annual-grain and diversified grain-forage) and two input systems (high level and organic) on carabid beetles.
   Pitfall traps were used to sample beetles over 3 years (1994-1996). Results showed that five species of Carabidae dominated the 51 species captured (Bembidion quadrimaculatum (LeConte), Bembidion obscurellum (Motschulsky), Agonum placidum (Say), Amara littoralis (Mannerheim), Bembidion nitidum (Kirby)). The annual-grain system was found to support greater species diversity than the diversified grain-forage system but there was no significant difference in the mean abundance. There were no significant differences between species diversity or mean abundance in high input versus organic systems.
   An inventory of carabids associated with specific agricultural production systems in Saskatchewan was developed, based on data collection and evaluation by crop, pest, economic and soil scientists, which are intended to monitor long-term sustainable agricultural production systems.

TI Integrated nutrient management: An overview of principles, problems and
   possibilities
SO ANNALS OF ARID ZONE
AB The common concept of fertilization should be widened into the more comprehensive concept of nutrient management being integrated with other production factors. On the basis of nutrient flows and cycles, and in order to reach the yield potential under the prevailing growth conditions, this includes better use of the different nutrient sources, the adaptation of crop rotations to nutrient supply, the consideration of soil heterogeneity and optimum nutrition of crops for better product quality and resistance, finally also prevention of avoidable nutrient losses. Different farming systems require different nutrient management provisions. Exploiting cropping is still widely used, but should be replaced by sustainable agriculture at low, medium or high yield level (depending on general growth conditions). The regional nutrient transfer (natural or by trade, e.g., into cities) and the global nutrient export pose special nutrient management problems. Due to future shortages of some nutrients there will be conflicting objectives, and it will probably be necessary to adapt food demands (via population number) to the resources available, not only for some countries but on a global scale.

TI Farm typology analysis and technology assessment: An application in an
   arid region of South Asia
SO LAND USE POLICY
AB The design and diffusion of context-specific technologies is centrally important in the multi-dimensional, complex farming systems in arid and semi-arid regions. This paper uses a mixed-method framework to characterize the complexity and heterogeneity of smallholder farming systems and identifies constraints to and opportunities for sustainable intensification. Specifically, the study: (i) characterized farm household typologies based on the diversity of livelihood assets; (ii) co-designed context- specific interventions through an iterative participatory process; and (iii) ex-ante evaluated such interventions to inform multiple stakeholders. We explored farming system diversity using data from 224 farm households in western Rajasthan, India. Employing multivariate statistical techniques and participatory validation, we identified 7 distinct farm household types. Participatory appraisal with multiple stakeholders revealed heterogeneity across farm household types. For instance, the interest of farmers in integrating perennial fruit trees even among the rainfed farm household types markedly varied: household type 1 preferred the multipurpose forestry tree, khejri which requires low labor inputs; household type 2 preferred market-oriented horticulture production; household type 3 did not opt for perennials but for small ruminants; and household type 4 (dominated by women) opted for small horticulture kitchen gardens. The study demonstrated the utility of a mixed-methods approach that addresses multi-dimensional heterogeneity to generate insights and assist in co-designing locally appropriate technologies across different farm types and agro-ecological regions to achieve sustainable intensification.

TI INFLUENCE OF ECOLOGICAL AND QUALITY CONCERNS ON THE ADOPTION INTENTION
   OF ENVIRONMENT-SMART AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
SO APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Within the framework of the theory of planned behavior, this paper explores whether farmers who plant high-priced tea accept an alternative farming system out of concern for the environment and product quality. In total, 253 tea farmers in Taiwan was interviewed, and their data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Statistical results indicated that the environmental concerns and quality considerations of tea farmers influence their behavioral intentions toward the adoption of new technology systems. Other social and economic variables, such as government subsidies, professional counseling, organization promotion, and community network, also affect their decision-making intention. Farmers with heterogeneous expectations of the new farming system must be considered in these analytical strategies. Based on the respondents' attitudes, effective promotion and implementation can be designed more specifically to target farmers' adoption intention by addressing ecological and product quality concerns.

AB Studies related to factors influencing sheep welfare are not or are relatively recently performed, as well as studied on strategies aimed at minimisation of adverse effects of the environment and improper management practices on welfare of sheep. The present overview discusses the main critical points influencing sheep welfare in intensive and extensive farming systems as follows: extreme climatic conditions and seasonal fluctuations in sward quality and quantity, too little space and inadequate layout of premises along with poor control on microclimate, inadequate milking systems and underestimated role of human-animal relationships. Parameters essential for the practice with respect to evaluation of the degree of satisfaction of biological needs of animals, e.g. welfare level in line with the latest global achievements are analysed.

TI Diversification of an integrated crop-livestock system: Agroecological
   and food production assessment at farm scale
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB Mixed farming systems are of interest in the search for sustainability because of their species diversity and the potential for synergy from integrating crops with livestock. However, their ability to maximize food production has been little addressed in the literature and deserves to be explored further. The issue of nutrient recycling raises questions about resource allocation between food crops, feed and animal products. This study, based on a whole farm system experiment conducted for approximately fifteen years in northeastern France, assesses the biotechnical processes and food production performance of two integrated mixed system configurations. These configurations differed both in their types of production (diversity in both livestock and crops) and in their overall strategies (striving for self-sufficiency vs. maximizing food-crop output). Taking a metabolic approach, the study evaluates biotechnical processes (by ecological network analysis and nutrient balances) and food production efficiency. Our results show that the configuration geared to maximizing food production is not the more productive but is the more efficient. In both cases, efficiency at the farm system scale is better than the efficiencies of each production. This confirms the importance of combining systemic and analytical approaches to better understand and act on the development of agroecological farming systems. We also show the importance, for a self-sufficient system, of having stocks in reserve to cope with unfavorable years. Finally, our study confirms the value of integrated mixed farming systems in terms of agroecology but highlights the need for (i) a closer consideration of their food production aspect and (ii) an analysis of the temporal dynamics of agrosystems and the trade-offs between food production and nutrient cycling.

TI Development of livestock production in the tropics: farm and farmers '
   perspectives
SO ANIMAL
AB Because of an increasing demand for animal-source foods, an increasing desire to reduce poverty and an increasing need to reduce the environmental impact of livestock production, tropical farming systems with livestock must increase their productivity. An important share of the global human and livestock populations are found within smallholder mixed-crop-livestock systems, which should, therefore, contribute significantly towards this increase in livestock production. The present paper argues that increased livestock production in smallholder mixed-crop-livestock systems faces many constraints at the level of the farm and the value chain. The present paper aims to describe and explain the impact of increased production from the farm and farmers' perspective, in order to understand the constraints for increased livestock production. A framework is presented that links farming systems to livestock value chains. It is concluded that farming systems that pass from subsistence to commercial livestock production will: (1) shift from rural to urban markets; (2) become part of a different value chain (with lower prices, higher demands for product quality and increased competition from peri-urban producers and imports); and (3) have to face changes in within-farm mechanisms and crop-livestock relationships. A model study showed that feed limitation, which is common in tropical farming systems with livestock, implies that maximum herd output is achieved with small herd sizes, leaving low-quality feeds unutilised. Maximal herd output is not achieved at maximal individual animal output. Having more animals than required for optimal production - which is often the case as a larger herd size supports non-production functions of livestock, such as manure production, draught, traction and capital storage - goes at the expense of animal-source food output. Improving low-quality feeds by treatment allows keeping more animals while maintaining the same level of production. Ruminant methane emission per kg of milk produced is mainly determined by the level of milk production per cow. Part of the methane emissions, however, should be attributed to the non-production functions of ruminants. It was concluded that understanding the farm and farmers' perceptions of increased production helps with the understanding of productivity increase constraints and adds information to that reported in the literature at the level of technology, markets and institutions.

TI Introducing cash crops in shifting cultivation regions - the experience
   with cardamom in Laos
SO AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB Farmers are often blamed for destroying the tropical forest, especially in Laos. Converting shifting cultivation into cash crop based agriculture is frequently presented as the solution for merging forest protection and poverty alleviation, but many attempts have ended in failure. A rural development project has attempted to introduce medicinal cardamom (Amomum villosum) cultivation in the notably remote region of Phongsaly (northern Laos), for export to China. With nearly 300 ha planted, the crop now involves about 75% of the farmers in the region. Farmers fitted cardamom into their farming system, to suit their needs for sustainability with a crop compatible with existing practices. Results indicate that introducing a cash crop into a shifting cultivation region is possible if a greater attention is paid to: (i) appraise how the new crop fits into the farming systems; (ii) prioritise economic issues over agronomic matters, in particular identify markets, traders or commercial risks.

TI How farming systems simulation can aid the development of more
   sustainable smallholder farming systems in southern Africa
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
AB Over the past 20 years, farming systems modelling has become an accessible tool for developing intervention strategies targeted at smallholder farmers in southern Africa. Applying the Agricultural Productions Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to credibly simulate key soil and crop processes in highly constrained, low yielding maize/legume systems has led to four distinct modes of use: (i) to add value to field experimentation and demonstration; (ii) in direct engagement with farmers: (iii) to explore key system constraints and opportunities with researchers and extension agencies; and (iv) in the generation of information for policy makers. bankers and insurance institutions. Examples of application in each of these modes are presented. Despite being demonstrated as an excellent tool for developing intervention strategies and extension material, the use Of Simulation is limited by a lack of competent local users. Better co-operation within the simulation community, sharing of climate, soil and crop parameterisation and validation datasets, and focussing of efforts on using models to benefit smallholder farmers are suggested as ways of increasing the use and relevance of simulation. Substantial investment in the training of agriculturalists and the further science development of systems simulation is required to tackle the enormous challenges facing agricultural development in the region.

TI Farming systems dynamics: Impact of increasing population density and
   the availability of land resources on changes in agricultural systems.
   The case of Sukumaland, Tanzania
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB The changes in agricultural production systems over the period 1875 till 1990 have been analysed for three districts belonging to Sukumaland, Tanzania. The analysis is based on historic information for the early period, on data from agricultural studies conducted in 1945 and 1961, and on recent field studies in 1990-1992.
   Increasing population densities and therefore decreasing availability of agricultural land per capita has occurred generally. In addition, there exist important agro-ecological differences between the three districts that have also been responsible for the present diversity in farming systems. Among these, differences in rainfall and the relative availability, quality and type of land resources, as related to toposequential land units, are of major significance. Together these factors determined the potential and subsequently the changes that have occurred during the past 50 years in the major land use systems and crops for the various parts of Sukumaland.
   In anticipating the direction of agricultural developments and consequently the sustainability of actual and future agricultural systems, differences in the principle agro-ecological factors of soils in relation to the topography (landscape units) should be considered more closely. Such information should be used to complement the broad socio-economic considerations on which most policy decisions, including development aid, are currently based.

Over three years, data on performance, management and feeding were collected on the farms and feed samples were collected and analyzed. First analyses show that on average the organic farms have a significantly higher longevity (39 month) and grazing time (2510 h*a(-1)) than the conventional farms. On the other hand, mean milk yields (6478 kg*cow(-1)*a(-1)) and lifetime efficiency (10.3 kg*cow(-1)*a(-1)) are significantly lower on the organic farms. In both farming systems lifetime efficiency significantly decreases with increasing age at first calving (p<0.05). Further analyses shall highlight influences of farm management on the GHG balance of dairy farms and illustrate optimisation potential.

TI Yield and Nutritional Quality of Vesuvian Piennolo Tomato PDO as
   Affected by Farming System and Biostimulant Application
SO AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB Scientific investigations are being increasingly devoted to biostimulant effects on vegetable yield and quality, with the perspective of sustainable crop management. Two farming systems (conventional or organic) in factorial combination with two biostimulant treatments (tropical plant extract (PE); legume-derived protein hydrolysate (PH)) plus a non-treated control were compared in terms of tomato fruit yield, yield components, mineral composition, functional and nutritional indicators. PE- and PH-based biostimulants resulted in higher plant biomass, PH even in higher leaf area index, compared to non-treated control. Marketable yield was not significantly affected by farming system. PH and PE gave higher yield than non-treated control. PH treatment led to higher fruit number than the control, whereas PE incurred significant increase in yield only under organic farming. The mean fruit weight attained the highest value upon PE application under conventional management. Colour component a* (redness) was higher with the conventional system compared to the organic one, whereas an opposite trend was shown by the organic acids malate, oxalate and isocitrate. Irrespective of the farming system, the soluble solids, fruit brightness (L*) and redness as well as the target organic acids malate, oxalate, citrate and isocitrate were significantly higher than untreated plants by 10.1%, 16.1%, 19.8%, 18.9%, 12.1%, 13.5% and 26.8%, respectively, with no significant differences between the PH- and PE-based biostimulants. Higher lipophilic activity and total ascorbic acid concentration but lower lycopene were recorded under organic management. PE and PH application resulted in higher total phenol and ascorbic acid as well as in lycopene content, and lipophilic antioxidant activity than the non-treated control. Biostimulants proved to be an effective sustainable tool for enhancing tomato fruit yield and functional quality both under conventional and organic vegetable systems.

TI Perennial wheat: a review of environmental and agronomic prospects for
   development in Australia
SO CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE
AB Perennial wheat could improve grain production systems in Australia by rectifying many environmental problems such as hydrological imbalance, nutrient losses, soil erosion, and declining soil carbon and soil health. There are also potential direct production benefits from reduced external inputs, providing extra grazing for livestock in mixed farming systems, as well as benefits for whole-farm management which may offset lower grain yields. In addition to universal issues of domestication and breeding of perennial wheat, specific challenges for perennial wheat in Australia's dryland systems will include tolerance of water deficit and poor soil environments, and the risks of hosting foliar pathogens over summer. Temperate perennial forage grasses could indicate the potential distribution and traits required in perennial wheat adapted to more arid environments (e.g. summer dormancy). Several Australian native and exotic perennial relatives of wheat could also provide sources of disease resistance, and tolerance of soil acidity, drought, salinity and waterlogging. Still, several farming systems could accommodate perennial wheat with inconsistent persistence in some environments. While developing perennial wheat will be challenging, there is significant opportunity in Australia for perennial wheat to diversify current cropping options. The risks may be minimised by staged investment and interim products with some immediate applications could be produced along the way.

TI Which rice farming system is more environmentally friendly in Khuzestan
   province, Iran? A study based on emergy analysis
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB This research was conducted with the aim of (i) evaluating the sustainability of three rice production systems (DBS: dry bed seeding, TP: transplanting, and WBS: wet bed seeding) in Khuzestan province, Iran, (ii) introducing the most cost-effective and sustainable system, and (iii) providing solutions to increase the systems' sustain-ability and efficiency. In order to analyze the studied systems during the 2020-2021 growing season, several emergy-based and economic indicators were analyzed. The total emergy inputs supporting the systems are estimated to be 2.69E+16, 4.16E+16, and 3.17E+16 sej ha(-1) yr(-1) for DBS, TP, and WBS, respectively. The three studied farming systems were determined to be inefficient and unsustainable due to their reliance on purchased resources including labor, fossil fuel, and seed/transplant. According to the environmental loading ratio and modified environmental loading ratio indicators, the WBS and TP systems exerted less pressure on ecosystems and were more sustainable than the DBS system due to the greater quantity of purchased renewable flows (labor and seed/transplant). The results of the emergy renewability, emergy sustainability index, and modified emergy sustainability index indices indicated that the three investigated systems were not sustainable, indicating that high energy consumption in rice farming systems resulted in a significant environmental burden. The economic analysis of rice production systems revealed that the DBS system was economically superior due to its lower total production costs, especially labor costs, when compared with the other two systems. In light of the water scarcity crisis in Iran, the DBS method is recommended due mainly because of its ability to save 30-60% of irrigation water in the studied areas compared with the other two systems that have high water consumption. Due to the lower sustainability and greater environmental pressure of the DBS method compared with the two studied farming systems, it is also recommended to decrease the proportion of nonrenewable inputs (fossil fuel, chemical fertilizers, and herbicides) and increase the proportion of renewable inputs (organic fertilizer).

TI Designing agroecological transitions; A review
SO AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Concerns about the negative impacts of productivist agriculture have led to the emergence of two forms of ecological modernisation of agriculture. The first, efficiency-substitution agriculture, aims to improve input use efficiency and to minimise environmental impacts of modern farming systems. It is currently the dominant modernisation pathway. The second, biodiversity-based agriculture, aims to develop ecosystem services provided by biological diversity. It currently exists only as a niche. Here we review challenges of implementing biodiversity-based agriculture: managing, at the local level, a consistent transition within and among farming systems, supply chains and natural resource management. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of existing conceptual frameworks developed to analyse farming, socialecological and socio-technical systems. Then we present an integrative framework tailored for structuring analysis of agriculture from the perspective of developing a territorial biodiversity-based agriculture. In addition, we propose a participatory methodology to design this agroecological transition at the local level. This design methodology was developed to support a multi-stakeholder arena in analysing the current situation, identifying future exogenous changes and designing (1) targeted territorial biodiversity-based agriculture, (2) the pathway of the transition and (3) the required adaptive governance structures and management strategies. We conclude by analysing key challenges of designing such a complex transition, developing multi-actor and multidomain approaches based on a combination of scientific and experiential knowledge and on building suitable boundary objects (computer-based and conceptual models, indicators, etc.) to assess innovative systems designed by stakeholders.

TI Review: Redesigning Canadian prairie cropping systems for profitability,
   sustainability, and resilience
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE
AB Redesign of agricultural systems according to ecological principles has been proposed for the development of sustainable systems. We review a wide variety of ecologically based crop production practices, including crop varieties and genetic diversity, crop selection and rotation, cover crops, annual polyculture, perennial forages, perennial grains, agroforestry systems, reducing tillage, use of animal manures and green manures, soil biological fertility, organic production systems, integrated crop-livestock systems, and purposeful design of farm landscapes (farmscaping), and discuss their potential role in enhancing the profitability, environmental sustainability, and resilience of Canadian prairie cropping systems. Farming systems that most closely mimic natural systems through appropriate integration of diverse components, within a context of supportive social and economic structures, appear to offer the greatest potential benefits, while creating a framework in which to place all other farming practices. Our understanding of ecological relationships within agricultural systems is currently lacking, and a major shift in research, education, and policy will be required to purposefully and proactively redesign Canadian prairie agricultural systems for long-term sustainability.

TI Structuring Markets for Resilient Farming Systems
SO AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Diversified farms have received considerable attention for their potential to contribute to environmentally sustainable, resilient, and socially just food systems. In response, some governments are building new forms of public support for social-ecological services through the creation of mediated markets, such as targeted public food procurement programs. Here, we examine the relationship between farmer participation in Brazil's National School Feeding Program and farm diversification and household autonomy, as key indicators of farm household resilience. We hypothesized that two key features of the food procurement programstructured demand for diversified food products, and a price premium for certified organic and agroecological productionwould increase farm-level agrobiodiversity and the use of agroecological practices. We designed a comparative study between family farmers who do, and do not, participate in Brazil's National School Feeding Program in the plateau region of Santa Catarina in Southern Brazil. We used semi-structured surveys to collect data on farm agrobiodiversity, management practices, and farm household autonomy, and we conducted land use history assessments. Here, we suggest for the first time that the National School Feeding Program played a role in driving the following: (1) transitions on family farms from low agrobiodiversity, input-intensive farming systems to diversified farming systems (i.e., horticultural production) and (2) a significant increase in the cropped area under diversified farming systems. This transition was supported by making horticultural production an economically viable alternative to field crops typically linked to volatile, unpredictable markets. The convergence of public policies supporting mediated markets, increased farm household autonomy, and farm diversification represents an integrated mechanism with the potential to enhance food system resilience.

TI Farm-level assessment of the nutrient balance in northern Nigeria
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
CT Conference on Soil Fertility Management in Sub-Saharan Africa
CY FEB, 1997
CL NAIROBI, KENYA
AB The farming system of the Kano close-settled zone, northern Nigeria, is known for its longevity and continued productivity in spite of population increases in the area. Mounting circumstantial evidence has led to its reputation of being 'sustainable'. Rural population density in this region now exceeds 300 km(-2), and almost all land (86.4%) is under annual cultivation. It is generally believed that such an intensive fanning system is only possible under high input levels. This study set out to determine the nutrient balance to see if the system really was sustainable. Agronomic and soil fertility management practices were monitored on three farms over a two year period. Inputs and outputs measured at the field level included fertilizer use (manure and inorganic), dry deposition, biological N fixation, and the harvest of crops and hedgerow products. The results indicate great variability among fields, farmers, and years, and showed that the N balance was strongly negative, whereas P, K, and Mg balances were close to zero. The Ca balance was quite positive as a result of dry deposition. The study also quantified nutrient dynamics within the farming system, highlighting, (1) the role of leguminous crops in bringing in N through fixation, and as a source of fodder for small ruminants, (2) the role of small ruminants in converting cop residues into manure, and (3) the input of nutrients through dry deposition.

TI Emergy Evaluation of three Rice Wetland Farming Systems in the Taihu
   Lake Catchment of China
SO WETLANDS
AB Emergy analysis was performed to evaluate the sustainability of three rice farming systems (rice mono-cropping, rice-fish and rice-duck farming systems) in the Jiangsu province. The results showed that the three systems exhibit unique characteristics on each component. The emergy of rice seeding and the labour input were the most important costs, at 57.18 and 18.20 sej/ha/season, respectively, for the rice mono-cropping system. In the rice-fish and rice-duck systems, the feed input played a more important role, corresponding to values of 63.70 and 79.20 sej/ha/season, respectively. The machinery input was 45.21 sej/ha/season for the rice-fish system due to the construction of fish ponds and ditches. The rice-duck system exhibited lower environmental loading and a higher sustainability index than the rice mono-cropping and rice-fish systems, respectively. The ratios of the economic input to output were 0.41, 0.61 and 0.41 for the rice mono-cropping, rice-fish and rice-duck systems, respectively. The net profit of the rice-duck system was $3264.2 per hectare, which was nearly 40% higher than those of the other systems. Based on the results showing the highest economic efficiency and value on the sustainability index, the rice-duck system may be the optimal rice agriculture system from both ecological and economic perspectives.

TI Evidence of varietal adaptation to organic farming systems
SO FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
AB Consumer demand regarding the impacts of conventional agriculture on the environment and human health have spurred the growth of organic farming systems; however, organic agriculture is often criticized as low-yielding and unable to produce enough food to supply the world's population. Using wheat as a model crop species, we show that poorly adapted cultivars are partially responsible for the lower yields often found in organic farming systems when compared with conventional farming systems. Our results demonstrate that the highest yielding soft white winter wheat genotypes in conventional systems are not the highest yielding genotypes in organic systems. An analysis of variance for yield among 35 genotypes between paired organic and conventional systems showed highly significant (P < 0.001) genotype x system interactions in four of five locations. Genotypic ranking analysis using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (R-S) showed no correlation between genotypic rankings for yield in four of five locations; however, the ranks were correlated for test weight at all five locations. This indicates that increasing yield in organic systems through breeding will require direct selection within organic systems rather than indirect selection in conventional systems. Direct selection in organic systems produced yields 15%, 7%, 31% and 5% higher than the yields resulting from indirect selection for locations 1-4, respectively. With crop cultivars bred in and adapted to the unique conditions inherent in organic systems, organic agriculture will be better able to realize its full potential as a high-yielding alternative to conventional agriculture.

TI Using a positive deviance approach to inform farming systems redesign: A
   case study from Bihar, India
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB Improving farming systems in resource-poor contexts is often difficult as farmers face multiple challenges to implement the innovations developed by researchers. Viable solutions may however be present within local communities by positive deviant farmers, i.e. farmers that outperform positively compared to others. This study develops a positive deviance informed methodology to support redesign of farming systems, with the aim to improve farm productive, economic and environmental performances. We tested the methodology in Bihar, India, using survey data from 43 farms and the indicators of operating profit, soil organic matter balance, water use and dietary energy production. Positive deviant farms and practices were first identified and then recombined into a redesigned farm in consultation with farmers. The FarmDESIGN model was used to calculate current farm performance and to explore potential alternative farm configurations in the redesign. We found that outstanding performance on all indicators could only be reached by integrating high livestock density with an optimal combination of crop practices, which confirms the key role of interactions among components in mixed crop-livestock systems to improve all dimensions of farm sustainability. The redesigns outperformed all real farms on the indicators assessed. Farmers confirmed the viability of the redesigns in focus group discussions and their suggestions can serve as useful input for a next cycle of farm redesign. Since all suggestions are locally practiced and have proven to be accessible, affordable and recognizable, we conclude that our methodology based on positive deviant farms and practices yields promising results with a large potential to boost agricultural development for resource-scarce smallholder farmers.

TI Integrated farming system in India: Current status, scope and future
   prospects in changing agricultural scenario
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
AB Small and marginal farmers are the core of the Indian rural economy constituting 85% of the total fanning community but possessing only 44% of the total operational land. Indian agriculture is labour oriented and requires lot of man-power and energy but even after this hard work farmers are not in a position to earn their livelihood, especially small farmers because there is very little left after they pay for all inputs (seeds, livestock breeds, fertilizers, pesticides, energy, feed, labour, etc.). To fulfill basic needs of these farm families including food (cereal, pulses, oilseeds, milk, fruit, honey, meat etc.), feed fodder, fibre and fuel warrant an attention about integrated fanning system (IFS). The emergence of IFS has enabled us to develop a framework for an alternative development model to improve the feasibility of small sized fanning operations in relation to larger ones. IFS refer to agricultural systems that integrate livestock and crop production or integrate fish and livestock and may sometimes be known as integrated bio systems. In this system, an inter-related set of enterprises are used so that the waste from one component becomes an input for other enterprises of the system, which reduces cost and improves production and thereby income. Integrated farming systems seem to be the possible solution to the continuous increase of demand for food and nutrition, income stability and livelihood upliftment particularly for small and marginal farmers with little resources. Based on the research works conducted all over the country, it is clear that crop cultivation alone can't fulfill the demand of food and nutritional requirement and we have to focus on multi-component fanning as it is the only way of efficient resource recycling within the system with increased economic profitability, economic stability, enhanced soil sustainability, and preserving environmental quality and maintaining biological diversity and ecological stability.

AB Meeting the growing demand for animal-sourced food, prompted by population growth and increases in average per-capita income in low-income countries, is a major challenge. Yet, it also presents significant potential for agricultural growth, economic development, and reduction of poverty in rural areas. The main constraints to livestock producers taking advantage of growing markets include; lack of forage and feed gaps, communal land tenure, limited access to land and water resources, weak institutions, poor infrastructure and environmental degradation. To improve rural livelihood and food security in smallholder crop-livestock farming systems, concurrent work is required to address issues regarding efficiency of production, risk within systems and development of whole value chain systems. This paper provides a review of several forage based-studies in tropical and non-tropical dry areas of the developing countries. A central tenet of this paper is that forages have an essential role in agricultural productivity, environmental sustainability and livestock nutrition in smallholder mixed farming systems.

TI Knowns and unknowns of cattle grazing in oil palm plantations. A review
SO AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Population growth and improving living standards are leading to a growing demand for beef. The understorey in the 19 million hectares of oil palm plantation worldwide represent a source of cattle feed, while also sparing additional land conversion for grazing. Research on cattle grazing under oil palm is novel and knowledge is lacking on long-term profitability and sustainability of the system, a major deterrent to cattle-oil palm farming system adoption. Here we review the current literature on cattle grazing in oil palm plantations, to highlight the knowns and unknowns of grazing impacts on the understorey, cattle and oil palm productivity, as well as economic implications. This review's major outcomes are the following: (i) although understorey utilization as feed is a major advantage of cattle-oil palm integrated farming systems, declining understorey productivity under ageing plantation indicates the need for alternative solutions for sustained cattle productivity over the plantation's lifecycle; (ii) oil palm yields were reported to increase under cattle integration but evidence was weak, both oil palm yields and the pathways through which oil palm yields are impacted by cattle grazing should be further explored; (iii) economic analyses showed cattle grazing under oil palm plantations was profitable for large-scale oil palm producers due to cattle sales, and returns were further enhanced by reductions in weeding and fertilizer costs; (iv) sustainable cattle grazing was found to be difficult in smallholder oil palm plantations due to land constraints and the current practice of free-grazing; options for improving grazing sustainability and profitability in these systems should be explored. This systematic review concluded that cattle integration in oil palm plantations has great potential but further research is required to develop locally specific productive and sustainable systems of grazed cattle integration with oil palm plantations.

TI A technique for assessing environmental impact risks of agricultural
   systems
SO RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS
AB Conventional agriculture often aims to achieve high returns without allowing for sustainable natural resource management. To prevent environmental degradation, agricultural systems must be assessed and environmental standards need to be developed. This study used a multi-factor approach to assess the potential environmental impact risk of six diverse systems: five production systems and a successional system or abandoned agronomic field. Assessment factors were soil quality status, amount of pesticide and fertilizer applied and tillage intensity. The assessment identified the best management practices (BMP)-conventional tillage system as a high-risk system mostly because of extensive tillage. The certified organic system was also extensively tilled and was characterized by P build-up in the soil, but performed well based on other assessment factors. Conversely, the BMP-no tillage and the crop-animal integrated system were characterized as low risk mainly because of reduced tillage. The paper discusses assessment strengths and weaknesses, ways to improve indicators used, and the need for additional indicators. We concluded that with further development the technique will become a resourceful tool to promote agricultural sustainability and environmental stewardship and assist policy-making processes.

TI Effect of farming system on meat traits of native Massese suckling lamb
SO ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE
AB Growth performance and meat quality traits of 24 Massese suckling lambs reared up to 69 days of age in different farming systems were evaluated. Three groups were considered: stall (S) reared indoors and fed concentrate and hay; pasture (P) reared outdoor and fed pasture and hay; semi free-range (F) reared indoors during the night and at pasture during the day, fed concentrate, hay and herbage. The lambs remained constantly with their dams for the whole period, having thus always access to mothers' milk. Animals weights were recorded, and, after slaughtering, carcase traits were considered. Fatty acids composition and chemical/physical parameters of milk and meat were analysed. Lambs growth was similar in the first 30 days, while afterwards differences emerged: P lambs recorded the worst values reaching slaughter weight of 14.6 kg versus 22.3 and 22.7 of the S and the F group, respectively. Carcase of P lambs resulted less fat and with a lower lean/bone ratio than the other groups (1.8, 2.1 and 2.3 for P, S and F, respectively). Fatty acids composition of ewes' milk had effect on lambs' meat profile, probably because they continued to suck milk until slaughter. Moreover, also farming system affected fatty acids profile of lambs' meat: grazing animals, especially P, showed the highest PUFA and the lowest SFA percentage and P meat showed the best composition for human health. As regards physical traits, F meat was more coloured than P and S meat, while P meat was less tender than others.

TI Sizing on-farm reservoirs for crop-fish integration in rainfed farming
   systems in eastern India
SO BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
AB For natural resource management and sustainable development of rainfed farming systems, the optimum size of the rainwater storage and recycling processes is essential for mitigating the uncertainty of rainfall. In the present study, a model is developed to predict the optimum size of the on-farm reservoir so as to provide supplemental irrigation to rice in monsoon season, pre-sowing irrigation to mustard in winter and to support fish cultivation in rainfed farming systems in Eastern India. The model is based on water balance approach for both the crop field and the reservoir, where hydro-meteorological parameters and the irrigation management practices are input to the model. The model predicts the reservoir sizes in terms of the percentage of the farm area under unlined and plastic lined conditions for two side slopes (horizontal: vertical) of 1-5:1 and 1:1 and two reservoir depths of 2 and 2.5m. The study reveals that for a 1-5:1 side slope, a return period of 5 yr requires 21.4% and 17.5% of the farm area for the unlined and 17.3% and 13.2% of the farm area for the lined reservoirs for depths of 2 to and 2.5 m, respectively. However, the same return period requires 18-9% and 14.9% of the farm area for the unlined and 14.7% and 10.7% of the farm area for the lined reservoirs at 1:1 side slope with a depth of 2 to and 2.5 m, respectively. Based on the simulated sizes, 1 yr of field experiments are undertaken for the plastic lined and unlined reservoirs with rice-mustard cropping system along with fish cultivation in the reservoirs. Economic analysts of the study reveals the benefit-cost ratio of 1.28 and 1.75, internal rate of return of 18-1% and 29.2% and capital recovery periods of 8 and 5 yr for the unlined and lined reservoir, respectively.

SE Microorganisms for Sustainability
AB Sustainability is the key for continued existence of any civilization. Agriculture may be considered sustainable when the system is resource conserving, socially supportive, commercially competitive, and environmentally sound. In farming systems, microbes play a pivotal role as the main dynamic forces. The health of the planet relies on the development of efficient and sustainable agricultural systems. Soil is the base of many of the biological processes, viz., biological nitrogen fixation, residue decomposition, mineralization/immobilization turnover, nutrient cycling, and denitrification, which are regulated by the microbes. In today's scenario, wherein the addition of chemicals is done to an extreme level, the soil has lost rich flora of beneficial microbes. It is high time to reintroduce environmentally friendly microflora into the field, so as to accomplish the goal of sustainable agriculture. In this chapter we will attempt to explain the application of soil beneficial microbes through traditional and advanced approaches using organic manures in organic farming system so that human race and nature may be benefited by maintaining sustainable agroecosystem.

The potential and importance of fadama agriculture for food production and economic development is crucial, given rising food prices, climatic changes, environmental risks associated with 'modern' agriculture, modelled farming systems and population growth. Fadama areas are therefore of critical importance to the survival and economic development of millions of rural dwellers. This research surveys and analyses the sustainability of fadama farming systems in semi-arid northern Nigeria. Findings reveal a delicate interaction and negotiation across the formal and informal boundaries where traditional agricultural practices, based on an understanding of the particular physical reality and exploitation of natural synergies, are combined with inputs typical of conventional agriculture. African agriculture thus stands poised at a crossroads: whether to abandon tradition in favour of entirely 'modern' methods and export markets as often advocated in certain circles or to depend on time-tested indigenous knowledge systems and grassroots-defined development vision which combines popular livelihoods with respect for nature's systems.

TI Environmental impacts of organic agriculture: A Canadian perspective
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE
AB Lynch, D. 2009. Environmental impacts of organic agriculture: A Canadian perspective. Can. J. Plant Sci. 89: 621-628. Canada, in 2009, will enact a regulatory regime to oversee certified organic agricultural productions systems, based on a management standard. The overreaching goal of that standard is to develop farm enterprises that are "sustainable and harmonious with the environment". However, empirical evidence to shed light on claims of environmental benefits from organic agriculture is particularly scarce in Canada and North America generally, and has not been comprehensively summarized. This review examines the literature of Canadian and US studies which relate to environmental impacts of organic agriculture within the selected indicators of: (i) soil organic matter storage and soil quality/soil health; (ii) plant and wildlife biodiversity; (iii) energy use; (iv) nutrient loading and off-farm nutrient losses; and (v) climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. The empirical evidence presented suggests organic farming system attributes regarding cropping, floral, and habitat diversity, nutrient intensity, soil management, energy and pesticide use, etc., are sufficiently distinct as to impart potentially important environmental benefits across the indicator categories examined. However, on average, crop yields under organic management regimes continue to lag behind those obtained by conventional management systems. More research is needed to validate these results, for the benefit of producers, consumers and policy makers as they decide the relative importance and contribution of organic farming systems to the Canadian food marketplace and agrifood sector.

TI BIODIVERSITY OF SOIL FUNGI ON INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT FARMING SYSTEM
SO AGRIVITA
AB The greatest problem of modern agricultural practices is the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers. It is noted that about 40% of the world's land surface is used for agriculture. The way this agricultural land is managed has a great influence on the global environment. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) farming system produces fewer negative externally affects, can effectively restore ecosystems and deliver well ecosystem services. Depending on methods applied and degree of production, agricultural practices impact biodiversity in the ecosystem and it also influences conservation practices within the ecosystem. The result showed that diversity of soil fungi on IPM was higher than diversity on conventional one. Trichoderma sp. and Acremonium sp. which are known as antagonist fungi were found on IPM but not on conventional one. Domination Index on IPM was lower than conventional field. Bacterial leaf blight (Xanthomonas oryzae) disease intensity showed no difference on both systems. The yield on IPM was higher (6.34 ton/ha) than conventional field (5.56 ton/ha). It has been found that rich biodiversity in agricultural environment improves productivity of agricultural systems. The IPM system gives more regard to the soil fungi biodiversity and considers it as an integrated system upon which the success of the agricultural production depends.

AB Simple Summary
   This study's goal was a thorough analysis and a detailed characterization of commercial snail farms in Greece, considering the unstructured development of the snail-farming sector over recent years. Additionally, the characterization of snail farms in Greece could help Southern European countries improve heliciculture. This study classifies 29 farms in five snail farming systems: elevated sections (7%), net-covered greenhouse (38%), a mixed system with a net-covered greenhouse (10%), open field (38%), and mixed system with an open field (7%). Results showed the impact of various parameters (farming system, region, equipment, and facilities) on annual production. Snail farms were dispersed in six different regions (Thrace, Central Macedonia, West Macedonia, Thessaly, Western Greece, and the Attica Islands). The location affected productivity, but also influenced the duration of operation during an annual cycle.
   In this study, the structural and management characteristics of snail farms in Greece were analyzed to maximize sustainable food production. Objectives, such as the classification of farming systems and assessing the effects of various annual production parameters, were investigated. Data were collected (2017) via a questionnaire, and sampling was conducted in 29 snail farms dispersed in six different regions (Thrace, Central Macedonia, West Macedonia, Thessaly, Western Greece, and the Attica Islands). Descriptive statistics for continuous variables and frequencies for categorical variables were calculated. The similarity between farms was analyzed using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (nMDS). The average farm operation duration exceeded eight months and the mean annual production was 1597 kg of fresh, live snails. Results recorded five farming systems: elevated sections (7%), net-covered greenhouse (38%), a mixed system with a net-covered greenhouse (10%), open field (38%), and mixed system with an open field (7%). Snail farms differ in the type of substrate, available facilities, and equipment (60% similarity between most of the open field farms). The geographical location of a farms' settlement affects productivity but also influences the duration of operation, especially in open field farms, due to their operation under a wide assortment of climatic types.

TI Exploring the emergence and changing dynamics of a new integrated
   rice-crawfish farming system in China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Crop-aquaculture systems are widely adopted around the world as they can provide high protein and energy outputs per unit of land and raise farm incomes, particularly for smallholder farmers. Recently, a new crop-aquaculture system, which combines rice production with crawfish breeding (integrated rice-crawfish farming), has emerged and rapidly expanded in China. However, the spatial extent and temporal dynamics of this integrated farming system largely remain unclear, which prohibits rigorous impact assessments to support its sustainable development. Here we use time series of Landsat satellite data, for the first time, to explore the emergence and the changing dynamics of this rice-crawfish farming system for the period of 2013-2021 in five provinces (805 600 km(2)) of China, where 90% of the global crawfish are produced. Our analysis reveals that the total area of rice-crawfish farming in these five provinces increased steadily from 0.11 Mha in 2013 to 0.70 Mha in 2019, then sharply contracted by a third in 2020 and rebounded in 2021. Spatially, rice-crawfish system is located primarily in low-elevation plain areas with abundant water resources, where paddy rice cultivation has traditionally dominated agriculture. More concentrated rice-crawfish distribution is observed in Jianghan Plain, and regions around Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake. The spatial distribution of rice-crawfish cultivation experienced considerable expansion towards the east and north from 2013 to 2021, with the largest expansion found in Jiangsu and Anhui after 2018. At the county level, over 6% of counties experienced notable area increases of more than 60 km(2) from 2017 and 2019, but 20% of counties have decreased from 2019 to 2021. Among the converted land use types, irrigated cropland is the largest contributor to rice-crawfish expansion with a contribution of 56%, followed by water bodies (25%) and rainfed cropland (13%). The spatial and temporal information provided in this study helps to understand the evolution of rice-crawfish cultivation in China and facilitates more efficient management of land resources under the rapid development of this farming system.

AB Soil is a vital natural resource. To ensure optimum agricultural production, it is imperative to know the basic facts of the soils, their potential and limitations and management strategies needed to overcome the limitations. To improve the productive capacity of soils and further degradation of soil resources, there is a need to develop soil-based technologies and their assessment through participatory approach for quick and wider adoption. Identification of biophysical, socio-economic setup and need of the stakeholders will help to design sustainable, acceptable and economically viable land use plans. In this chapter, impact of soilbased agrotechnology transfer in two agroecological subregions of India has been reported. These plans are based on participatory and integrated farming system approach, where soil-specific agrotechnologies improved the productivity of soils and also the livelihood of farming community.

TI Understanding farm-level differences in environmental impact and
   eco-efficiency: The case of rice production in Iran
SO SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
AB Eco-efficiency, defined as the economic profit per unit of environmental impact, can largely differ between farms that produce the same crop. Understanding the underlying drivers of differences in eco-efficiency can help to identify effective options for increasing environmental product performance. Here, we analyzed differences in eco-efficiency between 200 paddy farms in Iran. With multiple linear regression modeling, we assessed the influences of farming system (conventional, limited input, organic) and yield, including potential interactions, on economic profit per unit of impact on ecosystems (terrestrial, freshwater, marine) and human health. Our results showed that the eco-efficiency of organic farming systems is (i) positively associated with yield, and (ii) systematically higher compared to conventional and limited input farming systems. We also found that the eco-efficiency of conventional and limited input systems is positively associated with yield for impacts on terrestrial ecosystems, but not for impacts on freshwater and marine ecosystems and human health. Our results reflect both higher economic profits and lower environmental impacts of organic paddy farms per unit of rice production compared to the other two production systems.

TI ROTOR, a tool for generating and evaluating crop rotations for organic
   farming systems
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
AB As with conventional farming, the improvement of organic farming systems requires agronomic planning tools to enhance economic performance. Crop rotation planning plays a crucial role in organic arable farming systems due to the renunciation of mineral nitrogen fertilisers and pesticides. Our objective was to develop a tool for generating and evaluating site-specific and agronomically sustainable crop rotations for organic farming systems in central Europe. The resulting static rule-based model, called ROTOR, consists of two basic steps: (A) A set of annual crop production activities (CPAs) is assembled semi-automatically from single site and crop-specific field operations using a relational data base. The database includes all relevant crops recorded separately with inputs and outputs, machinery and timing. Starting from stubble tillage and ending with the last harvest measure, the CPAs describe the current best cropping practices. Different CPAs are included for each crop according to (i) the type of crop preceding and (ii) the field operations following: whether ploughing or non-inverting tillage, undersowing crops, using catch crops, manuring, straw harvesting, or mechanical weed control. The former allows for the modelling of all possible positions of a crop within a crop rotation and the consequential effects of preceding crops. The CPAs are evaluated using rule-based assessment modules for yield, economic performance, N balance, nitrate leaching, and weed infestation risks. These modules have been developed using data from field experiments, farm trials and surveys, expert knowledge and a soil-crop simulation model. (B) Within the crop generation module, all possible sequences of CPAs are linked to 3-8-year preliminary crop rotations. Agronomically sustainable crop rotations are selected according to exclusion criteria (i.e., thresholds for N balance, weed infestation risks, phytosanitary and chronological restrictions) and ranked, e.g. by economic performance. The model was tested by comparing (i) estimated with observed yields and (ii) generated with existing rotations. These comparisons, based on data obtained from two farm surveys from North Eastern Germany, indicate the validity and usability of the model approach. ROTOR was found to support the complex crop rotation planning in organic farming systems requiring rotations with overlapping undersown main and cover crops. ROTOR is able to reduce the risk of planning failures by offering a quantitative method of optimisation of weed and site-specific N management. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The "Europe 2020 Strategy" launched by European Institutions is a commitment to increase growth based on the coexistence of both competitiveness and sustainable development. This paper analyzes the competitiveness of production systems in the cereal steppes of Castile, Spain. An indicator based on each production system's profitability threshold was built. The diagnostic analysis methodology allowed the identification of 20 production system models related to agrarian, livestock and mixed farming systems. The results show very different levels of competitiveness which are not necessarily related to the farms' sizes or capitalization levels but mostly to production costs and the farmers' ages. The response of these models to future input and output price scenarios shows that mixed farms are less dependent on external production factors.

CY JUN 28-JUL 02, 1998

SP European Soc Agron
AB Forage and ruminant production in Western Europe have increased significantly since World War II. However, in the last decade the livestock production sector has come under increasing pressure as the European Union introduced the milk quota system, effectively curbing total national and individual farm production volume, and national governments increasingly took measures to reduce the losses of nutrients from these systems to the environment. In the late 1980's in the Netherlands a project was initiated with the objective to design, test and further develop a farming system that can serve as a starting point for the development of dairy farms on dry sandy soils with average milk production (system 'De Marke') using the method of 'prototyping'. First, a number of farming systems have been identified that, in theory, meet the formulated objectives. From this theoretically acceptable set one of the technically and economically most attractive and, from a research point of view, most interesting was implemented at the experimental farm 'De Marke' in 1992. The functioning of this system is monitored in quantitative terms by measuring flows of dry matter and nutrients. The results so far suggest that on dry sandy soils strict environmental standards for losses of nitrogen and accumulation of phosphorus can be attained within a short time while maintaining the current milk quota. Grass, maize and fodder beets could be grown in such a way that the norms for nitrate losses could be met. Improved utilization of animal manure and lower manuring levels allowed a reduction in the use of fertilizer-N of 74% compared to current practice. The input of P in feed and the output in milk and meat could be more or less balanced: P-surplus was only 18% of that on the current farm. To obtain reliable results the research will be continued for a longer period of time because the system has to stabilize, the soil nutrient and organic matter stores and soil fertility react slowly to changes in management, and weather conditions are always variable.

TI Predator mortality depends on whether its prey feeds on organic or
   conventionally fertilised plants
SO BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
AB Natural enemy abundance and diversity can be increased under sustainable farming systems, but this has not been shown to consistently increase predation and parasitism rates or decrease herbivore abundance. 'Top-down' regulation of herbivore populations may depend on 'bottom-up' factors such as plant quality, and not solely on predator diversity or abundance. Specialised herbivore species can sequester secondary chemicals from plants to use in a defensive system against predators which mimics that of their host plants, but this herbivore defence may vary with the concentration of plant defences. We investigated whether fertiliser type and concentration alter the mortality of coccinellids feeding on two aphid species from Brassica plants growing in fertilisers typical of organic and conventional farming systems, due to differences in concentrations of defensive glucosinolate compounds cascading up the food chain. Coccinellid larval mortality was 10% higher when feeding on aphids from synthetically fertilised plants compared with those in organic fertilisers, regardless of the aphid species. Concentrations of both constitutive foliar glucosinolates, and those induced by aphids, varied with fertiliser type but this did not affect the glucosinolate concentrations sequestered by the aphids. The efficacy of predators as biological control agents may thus differ between conventional and sustainable farming systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The higher intensity of labor observed in many agroecological farming systems has been little studied by the scientific community, especially in terms of work organization. Narrative interview research concerning 34 farmers in six French farm machinery cooperatives, on the basis of the farming styles framework, allows us to highlight a specific style of farm work conducive to the agroecological transition. Farmers members of these cooperatives have developed a long-standing reliance on peer-to-peer cooperation, gradually shaping a labor-intensive and collective style of farm work to make their conventional farming systems viable. They have then remobilized with relative ease the structuring basis of their initial organization of work, i.e., labor intensity and peer-to-peer cooperation, to develop agroecological practices.

SO SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE
AB Hydroponics is a soilless farming method that can contribute to meeting the global food demand, improving food sustainability as well as ensuring food availability in a novel high efficiency yet low maintenance way. In this global meta-analysis, the crop yields of hydroponic cultivation were quantified and the differences in yields for distinct farming systems as in hydroponic vs. soil-based systems, farming orientations as in vertical vs. horizontal farming and environments as in controlled environment vs. open-air agriculture, were discussed. 499 observa-tions were extracted from 68 papers that discussed hydroponic crop yields. The most studied vegetable crops were "Lettuce and chicory". The greatest difference in crop productivity between hydroponics and soil-based agriculture was observed in "Spinach," with yields of 2.7 kg m- 2 year &#xfffd; 1 for hydroponics compared to 16.35 kg m &#xfffd; 2 year &#xfffd;1 for soil-based agriculture. The result showed that the productivity of the growing systems varied between crop categories. The impact of the growing orientation was significant for "Lettuce & chicory" and "Vegetables, fresh nes", but there was no clear pattern indicating the best growing orientation overall. The crop yields of the controlled environment were significantly higher than the open-air setup; it had a significant effect on "Anise, badian, fennel, coriander", "Cabbage & other brassicas", "Lettuce & chicory" and "Vegetables, fresh nes". This meta-analysis helps in quantifying the globally relevant crop yields of hydroponic farming systems, seeks to provide more solid evidence of the crop yields for hydroponic agriculture and determines the better hydroponic growing environment.

TI Impacts of Dryland Farm Management Systems on Weeds and Ground Beetles
   (Carabidae) in the Northern Great Plains
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Farming systems act as ecological filters impacting cropland associated biodiversity; however, the extent of these effects is largely unknown in the drylands of the Northern Great Plains (NGP), a key conventional and organic crop production region. In this 3-year (2013-2015) on-farm study, we addressed this knowledge gap by assessing the effects of conventional and organic farming systems on weed and ground beetle (carabidae) communities. We observed 25 weed species in conventional and 44 in organic fields. Weed species richness and weed species evenness were 237% and 137% greater in organic fields than in conventional fields. We collected a total of 1520 beetle specimens, representing 28 species in conventional and 37 in organic fields. Beetle activity-density and species richness were 220% and 156% greater in organic fields than in conventional fields. Both weed and ground beetle communities differed between conventional and organic fields, indicating that farming systems act as distinct ecological filters. We conclude that, in the drylands of the NGP, adoption of organic farming enhances weed abundance which could have potential management challenges, but provide floral resources to the pollinators and parasitoids. Similarly, greater diversity of ground beetles could enhance conservation biological control of crop pests, ultimately supporting for sustainable agriculture.

TI Trade-offs and synergies between livestock production and other
   ecosystem services
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB One of the biggest challenges today is to satisfy an increasing food demand while preserving ecosystem services. Farming systems have a huge impact on land cover and land use, it is therefore vital to understand how land cover and land use allocation can promote synergies between food production and other ecosystem services. Livestock production has multiple interactions with other ecosystem services and can promote synergies especially in grasslands. We investigated the interactions between livestock production and other ecosystem services and explored strategies to soften trade-offs and enhance synergies. We considered four ecosystem services (livestock production, crop production, carbon sequestration, and timber growth) in France. We considered 709 land units covering a wide range of farming systems where both food production and other ecosystem services are provided. For each land unit, we built ecological production functions that are models measuring the statistical influence of driving variables (i.e. land cover, land use, pesticide expense, and climate) on the provision of ecosystem services. Using an optimization procedure, we studied the extent to which livestock production could be increased without reducing other ecosystem services and without increasing total pesticide expense. We found that a 20% increase in livestock production could be achieved by all farming systems in France under those general constraints. The 709 land units could be grouped based on similar combinations of increases or decreases in specific ecosystem services during the optimization. 48% of land units were specialised on food production, 24% were specialised on other ecosystem services, 16% were specialised on the mixed provision of food production and other ecosystem services, whereas the remaining 12% showed decrease or no change in all ecosystem services. Livestock production was either in trade-off or in synergy with the other ecosystem services. The trade-offs could be softened through intensified use of cultivated land and spatial segregation of livestock production. The synergies could be enhanced only through major grassland expansion.

TI Assessment of Agricultural Biodiversity in Organic Livestock Farms in
   Italy
SO AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB Livestock farming is often addressed as one of the most impactful food production systems on the environment due to GHGE-Green-House Gas Emissions- and land use degradation. However, in the last years there is a growing number of studies that underline the beneficial environmental impacts of extensive livestock farming (i.e., providing ecosystem services, increasing biodiversity and improving carbon and nitrogen cycles), as well as social and economic benefits (i.e., offering alternative and additional forms of income in marginal areas). The multitude of livestock management approaches call urgently for specific tools of assessment in order to inform and orientate policies, farming practices and consumer choices. This study proposes a set of 14 agroecological indicators to assess the state of structural/planned agrobiodiversity in livestock farming systems. Our methodology stems from the already established Indicator-Based Framework to evaluate the sustainability of farming systems and adapted it specifically to livestock farming systems. The set of indicators has been clustered with respect to the ecosystem functions/services they describe. The methodology has been applied and validated on a selection of 12 Italian organic livestock farms and analyzed according to animal breeds and geographical regions. The results highlight that the farms show very positive results with optimal values for all indicators, except for Field Adjacency (FA), Share Species (SS), Share Group (SG). This study highlights how livestock farms could actually provide different ecosystem services in comparison to stockless farms.

TI Sustainability of Timor Deer in Captivity: Captive Breeding Systems in
   West Java, Indonesia
SO TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB The population of Timor deer (Rusa timorensis), an Indonesian endemic, continues to decline in its natural habitat, so captive breeding could become a source of individuals to bolster wild population. Support for captive breeding programs may be stronger if captive breeding also provided meat for human consumption. Thus, sustainable captive yields could be expected to support both conservation interests and food needs. The aim of this research is to evaluate the environmental impact, based on global warming potential (GWP), of two Timor deer breeding systems, that is, a farming system and a ranching system, in West Java, Indonesia. Life cycle assessment methodology was used for the evaluation to gain a cradle-to-gate perspective. The functional unit used was 1 kg of Timor deer live weight in captivity. The main result of the study indicated that the GWP per kg of Timor deer was estimated at 17.30 kgCO(2)eq (farming system) and 17.60 kgCO(2)eq (ranching system). The largest GWP in both systems was derived from cultivation activities and infrastructure development. In general, there is no significant difference in the GWP of the two breeding systems studied. This was due to the similar overall management adopted by the two breeding systems, especially the use of food types and infrastructure materials. Currently, the environmental dimension, especially the emissions from Timor deer breeding activities, is not a major concern, but in the future, breeding management should pay attention to the efficient use of the food and infrastructure to make it more environmentally friendly.

AB The sustainability of small-scale farming systems on marginal lands is still being a topic of debate in scientific and institutional communities. To address this, a study was conducted to find a method of sustaining the productivity of marginal lands for food crop production. Agricultural practices (fallow and traditional cultivation) used by the local small-scale farmers in managing soil fertility to meet the natural biological processes above and below the ground were studied in Muna Island Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. Participatory approach was used to gather data and information on soil and land as well as to collect soil macrofauna. The results showed that the practices of local small-scale farmers are based on local soil and land suitability. Organic materials are the source of nutrient inputs to sustain the productivity of their lands by fallowing, burning natural vegetation, putting back the crop residues, doing minimum tillage and mix-and inter-crops. In conclusion, the sustainability of local small-scale farming systems will be established by knowing and understanding local soil and land classification systems and preferred crops being planted. Following the nature of fallow and monitoring soil macrofauna diversity and abundance, all preferred crops should be planted during rainy season with different time of harvest until the next rainy season. Therefore, soils are still covered with crops during dry season. It was suggested that planting time should be done in the rainy season. Doing more researches in other locations with different socio-cultural, economical, and ecological conditions is suggested to validate and refine the method.

TI The Windmill Approach Combining transaction cost economics and farming
   systems theory to analyse farmer participation in value chains
SO OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE
AB A common theoretical approach for understanding smallholder farmers' choice of sales arrangements is transaction cost economics (TCE), which usually focuses on a single transaction. However, farmers produce different crops and participate in several value chains simultaneously. Based on two case studies in central Mozambique, the authors propose an analytical framework that pays attention to both the production and the transaction strategies of farmers. This Windmill Approach acknowledges that farmers decide on participating in various value chains on the basis of multiple objectives and aspirations. Farmers prioritize the allocation of available resources towards the sustainability of the whole farm. Policy to support smallholder farmers' market access should not focus on single transactions, but on the combination of farming system and value chain costs and benefits.

TI Transitioning to Sustainable Agriculture Requires Growing and Sustaining
   an Ecologically Skilled Workforce
SO FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB In the face of rapidly advancing climate change, biodiversity loss, and water scarcity, it is clear that global agriculture must swiftly and decisively shift toward sustainability. Fortunately, farmers and researchers have developed a thoroughly studied pathway to this transition: agroecological farming systems that mimic natural ecosystems, creating tightly coupled cycles of energy, water, and nutrients. A critical and underappreciated feature of agroecological systems is that they replace fossil fuel- and chemical -intensive management with knowledge-intensive management. Hence, the greatest sustainability challenge for agriculture may well be that of replacing non-renewable resources with ecologically-skilled people, and doing so in ways that create and support desirable rural livelihoods. Yet over the past century, US agriculture has been trending in the opposite direction, rapidly replacing knowledgeable people with non-renewable resources and eroding rural economies in the process. Below, we suggest how US policy could pivot to enable and support the ecologically skilled workforce needed to achieve food security in the face of climate change.

TI Comparative life cycle assessment of whiteleg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei)
   cultured in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), biofloc technology
   (BFT) and higher-place ponds (HPP) farming systems in China
SO AQUACULTURE
AB Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), biofloc technology (BFT), and higher-place ponds (HPP) are considered as alternative technologies in addressing major environmental challenges linked to conventional Whiteleg shrimp farming systems. Global concern about energy consumption and carbon emission in aquaculture in-dustries, especially in countries like China. The application of life cycle assessment (LCA) in shrimp aquaculture, especially in comparing different shrimp production systems, is being used. In our study, surveys on three RAS, three BFT and nine HPP farms have been conducted, and the data inputs were used to establish a cradle to farm -gate LCA by means of software SimaPro 9.3.0.2 and CML-IA methods to evaluate the environmental perfor-mance. The methods are well suited to this LCA, as it focuses mainly on energy consumption input, pollution output, and ecological damage. A ton of live weight shrimp production did generate 4424.2, 4657.2, and 4965.6 kg CO2 eq; 21.8, 25.9, 36.2 kg PO4 eq; 38.7, 40.6 and 43.5 kg SO2 eq in RAS, BFT and HPP systems, respectively. Regarding the characterization and normalization results, eleven categories (abiotic depletion, acidification, eutrophication, etc.) were considered. In most impact categories, the results showed that HPP had the highest environmental impact per unit production when compared to RAS and BFT. Acidification potential (AP) and eutrophication potential (EP) were the top two contributing factors to RAS, BFT and HPP. And AP and EP is closely related to the production of electricity. Electricity was identified as primary contributors in all farming processes. Results indicate that BFT and RAS could be used in combination to reduce environmental impacts. In order to improve the environmental performance of these farming systems, feed ingredients substitution; feeding management and effluent treatment are among the suggested measures. In order to enhanced aquaculture LCI databases and support aquaculture LCA research, the life cycle inventory for shrimp farming were established.

AB Indian as well as global agriculture will face several challenges over the coming decades because it must produce more food to feed affluent and growing populations. Improving agricultural productivity while conserving and enhancing natural resources is also another problem in Indian agriculture. The solution of aforesaid problem in changing scenario is sustainability in agriculture production. In India, rural economy suffers from poverty, unemployment, malnutrition, limited diversification of farming and degradation of natural resources such water, land and forest. Livelihood diversification is essential for poverty reduction, food security, rural livelihood security and improved income for rural farming community. Sustainable agriculture policies can better serve the goal of poverty reduction as well as rural livelihood security. The efforts to stimulate and support to the sustainable agricultural growth are essential for the rural livelihood security and rural development in India.

SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE
AB A questionnaire-based survey was conducted among a purposive sample of 60 small-scale cattle farmers in the Mopeane Rustenburg district, all of whom owned five or more head of cattle. Results showed that small-scale cattle farming is a part-time activity for most farmers in this district, and a way of investing or saving money in a form that is easily converted to cash when needed. This activity also provides households with a source of fresh milk. Contrary to the situation in most other Southern African regions, social status and lobola (bridal dowry) did not constitute the most important reasons for farming with cattle. The poor economic return of these small-scale cattle farming activities and the potential environmental degradation associated with overstocking poses a serious risk to the long-term sustainability of such fanning systems.

AB An experiment to observe the influence of compost by rice straw in potato production has been conducted in North Sulawesi from April to October 2015. Therefore this research was conducted with the objectives: (1) to find out the effects of rice straw-based compost compared to manure on potato production; and (2) to ensure the use of compost without inorganic fertilizer in the potato-based farming system as a basis of organic farming system in the production center of potato in Western Indonesia. The treatments were designed into CRBD proceeded to the Least Significant Difference Test (LSD test). Six treatments were applied, A=Compost 20 t.ha(-1) plus inorganic fertilizer; B= Manure 20 t.ha(-1) plus inorganic fertilizer; C= Compost 20 t.ha(-1) without inorganic fertilizer; D= Compost 12 t.ha(-1) plus inorganic fertilizer E= Compost 12 t.ha(-1) without inorganic fertilizer and F= Manure 5 t.ha(-1) plus inorganic fertilizer. Parameters tested show that the treatments of compost have advantages compared with the manure treatment. This related to the nutrients composition of straw rich especially potassium. Treatment A (Compost 20 t.ha(-1) + inorganic fertilizers) is not significantly different from treatment C compost 20 t.ha(-1) without inorganic fertilizers) in almost parameters except tuber weight of Grade #1 (industry purposes), describing the potency of the organic agricultural system of potato by using compost rice straw based. However, the organic agricultural system economically could be applied by the farmer as well as ease to get the materials. It also provides sustainable agricultural practices in the production center of a potato.

TI Effect of tillage and farming system upon VAM fungus populations and
   mycorrhizas and nutrient uptake of maize
SO PLANT AND SOIL
AB Low-input agricultural systems that do not rely on fertilizers may be more dependent on vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal [VAM] fungi than conventionally managed systems. We studied populations of spores of VAM fungi, mycorrhiza formation and nutrient utilization of maize (Zea mays L.) grown in moldboard plowed, chisel-disked or no-tilled soil under conventional and low-input agricultural systems. Maize shoots and roots were collected at four growth stages. Soils under low-input management had higher VAM fungus spore populations than soils under conventional management. Spore populations and colonization of maize roots by VAM fungi were higher in no-tilled than in moldboard plowed or chisel-disked soil. The inoculum potential of soil collected in the autumn was greater for no-till and chisel-disked soils than for moldboard plowed soils and greater for low-input than conventionally farmed soil. The effects of tillage and farming system on N uptake and utilization varied with growth stage of the maize plants. The effect of farming system on P use efficiency was significant at the vegetative stages only, with higher efficiencies in plants under low-input management. The effect of tillage was consistent through all growth stages, with higher P use efficiencies in plants under moldboard plow and chisel-disk than under no-till. Plants grown in no-tilled soils had the highest shoot P concentrations throughout the experiment. This benefit of enhanced VAM fungus colonization, particularly in the low-input system in the absence of effective weed control and with likely lower soil temperatures, did not translate into enhanced growth and yield.

SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT
AB In the Philippines, as the population passes 100 million, issues of food security, clean energy access and natural resource use have come into sharper focus, as well as the growing threats from climate change. New and innovative agricultural systems are required to satisfy these critical challenges. For the past 20 years, the Sustainable Agriculture and Natural Resource Management Project in Mindanao has been developing solutions to some of these issues. Its conservation agriculture with trees (CAT) system has helped stabilize and build up soils, conserve water, and prevent landslides in the uplands, while increasing food productivity. However, the clean energy component, which is vital for both greenhouse gas mitigation and food security, has been missing. This paper describes the integration of bioenergy into the CAT system. It draws upon cutting edge bioenergy models in the Philippines and internationally to highlight the potential for an integrated food energy system using agroforestry, livestock, and bioenergy. It outlines the feasibility and merits of such an approach in the upland farms of the Southern Philippines.

TI Diversity and sustainability of pig farm types in the northern mountains
   of Vietnam
SO TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB Pig farming systems in Vietnam are very diverse but little is known about this diversity. In particular, the different livestock farming systems currently in operation do not have the same capacity to be sustainable. The study aims to categorize farming systems involving pig production and investigate their sustainability. Data were collected from 160 family pig farms and 2 large-scale farms in Mai Son district of Son La province (northwest of Vietnam) using stratified random sampling. The multiple factor analysis method was used to identify different farms and to characterize each type with economic, social, and environmental indicators. The results highlighted four different farm types. Type 1 contained smallholder farms with diversified farm activities. They were mainly farmed by ethnic minorities located in the intermediate highland. They had low labor productivity and relied mainly on crop farming. Pig production was characterized by a low level of economic and social sustainability. Type 2 farms had comparatively less land and crops than other types. They were more specialized in livestock production, had medium-size pig herds, and were engaged in off-farm jobs. They were less dependent on credit or location and performed better with regard to environmental issues than larger farm types. Type 3 was specialized farms with large pig herds. They seemed more sustainable in economic and social components than the other types, but their environmental sustainability was questionable. Type 4 contained large mixed crop-livestock farms. They obtained high income but were more dependent on credit than the other types. In the future, in addition to focusing on large-scale specialized farms, policies should also consider small-scale and diversified farms because of their role in the sustainable development of national pig production.

TI IoT-Agro: A smart farming system to Colombian coffee farms
SO COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
AB Currently, the adoption of smart technologies for sustainable farming systems creates a distinct competitive edge for farmers, extension services, agri-business, and policy-makers. However, selecting the most appropriate technologies from a wide range of options is never an easy job. In this context, several authors consider Smart Farming as the best solution. However, they fall short in providing more information to recommend the most appropriate IoT technology, the options to manage the IoT infrastructure, and the services to crop management plans and crop production estimation. This paper implements a Smart Farming System based on a three-layered architecture (Agriculture Perception, Edge Computing, and Data Analytics). In the Agriculture Perception Layer, we evaluated Omicron, Libelium, and Intel technologies under criteria such as the price, the number of inputs for sensor connection, communication protocols, portability, battery life, and harvesting energy system photovoltaic panel. We evaluated edge-based management mechanisms in the Edge Layer to provide data reliability, focusing on outlier detection and treatment using Machine Learning and Interpolation algorithms. We recommend the Isolation Forest algorithm for classifying outliers in the monthly temperature dataset (99% of precision) and the Cubic Spline technique for effectively replacing the data classified as outliers (RMSE lower than 0.085). In the Data Analytics Layer, we evaluated different machine learning algorithms to estimate coffee production. The results show that the measured error values of the XGBOOST algorithm keep the values lower than the other models (RMSE 0.008, MAE 0.032, and RSE 0.585). The www.iot-agro.com platform offers farmer services such as weather variables monitoring, coffee production estimating, and IoT infrastructure setting. Finally, stakeholders, researchers, and engineers validated our Smart Farming Solution through a Colombian coffee farm case study. The test evaluated the usability, the straightforward interpretation of data, and the look feel of the web application.

TI Life cycle environmental impacts of high and low intensification
   pasture-based milk production systems: A case study of the Waikato
   region, New Zealand
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Intensification of pasture-based dairy farming systems is usually associated with increased use of off farm inputs to increase milk production per hectare, and additional environmental impacts may be associated with upstream production and delivery of these off-farm inputs. The objective of this study was to compare two levels of dairy farming intensification (i.e. high versus low) in pasture-based milk production systems with respect to (i) farm production and (ii) life cycle environmental indicators. The study considered 53 dairy farms in the Waikato region, New Zealand. Three farm attributes (stocking rate, amount of brought-in feeds and amount of nitrogen fertilizer used) were used to define a level of farming intensification (Intensification Index) for each dairy farm. The upper and lower quartiles of the dairy farms ranked on their Intensification Indices were chosen to represent high and low intensification groups, respectively. Twelve midpoint environmental indicators of the dairy systems were assessed' using attributional Life Cycle Assessment with one kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk as a functional unit and a cradleLto-farm gate perspective as a system boundary. Compared with the low intensification group, the high intensification group had (on a per hectare basis) higher (P < 0.001) stocking rate, total brought-in feeds and nitrogen fertilizer use, which led to greater milk yield per cow (P < 0.01) and per hectare (P < 0.001). The different levels of farming intensification did not affect total feed conversion efficiency (P > 0.05). However, for the high intensification group, the results for 10 out of 12 environmental indicators per kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk were higher (P < 0.05) than those in the low intensification group. The main drivers for the increases in most environmental indicator results were the production of brought-in feeds, manufacturing of agrichemicals and transportation of off-farm inputs for use on dairy farms. In contrast, increased pasture intake was negatively correlated (P < 0.05) with all environmental impacts, indicating that efficient pasture managenient is also critical to mitigate environmental impacts. In conclusion, while an increase in intensification of pasture-based dairy farming systems led to increased milk production per cow and per hectare, it also resulted in increased environmental impacts for most indicators. Apart from increased resource use efficiency, increased pasture utilization efficiency is a promising measure to improve environmental sustainability of pasture-based dairy farming systems.

TI Environmentally sustainable production of food, feed and fuel from
   natural resources in the tropics (Reprinted)
SO TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB Responding to the challenges posed by global warming, peak oil and biofuels will require a paradigm shift in the practice of agriculture and in the role of live stock within the farming system. Farming systems should aim at maximizing plant biomass production from locally available diversified resources, processing of the biomass on farm to provide food, feed and energy and recycling of all waste materials. The approach that is the subject of this paper is that the generation of electricity can be a by-product of food/feed production. The concept is the fractionation of biomass into inedible cell wall material that can be converted to an inflammable gas by gasification, the gas in turn being the source of fuel for internal combustion engines driving electrical generators. The cell contents and related structures such as tree leaves are used as human food or animal feed. As well as providing food and feed the model is highly appropriate for decentralized small scale production of electricity in rural areas. It also offers opportunities for sequestration of carbon in the form of biochar the solid residue remaining after gasification of the biomass.

TI Environmental sustainability of conventional and organic farming:
   Accounting for ecosystem services in life cycle assessment
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Today, there is an ongoing debate about the environmental sustainability of the products of organic farming. To compare the performance of conventional and organic farming systems regarding environmental impact and productivity, the comprehensive environmental assessment tool 'life cycle assessment' can be used. The lower crop yields attained by organic systems compared to conventional farming systems might, however, outweigh the benefits of the use of more environmental-friendly practices when evaluating the environmental impact per product unit. Although these practices arc beneficial for the environment, which is reflected in the delivery of a range of ecosystem services (ES), the focus is traditionally put only on the (harvested) product. Because the agricultural product involves actually a bundle of ES, the impact should be allocated among the whole output of an agricultural system. In this study, we propose an allocation procedure based on the capacity of agricultural systems to deliver ES to divide the environmental impact over all agricultural outputs (i.e. provisioning and other ES). Allocation factors are developed for conventional and organic arable farming systems. Applying these allocation factors, we demonstrate that for about half of the studied food products (including maize, potato), organic farming has clear environmental benefits in terms of resource consumption in comparison to conventional cultivation methods. This allocation approach allows a more complete comparison of the environmental sustainability of organically and conventionally produced food. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SE ACTA HORTICULTURAE
CT 8th International Symposium on Flowerbulbs
CY AUG 28-31, 2000
CL CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA
AB Flower bulb production in The Netherlands is economically successful. However, production methods rely heavily on external inputs, causing contamination of surface and ground water. The use of pesticides has been estimated 100 kg active ingredient (a.i.) per ha in 1994. In the same year the annual use of nitrogen and phosphate was 310 and 130 kg per ha respectively. Over the last decade the Dutch government established targets for the input and emission of pesticides and (in)organic fertilizers, energy use and volume of production related waste. Prototype flower bulb farming systems, with regard to these objectives, were developed, tested and improved on three experimental farms. This article concentrates on the results of two experimental farms on sandy soils in the west of The Netherlands in the period 1991-1997: 'De Noord' at St. Maartensbrug and 'De Zuid' at Hillegom. At both experimental farms the use of pesticides was reduced with at least 75% compared to the reference year of 1987-1988. Considerable reduction in the use of soil fumigants and fungicides was realised, but not of herbicides and insecticides. The use of nitrogen and phosphate decreased to approximately 215 kg and 55 kg per ha respectively. The integrated prototypes of experimental farm 'De Zuid' were economically competitive with flowerbulb farms in the same region. Integrated farming prototypes of 'De Noord' were less profitable due to suboptimal soil conditions, over-ambitious research targets and inexperienced management. As a spin-off of this farming system research, 24 flower bulb growers are converting to integrated flowerbulb growing on their farms. They are supported by research and extension workers.

TI Nurturing Diversified Farming Systems in Industrialized Countries: How
   Public Policy Can Contribute
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB If diversified farming systems (DFS) are to thrive again in the United States, policies and preferences must evolve to reward the environmental and social benefits of sustainable farming and landscape management. Compared with conventional agricultural policies, policies aiding ecological diversification are underdeveloped and fragmented. We consider several examples of obstacles to the adoption and spread of diversified farming practices in the U. S. industrialized agricultural system. These include the broader political economic context of industrialized agriculture, the erosion of farmer knowledge and capacity, and supply chain and marketing conditions that limit the ability of farmers to adopt sustainable practices. To overcome these obstacles and nurture DFS, policy makers, researchers, industry, farmers, consumers, and local communities can play pivotal roles to transform agricultural research, develop peer-to-peer learning processes, support the recruitment and retention of new farmers through access to credit and land, invest in improved agricultural conservation programs, provide compensation for provision of ecological services in working landscapes, and develop links to consumer and institutional markets.

TI Implementing miscanthus into farming systems: A review of agronomic
   practices, capital and labour demand
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Miscanthus is a promising bioeconomy crop with several biomass utilisation pathways. However, its current cultivation area in Europe is relatively low. This is most likely due to a lack of knowledge about the implementation of miscanthus into farming systems. This study reviews current best practices and suitable land areas for miscanthus cultivation. Biomass production costs and labour requirements were evaluated over the whole 20-year cultivation cycle of four utilisation pathways: combustion, animal bedding, and both conventional and organic biogas production. The assessment was performed for two field sizes (1 and 10 ha), two average annual yield levels (15 and 25 t dry matter ha(-1)), and both green and brown harvest regimes.
   The maximum attainable annual gross margins are 1657 (sic) ha(-1) for combustion, 13,920 (sic) ha(-1) for animal bedding, 2066 (sic) ha(-1) for conventional and 2088 (sic) ha(-1) for organic biogas production. The combustion pathway has the lowest labour demand (141.5 h ha(-1)), and animal bedding the highest (317.6 h ha(-1)) due to additional baling during harvest.
   Suitable cultivation areas include depleted soils, erosion-prone slopes, heavy clay soils and ecological focus areas such as riparian buffer zones and groundwater protection areas. On such sites, miscanthus would (i) improve soil and water quality, and (ii) enable viable agricultural land utilisation even on scattered patches and strips.
   Due to its low demands and perennial nature, miscanthus is suitable for sustainable intensification of industrial crop cultivation in a growing bioeconomy, benefiting soil and water quality, while providing large amounts of biomass for several utilisation pathways.

TI Indigenous strategies of sustainable farming systems in the highlands of
   northern Philippines
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB Indigenous strategies have been practiced in the Philippine uplands and they have maintained the sustainability of upland farming systems for generations. A collaborative activity among researchers, extensionists and practitioners from UPLB, BSU, HARRDEC, ICRAF, DENR-CAR, DA-CHARM, and NCIP was carried out to document and understand the indigenous strategies of farming systems in Bayyo, Mt. Province. Participatory rural appraisal (PRA) activities including transect lines, resource mapping, key informant interviews, and mind mapping were conducted with selected participants from the community.
   Most households in Bayyo maintain three production systems: irrigated rice fields (payew), permanent swidden (katualle), and shifting Cultivation (uma) plots. All three production systems are essential for their Survival. Local people practice a variety of indigenous strategies to sustain productivity in these production systems. These include terracing, crop rotation, mixed cropping, soil fertility management, and the sweetpotato cropping system.
   Payew fields are flat terraces built along the mountainsides with terrace sides fortified with stone walls. The se fields are irrigated with water from neat-by spring water to grow paddy rice. Terracing is also practiced in the katualle to reduce the steepness of the slope of the fields and to reduce soil erosion. Different systems of crop rotation and mixed cropping of rice, sweet potato, and peanuts are practiced in the three production systems to sustain crop productivity. Soil fertility in the payew fields is maintained by the application of the indigenous species Tithonia diversifolia. Laying removed weeds around sweetpotato plants as mulch is the main soil fertility management and weed control in the katualle fields. Fallowing is an important component of the shifting cultivation cycle in the Lima fields. Sweet potato is the second staple food crop in Bayyo and farmers keep a collection of a diverse array of sweet potato varieties Suited to different growing conditions and with varying characteristics of growing season length, herbage yield, drought tolerance and tuber storage longevity.
   PRA results have shown that indigenous practices kept the upland farms in Bayyo sustainable through the years.

TI Comparison of landscape features in organic and conventional farming

SO LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
AB Four organic (biodynamic) farms coupled with conventional farms from their neighbourhood in The Netherlands, Germany and Sweden, and 3 organic farms and 4 conventional farms from the West Friesean region in The Netherlands were evaluated to compare their impact on landscape diversity. Materials used were soil-, water-, land use- and land-property maps, interviews with the farmers, repeated (several days) visits to the farms, allowing to make temporal transects, photographs and pictures of the farm-couples and their surroundings. Presence of diverse land use types, woody elements (plantings) and visual elements (vertical and horizontal coherence, colours and forms) were analysed. The results show that the diversity of landscapes and farming system was greater in organic farms. It regards to the land-use types, crops, livestock, plantings (hedges, solitary shrubs and trees), flora, sensorial information (more forms, colours, smells, sounds, spatial experiences) and labour (more on-farm processing and more people involved). Also, all forms of coherence were found to be greater in organic farms. In terms of landscape diversity the organic types of agriculture have a good potential for positive contributions to a sustainable agro-landscape management.

TI Solutions to neutralize greenhouse gas emissions of the rice value
   chain-A case study in China
SO SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
AB Rice contributes significantly to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the food system. Previous studies mainly focused on emission reduction methods within the rice farming system rather than examining systematic solu-tions along the rice value chain. Organic and rice -fish co-culture rice are considered promising solutions for re-ducing environmental burdens. This study compared the GHG emissions of organic, rice -fish co-culture, and conventional rice value chains (including cultivation, processing, transportation, cooking, and waste disposal) with a cradle-to-grave system boundary and a new perspective from consumer dietary habits changes. The re-sults indicated that organic rice had the highest carbon input, output, and net GHG emissions in the farming sys-tem, with 9.277, 9.658, and 0.380 kg CO2-eq kg-1 white rice, respectively. However, the net GHG emissions from rice -fish co-culture and conventional rice farming systems were -1.682 and -0.393 kg CO2-eq kg-1 white rice, respectively. Methane (CH4) contributed more than 60 % of the total GHG emissions of the three rice farming sys-tems. Post-harvest systems, including processing, waste disposal, and transportation, contributed little to the GHG emissions of the three rice value chains. The cooking system was a relatively primary source of GHG emis-sions due to electricity consumption. Concerning the whole rice value chain, though higher consumption sustain -ability levels were assumed for the organic rice and rice -fish co-culture value chains, they were still carbon sources with GHG emissions of 0.770 and 0.147 kg CO2-eq kg-1 white rice mainly from the farming system, while the conventional rice value chain was a carbon sink (-1.012 CO2-eq kg-1). The results are similar to the functional unit of the capital diet. In this case study, organic rice had higher GHG emissions than rice -fish co -culture and conventional rice along the rice value chain, mainly from the farming system due to higher organic material inputs. Future studies should focus on reducing CH4 emissions from organic rice cultivation through sustainable soil and water management. (c) 2022 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

TI Nematode management in sustainable and subsistence agriculture
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF PHYTOPATHOLOGY
AB In small-scale, subsistence agriculture in the tropics and the subtropics, traditional farming practices have evolved that provide a sustainable means of reducing the incidence and damage caused by pests including nematodes. Other newer, cultural and low-input practices can also be successfully introduced in small-scale farming. In sustainable and subsistence farming systems, nematodes and some other pests can be managed by integrating different farming practices into four strategies: preventing the introduction and spread of nematodes; using direct, nonchemical, cultural and physical control methods; encouraging naturally occurring biological control agents; and maintaining or enhancing the biodiversity inherent in multiple cropping and multiple cultivar traditional farming systems to increase the available resistance or tolerance to nematodes.

AB Agricultural production systems are processes through which the different elements or production factors are organized and interrelated to produce an agricultural or livestock commodity. The objective of this work is to comparatively analyze the management of water and soil in smallholder farming production systems and commercial production systems as determining factor of environmental sustainability. Two cases are studied: the first is the commercial production of blackberries in the Valle de Los Reyes in the State of Michoacan, Mexico and the second is the smallholder farming production of mulberry in the Department of Caldas, Colombia. These two types of systems display two contrasting sorts of social organization and different operational logics regarding the resources of soil and water. One of the conclusions is that a greater environmental sustainability regarding the management of soil and water is evident in smallholder farming systems in comparison to commercial systems.

TI Approaches to assessing sustainable agriculture
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB This paper brings together several case Studies in which different methodological approaches and techniques mobilizing single or composite indicators were applied to assess agricultural Sustainability at four hierarchical levels, including the land management system, the cropping system, the farming system, and the agricultural sector system. The first case study (Iran) focuses on the land management system at the level of individual soil units, using statistical quality control charting to assess the soil fertility status and its effect on agricultural sustainability. Statistical limits are adequate to monitor the behavior of a data popula- tion over time, but Must be replaced by acceptance/sufficiency standards for sustainability assessment. A relevant limitation of control charting is that large data sets are needed to allow for random sample data selection from the whole population and check for normal distribution of the data. The second case (Kenya) concentrates on the cropping system at parcel level, using yield gap analysis to evaluate sustainable crop productivity. Although yield gap analysis does not indicate by itself what yield level is sustainable, it points at levels of crop productivity higher than farmers' yields, which could be achievable with additional inputs and improved management practices. If the farmer can raise the yield to a higher level, his/her farming activity will become more profitable and, therefore, economically more sustainable. The third study (Iran) refers to the farming system at the production unit level, using the energy balance analysis to compare the sustainability of traditional and modern agricultural systems. Energy balance analysis has the advantage of expressing all input and Output parameters in the same unit. The approach allows us to establish input/output ratios and compare different farming systems in quantitative terms for assessing their sustainability, but it must be combined with complementary techniques to cover the many facets of the sustainability concept. The last case study (Venezuela) addresses the agricultural sector as a whole, using an aggregated index to monitor the sustainability of the farming activity at regional/national level. Component indicators must be chosen according to data availability, data sensitivity to temporal changes, and the capacity of the data to describe quantitatively the behavior of the agricultural activity. The index needs refinement by integrating additional indicators and by allocating differential weights to the indicators to properly reflect their relevance and dynamics. In general, Much effort is still needed to integrate the scale-specific methodological approaches in one coherent framework allowing to navigate through the hierarchical levels of the agricultural macro-system and to take into account the many requirements involved in a holistic model of sustainability.

TI How sustainable is sustainable intensification? Assessing yield gaps at
   field and farm level across the globe
SO GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY-AGRICULTURE POLICY ECONOMICS AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Sustainable intensification has been proposed as a pathway to achieve food security and reduce environmental impacts of agriculture by focusing on narrowing yield gaps on existing agricultural land while improving resource use efficiencies. There is a general consensus that regions with large yield gaps can benefit most from sustainable intensification but it remains unclear how sustainable this is for farmers given their current resource constraints and livelihood strategies. Here, we draw upon three contrasting case studies, for which detailed data at field and farm levels were available for yield gap decomposition, to assess how sustainable intensification of crops (at field level) works out at farm level using environmental and socio-economic indicators. Although there is large potential for future intensification (more output with more input) of cereal production in southern Ethiopia, current input use in these farming systems is not economically and environmentally sustainable at farm level. The same is true for rice production in Central Luzon where sustainable intensification (more output with less input) can help to narrow yield gaps and improve N use efficiency (NUE) but it is not profitable due to the heavy reliance on costly hired labour. Trade-offs between yield gap closure and labour productivity were also observed in the aforementioned farming systems. Arable farms in the Netherlands exhibit small yield gaps as well as higher economic performance, NUE and N surplus compared to those observed in Southern Ethiopia and Central Luzon. For improving environmental sustainability, these farms require increases in resource-use efficiency and a reduction of the environmental impacts through a lower use of inputs (same output with less input). We conclude that public investments conducive for innovation and profitable farming are essential to make technologies accessible and affordable for farmers and to ensure that yield gaps can be narrowed and sustainability objectives served at the farm level.

TI Disruption to vegetable food systems during the COVID-19 pandemic in the
   Lao People's Democratic Republic
SO SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY
AB Globally, the COVID-19 (SARSCoV-2) pandemic has affected human health and the flow of goods and services in many sectors, with significant social and economic consequences and repercussions. COVID-19 lockdowns have disrupted food systems; impacting farmers, food producers, traders and consumers. Using a food system approach, disruptions to and the resilience of vegetable food production and trade was analysed. Representatives of traditional farming systems in Lao PDR producing and trading vegetables were involved. Over 350 farmers, 60 wholesalers, 50 retailers and 70 consumers were surveyed to determine the disruptions to vegetable supplies in terms of quantities traded, prices and income fluctuations. Findings revealed significant impacts on trading capacity and consequent reductions in incomes, prices, purchases, transport and sales of produce. However, livelihoods resumed as soon as the lockdown lifted. Traditionally, vegetable production and trading are a woman's tasks and hence women were the most affected by the disruptions. With trading contractions, the stability of the food supply was threatened, but only temporarily, indicating that a traditional, resilient farming system based on lower population densities, lower input requirements and lower productivity could adapt to novel disruptions in the short term.

TI Reducing tillage does not affect the long-term profitability of organic
   or conventional field crop systems
SO FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB Reducing tillage and supporting continuous living cover (CLC) can improve agroecosystem sustainability under both organic and conventional field crop production. What is less clear, however, is how reducing tillage affects the economic sustainability of organic field crop systems with CLC as compared to conventional field crop systems. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a comprehensive economic analysis based on field records and crop yields from the long-term Farming Systems Trial (FST) at Rodale Institute in Kutztown, Pennsylvania. The FST (established in 1981) comprises three farming systems (conventional, low-input organic, and manure-based organic) which were split into tilled and reduced-till treatments in 2008. FST field activities, inputs, and crop yields from 2008 to 2020 were used to construct enterprise budgets to assess cumulative labor, costs, returns, and economic risk of six replicated theoretical farms. Reducing tillage on the conventional farms led to lower gross revenues (-10%), but lower annual costs (-5%) helped maintain similar net returns but increased economic risk as compared to tilled conventional farms. Reducing tillage on the low-input organic farms also led to lower gross revenues (-13%) and lower annual costs (-6%), which maintained net returns and increased risk relative to the tilled, low-input organic farms. For the more diverse manure-based organic farms that include periods of mixed perennial cover, reducing tillage had a smaller effect on overall costs (-2%) and no effect on gross revenues, net returns, or economic risk. Overall, reducing tillage did not affect the long-term profitability of any of the three FST farming systems. Regardless of tillage practices or organic price premiums, the manure-based organic system supported higher net returns than the conventional system. This finding suggests that continuous living cover and manure inputs may have a greater influence on system profitability than tillage practices.

TI A comprehensive approach for assessing the economic contribution of
   forage and livestock improvement options to smallholder farming
   enterprises
SO JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
AB The importance of livestock production activities to improving the livelihoods of smallholder farming households and the efficiency of their underlying farming systems is increasingly recognized. A rapid increase in livestock numbers, especially beef cattle, and special purpose forages is being promoted for smallholder farms which have traditionally undertaken subsistence cropping activities or simple livestock rearing activities using low quality feedstuffs. Because limited plantings of specialized forages combined with a poor knowledge of animal nutrition are a challenge to establishing sustainable livestock enterprises, much public policy and research is now being focused on the use of new forages and improved feeding practices. A number of economic studies have suggested that specialized forage growing and livestock feeding activities can make a positive contribution to smallholder welfare. The studies have typically compared the total level of farm or household income with and without livestock activities. Little attention is given to how much the new forage or livestock activities actually contribute to or draw resources from other farm activities to assess their real economic contribution to the enterprise, and the availability of simple tools to assist in making such assessments are limited. This paper describes a simple modelling approach that was developed for an Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR)-supported project to explore the real as opposed to apparent economic impact of integrating improved forages and livestock within smallholder farming systems in the Red Soils region of south-central China. Application of the model is demonstrated using a simple case study of a smallholder enterprise that plans to introduce a new beef cattle rearing activity to its existing farm activity mix. The case study highlights the importance of explicitly valuing transfers of resources between different farm activities to gauge the real contribution of those activities to economic returns.

TI Financial performance of fertilisation strategies for sustainable soil
   fertility management in Sudano-Sahelian West Africa 1: profitability of
   annual fertilisation strategies
SO NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS
AB Low concentrations of phosphorus (P) also limit crop production on the acid, sandy soils in Sudano-Sahelian West Africa (SSWA). An increased P-use is thus a key leverage for enhancing food security and alleviating poverty. Therefore, P-imports into the predominating agro-pastoral farming systems are indispensable, but most smallholders are cash-poor and risk averse, face labor-constraints, and P-fertiliser responses are site-specific. Key to the adoption of any new technology is a high financial performance with low risk levels of failure, low demands of labor and cash, and adaptation to the prevailing farming systems. Financial performances were assessed from nine, annually applied fertilising practices during 4 years in five SSWA zones. Information about the farming systems, labor demands, and input-output prices stem from secondary sources. The profitability largely depended on rainfall and location-specific soil conditions, but those of annually repeated mineral and organic P-strategies increased over time. Several P-fertilisations were profitable on a per land unit basis, but could not compete with farmers' practices on a per labor unit basis. Mulching with and without P (13 kg P ha(-1)) were not financially superior, but the broadcast application of 13 kg P ha(-1) became profitable over time. Hill-placed P (4 kg P ha(-1)), also known as micro-dosing, was a profitable alternative to farmers' practices particularly in the intermediate rainfall zone. The results showed the importance of recommendations following rainfall zones, which are of interest across a spectrum of users including policy makers, land use practitioners, private firms, NGOs and research for development implementers.

TI Effects of Biopesticides and Undersown Cover Crops on Soil Properties in
   the Organic Farming System
SO AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB The inclusion of undersown cover crops in crop rotations and the use of biopesticides are essential for the long-term sustainability of the agroecosystem in organic farming. We hypothesized that biopesticides and undersown cover crops (crimson (incarnate) clover (Trifolium incarnatum Broth.), hairy (winter) vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), and winter rye (Secale cereale L.)) are likely to have a positive impact on soil agrophysical and biological properties. Soil shear strength, soil aggregate-size distribution, plant root dry biomass and number and biomass of earthworms were determined at the end of the plant growing season. We concluded that the application of biopesticides and growing of undersown cover crops decreased soil shear strength and increased the percentage of macro-aggregates (0.25-10 mm) in the plough layer. In the plots with cover crops, plant root biomass was found to be significantly higher by a factor of 1.9 to 3.5, compared to the plots without cover crops. The application of biopesticides and undersown cover crops did not significantly affect the number and biomass of earthworms in the soil. The abundance of earthworms was more influenced by meteorological conditions.

TI COMPARISON OF SOIL PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES AS INFLUENCED BY SUSTAINABLE AND
   CONVENTIONAL FARMING SYSTEMS
SO JOURNAL OF THE AGRICULTURAL ASSOCIATION OF CHINA
AB The objective of this study was to compare the physical properties of soils between sustainable and conventional farming systems. Two experimental fields were located at Chishan and Lutsao in the southern part of Taiwan. Three treatments ( i. e. sustainable, conventional and intermediate farming) were conducted. Each treatment had two rotation sequences with six crops (Sesbania roxburgii, cabbage, sweet corn, vegetable soybean, rice and radish), and a cycle of a rotation took two years. During the four years' farming activites, soil samples were taken after the harvest of each rice crop for the determination of moisture content, bulk density, total porosity and aggregate stability of the surface soils.
   The moisture contents and aggregate stabilities of the surface soils taken from sustainable farms of two expermental fields were higher than those from conventional farms in the first rotation, and significantly higher than those from conventional farm in the second rotation.The bulk densities of the surface soils of sustainable farms were lower than those of conventional farms. Whether the differences in both treatment reached the statistically significant level, they depend on the experimental locations and rotation sequences. During the second rotation, the total porosities of surface soils of sustainable farms were higher than those of conventional farms. However, the differences were not statistically significant.

TI Public perception of ecosystem and social services produced by Sardinia
   extensive dairy sheep farming systems
SO AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD ECONOMICS
AB Dairy sheep farming systems provide a great range of ecosystem services (ESs) and social services (SSs). These are Agro-pastoral Secondary Outputs (ASOs), the promotion of which can help the survival of the systems and the rural regions in which they exist. However, little attention has been paid to understanding which ASOs are recognized by the public, which is the first step to adequately promote them. This study first aims to review previous literature on ASOs relating to livestock in general and dairy sheep farming systems in particular. The literature review, conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, revealed significant gaps. Second, the research provides evidence of public perception of ASOs of a given dairy sheep sector-i.e. that developed on the region of Sardinia (Italy)-via a questionnaire distributed to a composite sample of 525 stakeholders. We found that cultural and landscape services are the most appreciated services. Multiple correspondence analysis suggests that appreciation of a specific secondary output would imply the appreciation of all the other outputs. Furthermore, we ran a set of logit regressions where each ASO was related to several socio-economic variables. Findings showed, among others, that the 'subjective knowledge' of the Sardinian agro-pastoral reality positively and significantly affects appreciation of all the ASOs. Several implications for practitioners, academics and policymakers are derived from these findings.

TI The energy efficiency of organic agriculture: A review
SO RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS
AB Growing populations and a constrained fossil-manufactured energy supply present a major challenge for society and there is a real need to develop forms of agriculture that are less dependent on finite energy sources. It has been suggested that organic agriculture can provide a more energy efficient approach due to its focus on sustainable production methods. This review has investigated the extent to which this is true for a range of farming systems. Data from about 50 studies were reviewed with results suggesting that organic farming performs better than conventional for nearly all crop types when energy use is expressed on a unit of area basis. Results are more variable per unit of product due to the lower yield for most organic crops. For livestock, ruminant production systems tend to be more energy efficient under organic management due to the production of forage in grass-clover leys. Conversely, organic poultry tend to perform worse in terms of energy use as a result of higher feed conversion ratios and mortality rates compared to conventional fully housed or free-range systems. With regard to energy sources, there is some evidence that organic farms use more renewable energy and have less of an impact on natural ecosystems. Human energy requirements on organic farms are also higher as a result of greater system diversity and manual weed control. Overall this review has found that most organic farming systems are more energy efficient than their conventional counterparts, although there are some notable exceptions.

TI Transitioning from paternalism to empowerment of farmers in low-income
   countries: Farming components to systems
SO JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
AB Reasons for the initiation of farming systems/participatory approaches in non-Green Revolution (i.e., in more heterogeneous and less favourable production environments) areas in low-income countries is followed by a discussion of their evolution. Four phases are described along, with a brief description of some of the significant methods in which farmer participation has been sought, accessed and evaluated. They enabled/facilitated the evolutionary process. Although, over the last 40 years there has been a progress in making small-scale farmers much more visible in driving the agricultural research/development agenda through using the four basic stages embodied in the farming systems approach (i.e., descriptive, diagnosis, testing/ evaluation and finally dissemination), much still needs to be done. This leads on to a discussion as to some of the barriers still inhibiting true farmer empowerment and why further, such empowerment is imperative, if the agricultural challenges of this century are to be addressed successfully, namely substantially increasing agricultural productivity in an ecologically sustainable manner. Given the heterogeneity of the production environments and that many identified improvements are likely to be incremental rather than revolutionary in nature, this will require farmers' intimate involvement in their identification, evaluation and dissemination. Discussion in the paper recognizes that there is increasing globalization/commercialization of agriculture and is predicated on the need to consider the whole farmer-research-development continuum involving multiple stakeholders (i.e., farmers, scientists, extension workers, input/output service providers and policymakers). Such a continuum has been explicitly recognized in the operational plans for the recently reformed international agricultural research (i.e., CGIAR) system. The paper concludes with a short discussion on the potential role of formal modelling.

TI Influencing factors and incentives on the intention to adopt precision
   agricultural technologies within arable farming systems
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB Precision agriculture technologies (PATs) offer an approach to arable systems which both enhance productivity and minimise environmental harm. Despite expected economic gains uptake by farmers has been low. This paper explores the intended adoption of PATs through a survey of 971 farmers growing wheat, potato and cotton in five European countries. We apply a count data modelling framework to accommodate the inherent structural differences between the current adopters and non-adopters of PATs. This is augmented by qualitative analysis of the main thematic reasons for intended uptake. Results indicate non-adopters have more belief in their knowledge of field topology and are generally older than current adopters. Those non-adopters intending to adopt PATs in the future are more favourable to a wider range of incentives than current adopters. Attitudinal differences towards the economic certainty of investment and payback periods also emerge. The results indicate that a gradient of adoption is occurring within European arable farming systems which may lead to inequalities in technology access. Recognition of these differences at policy level could lead to cost-effective interventions which maximise uptake, generate returns to candidate farmers and meet policy desires for sustainable agricultural production in the future.

TI A survey of soil fertility management in small-scale farming systems in
   north eastern Zimbabwe
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB This paper examines the soil fertility management practices of smallholder farmers in north eastern Zimbabwe and investigates whether mixed farming systems like these are sustainable. To maintain crop production, farmers used inorganic fertilizers and a variety of locally-derived fertilizers: manure, termitarium soil, crop residues, woodland litter, compost and household waste. On average, locally-derived fertilizers provide about 25 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and 65 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for fields and gardens, respectively, indicating the importance of gardens as a focus for soil management. Farmers achieve target yields without the high application rates recommended by the extension service, probably because of the positive interactive effects of applying inorganic and organic fertilizer. Current yields on these nutrient-poor sands cannot be maintained in the absence of the inorganic inputs, thus sustainability is threatened by rising human populations and the recent massive increases in fertilizer prices.

TI A ley-farming system for marginal lands based upon a self-regenerating
   perennial pasture legume
SO AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Annual-based farming systems represent some of the most highly disturbed terrestrial ecosystems on the planet. They are also highly exposed to climate variability. Many wheatbelt systems of southern Australia rotate annual crops with annual pastures, where the productivity of both is reliant upon seasonal rainfall. Perennial plants, in contrast, are less reliant upon both consistent rainfall and annual establishment, so one approach to decrease exposure to climate variability and disturbance in agriculture is to increase the proportion of the farm sown to perennial species. Perennial pasture or forage species offer immediate possibilities for transformation of agricultural ecosystems as they offer high protein feed to animals, often when green feed is most limiting, and concomitantly restore soil fertility. However, there are no perennial forage legumes adapted to acid and infertile soils in low-rainfall regions of the developed world, either in temperate or Mediterranean climates. Here, we review the recent research efforts to domesticate a perennial legume for these regions. Reasons for the lack of success are provided by a comparison of the attributes of the legumes evaluated in recent research programs and the limitations of these legumes as assessed by reviews and publications. This manuscript outlines an alternative approach to domestication of perennial forage legumes for acid soils and introduces new concepts in ley farming in an Australian context that might support the development of more sustainable agro-ecosystems. It highlights situations where very hard-seeded annual legumes have been successfully included in modern intensive cropping systems, and where perennial legumes may underpin ley-farming systems on infertile soils that normally produce low crop yields. Both innovations require the legume and their nodule bacteria to be sown only once in decades and address concerns about the sustainability of modern agro-ecosystems.

TI Integration of elements of a farming system for sustainable weed and

SO CROP PROTECTION
CT 4th International Weed Science Congress
CY JUN, 2004
CL Durban, SOUTH AFRICA
AB Diversification of agricultural activities that links farm-based enterprises with cultivation of field crops helps the resource-poor farmers in tropics to generate additional income, gainful employment and improve their dietary standards. A farming system approach has been found to be a resource management strategy for achieving economic and sustainable agricultural production, catering to the diverse needs of tropical farm household while preserving the resource base and ensuring high environmental quality. A judicious combination of any one or more of the farming enterprises like poultry rearing, duckery, fish culture, cattle rearing, green manuring and culture of biofertilizers contribute significantly for weed and pest management in field crops. Cropping system strategies like rotation of crops in sequence, intercropping and mulching do influence the weed-pest complex of crops. All these elements alter the weed flora in cropped fields through their feeding habits, allelopathic or allelomediatory principles in their excreta, suppression through physical interference like shading and altered ecology. Some of these elements also supplement pest management directly by virtue of their predatory behaviour or indirectly through suppression of weeds that serve as alternate hosts and by inducing fast and robust crop growth. Field experiments in Faculty of Agriculture, Annamalai University, India have revealed such beneficial interactions among component elements of different farming systems, viz., rice + fish + poultry, rice + azolla + fish, greenmanure-rice, rice-pulse, goat rearing + sorghum and cotton intercropped with pulse. All these approaches along with similar strategies involving other farming elements are discussed here. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Scenarios for an agroecological transition of smallholder family
   farmers: a case study in Guadeloupe
SO AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB In Guadeloupe, a French overseas region, civil society is calling for an agroecological transition (AET) to obtain access to healthy agricultural products following a major ecological scandal caused by a persistent pesticide that contaminated water and agricultural soils. To support such a transition, we tested a five-step methodological framework designed to enable farmers to describe and explore scenarios in farming systems, socio-technical systems, and social-ecological systems. This is one of the first operational methodological tools to build scenarios and action plans for an AET taking into account simultaneous changes in these three systems. We first surveyed 63 farmers and positioned their farming systems along an AET gradient using the Efficiency-Substitution-Redesign framework. In the second step, a sub-sample of 18 farmers, who represented diverse farming system types, individually defined AET scenarios at the level of their own farms. We then applied a farm simulation model to evaluate the technical and economic performance of each scenario. The third step involved analyzing the types of social networks used by 45 farmers to share information and promote technical, commercial, and social exchanges to implement agroecological practices in their territory. In the fourth step, we worked with a group of 15 farmers and 10 researchers in a participatory workshop to characterize the natural resources, their associated services and disservices, and the actors involved. In the last step, the farmers and researchers defined an action plan for the AET in their territory. Our results suggest that AET is understood by farmers to be a gradual and multiscale process involving the co-creation of knowledge, technical solutions, and organizational changes. An initial outcome of the process tested was a shift in the stance of researchers. Their focus shifted from experiments conducted on-station toward experiments managed by farmers to co-produce knowledge on the viability of agroecological practices under their own specific conditions, triggering discussions between stakeholders (such as advisers, policy makers, smallholders, and larger farmers) in the territory.

TI An agro-ecological evaluation of aquaculture integration into farming
   systems of the Mekong Delta
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB This study compared ecological sustainability of Integrated Agriculture-Aquaculture (IAA) systems with different forms and intensity of aquaculture integration in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam: orchard-based and low-input fish (O-LF); rice-based and medium-input fish (R-MF); and rice-based and high-input fish (R-HF) farming systems. We monitored eleven IAA-farms from September 2002 to September 2004. ECOPATH models, based on nitrogen flows, produced 19 agro-ecological system attributes that were reduced to four factors by factor analysis (Productivity-Efficiency; Diversity; Maturity; Aquaculture Integration), explaining 76.8% of total variance. In general, R-HF farms scored higher on Productivity-Efficiency, R-MF on Diversity, and O-LF farms on Maturity than the other systems. Within all three farm systems, variability among farms was high, caused by differences in land use, financial and crop disease constraints, market possibilities, and family conditions. The ponds and ditches served as a trap to capture nutrients and re-distribute them to other parts of the farms. Despite the differences in intensity of fish keeping between the three systems, the fish ponds in the rice-based systems and fish in ditches in the orchard-based system contributed to the same extent to the nutrient supply of other components. Differences in nutrient efficiency among the farming systems were caused primarily by the inefficient orchard and rice components on the O-LF farms. Fertilizers were often applied in excess. Nutrient use efficiency should be improved through proper application of fertilizers and promotion of the traditional integration practices. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Energy Use in Organic, Green and Conventional Pear Producing
   SystemsCases from China
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the differences in the energy consumption between the production of certified organic pear, green food certified pear, and conventional pear in two areas in China. Data were collected from interviews with farmers during 2007 and 2008. Energy inputs were significantly higher in organic systems compared with conventional and green systems. Fertilizer was the most important contributor to energy consumption in all three farming systems. Three calculation methods for energy value of manure have been found in the literature: substitution method, by-product method, and thermal method. The choice of various calculation methods for estimating the energy value of manure turns out to have great influence on the results in terms of energy inputs and energy efficiency. Additionally, energy inputs and energy efficiency were also influenced by other agricultural inputs, such as machinery and corresponding fossil fuels, human labor, etc. Possible explanations for these differences are discussed.

TI An economic analysis of communal goat production
SO JOURNAL OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN VETERINARY ASSOCIATION
AB The economic impact of different extension messages used was calculated using enterprise budgeting (gross margin analysis). Input data were gleaned from the literature, from participatory appraisals, as well as a field study, spanning 12 months, of small-scale communal goat farming systems in Jericho in the Odi District of North West Province. The number of offspring weaned per annum, as a proportion of does owned, was selected as the desired output for analysis. This study has shown that small-scale communal goat farmers are not adopting or implementing extension messages to improve production capacity. In south Africa the majority of goats are slaughtered in the informal sector. If the informal sector is to be persuaded to market goats commercially through formal channels, then knowledge of the economics of goat farming on communal lands should be provided. The economic aspects of extension messages are probably an important factor in determining acceptance and sustainability yet appear to be seldom investigated. The probable reason for lack of adoption of standard extension messages, which promote improved nutrition, parasite control, vaccination and treatment of goats, was economic. In other words, the so-called 'poor management practices' used by communal farmers appeared to be economically more profitable than the 'good management practices' suggested to increase production. The price of communal goats was not related to their mass. A higher level of inputs would probably have resulted in a heavier kid, however it was established that this would not have influenced the price received as a majority of the goats were slaughtered for ritual purposes where age, colour and sex were more important to the purchaser than body mass. It is standard practice in commercial farming systems to evaluate the economic benefits of all management practices before they are implemented. Production animal veterinarians use veterinary economics to compare different scenarios to control diseases or select management practices in commercial herds. It is suggested that the inputs and outputs of small-scale farming systems should be carefully analysed and that veterinary economics should also be used to evaluate the probable impact of extension messages formulated by veterinarians and animal health technicians.

TI Irrrigation water pricing aand sustainability of production systems: the
   case of Oum Zessar watershed in South-easternn Tunisa
SO NEW MEDIT
AB This paper aims at assessing the impact of water pricing policy on the sustainability of irrigated farming systems and the preservation of water and soil resources in Tunisia. The bio-economic modelling approach coupling the biophysical model CropSyst (Cropping System Model) and the economic farm model FSSIM (Farming System Simulator) has been mobilized for this impact analysis. This approach was applied to four farm types representing irrigated agriculture systems in the Oum Zessar watershed located in the south-east of Tunisia. The main results from this research show: the strong dependence of different agricultural systems on the pricing water policy; the high sensitivity of farms in the private irrigated schemes to the progressive increase of irrigation water cost compared to those in the public scheme, which are able to reduce the impact of water cost increase thanks to their good adaptation capacity. The agricultural systems of groundwater wells seem more fragile and unsustainable, and thus, the extension of public schemes would be preferable for maintaining irrigated activities and ensuring natural resources sustainability in these arid zones.

TI Farming System for Nutrition-a pathway to dietary diversity: Evidence
   from India
SO PLOS ONE
AB Farming is the main livelihood of a majority of people in India. The country is also home to a large population of undernourished people. This indicates potential for mainstreaming the nutrition dimension in the farming system to impact on nutrition outcomes. A Farming System for Nutrition (FSN) study was conducted in two agro-ecologically different locations from 2013-2018, to explore the feasibility of nutrition-sensitive agricultural interventions. The baseline survey in 2013-2014 revealed that the population in the study area was largely undernourished and that household diets were cereal-dominated. The FSN model was designed in consultation with community members, to increase availability of nutrient-dense cereals and pulses, by enhancing production and crop diversification at the farm level, promoting cultivation of nutrient-rich fruits and vegetables in nutrition gardens and supporting interventions to promote access to animal foods. Nutrition awareness initiatives were undertaken to build capacity at the local level and translate production diversity to consumption diversity. An endline survey was conducted in 2017 (July-October), following three years of intervention. Crop, vegetable and animal food production and food consumption was compared with the baseline data. There was evidence of higher production and consumption of nutrient rich foods, improved household dietary diversity; and understanding and acceptance of nutrition-sensitive agriculture. The number of items consumed under each food group, frequency of consumption of food and average per capita intake of nutrient-rich foods were found to have improved. The results provide evidence regarding feasibility of location-specific FSN models to promote sustainable and healthy diets, using locally available plant and animal food resources, to address nutrition deficiencies in farm families.

AB This paper describes the farming systems in two horticulture growing regions in Timor Leste and outlines the challenges and constraints faced by farmers in the production and marketing of horticultural products. The paper is based on a wider study of farming systems in Timor Leste. One of the main challenges faced by farmers is the low productivity and quality of the produce. This is due to current farm management and post-harvest practices as well as the lack of farm inputs. Product quality is a problem due to poor product handling. Marketing is hampered by the poor transport and road network system, inadequate communication, the lack of storage facilities, and the lack of a grading and standardisation system in the industry. Given the high local demand for vegetables and the potential for exports, it is important to address these challenges for producers to benefit from market opportunities and to increase their incomes. Dealing with these challenges will require a whole value chain approach.

TI Commercial Organic Fertilizers and their Labeling in Malaysia
SO MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
AB Organic and sustainable farming systems require organic fertilizer as an organic input to sustain soil fertility. As organic fertilizers (OF) are complex and variable, their selection is important since it has a direct influence on the organic produce. Thirty five bags of commercially available OF were obtained from Klang Valley, Selangor and Seremban. The OF were grouped as: a) oil-palm wastes base (OP), b) plant base (P), c) manure base (M), d) plant and manure base (P+M) and e) vermicompost (VC) based on the method of composting and f) unknown (UKN) when the source of material was not known (either from the labels or the suppliers). From this study it is suggested that by adopting uniform definitions, fertilizer manufacturer would he able to designate products that are suitable for organic production. The Department of Agriculture (DOA) should also have proper guidelines on the quality of OF for safe use in the organic farming system especially on adjustment of fertilizer terms and information on the labels. This may reduce the confusion caused by multiple definitions of the word 'organic'. Organic fertilizer standards are recommended in order to produce high quality organic fertilizers for organic production in Malaysia.

TI Mountain Farming Systems' Exposure and Sensitivity to Climate Change and
   Variability: Agroforestry and Conventional Agriculture Systems Compared
   in Ecuador's Indigenous Territory of Kayambi People
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Smallholder farming is considered one of the most vulnerable sectors to the impacts of climate change, variability, and extremes, especially in the developing world. This high vulnerability is due to the socioeconomic limitations and high environmental sensitivity which affect the biophysical and socioeconomic components of their farming systems. Therefore, systems' functionality and farmers' livelihoods will also be affected, with significant implications for global food security, land-use/land-cover change processes and agrobiodiversity conservation. Thus, less vulnerable and more resilient smallholder farming systems constitute an important requisite for sustainable land management and to safeguard the livelihoods of millions of rural and urban households. This study compares a comprehensive socioeconomic and environmental dataset collected in 2015-2016 based on household interviews of 30 farmers of highland agroforestry systems and 30 farmers of conventional agriculture systems, to determine which system provides better opportunities to reduce exposure and sensitivity. A modified Climate Change Questionnaire Version 2 of the World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT) was applied to collect the data. The interview data are based on the perceptions of Kayambi indigenous farmers about the levels of exposure and sensitivity of their farming systems during the last decade. Descriptive statistics were applied to analyze the data from the 60 farms. Results indicate that both agroforesters and conventional farmers clearly perceived increases in temperature and reductions in precipitation for the last decade, and expected this trend to continue in the next decade. Furthermore, conventional farmers perceived greater exposure to droughts (20%), solar radiation (43%), and pests, weeds and disease outbreaks (40%) than agroforesters. Additionally, results emphasize the better ability of agroforestry systems to reduce exposure and sensitivity to climate change and variability. These findings support the well-known assumptions about the key role played by agroforestry systems for climate change adaptation and mitigation, especially in developing countries.

TI Horticultural systems based on greenhouse tomato in south Uruguay
   characterization and analysis of economic efficiencies
SO AGROCIENCIA-URUGUAY
AB Sustainable development of food production requires more productive, profitable, and resource-efficient farming systems. Economic efficiency depends on commercial yield, but also on the efficient use of inputs, their price, and the sale price of products; it is also related to farming system characteristics. This study aimed to assess resource endowment and structural characteristics of greenhouse tomato farms and how they affect the economic efficiency of tomato crop, delving into the analysis of the main causes of its variability. This study included 23 representative farms in south Uruguay and 110 tomato crops (two to three per farm) during 2014/2015 and 2015/2016 seasons. We found high variability in commercial yields, product quality, sale prices according to harvest time, and production costs. This resulted in significant variability in net margins among crops, from negative values to a maximum of USD 16.2 m(-2). Four groups were distinguished according to farm characteristics. Large-scale farms had higher economic efficiency in tomato crops, however, farm scale group was not among the main factors responsible for crop net margin variability. The main cause of net margin variability in 2014/2015 and 2015/2016 was gross income variability. Yield and sale price explained net margin differences for all gross income levels. However, the price was more relevant within the group with higher gross income and yield within the lower gross income group. Production costs were only ranked in the group of higher gross income.

TI Farming system changes in the Vietnamese uplands - using fallow length
   and farmers' adoption of Sloping Agricultural Land Technologies as
   indicators of environmental sustainability
SO GEOGRAFISK TIDSSKRIFT-DANISH JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY
AB The environmental sustainability of the farming system changes during the 1990s of two villages in the northwestern Vietnamese uplands was assessed by an analysis of changing fallow length practice and farmers' adoption of Sloping Agricultural Land Technologies (SALT) in relation to slope steepness. The fallow length change detection involved an identification of the vegetation succession stage of the fallow vegetation at the time of clearance and was based on high resolution satellite image classifications. The use of SALT was surveyed by ground registration and overlaid with a digital elevation model. The results were coupled with an assessment of farmers' ability and willingness to adopt SALT in order to detect changes in attitude and perceptions amongst the farmers regarding their future agricultural strategies, and a discussion of the level of livelihood diversification in the villages. The study illustrates the complexity of the development situation in the Vietnamese uplands and emphasises the importance of locally adapted development strategies, suited to the traditional farming systems of the ethnic upland communities. The methodology for the analysis of changes in fallow length based on satellite images offers promising potential for the use of remote sensing technology in the assessment of environmental sustainability of shifting cultivation systems under change.

TI What future for banana-based farming systems in Uganda? A participatory
   scenario analysis
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB CONTEXT: Population pressure, land scarcity and encroachment of nature reserves are challenging sustainable intensification of agriculture in Uganda. One of the main staple crops in Uganda is East African Highland banana. Area expansion and improved management have enhanced the economic performance of banana, yet at the expense of food security, environmental and social sustainability. While a transition of banana-based farming systems to a more sustainable future seems necessary, the desired future state and pathways of getting there may differ among actors involved. OBJECTIVES: Our study aimed to co-design potential transition pathways with stakeholders along the banana value chain in Uganda, and to assess the effects of these pathways on sustainability indicators at the household level.METHODS: We conducted a participatory scenario analysis consisting of: 1) stakeholders envisioning and backcasting a sustainable future for two banana-based farming systems in Uganda; 2) researchers developing and quantifying plausible future scenarios to assess their effects on locally-relevant sustainability indicators at the household level; 3) stakeholders reflecting on the results, including synergies and trade-offs between sustain -ability indicators.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Stakeholders' envisioned future combined with main trends influencing banana -based farming systems resulted in four contrasting scenarios: Marginalisation (stagnation compared with the reference baseline); Business as usual (extrapolation of historic trends); Intensification (including Integrated Soil Fertility Management and collective marketing of banana); and Transformation (irrigation in banana, balanced crop nutrient management, cooperatives, and increased farm sizes for some as other households leave agriculture).Compared with the current baseline situation, selected sustainability indicators food self-sufficiency and farm gross margins decreased in Marginalisation, but improved in all other scenarios. Soil nutrient balances were unfavourable in all scenarios, except with balanced crop nutrition in Transformation. Stakeholders recognised labour as a main trade-off for desired improvements in other sustainability domains. Stakeholders also reflected on benefits and risks of a continued specialisation in banana, and fiercely debated the desirability of mineral fertilizer use.The active involvement of stakeholders in providing the building blocks for the scenarios, identifying relevant indicators and reflecting on the results, aimed to guide stakeholders on concrete entry points for improving sustainability of the system.SIGNFICANCE: Indications of stakeholder commitment towards a more sustainable future included a conver-gence of ideas on the need for Integrated Soil Fertility Management, collaboration in cooperatives and the need for savings to overcome risks of specialising in banana. Meanwhile, higher-level advocacy and support is required in decision-making on more complex, long-term challenges.

TI Organic amendments as sustainable tool to recovery fertility in
   intensive agricultural systems
SO JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
AB Intensive agriculture is a farming system characterised by a large use of inputs, causing a large pressure on the environment. As peculiar and efficient example of intensive agriculture cultivation under plastic tunnels provides several advantages for farmers due to improvement of microclimatic conditions coupled with a relatively low investment costs. In the Mediterranean Basin such cultivation systems reach about 200,000 ha mainly in Spain, Turkey, Italy, and Morocco. As downside, intensive agriculture negatively affects soil fertility principally because of a loss in soil organic matter. Sustainable practices providing organic amendments could be a useful tool to maintain or increase organic matter content in agricultural soils, preserving and improving soil fertility. An improved knowledge of management factors affecting soil quality is crucial to plan farming systems that effectively maintain soil fertility. Therefore, this review focuses on the potential value of organic amendments in the recovery of soil fertility, in particular in sites under plastic cover intensive farming system. Following a brief overview of the effects of intensive agriculture on soil, the review describes various organic amendments used in agriculture and their benefits on soil fertility, to conclude with the need, in the future researches, to identify organic amendments able to maximize a recovery of soil fertility.

AB A way to restore the fertility of rice fields is through improving soil structure and microbes by using organic fertilizer derived from livestock waste. Therefore it is necessary to implement an Integrated Farming System (IFS) particularly rice and cattle. The study aimed to analyze the determinants of farmers' decisions in adopting IFS of rice in Bengkulu Province, Indonesia. This research applied a survey method, which was conducted in Seluma and Rejang Lebong Regencies, Bengkulu Province, Indonesia. The data included primary and secondary and analyzed with the use of Multinomial Logistic Regression. The results indicated that simultaneously all the predictor variables had a significant effect on the response variable, while the income, land area, number of cattle and farmers' perceptions had a very significant effect on the adoption of the integration system while the variable costs of production, farming experience and labor did not have a significant effect on the decision to adopt a rice and cattle integration system.

TI Outlining a conception of animal welfare for organic farming systems
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS
AB The concept of animal welfare refers to the animal's quality of life. The choice of definition always reflects some basic valuation. This makes a particular conception of welfare value-dependent. Also, the animal husbandry system reflects certain values or aims. The values reflected in the chosen conception of animal welfare ought to correspond to values aimed for in the husbandry system. The IFOAM Basic Standards and other writings dealing with organic animal husbandry should be taken as a departure point for a discussion of how to interpret the conception of welfare in organic farming systems. The conception of welfare is related to two core values in the organic agriculture movement. These core values should be considered in terms of (1) aim for holistic view and (2) aim for sustainability. A third, implicit core value, based on bio- and ecocentric views: (3) respect for nature is needed as a supplement to these two core values. There are important implications of these core values for an ``organic'' conception of animal welfare and for confronting two dilemmas due to conflicting interests. Comparisons among the three commonly used welfare definitions will show the superiority of the third approach, which can provide an outline for a conception of animal welfare more suitable for organic farming systems. This outline combines a holistic ecocentric approach with respect for the individual animal, and it can be used as the basis for a complex definition with emphasis on natural behavior. Such a systemic approach considers welfare in relation to different systemic levels. The systemic view also offers possibilities for resolving the dilemmas in new ways.

TI Government extension, agroecology, and sustainable food systems in
   Belize milpa farming communities: A socio-ecological systems approach
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE FOOD SYSTEMS AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
AB The sustainability of milpa agriculture, a traditional Mayan farming system in southern Belize, is uncertain. For centuries, the milpa has been a sustainable agriculture system. The slash-and-burn aspect of milpa farming, however, has become less reliable and less sustainable over the last 50 years due to several factors, including forest loss, climate change, population growth, and other factors. The traditional milpa practices of slash-and-mulch and soil nutrient enrichment (nutrient cycling) are agroecological practices that produce food in a more sustainable way. Agriculture extension, a government service in Belize, can promote additional agroecological practices to address food and livelihood insecurities in milpa communities. This study examines perceptions of these practices from milpa farmers and agricultural extension officers in Belize using a socio-ecological systems (SES) framework. SES considers multidisciplinary linkages, including social, economic, environmental, cultural, and other factors in the agroecological system. The study finds several of these SES linkages between agroecological practices-specifically slash-andmulch and soil nutrient enrichment-and the sustainability of the milpa farming system in southern Belize. Milpa communities are part of the broader SES and therefore are affected by changes to it. Milpa communities can also be enabled and participate in solution-finding. The findings imply that increasing the use of agroecology practices in milpa communities is needed and that government involvement and action, particularly from agriculture extension services, can facilitate a more sustainable milpa farming system and therefore more food and livelihood security in milpa communities in Belize.

TI Spatially variable rate herbicide application on durum wheat in Sicily
SO BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
AB Using the conventional farming system, durum wheat requires high rates of herbicide spraying. Herbicide residues can cause pollution of soil and ground water and, therefore, of the entire environment.
   In order to minimise the environmental impact of herbicides, a home-made system for spatially variable rate crop input application was designed and developed. This system consists of a differential global positioning system (DGPS), a portable computer, specifically developed software and a device for applying rates proportionally related to the machine forward speed.
   Tests of spatially variable rate herbicide application were carried out in inland Sicily, on a field of 8.4ha (where a 3-yr crop rotation of broad bean/vetch, durum wheat and durum wheat was practised), using a sprayer modified for applying variable rates and equipped with the above-mentioned system.
   The results are promising. The spatially variable rate herbicide application allowed an almost even grain yield over the entire field and a saving of 29% of herbicides with respect to the amounts normally used with the conventional farming system.

TI Framework for evaluation of sustainable land management: A case study of
   two rain-fed cereal-livestock farming systems in the Black Chernozemic
   soil zone of southern Alberta, Canada
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
AB The Framework for Evaluation of Sustainable Land Management (FESLM) was used to assess the sustainablility of two land-use systems in the Canadian Prairies. The FESLM provided a means of identifying the factors impacting on sustainability, the processes by which these factors operate and interact, and the indicators and thresholds by which they could be measured to attain an assessment end point. On the basis of the framework, it was possible to expand sustainability assessment beyond traditional factors of productivity and economic viability to include ones pertaining to production risk, protection of the natural resource base, and social acceptability. In conducting the FESLM-based analysis, the decision-making characteristics of the producer were identified as important components of sustainability. Preliminary indications are that substantially greater amounts of farm-specific and regional data are required to make a conclusive FESLM-based sustainability assessment. Nevertheless, application of the framework suggests that, for the farming systems and the type of producer under consideration, the conservation-based landuse system is more sustainable than the conventional land-use system.

AB Nitrogen fixing trees (NFTs) have the potential to contribute toward the sustainability of farming systems because they can provide wood for fuel and timber and fodder for animals; NFTs so sustain soil productivity through the addition of biomass as mulch and nitrogen fixation. In Papua New Guinea (PNG), the livelihood of about 75% of the population depends on subsistence farming. With an annual population increase of 2.3%, the traditional practice of shifting cultivation is unsustainable, especially in densely populated areas. As a result of the mandate given by the government of PNG to the Agriculture Research Division to develop sustainable farming systems based on low-input technology, studies to collect and evaluate various NFTs commenced in 1987. This paper reports on a study of six NFTs/shrubs in the highlands of Aiyura in PNG to identify suitable species for biomass production and use in cropping systems. Calliandra calothyrsus, Acacia angustissima, Leucaena diversifolia, and Leucaena mexicana produced more biomass than Leucaena leucocephala (cultivar K636) or Desmodium sequax, The four most productive species also contributed large amounts of major nutrients to the soil through hedge biomass whereas L. leucacephala (K636) and Desmodium sequax contributed the lowest. There was an increase in soil N and P levels and no change in soil K and organic carbon levels 2.5 years after planting NFTs.

TI ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT OF WATER HARVESTING PLUS SUPPLEMENTAL IRRIGATION FOR
   IMPROVING WATER PRODUCTIVITY OF A PULSE-COTTON BASED INTEGRATED FARMING
   SYSTEM IN TELANGANA, INDIA(dagger)
SO IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
AB An integrated farming system (IFS) aims to sustain agricultural production, maintain farm incomes, safeguard the environment and respond to climate change impacts. Experiments in a tribal farmer's fields during 2016-2018 with two IFS models (pulse and cotton) were conducted in the Telangana region, India. An on-farm reservoir (OFR) is designed for storing surface runoff based on the area and runoff coefficient determined through a modelling approach. The results demonstrated how supplemental irrigation and water harvesting are the most important and proven technologies for improving crop productivity and the efficient use of water in dryland areas of the semi-arid tropics. The economic analysis indicated that after introduction of OFR technology, farmers' profits were increased under both scenarios of prolonged and short dry spells. According to the results, adoption of the OFR and IFS models not only ensured economic returns but provided regular employment even on less than 1 ha of land, which is usually non-sustainable if monocropping is being practised. The approaches used in this work might be useful for guiding producers' decisions in optimizing resources and selecting crops based on economic and water use efficiency.

AB Fuzzy logic is an approach that is particularly useful for formulating and solving multiple attribute decision making (MADM) problems related to agricultural sustainability. The specific decision of interest is the selection among alternative farming systems in order to achieve the highest degree of sustainability. The fuzzy logic approach offers several advantages including the ability to (1) integrate mixed qualitative and quantitative data, (2) utilize data expressed in noncommensurate units without the need for rescaling, (3) include information that is relevant to the decision but may be vague or imprecise, (4) avoid inappropriately high levels of discrimination between alternatives that differ only slightly in their attributes, (5) model the interrelationships between the different sustainability criteria, and (6) provide a full ranking of the alternatives. To illustrate the application of fuzzy logic in MADM, a prototype model for selecting between two farming systems in northern Missouri is described and a decision support system (DSS) based on fuzzy logic is proposed.

TI Aligning conservation agriculture among various disciplines in South
   Africa
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PLANT AND SOIL
AB In South Africa, the term conservation agriculture (CA) is often used to describe any soil conservation action rather than a combination of the three management principles that CA encompasses, namely minimum soil disturbance, using a diversity of crops in rotation or association, and protecting the soil with an organic soil cover. A workshop was held with delegates from tertiary institutions, research institutions, government and private companies, in January 2019, to share and exchange CA research experiences and lessons, and to identify research gaps in the field of CA in South Africa. By collating the information from the workshop, this article aims to align CA approaches among various disciplines in South Africa and to identify the inevitable challenges with CA and (mis-)perceptions of CA in South Africa. It was clear that CA is applicable to most farming systems, but is context specific. No specific CA practice can be recommended as a panacea to solve issues experienced in all systems. Adaptation and application of CA within different South African farming systems needs to be dealt with sensibly and realistically, in ways that are based on practical rather than purely theoretical considerations. It is important that CA is not advocated without taking sustainable intensification into account. Dealing with CA sensibly requires a multidisciplinary approach.

TI HISTORICAL LAND-USE EVOLUTION IN A TROPICAL ACID UPLAND AGROECOSYSTEM
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB Understanding the historical evolution of land use in humid tropical agroecosystems may assist in developing more appropriate farming systems-better able to sustain dense human populations, alleviate deforestation and regenerate degraded land resources. We analyzed land use change over a 40 year period for a key acid upland farming systems research site (8 km X 10 km) undergoing rapid transformation in Claveria, Mindanao, Philippines. The landscape is dominated by small-scale cereal cropping on gently to steeply rolling volcanic Oxisols. The six slope classes identified (ranging from 0-3% to more than 60%) each occupied between 9 and 19% of the study area. Aerial photographs (1:15000) taken in 1949 and 1967, and a ground survey in 1988, were used to map land use patterns at three points in time. Settlement by in-migration began early in the twentieth century. By 1949 9% of the land was cultivated, but grassland (59%) and forest (14%) were the dominant land uses. From 1949 to 1967 the cultivated area doubled to 20%, and the proportion of grassland decreased to less than 50% of the land. The forested area remained unchanged. Subsequently, settlement by small-scale farmers accelerated. Between 1967 and 1988 the area cropped annually doubled again to 41%. Forest land declined drastically during this period to 1%, while perennial cropland (mainly coffee) increased to 30%. Land use on the steeply sloping lands (more than 15%) was particularly affected during the 21 year period: 27% was converted to field crop production, and 43% to perennial crops. More than 33% of the food crop area is now on steep slopes. The analysis of the historical evolution of land use may guide research priorities for developing sustainable technologies on sloping land based on agroforestry.

TI Opportunities and Challenges for Cover Cropping in Sustainable
   Agriculture Systems in Southern Australia
SO AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB Southern Australian farming systems operate predominantly under Mediterranean climatic conditions, which limit the choice of cover crops suitable for enhancement of ground cover and soil moisture retention, erosion control, atmospheric soil nitrogen (N) fixation, and weed suppression between cash crop rotations. Given that the successful establishment of cover crops is climate-driven and also influenced by edaphic factors such as soil pH and salinity, there has been increased interest by southern Australian producers in identifying potential cover crop species well adapted to specific Australian farming systems, which provide vital ecosystem services and sustainable economic benefits through the improvement of soil properties. This review summarises recent findings on cover crop inclusion in diverse farming systems in southern Australia, including continuous and mixed broadacre cropping as well as viticulture and horticulture systems, to identify opportunities and limitations related to their use. Cover crop inclusion in viticulture and pasture systems with lower moisture stress was observed to benefit the subsequent cash crop through enhanced production potential. Long-term, multi-site field experimentation incorporating summer cover crops in winter crop rotations showed that cover crops enhanced ground cover and soil water infiltration in some locations across southern Australia while sometimes increasing winter crop yield, suggesting that soil type and regional climatic conditions greatly influenced the delivery of multiple cover crop benefits. Collectively, these studies have suggested a need for longer-term field evaluations using multiple cover crop species and investigations of termination options under varying environmental and soil conditions to better quantify the legacy effects of cover crops.

TI CaTMAS: A multi-agent model for simulating the dynamics of carbon
   resources of West African villages
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB Carbon is an important determinant of the sustainability of West African farming systems and of the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Given the complexity of C dynamics, various simulation models have been developed. Few include socioeconomic factors or handle system heterogeneity. This study proposes a generic, multi-agent model for the analysis of C dynamics at village level. It assumes that a better analysis of carbon dynamics at village level requires account to be taken of social, economic, physical and biological factors as well as of the actions of individuals and their interdependence. The Carbon of Territory Multi-Agent Simulator (CaTMAS) model is based on the Organization-Role-Entity-Aspect (OREA) meta-model and the Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) approach. OREA enables C dynamics to be studied from various points of view through the roles played by entities within organizations and also allows various entities to play the same role in various ways through the notion of aspects. The model was coupled with the Century model and a geographical information system to provide a realistic representation of C dynamics. CaTMAS provides not only a framework for the explicit description of the carbon dynamics of farming systems but can also be used to assess the viability of farming systems using various socioeconomic and biophysical scenarios. The model includes interactions between human activities and the environment. Simple simulations involving two cropping systems and focusing on the impact of population growth and different climate regimes on the C dynamics indicate that CaTMAS accounts realistically for the relationships between population, agriculture, climate and SOC dynamics. In simulation, population growth, which drives food demand, leads to agricultural expansion, land scarcity and decrease in fallow duration. These effects are accentuated by increasing temperature and decreasing rainfall which affect the SOC dynamics controlling soil fertility and thus crop production. Improvements to the model should make it possible to extend the scale of the simulation of C dynamics and include refinements such as the inclusion of the trading of carbon credits.

   Small Holdings in India
SO AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB The agrarian communities of South Asia are dominated by small and marginal farmers (<2.0 ha operational holdings) and are confronted with manifold challenges of lower productivity, income, and resource degradation. For optimized and efficient resource use, a shift from business as usual towards green economy is imperative. Therefore, a study to address these challenges, through integrating diverse crops and allied enterprises under an integrated farming system (IFS) model was carried out. We hypothesized that a standardized IFS model with appropriate location-specific modules will have higher system output, income, and lesser environmental footprints. Vegetable cultivation (VC), protected vegetable cultivation (PVC), field crops (FC), mushroom production (MP), and beekeeping (BK) were evaluated under the IFS model, with objectives to optimize the coherent use of available farm resources with enhancing system productivity and profitability. Among the FC module, the system productivity increased from 21-247% of different cropping systems, over the predominant rice-wheat system (RWS). The integration of different components, viz., VP + PVC + FC + AHS + MP + BK + VC in M-10 resulted in achieving the maximum water productivity (6.72 kg/m(3)), energy productivity (1.50 kg/MJ), net return (9446 USD/ha), employment opportunities (792 man-days), sustainable livelihood index (70.2%), and nutrient cycling (138.12, 67.9, and 381.6 kg/ha of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, respectively). These findings can be a scientific basis for the optimization and sustainable management of natural resources under different modules of IFS for the less-endowed small and marginal farmers.

TI Soil microbial communities are sensitive to differences in fertilization
   intensity in organic and conventional farming systems
SO FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
AB Fertilization intensity shapes soil fungal and bacterial communities in organic and conventional farming systems of the 42-year-old DOK long-term field trial.
   Intensive agriculture has increased global food production, but also impaired ecosystem services and soil biodiversity. Organic fertilization, essential to organic and integrated farming, can provide numerous benefits for soil quality but also compromise the environment by polluting soils and producing greenhouse gases through animal husbandry. The need for reduced stocking density is inevitably accompanied by lower FYM inputs, but little research is available on the impact of these effects on the soil microbiome. We collected soil samples from winter wheat plots of a 42-year-old long-term trial comparing different farming systems receiving farmyard manure at two intensities and measured soil quality parameters and microbial community diversity through DNA metabarcoding. High-input fertilization, corresponding to 1.4 livestock units (LU) improved the soil's nutritional status and increased soil microbial biomass and respiration when compared to low-input at 0.7 LU. Bacterial and fungal alpha-diversity was largely unaffected by fertilization intensity, whereas their community structure changed consistently, accompanied by an increase in the bacterial copiotroph-to-oligotroph ratio in high-input systems and by more copiotrophic indicator OTUs associated with high than low-input. This study shows that reduced nutrient availability under low-input selects oligotrophic microbes efficiently obtaining nutrients from various carbon sources; a potentially beneficial trait considering future agroecosystems.

TI Soil Nutrient Dynamics in Integrated Crop-Livestock Systems in the
   Northern Ethiopian Highlands
SO SUSTAINABLE POVERTY REDUCTION IN LESS-FAVOURED AREAS
AB In the Northern Ethiopian Highlands, one of the least-favoured areas in East Africa, farming systems are characterized by the integrated management of crop and livestock components. The overall objective of this chapter was to increase insight into the functioning of these farming systems, with special attention to the influence of farm management regimes on soil nutrient dynamics, as a basis for formulation of recommendations for technological innovation leading to increased farm productivity, conservation of the natural resources and improved livelihoods for the farming population.
   Partial balances of the macronutrients - nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) - were studied at farm and field scales and soil organic carbon (C) balance at village scale, and the results indicate that soil nutrient balances were negative at all scales. Nutrient depletion rates differ significantly among farmer wealth groups, with the highest rates recorded for the rich farm group, followed by the medium and poor farm groups. Current levels of organic fertilizer input are much lower than required to maintain a dynamic equilibrium in soil organic matter content. Thus, limited availability of organic inputs is a crucial constraint for attaining sustainability in terms of nutrient elements.
   Results of a simulation study on long-term dynamics of soil C, N and P and the consequences of alternative farm management practices for crop-available N and P indicate that, in order to maintain current levels of soil N, organic carbon and P, external inputs in the form of inorganic fertilizers are indispensable. In this chapter, attention focuses on the biophysical aspects of sustainability in terms of soil qualities, with special attention to nutrient elements. Adoption of more sustainable farm management practices, however, is constrained by the (socio-) economic environment.

TI Comparison of nutritional composition and histological changes of the
   soybean seeds cultivated by conventional and organic farming systems
   after long-term storage - Preliminary study
SO JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF AGRICULTURE KYUSHU UNIVERSITY
AB We investigated the effect of hermetic long-term (9-year) storage at room temperature on the chemical compositions and histological structure of soybean seeds that had been cultivated by two farming systems [conventional farming (CF) or organic (natural) farming (OF)]. Soybean seeds had been harvested from plants cultivated in the field under CF practices, or in a neighboring field where OF practices had been used for over 3 years. Protein content, calcium (Ca), potassium (K) and phosphorus (P) content of OF soybean seeds were higher than CF seeds just after harvesting. However, after long-term storage, protein content of OF soybean seeds was significantly higher than CF seeds. In addition, there were many minerals with a higher content (in particular, K) of OF soybean seeds. The breaking strength and pH of OF soybean seeds were higher than CF ones. Optical microscopic examination revealed collapsed tissue and gaps in the internal and external parts of CF soybean seeds. Transmission electron microscopic photographs of CF soybean seeds confirmed the presence of collapsed cell walls and protein bodies. These results indicate that the type of farming system (inorganic or organic fertilizers) used results in differences in chemical compositions and histological structure of product during storage. In addition, our results indicated that high-Ca content of OF soybean seeds strengthened cell wall structure, and prevented the loss of contents during storage.

TI Mapping and Characterization of Phenological Changes over Various
   Farming Systems in an Arid and Semi-Arid Region Using Multitemporal
   Moderate Spatial Resolution Data
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB Changing land use patterns is of great importance in environmental studies and critical for land use management decision making over farming systems in arid and semi-arid regions. Unfortunately, ground data scarcity or inadequacy in many regions can cause large uncertainties in the characterization of phenological changes in arid and semi-arid regions, which can hamper tailored decision making towards best agricultural management practices. Alternatively, state-of-the-art methods for phenological metrics' extraction and long time-series analysis techniques of multispectral remote sensing imagery provide a viable solution. In this context, this study aims to characterize the changes over farming systems through trend analysis. To this end, four farming systems (fallow, rainfed, irrigated annual, and irrigated perennial) in arid areas of Morocco were studied based on four phenological metrics (PhM) (i.e., great integral, start, end, and length of the season). These were derived from large Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series using both a machine learning algorithm and a pixel-based change analysis method. Results showed that during the last twenty-year period (i.e., 2000-2019), a significant dynamism of the plant cover was linked to the behavior of farmers who tend to cultivate intensively and to invest in high-income crops. More specifically, a relevant variability in fallow and rainfed areas, closely linked to the weather conditions, was found. In addition, significant lag trends of the start (-6 days) and end (+3 days) were found, which indicate that the length of the season was related to the spatiotemporal variability of rainfall. This study has also highlighted the potential of multitemporal moderate spatial resolution data to accurately monitor agriculture and better manage land resources. In the meantime, for operationally implementing the use of such work in the field, we believe that it is essential consider the perceptions, opinions, and mutual benefits of farmers and stakeholders to improve strategies and synergies whilst ensuring food, welfare, and sustainability.

TI Exploring cost dominance in crop farming systems between high and low
   pesticide use
SO JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY ANALYSIS
AB The purpose of this paper is to assess cost dominance in direct inputs between arable crop-based systems using low or high pesticide levels per hectare. Our investigation departs from a traditional efficiency analysis and aims at comparing two minimal direct cost functions excluding pesticide expenses. This means that we evaluate the gap between two efficient frontiers instead of focusing on individual farm inefficiency scores. Our only objective is to compare two optimal cost benchmarks for systems respectively defined with high or low pesticide levels per hectare by varying their scale and output mix. A robust approach frontier is introduced to control the influence of potential outliers and unobserved heterogeneity. Based on 707 French crop farms observed in 2008, our simulations show that agricultural practices using less pesticide per hectare are unambiguously more cost-competitive in terms of direct inputs while inducing no other substitution costs. This cost dominance is a robust phenomenon regardless of the size and scope of crop activities, which supports more ecofriendly practices.

TI Compatibility of animal husbandry practices of registered organic
   farmers with organic animal husbandry standards (OAHS): an assessment in
   Uttarakhand
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES
AB Organic fanning is increasingly being seen as one sustainable option to farmers, among the alternatives to conventional input intensive farming systems. Uttarakhand in India is promoting organic agriculture state state through registering the farmers and providing them necessary support including marketing in crop sector. However, these registered organic farmers, who maintain two or more than two livestock species under crop-livestock mixed farming systems, not yet geared to organic livestock production per se. As 'organic' is a process claim rather than a product claim, the study on the compatibility of animal husbandry practices of registered organic farmers with the recommended organic livestock production standards, may provide an idea of the existing situation to the stakeholders of organic farming, to explore possibility of organic livestock production in the state. Hence, this study was carried out with 180 registered organic farmers selected from 3 districts of Uttarakhand. Majority of the animal husbandry practices followed by the farmers were favorable to or closer to the recommended organic livestock production standards. Besides, the Indigenous Technical Knowledge (ITK) of registered organic farmers, if scientifically validated, may be further useful towards promoting organic animal husbandry in the state.

TI The Food Security Conundrum of sub-Saharan Africa
SO GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY-AGRICULTURE POLICY ECONOMICS AND ENVIRONMENT
AB National food security in countries of sub-Saharan Africa requires an abundant supply of cheap and nutritious food for the burgeoning population. At the same time agriculture is a major contributor to the balance of payments for African economies. So agricultural production in Africa needs to increase strongly to meet the demands of both national and international markets. Yet fragmentation of land due to population pressure in rural areas, and the low prices farmers are paid for their produce, mean that in many rural areas in sub-Saharan Africa the farms are already too small to provide food security or a living income for the household. There is a high dependency on off-farm income and little incentive to intensify production. Thus rural households are often 'reluctant' farmers, lacking resources or the economic incentives to invest in agriculture. The conundrum that must be addressed is how to provide cheap, nutritious food to feed the growing urban and rural populations while creating incentives to stimulate increased agricultural production. This will require major transformations of the smallholder farming systems alongside creation of alternative employment.

TI Productivity, profitability and efficiency of diversified rice-based
   farming systems in the transmigration villages of Rasau Jaya District in
   West Kalimantan, Indonesia
SO PHILIPPINE AGRICULTURAL SCIENTIST
AB Different diversification schemes are practiced by farmers in the different transmigrant villages of Rasau Jaya District, West Kalimantan, Indonesia. To identify the scheme that best satisfies the farm household goals of food security and continuous cash flows on a sustainable basis, 380 farmers were interviewed using both informal and formal survey methods. Raising annual crops and animals was the most common diversification scheme practiced by 75% of the farmers. Only 24% of the farmers were into annuals + perennials + animals and only very few were into annual crops alone or a combination of annuals and perennials. Ten (10) diversification schemes were practiced by 62% of the farmers and they were evaluated based on various measures of productivity, profitability and efficiency Crop yields, total farm productivity, land use efficiency and net income were highest in the diversification scheme involving Rice + Corn + Cow + Native Chicken (R+C+CW+NC) giving a total adjusted yield of 8.23 t/ha. The slack time of the farm household was fully utilized in this scheme which increased labor use efficiency Rice Yield was highest which led to its highest technical efficiency (TE = 0.86). This was due to the application of composted manure. Without applying composted manure, rice grown under submerged field conditions had low technical efficiency (TE = 0.32-0.44) due to its low yield (0.64-0.87 t/ ha). This is because of the low availability of nutrients in the highly acidic peat soils (pH < 5) of the district. To unlock the adsorbed nutrients, many farmers resorted to burning peat soils which needed spraying of herbicide to initially dry the thick weed biomass to facilitate burning.
   Integrating ruminants in rice-based farming systems as in R+C+CW+NC was found to be the diversification scheme that best satisfies the farm household goals of increased farm productivity, food security and continuous cash flows. This farming system could be the key that would make burning of peat soils impractical, thus, conserving the nutrient-rich peat soils of the transmigration villages of Rasau Jaya District, West Kalimantan, Indonesia for long-term productivity.

TI Bioactive forage and phytotherapy to cure and control endo-parasite
   diseases in sheep and goat farming systems - a review of current
   scientific knowledge
SO LANDBAUFORSCHUNG VOLKENRODE
AB Infestation with gastro- intestinal nematodes (GIN) in small ruminants can cause server economic losses and endanger animal welfare. The development of organic farming systems, the increased public awareness for drug residues in agricultural products and the development of resistant strains of parasites have enforced the search for sustainable alternatives.
   The aim of this review is to summarise the current scientific knowledge of alternative strategies to prevent and control endo-parasitic diseases in organic sheep and goat farming systems. The conducted literature evaluation has revealed the major potential to be within the field of bioactive forages, phytotherapy, homeopathy and copper-oxide wire particles. Alternative management pattern like grazing management, nematophagous fungi, improved fodder and breeding are not considered.
   The administration and cultivation of bioactive forages and phytotherapy are displaying promise potential for endoparasite control in organic sheep and goat farming. Scientific research has mainly concentrated on the extracts of the plant species chicory, Birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus), Sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia), Sulla (Hedysarum coronarium) and Quebracho (Schinopsis ssp.). The analysis of these plants showed all plants to have some positive potential, but also highlighted individual limitations in application. However from the results of this literature review none of the investigated plants have been researched sufficiently in on farm experiments to recommend any for implementation at this stage.
   No concrete recommendation for a single plant can be given, further research on promising species for the commercial use is strongly recommended, as is the review of the law concerning the appliance of plant based remedies.

CY SEP 02-04, 1998
CL WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS

AB The three most westerly states of southern Australia have the largest area of water repellent soils, which limit agricultural production, of any country in the world.
   Simplified principles of the problems caused by repellency and the principles of soil management solutions are considered and related to experimental evidence. The phenomena of diverted soil water flow and isolated dry soil can explain most of the problems caused by repellency. Plant adaptation, soil or hydrophobic removal, reduced soil drying, reduced surface tension, water harvesting, avoidance, masking and, perhaps, water movement along dead root systems are the main soil management principles.
   Dead roots may play a role in zero till cropping systems, allowing more uniform wetting of dry hydrophobic soil at the base of a dead plant and along the dendritic pattern of the dead root system.
   Application of these management principles, especially water harvesting, avoidance and masking (by the use of deep trenching, furrow sowing methods or claying), have made a considerable improvement to sustainability and productivity of farming systems on the water repellent soils of Australia.
   Evidence is selected to assess risks of preferential flow, pesticide concentration and leaching for different agricultural soil management methods. All management methods can have some risks, but claying seems to have the least risk and furrowing the highest risk of encouraging preferential flow, pesticide concentration and leaching.
   It is suggested we have insufficient information and understanding to quantify the risks of groundwater contamination for different environments, farming systems and soil management methods to control repellency.
   There is an urgent need to develop quantified guidelines to minimise any possible groundwater contamination hazard for the extensive areas using farming systems with furrows and increasing amounts of pesticide and fertiliser. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF INSECT PESTS IN AGROECOSYSTEMS: EFFECTS OF CROP
   MANAGEMENT, FARMING SYSTEMS, AND SEMINATURAL HABITATS AT THE LANDSCAPE
   SCALE: A REVIEW
SO ADVANCES IN AGRONOMY, VOL 109
SE Advances in Agronomy
AB There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that the simplification of land uses associated with a strong dependence on agrochemical inputs is decreasing environmental quality, threatening biodiversity, and increasing the likelihood of pest outbreaks. The development of farming systems with greater reliance on ecosystem services, such as biological control of insect pests, should increase the sustainability of agroecosystems. However, the factors responsible for the maintenance or enhancement of natural pest control remain unclear. The goal of this review is, therefore, to expose which elements, from the field to the landscape scale, influence natural enemy populations and pest regulation. We present here the principal effects of seminatural habitats, farming systems, and crop management on the abundance of insect pests and their biological control, with a view to evaluating their relative importance and identifying key elements that regulate natural pest control interactions. Because of the range of spatial and temporal scales experienced by these organisms, we advocate, in studies investigating trophic relations and biological pest control, a clear description of cropping systems and an explicit consideration of seminatural habitats and more generally of the surrounding landscape. Through this review, we also indicate gaps in knowledge and demonstrate the interest of linking agronomy and landscape ecology to understand trophic interactions, maximize natural pest control, and limit pesticide applications. Quantifying the relative importance of both local and landscape scales is a fundamental step in the design and assessment of ecologically sound integrated pest management strategies for farmers.

TI Soil quality and phosphorus status after nine years of organic and
   conventional farming at two input levels in the Central Highlands of
   Kenya
SO GEODERMA
AB Under temperate climate conditions, organic farming systems show improved soil quality compared to non-organic systems, whereas little long-term research on the impact of organic farming on soil quality has been conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. Within the system comparison (SysCom) project, two long-term field experiments were set up in 2007 in the sub-humid Central Highlands of Kenya to compare organic and conventional farming at two input levels (high input systems with recommended rates of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and pesticides and with irrigation vs. rain-fed low input systems with low N, P and pesticides), with a similar design at both sites. The two sites differ mainly in their inherent soil properties and in the amount and distribution of rainfall. At the end of each three-year crop rotation period, we analyzed a set of chemical, biological and physical soil quality parameters in 0-20 cm soil depth. After nine years, microbial parameters seemed to have reached a steady state, whereas chemical parameters were still changing. Most soil quality parameters were highest under the high input organic farming system. The high input conventional system performed well in preserving several soil quality indicators, but a trend for acidification and the lack of soil carbon build-up raise concerns about the long-term sustainability of the system. Low input organic and conventional farming systems did not improve soil quality and even showed decreasing trends in several chemical parameters. Total and available P accumulated over time, especially in both high input systems, suggesting increasing risks of losses to the environment. Pronounced site effects revealed strong interactions with pedo-climatic conditions, with soil quality under high input organic farming improving to a greater extent at the site with more favorable conditions. Besides effects on soil quality, important criteria for sustainable input levels are thus the general availability of inputs, resulting nutrient input output budgets as well as interactions of inputs with inherent soil properties.

TI LCA and emergy accounting of aquaculture systems: Towards ecological
   intensification
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB An integrated approach is required to optimise fish farming systems by maximising output while minimising their negative environmental impacts. We developed a holistic approach to assess the environmental performances by combining two methods based on energetic and physical flow analysis. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a normalised method that estimates resource use and potential impacts throughout a product's life cycle. Emergy Accounting (EA) refers the amount of energy directly or indirectly required by a product or a service. The combination of these two methods was used to evaluate the environmental impacts of three contrasting fish-farming systems: a farm producing salmon in a recirculating system (RSF), a semi-extensive polyculture pond (PF1) and an extensive polyculture pond (PF2). The RSF system, with a low feed-conversion ratio (FCR = 0.95), had lower environmental impacts per tonne of live fish produced than did the two pond farms, when the effects on climate change, acidification, total cumulative energy demand, land competition and water dependence were considered. However, RSF was clearly disconnected from the surrounding environment and depended highly on external resources (e.g. nutrients, energy). Ponds adequately incorporated renewable natural resources but had higher environmental impacts due to incomplete use of external inputs. This study highlighted key factors necessary for the successful ecological intensification of fish farming, i.e., minimise external inputs, lower the FCR, and increase the use of renewable resources from the surrounding environment. The combination of LCA and EA seems to be a practical approach to address the complexity of optimising biophysical efficiency in aquaculture systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Organic Farming as an Innovative Farming System Development Model toward
   Sustainable Agriculture in Bali
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Organic farming has been promoted and developed in Bali since 2006 by the government in collaboration with private businesses and certification bodies. This research aimed to synthesize the development of Balinese organic production as an effort toward sustainable agriculture. Data from the in-depth interview and critical review were analyzed. As of 2012, the following have been certified as organic farms: 22 groups of food crop and horticulture farms such as rice/red rice, vegetables, flowers, salak, grape, mangosteen, papaya, banana, ginger, red onion, and mushroom; 8 groups of cashew farms; and 7 groups of coffee farms. The Balinese organic production systems are potentially sustainable since the sustainability criteria were fulfilled. Many constraint factors affect organic production in Bali, including limited organic fertilizer sources, limited fresh irrigation water resource, certification budget availability, and buyers who are willing to pay a premium for organic products. Success in removing the constraint factors would pave the way for sustainable organic agriculture in Bali.

TI SOME ASPECTS OF THE ROLE OF ORGANIC-MATTER IN SUSTAINABLE INTENSIFIED
   ARABLE FARMING SYSTEMS IN THE WEST-AFRICAN SEMI-ARID-TROPICS (SAT)
SO FERTILIZER RESEARCH
AB In this paper the role of organic manure in intensified farming systems in the SAT of West-Africa is discussed.  Different aspects are treated:  its function as a source of plant nutrients, its effects on soil physical and on soil chemical properties.  It is concluded that often the major effect is through increased nutrient supply, but that in combination with chemical fertilizer - particularly nitrogen - it serves to counteract the negative effects of these fertilizers, particularly acidification and the increased removal of nutrients other than the one applied in the fertilizer.
   Insufficient organic material appears to be available to realize the required production increase and prevent the negative effects of nitrogen fertilizers.  However, application of chemical fertilizer alone can lead to sustainable production systems provided export and losses of all nutrient elements are sufficiently compensated and acidification is avoided by using the correct type of nitrogen fertilizer, possibly in combination with liming.

TI Integrated multi-enterprise agricultural system for sustaining
   livelihood, energy use and resource recycling: a case study from
   semi-arid tropics of central India
SO AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB Integrated farming system (IFS) has been the way of life of agrarian people in semi-arid tropics (SAT) of India and other developing countries. However, there has been losing links between crops and livestock in the recent past due to promotion of mono- or double-crop-based intensive agricultural production systems owing to compulsions of hunger and poverty. Such farming practices resulted in issues of sustainability and economic viability due to stagnant productivity, deteriorating soil health, risk of failure of mono-cropping, absence of by-product and resource recycling, etc. Therefore, a study was planned during 2014-2018 involving multiple enterprises like food crops, agroforestry (fruits + vegetables), forage, livestock and water harvesting-cum-fish production to enhance productivity, profitability, energy efficiency, resource recycling and soil health. The IFS model of one hectare size besides producing multiple products (grains, fruit, vegetable, fodder, milk, fish, etc.) also resulted in US$ 1671/year net return with a benefit cost ratio of 1.58 and generated 293 man-days/year employment as against US$ 1287 net return and 119 man-days in groundnut-wheat cropping system. Energy efficiency, net energy gain and energy profitability were observed higher in groundnut-wheat cropping system. However, the share of indirect energy (71%) and renewable energy (67%) was more in IFS making it more self-reliant and sustainable. The IFS approach ensured round the year supply of income and a farmer can get approximately 265 to 597 US$ every month while he gets income only twice a year by adopting double cropping. Further, nearly 10.22 tonnes of farm yard manure and 2.5 tonnes of farm compost were recycled under IFS that improved soil health as compared to the double cropping. The study concluded that the IFS approach is capable of producing multiple products, improving productivity, profitability, employment opportunities, soil health and sustaining livelihood in vulnerable ecologies like SAT of central India and other parts of the world.

SP Int Soc Horticultural Sci
AB In Ethiopia, horticultural crops offer a strong pathway to nutrition security. However, leveraging this potential requires a shift from a mono-cropping system to a more diversified production system. Integrating appropriate horticultural crops into farming systems appears to be feasible, increasing nutrition security, diversifying and intensifying agriculture and reducing pressure on natural habitats in biodiversity hotspots. The objectives of this paper are to analyze vegetable value chains and to examine the performance of actors in the chain as well as to assess and analyze the challenges and opportunities for vegetable production, marketing and consumption. The study was undertaken in two districts (Yayu and Hurumu) of the Yayu biosphere reserve area. Data were collected from both primary and secondary sources. The study identified that vegetable crops have a comparative nutrition security advantage over the production of other crops and can offer alternatives to the coffee-based economy. However, vegetable crop development is constrained by a multitude of technological, socio-economic and institutional challenges. The major challenges are: the lack of diversified or nutrition-sensitive farming systems; lack of improved technologies; weak collaboration between agricultural and health offices; traditional management practices; pests and diseases; poor postharvest management; and a lack of knowledge in nutrition-sensitive value chain approaches. There is a need to reshape the current production system into a more nutrition-diversified system. In addition, changing traditional production practices and beliefs about vegetables through intensive social behavioral change strategies are of paramount importance. Moreover, there is a need to strengthen vertical and horizontal linkages between vegetable value chain actors in the study area.

TI Resilience of the pastoral component of Moroccan small ruminant systems
   in mountain areas
SO RANGELAND JOURNAL
AB Small ruminant farming is the main rural occupation in mountain areas of Morocco. This activity is subject to numerous pressures, including repeated climatic hazards that modify pastoral resource availability and trigger changes in production systems. This study aimed to identify and analyse changes in availability and utilisation of pastoral resources acknowledged by farmers over the past 40 years for the small ruminant farming systems of the Central High Atlas region of Morocco. We hypothesised, on the basis of previous research, that resilience of the pastoral component of such systems increases with elevation. We interviewed 50 farmers in three municipalities of Azilal province, at moderate (800-1400 m), medium (1400-1800 m) and high (1800-3000 m) elevations. In the 1970-1980s, pastoral resources were abundant and mobile flocks grazed collective rangelands. Subsequently, repeated droughts and the increased stock numbers promoted by agricultural policies led to the deterioration of resource abundance and quality, especially palatable plants. At moderate elevations, wooded areas and phytomass declined; erosion occurred at high elevations. Traditional systems diversified by including agricultural activities. At moderate elevations, livestock farming intensified, with the adoption of a productive breed, concentrate distribution and the grazing of fallow land. Currently, flock mobility is limited and rangelands provide less than 60% of sheep requirements. At high elevations, the pastoral component persisted at the cost of a diversification of pastoral areas and greater flock mobility. Rangelands are still collectively managed and provide almost 90% of sheep requirements. Since rangelands remain a major feed source, changes in pastoral resources can be considered as a major driver of change in livestock systems. The sustainability of small ruminant farming systems at these elevations thus depends on the conservation of rangeland.

TI Exploring Agroecological Sustainability: Unearthing Innovators and
   Documenting a Community of Practice in Southeast Australia
SO SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES
AB In this article we describe a movement to regenerate and sustainably use native grasslands using innovative grazing and cropping strategies. We find that this movement has the essential characteristics of a community of practice (COP) and is a strong example of a bottom-up transition toward a sustainable agroecological farming system. This COP was identified and described using participatory rural appraisals followed by biophysical and sociocultural studies with active COP members. Using these multiple mixed-method approaches helped characterize the COP's many layers, revealing how and why it is driven and fashioned by innovators who collaborate via joint enterprise, mutual engagement, and shared repertoire. Holistic Management, Grazing for Profit, and Stipa Native Grasses Association were the key enabling programs/associations for the COP, which, like other agroecological movements, exists on the margins of conventional agri-innovation systems and endures with little public acknowledgment or support. It is a potent grass-roots example of adaptive farm management that generates optimism in the farming families involved, and challenges existing research and extension paradigms regarding both innovation and practice change.

TI Infiltration and soil water storage under winter cover cropping in
   California's Sacramento Valley
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE
AB Winter cover cropping on agricultural fields may improve rainfall infiltration and enhance soil water storage in areas such as California's Sacramento Valley, where the majority of precipitation occurs in the winter over a relatively short period of time in a series of heavy, rainfall events. Enhanced soil water storage within the root Zone on cover-cropped fields may benefit a grower by reducing the demand for surface water deliveries to meet the irrigation needs of subsequent crops. A study was conducted in the winters of 1998-1999 and 1999-2000 to determine afield's ability to conserve water for subsequent crops and to evaluate the effects of soil physical conditions on the water balance for three 4-year rotation farming systems within the Sustainable Agriculture Farming Systems (SAFS) Project at the University of California, Davis, Rainfall, runoff, and soil water content data was collected on two treatments using a winter cover crop and one treatment maintained fallow during the winter Runoff and soil water content measurements were significantly affected by farming systems.
   Cumulative event runoff from 10.67 m(2) infiltration test areas was consistently, higher on the fallow treatment than on the cover-cropped treatments. Winter 1999-2000 field water content measurements from 0-1.05 in depth were significantly higher in the cover-cropped systems than in the fallow treatment after field capacity, had been reached. A hydrologic model was developed using the measured data and lysimeter data for evaporation and evapotranspiration to track daily, water budget components (i.e., runoff, infiltration, evaporation, evapotranspiration, and soil water storage) and to assess changes in surface hydraulic conductivity,. Model simulations showed that optimized hydraulic conductivity decreased for all treatments with successive runoff, but was less pronounced in cover-cropped plots. The study, indicated that cover cropping can improve soil water storage for subsequent crops if the cover crop is destroyed before the additional soil water is lost as evapotranspiration.

TI Eighteen-Year Farming Management Moderately Shapes the Soil Microbial
   Community Structure but Promotes Habitat-Specific Taxa
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB Soil microbes have critical influence on the productivity and sustainability of agricultural ecosystems, yet the magnitude and direction to which management practices affect the soil microbial community remain unclear. This work aimed to examine the impacts of three farming systems, conventional grain cropping (CON), organic grain cropping (ORG), and grain cropping-pasture rotation (ICL), on the soil microbial community structure and putative gene abundances of N transformations using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene and ITS sequencing approaches. Two additional systems, a forest plantation (PF) and an abandoned agricultural field subject to natural succession (SUC), were also included for better assessment of the soil microbial community in terms of variation scale and regulatory importance of management intensity vs. plant type. Farming systems significantly affected the biodiversity of soil fungi but not bacteria, with Shannon index being the lowest in ORG. Bacterial and fungal communities in three cropping systems clustered and separated from those in PF and SUC, suggesting that management practices as such played minor roles in shaping the soil microbial community compared to plant type (i.e., woody vs. herbaceous plants). However, management practices prominently regulated habitat-specific taxa. Lecanoromycetes, a class of Ascomycota accounted for similar to 10% of total fungal population in ORG, but almost nil in the other four systems. ORG also enriched bacteria belonging to the phyla, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, and Gemmatimonadetes. Further, PICRUSt predicted that N-cycle community compositions varied with farming systems; compared to CON, ORG and ICL were more divergent from PF and SUC. Soil pH, together with inorganic N, extractable organic C, and soil organic C: N ratio explained < 50% of the total variations in both bacterial and fungal communities. Our data indicates that while moderately affecting the overall structure of the soil microbial community, management practices, particularly fertilization and the source of N (synthetic vs. organic), were important in regulating the presence and abundance of habitat-specific taxa.

AB The search for economically viable ley pastures in the Australian tropics is an attempt to emulate the successful ley farming systems, based on subclover and wheat, in regions with Mediterranean and temperate climates in southern Australia.
   The paper examines experimental legume ley pastures in the semi-arid tropics from four points of view, viz - initial establishment and re-establishment of the various ley species after a crop; the contribution of biological nitrogen from the ley to the farming system; the control of pasture species during the crop phase; and the feeding value of ley pastures and crop residues to grazing cattle.
   Management problems highlighted by the research on experimental ley pastures include:  grass dominance in the pasture; the extremely rapid decomposition of legume residues and the resultant leaching of mineral nitrogen beyond the root front of the developing crop; and the lack of sufficient crop and pasture residues in some seasons for successful crop establishment using no-till methods.
   The adequacy of existing genetic resources for ley pastures in this region, the biological and economic sustainability of tropical ley systems, and the prospects for commercial use of the experimental results, are also examined.

TI Vertical farming systems bring new considerations for pest and disease

SO ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY
AB Vertical farming is an emerging area of food production that aims to provide sustainable intensification of agriculture by maximising the obtainable yield per unit area of land. This approach commonly utilises stacked horizontal levels of crop growth in glasshouse or controlled environment (CE) facilities. Vertical farming has, however, received relatively little scientific investigation to date. Consequently, important factors such as economic feasibility, system design and optimisation of production methods are still being evaluated. Vertical farming methods bring additional considerations for the effective management of pests and diseases compared with conventional protected horticulture, such as movement of both pest and beneficial insects between growth levels. This article aims to provide a perspective on the positive and negative issues facing pest and disease control in Vertical farming systems. We highlight important considerations for system optimisation and areas for future investigation.

TI Diversified Farming Systems: An Agroecological, Systems-based
   Alternative to Modern Industrial Agriculture
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB This Special Issue on Diversified Farming Systems is motivated by a desire to understand how agriculture designed according to whole systems, agroecological principles can contribute to creating a more sustainable, socially just, and secure global food system. We first define Diversified Farming Systems (DFS) as farming practices and landscapes that intentionally include functional biodiversity at multiple spatial and/or temporal scales in order to maintain ecosystem services that provide critical inputs to agriculture, such as soil fertility, pest and disease control, water use efficiency, and pollination. We explore to what extent DFS overlap or are differentiated from existing concepts such as sustainable, multifunctional, organic or ecoagriculture. DFS are components of social-ecological systems that depend on certain combinations of traditional and contemporary knowledge, cultures, practices, and governance structures. Further, as ecosystem services are generated and regenerated within a DFS, the resulting social benefits in turn support the maintenance of the DFS, enhancing its ability to provision these services sustainably. We explore how social institutions, particularly alternative agri-food networks and agrarian movements, may serve to promote DFS approaches, but note that such networks and movements have other primary goals and are not always explicitly connected to the environmental and agroecological concerns embodied within the DFS concept. We examine global trends in agriculture to investigate to what extent industrialized forms of agriculture are replacing former DFS, assess the current and potential contributions of DFS to food security, food sovereignty and the global food supply, and determine where and under what circumstances DFS are expanding rather than contracting.

AB This article describes a preliminary study of an on-going ARPA-E (Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy) MARINER Phase I project. The hydrodynamic load and dynamic response of an innovative offshore macroalgae cultivation system, Nautical Offshore Macroalgal Autonomous Device (NOMAD), under extreme environmental conditions is examined. The high strength, extremely durable, recyclable carbon fiber (rCF) free-floating long-line is applied with polyculture (Nereocystis luetkeana (bull kelp) and Saccharina latissima (sugar kelp)) in the NOMAD system. This novel macroalgal farming system is designed to free float from Washington State to California along the west coast of the US to avoid anchoring costs and the failure of earlier offshore growth trials. In this study, we expect to identify possible failure modes for the preliminarily design of NOMAD free-floating long-line macroalgal farming system based on the preliminary numerical predictions. We developed a 1km system-scale NOMAD free-floating long-line numerical model and performed a dynamic response analysis on the long-line to determine the behaviors of the long-line under extreme environmental conditions. The 1km free-floating rCF long-line responses very flexible due to wave and current activities even for large bending stiffness. Therefore, the potential entanglement of free-floating long-line on a global scale may cause the system failure even when the tensions and bending moments are in the safe range. Three cases include 10m NOMAD free-floating long-line with sugar kelp, bull kelp, and polyculture numerical models are developed, and the simulation results are analyzed. The tensions at the holdfast of the kelps in these cases are found to be below the breakage limit approximately. However, the severe clumping of the kelps and potential entanglement of adjacent lines may result in damage to the farming system.

TI Optimising biological N-2 fixation by legumes in farming systems
SO PLANT AND SOIL
AB Whether grown as pulses for grain, as green manure, as pastures or as the tree components of agro-forestry systems, the value of leguminous crops lies in their ability to fix atmospheric N-2, so reducing the use of expensive fertiliser-N and enhancing soil fertility. N-2 fixing legumes provide the basis for developing sustainable farming systems that incorporate integrated nutrient management. By exploiting the stable nitrogen isotope N-15, it has been possible to reliably measure rates of N-2 fixation in a wide range of agro-ecological field situations involving many leguminous species. The accumulated data demonstrate that there is a wealth of genetic diversity among legumes and their Rhizobium symbionts which can be used to enhance N-2 fixation. Practical agronomic and microbiological means to maximise N inputs by legumes have also been identified.

TI Effects of organic vs. conventional farming system on yield and quality
   of strawberry grown as an annual or biennial crop in southern Italy
SO SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE
AB Organic foods represent a significant market segment within the global food industry, since these products are often believed to be safer and more nutritious than their conventional counterparts. Due to the growing importance of organic strawberry cultivation for several agricultural areas in Italy, we carried out a four year research (2008-2011) on Fragaria x ananassa grown under tunnel in Campania (southern Italy), with the purpose of assessing the effects of two farming systems (organic or conventional) combined with propagation material (fresh or cold stored plants) and crop duration (annual or biennial) on yield and quality. The experimental treatments were randomized in a split-plot design, assigning the farming systems to the main plots and the propagation material in factorial combination with the crop duration to the subplots, with three replicates.
   The conventional system produced the highest yield, as a consequence of the higher fruit number per plant, while the organic management resulted in increased berry mean weight. Organic fruits showed higher values of dry and optical residue and higher content of glucose, sucrose, vitamin C and beta-carotene but lower nitrate. Fresh plant crops produced a lower yield than the cold stored ones; moreover, the fruit production of fresh plants was higher when grown as an annual crops compared with a biennial cycle, independently on the farming system. In the case of cold stored plants, no yield differences were recorded between annual and biennial cultivations under conventional management, whereas organic crops from cold stored plants showed higher yields as annual crops compared with the biennial cycle. Fruit dry residue as well as sucrose, malic acid and mineral element content attained higher values in the fruits harvested from biennial crops than from the annual ones.
   The choice of organic system as an alternative to the conventional practice could be justified by the better fruit quality, lower environmental impact and higher market prices. Moreover, the biennial crop duration could be a cost effective option when the crop is started from cold stored plants under organic management. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sustainable land use and management requires an understanding of the processes of recharge, discharge and salt movement across the landscape. Evaluation of land use changes on different parts of the catchment requires the application of farming system models in a catchment context to assess the implications of different scenarios on water and salt balance of the catchment. In this study we have developed a spatial modelling framework capable of incorporating farming system models (I-D) applied to land units with hydrological (lateral) connections between adjacent units in a catchment. The framework was applied to Simmons Creek catchment, a sub-catchment of the Billabong Creek in southern NSW comprising gentle uplands and substantial low relief areas containing swamps. An integrated approach incorporating soil, hydrology, hydrogeology, and terrain analysis resulted in interpretation of landscape function and the necessary parameterisation of the modelling framework. APSIM was used as the fanning system model in this study with SOILWAT2 as the soil water balance module, modified for lateral flow connections (surface and subsurface flows). Current land use (crop rotation and pasture) and an alternative land use (10% trees on uphill units and pasture in the lower lying lands) were simulated. The results of the modelling showed the relative contribution of parts of the catchment in total recharge. Comparison between current and alternative land use over 44 years of simulations indicated a decrease of mean annual drainage from 39 to 29 mm/yr and an average reduction of the groundwater level of about 0.4 m. More substantial decrease in water table depth would require targeted tree planting over larger areas. These can be investigated further with the spatial framework.

TI Seed exchanges, a key to analyze crop diversity dynamics in farmer-led
   on-farm conservation
SO GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION
AB Sustainable management of genetic resources is a crucial issue in the global context of food security. On-farm conservation is now widely acknowledged as a relevant strategy to reach this goal because it maintains evolutionary forces within and between the different components of the agricultural system. Seed exchanges between farmers play a key role in this process but are complicated to study over different agricultural contexts. This review begins by illustrating how interdisciplinary approaches combining ethnobotany and genetics helps provide a detailed analysis of the role of social and genetic dynamic interactions related to seed exchanges in traditional farming systems with farmer-led on-farm conservation. Secondly, the evolution of crop genetic diversity management is described in the context of industrialized farming systems. We follow the evolution of crop biodiversity perception by involved actors using a socio-historical perspective. After the agricultural shift from a traditional to a productivist model, recent social developments such as citizen science and participatory research movements are emerging and are strongly concerned by the question of biodiversity. These emerging trends which recognize and value seed exchanges between farmers show similarities to farmer-to-farmer seed exchanges in traditional farming systems. To what extent are these systems comparable? To fully benefit from studies in both traditional and industrialized contexts, it will be critical to develop an interdisciplinary framework to rigorously compare seed exchange systems and more generally farmer-led on-farm conservation strategies in diverse agricultural systems.

TI Environmentally sustainable production of food, feed and fuel from
   natural resources in the tropics
SO TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB Responding to the challenges posed by global warming, peak oil and biofuels will require a paradigm shift in the practice of agriculture and in the role of live stock within the farming system. Farming systems should aim at maximizing plant biomass production from locally available diversified resources, processing of the biomass on farm to provide food, feed and energy and recycling of all waste materials. The approach that is the subject of this paper is that the generation of electricity can be a by-product of food/feed production. The concept is the fractionation of biomass into inedible cell wall material that can be converted to an inflammable gas by gasification, the gas in turn being the source of fuel for internal combustion engines driving electrical generators. The cell contents and related structures such as tree leaves are used as human food or animal feed. As well as providing food and feed the model is highly appropriate for decentralized small scale production of electricity in rural areas. It also offers opportunities for sequestration of carbon in the form of biochar the solid residue remaining after gasification of the biomass.

AB This paper describes the contexts in which pasture and forage legumes are used. it points out that the main use of legumes in the Mediterranean basin is on the communally-owned grasslands, and that improvement of these grasslands are constrained by socio-economic factors. However, pasture and forage legumes also have roles to play in arable land where, especially in dry areas, they have the potential to replace fallow in cereal-producing farming systems through their capacity to fix nitrogen. Examples of both grassland and fallow improvement are given.
   In contrast to the Mediterranean basin annual legumes are used widely in southern Australia in a 'ley farming system'. Ley farming consists of consecutive phases of pasture and crop where the pasture regenerates spontaneously. It is a modification of the north African weedy fallow system except that annual legumes have largely replaced weeds. It is based on two groups of species: subterranean clover and the annual medics. Unfortunately ley farming has become unsustainable in southern Australia in four ways: it uses insufficient water resulting in rising water tables and dryland salinity: it results in soil acidification because of the leaching of excess nitrate and the removal of cations during cropping; an increased dependence on herbicides has resulted in herbicide resistant weeds; and finally there is widespread pasture deterioration due to many factors operating independently and together.
   Several remedies are proposed. The first requires the introduction of perennial species to increase water use. While some species are available and likely to be suitable there is a need for new germplasm especially for acid soils. Phase farming is likely to replace ley farming where longer periods of pasture are required and this will require new germplasm of which the seed can be produced cheaply. Aerial seeding clovers, of which there are many, and new genera such as Ornithopus and Biserrula will be of value. Finally, to arrest pasture deterioration two remedies are proposed: firstly the use of species mixtures in which the components use a range of reproductive strategies; and secondly the selection of species that are widespread in the Mediterranean basin. In addition to being widespread the latter are often dominant in the most arid environments, those environments which, in Australia, have proven to be the most intractable.
   It is concluded that new germplasm is needed in both the Mediterranean basin and in Australia and that the Mediterranean basin is a rich source of new germplasm.

TI Agriculture extensification and associated socio-ecological trade-offs
   in smallholder farming systems of Zambia
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB One of the main drivers of deforestation in Zambia is the expansion of agricultural land for increasing production areas and for shift cultivation due to poor crop management practices. Land expansion was also echoed by farmers in Northwestern province as they aim to increase yield via land expansion. It was therefore important to understand possible associated socio-ecological trade-offs in agricultural extensification and identify pathways to improve ecosystem services delivery and reduce trade-offs. We used the Tradeoff Analysis model for Multi-Dimensional (TOA-MD) and Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) to assess trade-offs in both current and future farming systems under extensification (CP) and sustainable agriculture intensification (SAI). Thirty-year simulations showed that agricultural extensification will lead to loss of soil organic carbon) and total soil nitrogen of about 23% and 22%, respectively leading to yield reductions of about 35% and increased poverty levels. However, SAI approach results showed that poverty can be reduced by about 20% for farmers with land holdings of 3 ha while those with 2 and 5 ha can be reduced by 10% and 5% respectively. The proposed SAI has potential to reduce poverty, maintain good current and future crop production, and potentially aid farmers to reduce opening new fields.

AB It is an agricultural tradition in Gadchiroli district of Maharashtra to make large ponds within paddy fields. These water bodies, locally known as bodis, serve the purpose of storing rainwater. Besides irrigating the paddy crop, the water in the bodi may be used for fish culture. A bodi-based farming system having greater diversification with ducks, poultry, fishery, fruit trees, vegetable cultivation and vermicompost-making was designed and analysed for production, income and employment. The study was carried out in two farms having bodis of 0.40 and 0.28 ha, respectively, in BAIF-MITTRA's Etapalli project villages of Tumargunda and Gurupalli in Gadchiroli district of Maharashtra during 2012-13. Preliminary results indicated that the integrated bodi-based farming system can generate an income of more than Rs. 60,000. The main income, as expected, was in the rainy season, but there were occasional returns during the rest of the year as well.

TI Sustainability of pasture-based livestock farming systems in the
   European Mediterranean context: Synergies and trade-offs
SO LIVESTOCK SCIENCE
AB The sustainability of livestock farming systems (LFS) in relation to global concerns about climate change, population dynamics and the quality of the agro-ecosystem services that are provided to society and their trade-offs has become a fundamental issue for public and scientific debate. However. LFS differ widely in terms of the use of resources, degree of intensification, species and orientation of production, local/regional socio-economic and market context, cultural roles, etc. Therefore, we need to disaggregate livestock farming systems when analysing any aspect of sustainability.
   This paper discusses low-input pasture-based farming systems (meat sheep and beef cattle) located in mountainous and other less favoured areas of the European Mediterranean basin. We first describe their recent evolution in terms of the level of intensification and structural, economic, social and environmental factors at the farm level, paying special attention to critical points of sustainability. Despite the diversity encountered, there are some common factors that threaten their future, such as an excessive dependency on premiums, the lack of generational turnover due to a number of increasingly influential social factors and a continuous process of abandonment of large marginal areas and concentration in more favourable areas. Next, we depict some relevant synergies and trade-offs between a number of factors that we have previously described, taking into account the wider socio-economic environment in which farms operate. Pasture-based LFS can satisfy societal demands (for public goods such as landscape and biodiversity or ethical concerns about food production) and are less vulnerable to market changes. However, they are not paid for the environmental services they deliver, they suffer displacement by other economic activities, and they are very sensitive to climate change scenarios. We also point out a number of options for designing and implementing more sustainable pasture-based LFS under very uncertain circumstances; the concepts of resilience, adaptive capacity and self-sufficiency are discussed within this context. Finally, we summarise some areas for future research: -valuation and integration of positive externalities of pasture-based LFS in an analytical sustainability frameworks and management tools, -assessment of the diversity of systems, the impact they generate and the public goods they deliver, -analysis of complex relationships between intensification of production, dependence on off-farm/on-farm inputs, productivity and working conditions, -consideration of the social factors that determine continuity and working conditions, -and the necessity of performing dynamic studies that allow the understanding and anticipation of change.

TI SUSTAINABILITY IN PERSPECTIVE - STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF FARMING
   SYSTEMS RESEARCH IN CONTRIBUTING TO A SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB This paper describes issues that face practitioners of farming systems research-extension (FSRE) as they address issues of the sustainability of agriculture. First, several major interpretations of ''sustainable agriculture'' are discussed; then categories of sustainability problems are presented. Causes of unsustainability are then discussed, with a focus on the interacting roles of population pressure on resources, population growth, poverty, policy, and institutional concerns. Finally, four potential contributions of FSRE towards the sustainability of agriculture are defined and described: ''direct,'' ''adaptive,'' ''policy-oriented,'' and ''preventive'' contributions. FSRE has focused on ''direct'' farm- or community-level interventions, but the ''preventive'' contributions of new agricultural technology developed outside of FSRE have been more powerful in the past, and are likely to remain so in the future. New technology ''prevents'' resource degradation when it: helps alleviate poverty, generates additional off-farm employment and facilitates expanded food production on smaller harvested areas, thus reducing pressures on fragile lands and forest margins. Reasons are presented why FSRE is likely, at best, to make only a limited contribution to agricultural sustainability.

AB As the control of any disease is most effective and economical if addressed at its onset, there is a need to detect potential epidemics before they decrease yields in sustainable farming systems. Diagnostic tests to detect plant pathogens are now based on a number of diverse technologies, yet to be effective a procedure must be simple, accurate, rapid and safe to perform, and be sensitive enough to avoid 'false positives'. These technologies have developed as considerable skill is required to identify, quantify or even detect the presence of pathogens at the start of an outbreak even when the final symptoms of a disease are frequently conspicuous. Although highly sensitive methods of diagnosis may not be as fast or simple as the conventional Visual examination of crop plants for disease symptoms, little training is required to generate routinely reliable results. Since no method of identifying pathogens or diseases is unrivalled in both reliability and simplicity, many diagnostic methods will probably continue to co-exist in some form in the future. In practice, different methods of diagnosing plant disease are often used in a complementary way rather than as alternatives. It is uncertain how much the traditional methods, such as identification by visual inspection of pathogens in situ or in vitro in pure cultures by microscopic examination, will decline as methods based on the molecular biology of pathogens become more prevalent. Electronic communication and retrieval systems are also likely to become useful. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Contribution of agroecological farming systems to the delivery of
   ecosystem services
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Agroecology has been suggested as a promising concept for reconciling agricultural production and environmental sustainability by optimizing ecological processes that deliver ecosystem services (ES) to replace external inputs. While this statement is widely agreed upon, few assessments of real-life conditions exist that assess multiple ES simultaneously. This paper provides an assessment of seven ES based on 14 indicators in three agroecological farming systems (AFS) and thirteen of their adjacent conventional fanning systems (CFS). Based on field-scale measurements spread over three years, our findings suggest that the studied AFS succeed in providing a wider array of regulating services than their neighboring CFS. Soil aggregate stability and soil respiration rates are in general more supported in AFS, which also show lower pest abundance. On the other hand, CFS show higher grain production and higher performance for two out of three fodder quality indices. While this 'productivity gap' may be due to the still-evolving state of the studied AFS, we nuance this through the lens of an emerging paradigm to assess farming system multi-performance. It is now argued that we need to shift from a volume-focused production system to a system that also values the ecological processes underpinning crop production and other benefits to society. Based on our findings, we recommend future work to iterate our initiative, including several indicators per service and embed these into a wider context of co-adaptive science-practice to further develop context-specific and user-useful research.

AB Alternative farming systems are used to cultivate high quality food products and retain the viability and fertility of soil. The field experiments of different farming systems were conducted at Joniskelis Experimental Station of the Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry in 2006-2013. The soil of the experimental site was Endocalcari-Endohypogleyic Cambisol (CMg-n-w-can).
   In different farming systems, farmyard manure, straw and green manure catch crops used for fertilization both in the soil low in soil organic matter and in the moderate in soil organic matter. In the 0-20 cm depth layer it had a more significant effect on soil moisture than on other physical soil properties. In the agricultural systems, in which catch crops had been grown, soil physical characteristics did not differ significantly before their biomass incorporation, except for the moisture content, which was lower in rainy periods and higher in drier periods than in the soil without catch crops. Soil bulk density and porosity in the topsoil layer were more dependent on soil organic matter content than on agricultural measures used: in the moderate in soil organic matter content, compared with the low in soil organic matter, bulk density was by 1.4 % lower, and porosity by 1.8 % higher.
   The research findings create a possibility to make improvements in alternative cropping systems by choosing organic fertilizers and catch crops' combinations that have sustainable effect on soil and that maintain sustainability of soil productivity parameters. Rational fertilization systems, securing stability of soil productivity parameters and crop rotation productivity will promote development of organic agriculture.

TI Long-term impact of fertilizer sources on cyclic P budget and soil P
   status under ley farming system
SO NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS
AB Optimal phosphorus (P) management is essential in order to achieve sustainable crop production under ley farming system. Manure-based fertilizer represents an alternative to mineral fertilizer to produce forage across tillage systems. Our objective was to investigate the effects of mineral fertilizer [MIN] vs. liquid dairy manure [LDM]) and chisel plough [CP] vs. moldboard plough [MP] on soil P dynamics under a long-term ley farming system. Cumulative P inputs, P offtake and P budget were determined by summing cyclic values across eight 3-yr cycles (1993-2016). Soil test P was determined across six 3-yr cycles (1999-2016) by the Mehlich3 method. Crop P offtake was similar between CP and MP or between LDM and MIN. Phosphorus inputs accumulated across cycles were higher under LDM (65-610 kg P ha(-1)) than under MIN (54-446 kg P ha(-1)). The cumulative P budget ranged from - 20 to + 150 kg P ha(-1) with LDM and from - 33 to + 3 kg P ha(-1) with MIN. Despite a tend of decrease of Mehlich3P in upper layers, a higher accumulation in the 0-0.15 m soil depth under MIN than LDM, and under CP than MP was observed. Discrepancies between P budget and soil test P highlighted the complex mechanisms regulating P cycling. Our findings suggest the importance of complete assessment of soil P reserves in soil profile to sustain P management. Long-term experiment is a useful tool for monitoring effects of agricultural practices on soil P dynamics.

TI Farming systems of the Loess Plateau, Gansu Province, China
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB Gansu Province in north western China contains a large portion of China's rural poor. Within this province we compared extant farming systems in lower and higher rainfall areas of the Loess Plateau. The farming systems were dominated by subsistence winter wheat production in the higher rainfall more productive area (Qingyang), and subsistence spring wheat in the lower rainfall less productive area (Dingxi). Once household grain production is satisfied, remaining land is allocated to cash crop and livestock enterprises. Similar farm sizes (ca. 1 ha) in both areas meant that farmers in the more productive Qingyang area were easily able to meet household food needs and produce more cash income from sale of produce. They have reinvested this into their farms and are now developing new enterprises, particularly livestock and cooperative trading arrangements. This has allowed many of these farmers to move away from subsistence grain production, such that 72% of household income is now derived from sale of farm produce. However, many farmers in Qingyang indicated a lack of technical agronomic support and limited access to reliable markets as barriers to diversification. In Dingxi, many farmers struggle to grow sufficient grain for household use and generate very little cash income, often insufficient to provide basic needs such as education. Potatoes, pea and oilseeds are the most common cash crops here, but livestock enterprises are poorly developed. In this area only 28% of household income is generated on farm, and young males often leave the farm to work in larger cities, leaving farming decisions to the elderly, women, and children, who are left behind to manage the farm. High illiteracy rates in this group reduce assimilation of new information. Farmers in Dingxi indicated that restricted access to capital, lack of technical agronomic support and little access to trading markets were serious impediments to the development of more profitable enterprises.

TI Energy use efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions of farming systems in
   north Iran
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Efficient use of energy resources in crop production is an important goal in sustainable agriculture. This study compares the energy flow in farming systems across farm size with their corresponding greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions - presented in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq.) - in the north of Iran. To reach this aim, primary data were collected by survey with farmers whose main activity was major crops production in the region that included wheat, barley, canola, soybean, paddy and corn silage. The results showed that total energy input for corn silage (52.1 GJ ha(-1)) is greater than other systems. The results also revealed that yield and output energy of crops were not significantly affected by field size, whereas energy use efficiency of systems increased significantly as field size increased. Study shows that the cultivation of paddy emits the highest CO2 eq. emission (6094 kg CO2 eq. ha(-1)) among crops, in which around 60% is contributed by methane (CH4). The efficient use of fertilizers, optimized pumping facilities for irrigation, stopping of crop residue burning in the field and use them for energy supply could be among the options to improve energy use efficiency and mitigate GHG emissions.

TI Sustainability, energy budgeting, and life cycle assessment of
   crop-dairy-fish-poultry mixed farming system for coastal lowlands under
   humid tropic condition of India
SO ENERGY
AB A study was conducted from 2015 to 2018 to find out the sustainability, profitability, energy efficiency and environmental impact of crop-livestock-aquaculture integration in west coast of India. Rice grown in rice-baby corn sequence recorded higher yield than rice-cowpea system. About 4 ton of fodder and 0.7 ton of azolla were produced and recycled as feed to the dairy animals. The household requirements of vegetables and fruits were produced in the kitchen garden (80 m(2)). The farming system recorded energy efficiency, net energy gain, and energy profitability of 2.63, 103311 MJ and 1.63 MJ, respectively. The greenhouse gas emission from the system was found to be 10.7 t CO2 eq. and the main contributor to the total emission were enteric methane emissions (24%) from livestock component, diesel consumptions (16%) and N2O emissions mainly from the chemical fertilizers (13%). The percent share of different components to the net return was found higher in cropping systems (40.5%) followed by dairy (37.8%) with an employment potential of 269 man-days/year. The study conclusively reveals that integration of dairy, fishery, poultry components with diversified cropping in coastal lowland ecosystem is essential to offset the ecological imbalances arising due to continuous cultivation of rice crop.

TI Ecosystem services provided by semi-natural and improved grasslands -
   synergies, trade-offs and bundles
SO FOURRAGES
AB Although grasslands have an extensive global coverage and are important contributors to fodder production, they have received less attention as providers of multiple ecosystem services (ES). In this paper, we investigate the utility of the ES framework for grassland management in Europe. We focus on semi-natural grasslands (SNG) and improved grasslands (IG); both are widespread in European agriculture. We present an overview of the ES delivered by these two grassland types and their potential synergies, trade-offs and bundles. We show that SNG are able to generate a wider range of ES than IG, and that trade-offs between ES exist in both grassland types. For example, SNG are good in providing habitat for biodiversity, pollination, biological control and cultural services, but are poorer in biomass production and for increasing water infiltration, whereas IG produce higher quantities of biomass for fodder but contribute less to cultural services. Both IG and SNG are likely needed for the long-term sustainability of food production, but a larger effort towards landscape-scale management is needed to balance the provision of ES. Applying the ES concept to grasslands in farming systems could be valuable if used in an informed way, leveraging ecologically and economically grassland management for sustainable livestock farming systems in Europe.

TI Organic and Conventional Agriculture: A Useful Framing?
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES, VOL 42
SE Annual Review of Environment and Resources
AB In this review, we examine the debate surrounding the role for organic agriculture in future food production systems. Typically represented as a binary organic-conventional question, this debate perpetuates an either/or mentality. We question this framing and examine the pitfalls of organic-conventional cropping systems comparisons. The review assesses current knowledge about how these cropping systems compare across a range of metrics related to four sustainability goals: productivity, environmental health, economic viability, and quality of life. We conclude by arguing for reframing the debate, recognizing that farming systems fall along gradients between three philosophical poles-industrial, agrarian, and ecological-and that different systems will be appropriate in different contexts. Despite evidence for lower yields in organic crop systems, we found considerable evidence for environmental and social benefits. Given these advantages, and the potential for improving organic systems, we echo calls for increased investment in organic and ecologically based cropping systems research and extension.

TI THE DUTCH PROGRAM ON SOIL ECOLOGY OF ARABLE FARMING SYSTEMS -
   FARM-MANAGEMENT MONITORING PROGRAM AND GENERAL RESULTS
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB A comparison was made between conventional farm management (CONV) and integrated farm management (INT) on a calcareous silty clay loam soil, with a crop rotation of winter wheat, sugar beet, spring barley and potatoes. Both types of management were started at two levels of soil organic matter, 2.2% and 2.8%, respectively, resulting from a previous experiment with different inputs of organic matter. Farm management and sampling strategies for soil variables, including soil organisms, and crop development are described. In INT, 20% less nitrogen and 90% less pesticides (mainly as a result of the lack of soil fumigation) were added than in CONV. The soil tillage depth was reduced from 20-25 cm in CONV to 12-15 cm in INT.
   INT crop yields were on average 90% (83-102%) of CONV crop yields and INT crop N uptake was on average 85% (74-103%) of CONV crop N uptake. INT management with the partial replacement of mineral fertiliser N by compost and manure, conserved the original levels of soil organic matter, but under CONV these levels decreased. The total N in soil increased under INT and did not change appreciably under CONV.

TI Productivity, profitability and partial nutrient balance in maize-based
   conventional and organic farming systems in Kenya
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB In 2007 two long-term trials were established in Kenya to contribute research-based evidence to the global debate on the productivity, economic viability and sustainability of different agricultural production systems. These trials compare conventional (Cony) and organic (Org) farming systems at high and low input levels at two locations, i.e. Chuka, with Humic Nitisols, high inherent soil fertility and rainfall, and Thika, with Rhodic Nitisols with low soil fertility and rainfall. The high input systems (High) represent commercial-scale, export-oriented production that uses the recommended amounts of fertilisers, pesticides and irrigation water to generate high yields, whilst the low input systems (Low) represent local smallholder practices, using relatively few fertilisers and pesticides and operating under rain-fed conditions. The conventional systems received synthetic fertilisers and organic manure, whilst the organic systems only received organic inputs. The trials so far have consisted of a 6-season, 3-year, crop rotation with maize (Zea mays L.) planted in the long rainy seasons (March-September), and vegetables in the short rainy seasons (October February). Generally, there were no significant differences in the dry matter yields and nutrient uptake by maize, baby corn or beans between the conventional and organic systems at either site. Similar maize grain and baby corn yields were also obtained at Chuka. However, at Thika, maize grain yields in Org-High in 2007 (at conversion) were lower than the yields in Cony-High, but the yields became similar in 2010 (after conversion). At the same site the yields of maize grain under sole cropping in Org-Low were 3.2 times lower than the yields in Cony Low in 2007 and 1.7 times lower in 2010. When intercropped with beans the yields of the two systems were similar. In the first two years profits from Cony-High were 0.5-1.8 times and 0.2-2.4 times higher than in Org-High when selling the produce at local (Chuka and Thika) and regional markets (Nairobi), but thereafter the profit from the two was similar, even when organic produce was sold at regular market prices. From the fifth year onwards Org-High attracted a price premium of 20 to 50% and this made it 1.3 to 4.1 times more profitable than Cony-High when selling on local and regional markets (in Chuka, Thika and Nairobi). Compared to Cony-High, partial N and K balances at the two sites were positive and higher in Org-High, except for N at Chuka. Our findings demonstrate that Org-High is productive, economically viable, resource-conserving and can contribute to sustainable agriculture production in Kenya depending on regional conditions and the crops cultivated.

TI BOVISOL Project: Breeding and Management Practices of Indigenous Bovine
   Breeds: Solutions towards a Sustainable Future
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In order to deal with the effects of globalization, urbanization, increase in world population, global warming, and climate change; and according to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2 targets, which aim to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture, it is urgently needed to transform our agriculture and livestock farming systems by taking into account the environmental considerations. The Breeding and management practices of indigenous bovine breeds: Solutions towards a sustainable future (BOVISOL) project is a scientific cooperation between three Mediterranean countries (Greece, Tunisia and Algeria) supported and funded by the European Commission under the European Research Area Networks (ERA-NET) scheme of the 7th Framework Programme. This project has been formed around the hypothesis that the local bovine breeds must be preserved since they possess a valuable genetic pool, and they are a part of the landscape and the biodiversity of rural areas. Moreover, their products (milk, cheese, meat, etc.) could contribute significantly to the local economies as they could easily be associated with recent food trends like "local" and "slow food", which are considered today, as, not only a mean of nutrition, but also a way of living and a part of people's identity. BOVISOL project aims to: (i) identify the local breeds and populations in a national level, (ii) describe the existing farm and breeding practices, (iii) analyze the quality of the main local animal products, (iv) propose solutions that will promote the sustainability of the traditional farming systems, especially nowadays that climate change proposes new challenges on animal production, and (v) disseminate the solutions on all the levels of the sector (farmers, scientists, local communities, governmental agencies).

TI Economic Viability of Tomato Cultivation in Organic Farming System
SO BRAZILIAN ARCHIVES OF BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The aim of the present study is to evaluate the economic viability of tomato cultivation in a system of organic farming, and to compare it with the conventional farming system. The fixed and variable costs of both cultivation systems were calculated, as well as the costs of disease control with the application of alternative products and pesticides. The revenues were computed using commercial production and the direct sales price. The total cost per area was higher in the conventional system, while the cost per plant was greater in the organic system, since it used a lower plant population density. In the conventional system, 2.33 times more was spent on plant management, due to the fact that the number of sprayings was greater than that carried out in organic farming. We further find that companion planting with other species such as coriander, in addition to helping with the management of the main crop, is important for economic sustainability as it is an extra source of income. Considering the specificities of the two systems, the profitability of organic cultivation, even accounting for its lower productivity, could exceed that of conventional cultivation.

AB Our paper discusses one key component of family farms sustainability in the Alps that is the working conditions. Mountain livestock systems remain Labour intensive. Farmers feel the gap between them and the rest of the society deepening regarding their workload. They express a demand for more spare time. We address this issue from two perspectives. First, we analyse how a group of farmers has constructed their own solutions to address the question of working conditions. We refer to the sociology of translation to understand this collective process. It shows that over a period of 3 years, farmers have refined the problem and tested different solutions. The second approach Lies in a systemic approach at farm Level assessing the work organisation and the farmers self-perception regarding his/her workloads. Crossing those two approaches, we discuss why successive phases of re-problematisation occurred and why the solutions imagined are not so straightforward. The single object of work organisation turns out to encompass all the complexity of small-scale farming systems in mountains areas.

TI A conceptual model for analysing input-output coefficients in arable
   farming systems: from diagnosis towards design
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB Environmental legislation is forcing a rethink about desirable crop production systems. The development of new production systems that meet economic and environmental objectives demands knowledge about which input-output combinations are feasible and optimal in practice. A review of concepts in agronomy and in farm and behavioural economics leads to a conceptual model with a division into production levels and accompanying production restricting factors. The highest production level can be defined by merely agronomic growth factors; the next production level is restricted by a mixture of economic and other agronomic factors. The two lowest levels are further restricted by taking into account the socio-psychological factors. With the production restricting factors of the conceptual model the differences in agronomic efficiency of actual and theoretical input-output combinations will be analysed in order to find out which input-output combinations will be feasible and optimal in practice.

TI Modelling and interpreting the impact of policy and price scenarios on
   farm-household sustainability: Farming systems vs. result-driven
   clustering
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
AB The Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union is subject to a continuous process of reform. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the effect of decoupling and related policy and market scenarios, as introduced in the 2003 CAP reform, by way of selected agriculture sustainability indicators and through the aggregation of individual farm-household simulated behaviour. The approach is based on the use of a Net Present Value-maximising dynamic farm-household model. The model is implemented on 80 farm-households to simulate the reaction to scenarios of different agricultural systems in 8 EU countries. The results are measured through three main indicators - represented by farm income, labour use and nitrogen use evaluated over a period of 14 years. The results of individual farm-households are aggregated first using the concept of farming system and then based on a cluster analysis using the results in different scenarios as discriminant variables. The results show that the CAP as a whole is crucial for the sustainability of farming systems in terms of income and employment, but also provides incentives for higher use of inputs, suggesting a trade-off between social and environmental sustainability concerns. In the range of variation considered, nitrogen and labour use appear much more reactive than income and indicate much higher variability across farms and scenarios. The aggregation by agricultural system denotes rather different behaviour among systems. However, the cluster analysis shows that results appear to be better interpreted by patterns of individual characteristics (location in the plain, structure, asset endowment, labour, etc.) than by country, specialisation or technology.

AB Nutrient balances were estimated for small-scale farming systems at four sub-humid, medium altitude locations in eastern and central Uganda. Data from several sources were used to estimate nutrient fluxes, including farmer interviews, observations of the fanning systems, soil analyses, and the output of simulation models. Results from the three locations were combined because of similarity of farming systems, with the Palissa location treated separately. Nutrient balances were determined to be negative for all crops except for N and P in the banana-based land use type (LUT) which benefited from the transfer of nutrients from other land use types in organic materials. The annual crops-LUT occupied more land than other LUTs and accounted for more nutrient loss than all other LUTs combined. Crop harvest and soil erosion were the major causes of nutrient losses at the crop and LUT levels. N and K balances were positive and negative, respectively, for the fallow and pasture LUTs. Harvests and livestock dung and urine were brought to the household LUT, and the losses in this relatively small LUT appeared to be high from burning, volatilization and erosion. No farmer used fertilizer and nutrients in any form were applied to banana, only. Marketing and purchasing of commodities resulted in farm-level nutrient deficits for Palissa but had little effect on the balances at other locations. The cumulative effect of several low-input management practices was estimated to give nutrient balances of near zero for N and P, but K losses at the held-level continued to be high.

TI Soil quality and microbes in organic and conventional farming systems
SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY RESEARCH
AB Compared to conventional farming practices, organic farming practices have an advantage over improving soil quality and gain worldwide acceptance. Here we summarize soil properties, microbial biomass, abundance and diversity of microbes between organic and conventional soil, as well as advantages and disadvantages of various molecular approaches for assessing the diversity of microbial communities. The results confirm that higher levels of total and organic C, total N and soluble organic C are observed in all of the organic soil. However, other soil properties are inconsistent between organic and conventional soil. Consistently, all the studies show that higher levels of microbial biomass C and N are found in organic soil with different plants. Nevertheless, different molecular approaches for assessing the diversity of microbial communities could lead to different results in the same study. In addition, most studies consider that organic management can improve the abundance and diversity of total bacteria and fungi. Knowledge and assessment of organic and conventional farming systems still need to be evaluated in the future work.

SP Int Soc Hort Sci
AB Sweet cherry production is a new activity in South Patagonia and its development has carried out profound changes in the local agrarian structure and in the regional economy. New actors, such as growers or investors, have emerged and specific demands of labour and services (with different degrees of specialization) have been brought out. Adaptation to these emerging changes requires evaluation of cherry system sustainability on three dimensions: productive-economic, environmental, and social. Managerial aspects (different producers and levels of technology) and employer-labour relations are normally beyond a traditional farming systems analysis. In this study, the MESMIS evaluation framework for sustainability assessment [which considers five basic attributes (productivity, stability, resilience, reliability, and adaptability) that can be operationalized by defining several criteria and subsequently assessed through indicators], was used as a base to derive (socio-economic) sustainability indicators (under a multi-disciplinary approach) for the sweet cherry production sector of South Patagonia. The methodology used to measure and monitor these indicators is described and some results and conclusions derived from this survey are presented. Socio-economic indicators related to labour show, for example, that more than 60% of the total operative cost is labour. The annual distribution is concentrated in one month (December) and availability and efficiency, as described by two qualitative indicators, are scarce and low, respectively.

TI Narrowing maize yield gaps across smallholder farming systems in Zambia:
   what interventions, where, and for whom?
SO AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Maize production in Zambia must increase with a view towards improved food security and reduced food imports whilst avoiding cropland expansion. To achieve this, it is important to understand the causes behind the large maize yield gaps observed in smallholder farming systems across the country. This is the first study providing a yield gap decomposition for maize in Zambia, and combining it with farm typology delineation, to identify the key limiting factors to maize yield gaps across the diversity of farms in the country. The analysis builds upon a nationally representative household survey covering three growing seasons and crop model simulations to benchmark on-farm maize yields and N application rates. Three farm types were delineated, including households for which maize is a marginal crop, households who are net buyers of maize, and households who are market-oriented maize producers. Yield gap closure was about 20% of the water-limited yield, corresponding to an actual yield of 2.4 t ha(- 1). Market-oriented maize farms yielded slightly more than the other farm types, yet the drivers of yield variability were largely consistent across farm types. The large yield gap was mostly attributed to the technology yield gap indicating that more efficient production methods are needed to raise maize yields beyond the levels observed in highest yielding fields. Yet, narrowing efficiency and resource yield gaps through improved crop management (i.e., sowing time, plant population, fertilizer inputs, and weed control) could more than double current yields. Creating a conducive environment to increase maize production should focus on the dissemination of technologies that conserve soil moisture in semi-arid areas and improve soil health in humid areas. Recommendations of sustainable intensification practices need to consider profitability, risk, and other non-information constraints to improved crop management and must be geographically targeted to the diversity of farming systems across the country.

TI How agro-environmental and climate measures are affecting farming system
   performances in Guadeloupe?: Lessons for the design of effective climate
   change policies
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB Relatively a few studies assess the impact of climate change (CC) policies on effective farmers' agronomic practices and associated agro-technical performance. This study aimed at characterizing how CC policies can help farmers to combine CC with other environmental issues to support the design of more effective policies at the farm level. It was conducted in Guadeloupe, where farming systems are highly vulnerable to CC. We analyzed the Agro-Environmental and Climate Measures (AECM) proposed by the European Union. We made surveys with 39 farmers and used an existing whole-farm simulation tool to assess practices promoted by the current AECM. The tool was also used to assess the new AECM under discussion by stakeholders. Structural characteristics allowed identifying various types of farms. These characteristics may affect farmers' capacity to implement the current AECM given that they are labour-intensive. New AECM focused on the decrease in pesticides and do not properly address CC since most of them lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and are very different from the current farmers' CC adaptation strategies. Synergies can be found between the reduction of pesticide use and CC if the alternatives proposed also permit to decrease in the use of synthetic fertilizers.

TI Application of Smart Techniques, Internet of Things and Data Mining for
   Resource Use Efficient and Sustainable Crop Production
SO AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB Technological advancements have led to an increased use of the internet of things (IoT) to enhance the resource use efficiency, productivity, and cost-effectiveness of agricultural production systems, particularly under the current scenario of climate change. Increasing world population, climate variations, and propelling demand for the food are the hot discussions these days. Keeping in view the importance of the abovementioned issues, this manuscript summarizes the modern approaches of IoT and smart techniques to aid sustainable crop production. The study also demonstrates the benefits of using modern IoT approaches and smart techniques in the establishment of smart- and resource-use-efficient farming systems. Modern technology not only aids in sustaining productivity under limited resources, but also can help in observing climatic variations, monitoring soil nutrients, water dynamics, supporting data management in farming systems, and assisting in insect, pest, and disease management. Various type of sensors and computer tools can be utilized in data recording and management of cropping systems, which ensure an opportunity for timely decisions. Digital tools and camera-assisted cropping systems can aid producers to monitor their crops remotely. IoT and smart farming techniques can help to simulate and predict the yield production under forecasted climatic conditions, and thus assist in decision making for various crop management practices, including irrigation, fertilizer, insecticide, and weedicide applications. We found that various neural networks and simulation models could aid in yield prediction for better decision support with an average simulation accuracy of up to 92%. Different numerical models and smart irrigation tools help to save energy use by reducing it up to 8%, whereas advanced irrigation helped in reducing the cost by 25.34% as compared to soil-moisture-based irrigation system. Several leaf diseases on various crops can be managed by using image processing techniques using a genetic algorithm with 90% precision accuracy. Establishment of indoor vertical farming systems worldwide, especially in the countries either lacking the supply of sufficient water for the crops or suffering an intense urbanization, is ultimately helping to increase yield as well as enhancing the metabolite profile of the plants. Hence, employing the advanced tools, a modern and smart agricultural farming system could be used to stabilize and enhance crop productivity by improving resource use efficiency of applied resources i.e., irrigation water and fertilizers.

TI A review of farming challenges and resilience management in the
   Sudano-Sahelian drylands of Nigeria in an era of climate change
SO JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
AB Dryland smallholders are faced with the challenges of achieving resilience and agricultural sustainability. This is in addition to constraints such as lack of capital, inputs, and often poor extension services. The risk of extreme weather events poses a great challenge to food security in drylands as the impacts of climate change increases. This paper examines the challenges faced by smallholders and the limitations of traditional farming systems in Sudano-Sahelian zones amidst climate change and emerging armed conflicts with special focus on the SudanoSahelian Nigerian drylands. The review reports three key findings as follows: first, smallholders have been active in managing short-term environmental risks and challenges by using local knowledge to improve production and short-term resilience. Secondly, concerns about potential longer-term climatic changes such as longer droughts, desertification, the impact of the drying of the Lake Chad, armed conflicts and extreme weather events could hinder resilience. Third, an increasing rainfall variability, soil/nutrient degradation and farming systems adopted could limit or undermine resilience strategies, especially if new environmental challenges exceed those previously experienced. This review suggests a need for additional research into innovative drylands' sustainability and resilience practices in response to a changing climate linked to other social challenges.

TI Farming system effects on biologically mediated plant-soil feedbacks
SO RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS
AB Cropping system characteristics such as tillage intensity, crop identity, crop-livestock integration and the application of off-farm synthetic inputs influence weed abundance, plant community composition and crop-weed competition. The resulting plant community, in turn, has species-specific effects on soil microbial communities which can impact the growth and competitive ability of subsequent plants, completing a plant-soil feedback (PSF) loop. Farming systems that minimize the negative impacts of PSFs on subsequent crop growth can increase the sustainability of the farming enterprise. This study sought to assess the individual and combined impact of the cropping system (certified organic-grazed, certified organic till and conventional no-till) and crop sequence [pairwise rotations with safflower (Carthamus tinctorius), yellow sweet clover (Melilotus officinalis) and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum)] on the PSF magnitude and direction. All cropping systems followed the same 5-year rotation and had completed one full rotation before soil was sampled. In a greenhouse setting, a sterile soil mix was inoculated with field soil collected from all systems and three crops. The PSF study consisted of two stages (conditioning and response phases) that mimicked the rotation stages occurring in the field. PSFs were calculated by comparing the biomass of the response phase plants grown in inoculated and uninoculated soils. The farm management system affected PSFs, inferring that tillage reduction can encourage more positive PSFs. Crop sequence did not affect PSF but interacted strongly with the farm system. As such, the effects of the farming system on PSFs are best illustrated when taken into account with the identity of the previous and current crops of a cropping sequence.

TI Assessment of opium-based fanning systems: a case study in the Nahom
   area, Oudomxay Province in Northern Laos
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
AB Pm interdisciplinary team of 10 completed an exploratory one-month survey of villages in Nahom, Oudomxay Province, Laos, an area representative of upland farming systems based on opium and shifting cultivation. The study included investigation of the physical and socioeconomic environments and assessment of the farming systems. Due to the relatively low population density, there is enough land for villagers to practice shifting cultivation with a one year cultivation cycle, followed by 10-12 years of fallow. The soil degradation commonly caused by shifting cultivation was not significant in this area and the soil fertility is still relatively high. However, most of the original forests had been cut down and used for shifting cultivation and some degradation of the vegetation has occurred, showing that the ecological sustainability has been threatened by prevailing practices. Thirty-six percent of the households had food supply problems for more than three months of each year. The extremely low return for labour from upland rice cultivation, only 5.64 kg per labour-day, was the critical factor that caused the food shortage. Because of poor technique, rice yield from paddy fields was also low, thus shifting cultivators hale no enthusiasm to expand their paddy fields. Income from opium provided 80.5% of household income. Opium was extremely tempting to local people due to the very high return for labour, 5700 kip (US$6) per labour-day, low investment, and good labour availability (mostly during the off-season of rice cultivation). However, opium was also a 'two-edged sword'. It did not bring real wealth, health and happiness but instead brings poverty, poor health and disappointment.

AB Soils perform five functions (biochemical and geochemical cycling, partitioning of water, storage and release, buffering, energy partitioning) that are essential for the support of ecosystems. When shifting from natural/semi-natural systems to managed systems, the balance among these functions can be extensively changed. This is especially true in the case of agroecosystems. Food supply is one of the most important questions in the domain of interactions between humans and their environment. Land available to agriculture is limited for topographical and climatic reasons, and half of that land is under production. Increasing food production to meet the future needs of the world's growing population will require management practices that make optimal use of available land and water resources, while maintaining the balance among the soil functions. A large imbalance results in land degradation. Increasing productivity on the best arable lands will require additional research towards establishing the tolerable intensity of soil use for sustainable agriculture. A better understanding of soil ecology will help in developing more environmentally-friendly sustainable farming systems.

In this study, Integrated Fanning System (IFS) and Indigenous Kulagar Fanning Systems (IKFS) were compared; and overall it was revealed that both are useful in enhancing the livelihood of small and marginal farmers, attracted the rural youth through generation of additional income and employment opportunities. There is need to modify the IKFS with integration of high value crops and having high market demand to make the system more remunerative and attractive. The IFS and IKFS have been the mainstay of economy and livelihood of farmers in Goa state. The mosaic structure of Kulagar with variety of crops offers a scope for inbuilt biodiversity as an index of sustainability in agriculture. Besides, both systems are climate resilient and proved potential for adaptation and mitigation to climate change. IFS and IKFS may be promoted in large scale in coastal agro-ecosystem in other parts of the country as an important strategy for enhancing livelihood and climate resilience in agriculture.

TI Coordinated Implementation of Climate-Smart Practices in Coffee Farming
   Increases Benefits at Farm, Landscape and Global Scale
SO FRONTIERS IN CLIMATE
AB Coffee is a major commodity crop that shapes large shares of tropical landscapes. However, the sustainability of these landscapes is threatened by climate change. Whilst adopting climate-smart (CS) practices clearly offers direct benefits to local farmers, their greater benefits at landscape and global scales has not been studied for specific commodity crops so far. Our research uniquely outlines how local adoption of CS-practices in coffee-farming systems provides local, landscape and global benefits. We review literature on CS agriculture, CS landscapes, and coffee farming to firstly identify the different CS-practices applicable to coffee farming systems, and then group these into functional groups that represent the main functional trait targeted by different practices within coffee-farming systems. This allows identifying benefits provided at local, landscape and global scales. The seven functional groups identified are: soil characteristics; water management; crop and genetic diversity; climate buffer and adjustment; crop nutrient management; structural elements and natural habitats; and system functioning. Benefits offered at landscape and global scales (non-exhaustively) include improved water quality, biodiversity conservation and habitat connectivity, as well as stabilized regional climate patterns. Our review shows that regulating services are especially pronounced, although the extent of benefits provided depend on landscape coordination. We discuss considerations for managing possible conflicts, coordinating actions, financing and accommodating lead time. Local farmers, policy-makers and global donors must unite to improve uptake of CS coffee-production practices in a coordinated way, to thereby augment and safeguard coffee-farming's socio-ecological system along with associated local, landscape and global benefits.

TI Impact of cropping methods on biodiversity in coffee agroecosystems in
   Sumatra, Indonesia
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB The sustainable management of biodiversity and productivity in forested lands requires an understanding of key interactions between socioeconomic and biophysical factors and their response to environmental change. Appropriate baseline data are rarely available. As part of a broader study on biodiversity and profitability, we examined the impact of different cropping methods on biodiversity (plant species richness) along a subjectively determined land-use intensity gradient in southern Sumatra, ranging from primary and secondary forest to coffee-farming systems (simple, complex, with and without shade crops) and smallholder coffee plantings, at increasing levels of intensity. We used 24 (40 x 5 m) plots to record site physical data, including soil nutrients and soil texture together with vegetation structure, all vascular plant species, and plant functional types (PFTs-readily observable, adaptive, morphological features). Biodiversity was lowest under simple, intensive, non-shaded farming systems and increased progressively through shaded and more complex agroforests to late secondary and closed-canopy forests. The most efficient single indicators of biodiversity and soil nutrient status were PFT richness and a derived measure of plant functional complexity. Vegetation structure, tree dry weight, and duration of the land-use type, to a lesser degree, were also highly correlated with biodiversity. Together with a vegetation, or V index, the close correspondence between these variables and soil nutrients suggests they are potentially useful indicators of coffee production and profitability across different farming systems. These findings provide a unique quantitative basis for a subsequent study of the nexus between biodiversity and profitability.

AB Uncertainty occupies a major place in the literature, both when it is being defined and when it is being measured. The mathematical viability theory framework provides useful concepts to go beyond the probabilistic views of uncertainty that are not able to capture all forms of uncertainty, particularly in the absence of statistical regularities. Bounded-set uncertainty can help to analyze changes in the evolutionary conditions that affect ecological and social systems with probabilistic or nonprobabilistic distributions. This paper introduces uncertainty into a viability model by associating stochastic and bounded-set uncertainty related to sales price as a driver of economic uncertainty. Based on an illustration of agroecosystems, the model identifies decision rules that guarantee viability. The larger the initial crop portfolio for sequential diversification is, the lower the costs to belong to the viability kernels will be, regardless of economic and environmental constraints. The diversification of farming systems transforms their complexity into an advantage against uncertainty, which opens up numerous viability trajectories.
   Recommedations for Resource Managers Considering the relevance of a bounded set of economic uncertainty, restoring soil quality and choosing diversification guarantee viability and allow a single generation of farmers to relax both their environmental and economic constraints. When the time available to conform to both their environmental and economic constraints decreases, sequential diversification can be used as a tool to relax the economic constraint of self-financing soil restoration. Sequential diversification is an asset, especially for low-quality soil. Even under uncertainty and very low soil quality, diversification drastically reduces the value-at-risk for viable farming investment. Eligibility for agricultural subsidies should be conditional on soil quality to motivate practices of soil restoration that provide a sort of insurance against economic uncertainty.

TI Hop (Humulus lupulus L.): Suitability of Traditional Cultivars to a
   Low-Trellis Farming System in a Semiarid Environment
SO HORTSCIENCE
AB Humulus lupulus is a dioecious twining herb, with an outstanding vertical development capacity. Hop plants are usually grown on trellises up to 4.5 to 6.0 m high, whose management requires intense use of water, fertilizers, pesticides, and labor. In semiarid Mediterranean areas, where native resources are often scarce, the adoption of low-trellis farming systems could be a sustainable option for hop cultiva-tion. With the aim of evaluating hop suitability to low-trellis cultivation in a Mediter-ranean environment, in 2018 and 2019 three traditional hop genotypes ('Cascade', 'Chinook', and 'Nugget') were grown, and their development rate was evaluated and put in relation with the plants' cone, root, and biomass yield. Moreover, organic (fragmented pine bark) and synthetic [black polyethylene (PE) plastic film] mulches were applied on the same cultivars, and both epigeal and hypogeal development were evaluated. The results showed that the faster the growth in the first two phases of plant elongation (up to 50% of the height of the upper wire), the lower the yield in both cones and total epigeal biomass. A fast growth rate was instead associated with a higher hypogeal biomass production. Mulching was able to significantly affect the hypogeal biomass, specifically for cv. Cascade, where the use of synthetic mulching allowed significant root biomass increases. The analysis of the results obtained showed that hop's suitability to a low-trellis farming system is highly variable among varieties in the semiarid Mediterranean environment.

TI Phosphorus forms and distribution in Andisol under contrasting land-use
   systems in central Mexico
SO TERRA LATINOAMERICANA
AB Conversion of forest to conventional farming systems may affect phosphorus (P) distributions and availability, particularly in P-limited soils. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of land use (native forest and avocado farming systems) on forms, distribution, and availability of P in soil. Soil samples (Andisol) from three sites cultivated with conventional farming and others from a contiguous native pine forest area were included. Soil Po and Pi fractions and microbial P were sequentially extracted after seven and 28-days (d) of incubation, respectively. In cultivated soil, total P was mostly represented by inorganic fractions (66 to 78%). Pi was mainly composed of easily mineralized P (Bic-Pi), moderately stable (NaOH 0.1-Pi) and relatively insoluble fractions (Residual-Pi). However, Po proportion (29%) decreased under cropped soil due to depletion of soil organic matter. In contrast, in native forest soils, more than 48% of P was extracted in microbial biomass, Bic-Po, and NaOH0.1-Po fractions. The distribution of soil P fractions was associated with soil use type. Conventional farming systems stimulated P retention in Fe-Al oxides (NaOH0.1-Pi and Residual-Pi) and decreased P availability. Compared to cultivated soil, the higher organic P proportion under forest corresponded to higher organic matter (OM) and microbial P, which highlights the potential relevance of SOM and microbial P in sustaining P availability in P-limited acidic soils. Sustainability in cropped systems could be enhanced by promoting adequate management practices aimed at increasing soil organic P storage and reducing soil chemical reactions that absorb, occlude or precipitate applied inorganic P.

TI Why and how farmers manage mixed cattle-sheep farming systems and cope
   with economic, climatic and workforce-related hazards
SO RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS
AB Combining cattle and sheep on the same farm can be a promising way for farmers to face uncertainties and produce in an agroecological manner. Previous studies showed benefits of mixed-species grazing on animal health and pasture use. However, few studies have examined how farmers truly manage the two species on their farms and why. The purpose of this study was to explore this issue by surveying 37 farmers who combined meat sheep and beef or dairy cattle on their farms. We chose a systemic and comprehensive approach to the functioning of mixed-species livestock farming systems (MSLF) by considering all dimensions of the system influenced by mixing species (i.e., system configuration, grazing, marketing of products, work and adaptive capacity) and by considering the farmers' viewpoints. The benefits of mixing species that farmers mentioned concerned economic stability and optimal use of grassland resources. Although farmers usually mentioned workload as a disadvantage, the facts are not so clear, and mixing species also benefits work. Farmers cited the pleasure of varied work and the flexibility of work organization. We identified four types of combining cattle and sheep on pasture that express a gradient of the interaction between the two species (from no to high interaction) and are influenced by field configuration (grouped or scattered) and cattle production (dairy or beef). Regarding work organization, ways to combine the two species concern distribution of work required for each species among workers (versatility or specialization) and over the year. Three modes of temporal organization of the work required for each species, which corresponded to different strategies for organizing animal-production cycles, the availability of labor and the willingness to use resources, were identified. To adapt their farm to climatic, economic and workforce-related hazards, farmers used mechanisms related to the combination of the two species: modifying the ewe/cow ratio, breeding periods, worker versatility, grazing management and allocation of resources between species. Our study showed the interest of a systemic and comprehensive approach to MSLF that are promising for the agroecological transition but poorly documented. In particular, it highlighted the need to consider work as part of the system to be configured, managed and adjusted along with the other parts and not simply as a set of constraints.

TI Factors affecting climate change coping strategies used by smallholder
   farmers under root crop farming systems in derived savannah ecology zone
   of Nigeria
SO ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
AB The study analyzes factors affecting climate change coping strategies and constraints experienced by smallholder farmers under root crop (cassava and yam) farming systems in derived savannah ecological zone of Nigeria. The study used data collected from 400 farmers selected through a multistage random sampling technique from two States, Ebonyi and Enugu States, in the zone. The factors affecting the use of some climate change coping strategies were estimated using multivariate probit regression. We isolated factors that constrain farmers from coping with changes in climate using exploratory factor analysis. The findings revealed that the majority (98%) of the smallholder farmers indicated that delay in the onset of rains, too much rainfall (70%), higher temperatures (65%), and erratic rainfall patterns (43%) were the main types of climate change they experienced. The key strategies the farmers applied in coping with climate change are buying food (45%), starting the use of sustainable land management practices (43%), planting of early maturing crops (36%), planting trees (32%), starting non-farm activity (30%), and eating less food (30%). The multivariate probit regression result indicated that some variables influenced the likelihood of simultaneous adoption of the coping strategies. For example, providing climate change information to cassava and yam farmers through extension agents significantly increases the likelihood of engaging in climate-smart practices, namely, planting early-maturing crop varieties and tree planting. We also found that farmers' experiences with climate change variables and outcomes significantly influence the coping strategies they choose. For example, a decline in crop yield was positively and significantly associated with buying food, planting early-maturing varieties, starting a non-farm activity, and eating less as coping strategies. Constraints the farmers faced in coping with climate change were grouped as cultural impediments, weak knowledge/information, ineffective agricultural extension services, and weak policy and institutions. The study recommends, among others, strengthening of public agricultural extension services, provision of climate services to farmers, implementing policies to guaranty food security and enhancing the human capital of the farm households to reduce their vulnerability to climate change.

TI Global sensitivity analysis of a pig fattening unit model simulating
   technico-economic performance and environmental impacts
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB Livestock farming system (LFS) models are used to produce key technical or economic outputs. Current models simulate multicriteria performance of LFS, i.e. technical, economic and environmental outputs. Therefore, conducting sensitivity analysis (SA) of these models is increasingly challenging. We developed a pig fattening unit model which is a stochastic, discrete-event mechanistic model with a one-day time step. An individual-based model is used to represent the pigs. Our objective was to perform a global SA of this model while accounting for effects of parameters on all outputs. Due to the model's long computational time, we first performed screening SA using the Morris method to identify and exclude non-influential parameters, and then performed variance-based SA of the influential parameters using metamodels. The most influential parameters were mainly pig characteristics and the disinfection period. This study provides a generic SA sequence adapted for models with a high computational cost and multiple outputs.

TI Long-term effect of integrated farming systems on soil erosion in hilly
   micro-watersheds (Indian Eastern Himalayas)
SO LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB Soil erosion from traditional hill agriculture is a major concern for agronomic development in the Eastern Himalayas (India). An integrated farming system (IFS: is the combination of multipurpose trees-MPT interspersed with seasonal agricultural crops) may reduce the severity of erosion while ensuring food and nutritional security. The aim of our study was to identify an IFS, resistant to soil erosion in the hill ecosystem of Eastern Himalaya. For this, eight micro-watershed (MW)-based IFSs namely livestock with fodder crops (MW1), forestry (MW2), agroforestry (MW3), agriculture (MW4), agri-horti-silvi-pastoral (MW5), horticulture (MW6), cultivated fallow (MW7), and abandoned shifting cultivation (MW8, as traditional land use) were established and soil erosion was measured for 24 years in the sloping land (32.0%-53.0%) of the Eastern Himalayas (Meghalaya, Northeast India). In the forests (MW2), annual average (IA: 1983-2006) runoff and soil losses were 405.5 (+/- 113) mm and 11.0 (+/- 2.4) Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The conversion of forests to cultivation caused a decline in the parameters of hydro-physical quality and fertility, more severely in the traditional farming (MW7&8) than in the IFS mode of cultivation (MW3,5,&6). Soil water conservation measures (SWCMs: contour bunding, terracing, and grassed waterways) were more effective at reducing erosion when used together compared to individually. Adoption of these SWCMs in cultivated MWs in IFS mode (MW3,5,&6), reduced the runoff by 13.0%-17.1% and soil loss by 12.6%-15.1% over forests (MW2). However, in traditional agriculture (MW7&8), runoff increased by 50.6%-87.6% while soil loss was 50.3%-59.8% higher over the forest. The study demonstrated that the adoption of agroforestry, agri-silvi-horti-pastoral or horticulture-based IFSs with appropriate SWCMs may be promoted to reduce soil erosion while sustaining soil quality attributes and food security in the hill ecosystem of the Indian Eastern Himalayas.

TI THE QUEST FOR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE - THE CURRENT POSITION IN
   AUSTRALIA
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB The primary production sector has contributed significantly to the growth of the Australian economy over the 200 years of European settlement. The farming systems that have developed utilise large areas of land, little labour and produce commodities for export, with pastoral farming systems accounting for more than half of all land farmed. Productivity increases were accompanied by a decline in the quality of the environment, particularly land degradation through non-sustainable farming practices. Several programs directed at sustainable resource management have been installed by the government. Organic farming is increasing rapidly and, at present, the demand for organic produce exceeds the supply. While farming techniques for sustainable systems have been developed through research, the adoption of such techniques by farmers has been slow. Community participation through landcare and catchment management groups in collaborative research and extension activities is being promoted throughout the country. Attitudes towards the land and awareness of environmental issues are changing in rural and urban communities. Innovative approaches are required to facilitate the learning needs of the people and to promote co-operation between landholders, researchers and extension workers. Systemic action research is an alternative paradigm for working with people towards a more sustainable agriculture in Australia.

TI SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE AND PRODUCT QUALITY - A CASE-STUDY FOR SELECTED
   CROPS
SO FOOD REVIEWS INTERNATIONAL
AB ''Sustainable agriculture'' has been defined as a farming system with a low external input of agrochemicals, particularly fertilizer nitrogen. The impact of such farming systems on the quality of three arable crops was considered. Rape seed, wheat, and potato were selected, because they represent arable crops with simple to complex quality criteria. Rape seed (= simple quality criteria): The oil quality is determined primarily by the genotype and is only slightly affected by environmental conditions and cultural practices such as low nitrogen supplies. Within three decades, conventional breeding has changed rape seed into a new crop providing oil for human consumption instead for technical purposes. Wheat (= more complex quality criteria): Wheat is an excellent source of highly digestible energy for human consumption, but its most important quality criterion is the content of protein, which is positively correlated with baking quality and with contents of essential amino acids such as lysine and methionine. Since nitrogen is a constituent of protein, farming systems with little or no fertilizer nitrogen necessarily produce wheat less suited for bread making and of lower nutritional value. At low nitrogen supply, high-protein wheat can be produced only if the grain yield is kept low. Nitrogen fertilization has only a small impact on the contents of vitamins and minerals. Reductions in phosphorus fertilization decrease the grain phosphorus content but may increase grain zinc content. Potato (= complex quality criteria): As compared to wheat, quality traits of potato are less affected by cultural practices. High potassium levels are essential for tubers of high quality. In contrast, high nitrogen inputs can have adverse effects on several quality traits. The use of pesticides and growth regulators most often has no direct effects on the quality of seeds and tubers. Generally, customers should be willing to pay more for food which is of a high ecological quality but may be inferior in technological and nutritional quality.

TI Orfee: A bio-economic model to simulate integrated and intensive
   management of mixed crop-livestock farms and their greenhouse gas
   emissions
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB How do we plan future sustainable livestock farming systems? Some argue that intensive, specialized systems are more efficient and emit fewer pollutants; others claim that integrated, diversified farming systems are more beneficial to both society and the environment. Bio-economic farm models can help decision-makers and researchers analyze the trade-offs among the numerous possibilities, and direct future livestock production toward greater sustainability. The Orfee model described and evaluated here was developed with this aim. It covers a broad range of beef and dairy systems and forage and crop production alternatives that may be managed with varying levels of intensity (breed, production objective, crop operations, etc.) and integration (crop rotation, organic fertilization, calving period, animal diets, etc.). Capital is also included in the optimization process, with trade-offs between production, labor, machinery and buildings. Environmental impact is assessed through potential impact on climate change.

TI Nested archetypes of vulnerability in African drylands: where lies
   potential for sustainable agricultural intensification?
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Food production is key to achieving food security in the drylands of sub-Saharan Africa. Since agricultural productivity is limited, however, due to inherent agro-ecological constraints and land degradation, sustainable agricultural intensification has been widely discussed as an opportunity for improving food security and reducing vulnerability. Yet vulnerability determinants are distributed heterogeneously in the drylands of sub-Saharan Africa and sustainable intensification cannot be achieved everywhere in cost-effective and efficient ways. To better understand the heterogeneity of farming systems' vulnerability in order to support decision making at regional scales, we present archetypes, i.e. socio-ecological patterns, of farming systems' vulnerability in the drylands of sub-Saharan Africa and reveal their nestedness. We quantitatively indicated the most relevant farming systems' properties at a sub-national resolution. These factors included water availability, agro-ecological potential, erosion sensitivity, population pressure, urbanisation, remoteness, governance, income and undernourishment. Cluster analysis revealed eight broad archetypes of vulnerability across all drylands of sub-Saharan Africa. The broad archetype representing better governance and highest remoteness in extremely dry and resource-constrained regions encompassed the largest area share (19%), mainly indicated in western Africa. Moreover, six nested archetypes were identified within those regions with better agropotential and prevalent agricultural livelihoods. Among these patterns, the nested archetype depicting regions with highest erosion sensitivity, severe undernourishment and lower agropotential represented the largest population (30%) and area (28%) share, mainly found in the Sahel region. The nested archetype indicating medium undernourishment, better governance and lowest erosion sensitivity showed particular potential for sustainable agricultural intensification, mainly in western and some parts of southeastern and eastern Africa. Insights into the nestedness of archetypes allowed a more differentiated discussion of vulnerability and sustainable intensification opportunities, enhancing the evaluation of key interlinkages between land management and food security. The archetypes may support the transfer of successful intensification strategies based on similarities among the drylands in sub-Saharan Africa.

TI Capturing farm diversity at regional level to up-scale farm level impact
   assessment of sustainable development options
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB The effectiveness of quantitative system approaches, aimed at exploring options for sustainable development, can be improved by integrating farm typologies and participatory methods. An innovative method of quantitative identification and characterization of farm typologies was developed, whose advantages are the straightforward communication of results to stakeholders and rapid graphical selection of representative farms. The method is presented through an application to a large census dataset of specialized vegetable production systems of South Uruguay. Seven farm types were characterized that mainly differed for availability of off-farm labour, mechanization endowment and irrigation. Farm types can be used to complement a model-based exploration aimed at designing options for sustainable development of the farming systems. The potential of the method to support the up-scaling of farm level results to study the impact of different livelihood strategies at the regional level is discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI Biomass production of banana plants in the indigenous farming system of
   the East African Highland - A case study on the Kamachumu Plateau in
   northwest Tanzania
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB The Haya people in northwest Tanzania have thrived by practising a unique farming system in which banana (Musa acuminata and M. balbisiana) is a staple food. Recent population pressure and long-term shortage of manure, however, have caused disputes about the decline in banana. production. In this study, to begin to solve the issue, the biomass of banana plants grown in Haya fields on the Kamachumu Plateau was estimated by using a non-destructive method. Twelve quadrats of 100 or 225 m(2) were established. Pseudostem height and diameter of all banana plants in each quadrat were measured, and the pseudostem volume was calculated. The fresh weight (FW) and dry weight (DW) of each plant in the quadrats were calculated from the relationship between the pseudostem. volume and FW and DW of various organs in 14 sampled plants. The total DW of banana plants in each unit field area varied greatly among quadrats (from 0. 12 to 1.45 kg m(-2)), but it averaged 0.92 +/- 0.08.kg m(-2) on a farm scale, which was reasonably homogeneous despite the differences in farm size of each household and fertility management. The annual production of banana bunches was estimated at 3.4 kg m(-2) from the average bunch FW and the annual bunch-bearing proportion: it was much higher than in the surrounding areas. Nevertheless, owing to a small proportion of edible part in a banana bunch, the current system would provide a net dry matter yield (pulp) of 0.38 kg m(-2) a year. This yield is comparable to a reasonably good yield (grains) of cereal crops in the tropics. However, the banana yield for each unit time should be at least halved because the plants need I year to produce the yield. ne turnover rate of total dry matter was 0.7-0.9 a year, showing a dynamic exchange of photosynthates and nutrients in permanent banana fields. Further study is needed to strengthen the sustainability of the current farming system from wider perspectives, including the nutrient balance and socio-economic aspect. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Although improving resilience of farms is a major policy goal in the European Union, the current state of resilience is often unknown. Previous resilience assessments have been based either on pre-defined indicators or on perceptions. In particular, empirical research of perceived resilience is still limited and usually restricted to one specific resilience capacity, one challenge, or one function. OBJECTIVE: We investigate how European farmers perceive resilience capacities of their farms. Extending beyond previous research, we cover all three resilience capacities (robustness, adaptability, and transformability), consider a broad range of short-term shocks and long-term stresses, and include multiple functions. Furthermore, we analyse farms from diverse farming systems across Europe and investigate whether farms and farmers with similar perceived resilience capacities share characteristics. METHODS: We address the complex nature of resilience capacities by accounting for multiple scales formulated as analytical steps of a resilience assessment framework. More specifically, these are 'resilience of what' (farms and farming systems), 'resilience to what' (challenges), 'resilience for what purpose' (functions), and 'what enhances resilience' (resilience attributes). These steps guided the development of a survey with farmers across eleven European farming systems. Based on three indices for each farmer indicating perceived robustness, adaptability, and transformability of their farms, we identified two classes of farmers with particularly strong and weak resilience profiles respectively. Using nonparametric Mann-Whitney U tests, we furthermore compared other parameters collected via the survey across the identified classes. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our data sample outputs two classes of similar size characterised by all three perceived resilience capacities being above (below) regional average. This finding suggests that the perceptions of robustness, adaptability, and transformability are mutually dependent. Furthermore, we found that farmers who perceive their resilience above the regional averages are characterised by lower risk aversion, greater focus on providing public goods, a higher number of implemented risk management strategies, more active involvement in networks, and greater openness to innovation. SIGNIFICANCE: The revealed links between particular characteristics of farms and farmers and different levels of perceived resilience capacities can support policy-makers in developing more targeted resilience-enhancing strategies, as well as in understanding farmers' responses to challenges. Finally, our results can serve as a basis for further research, e.g., for formulating and testing hypotheses on causal effects between perceived resilience and its components, and on links between perception-and indicator-based resilience assessments.

SP Grains Res & Dev Corp
AB Plant breeding is not a discipline that readily comes to mind when agricultural sustainability is being considered. Sustainability is normally associated with farming practices such as stubble retention, direct-drilling, or amelioration practices such as contour farming or liming, or rotation practices for nutrient management and disease control. The contribution of plant breeding will be in providing germplasm for these changed practices and devising new methods of selection. This paper reviews opportunities where plant breeding can contribute to improvements in sustainable farming practices. The emphasis is on rainfed cropping systems and cereal improvement. The main contribution for breeding is to (i) increase crop water and nutrient use so that less escapes from the root profile; and (ii) preserve the soil resource with conservation farming systems by developing cultivars specifically adapted to changed farming systems and competitive cultivars that reduce herbicide use. To achieve these outcomes identification of desirable traits, suitable selection methods and development of appropriate germplasm are discussed.

TI Establishing integrated agriculture-nutrition programmes to diversify
   household food and diets in rural India
SO FOOD SECURITY
AB Agriculture is the predominant livelihood for 70 % of the population living in rural India, and food expenses occupy a major proportion of their household budget. Rural household diets suggest that agricultural growth has contributed to increasing calorie intake with very minimal effect on the intake of protein and micronutrients. This in turn causes weak positive impact of agriculture on household dietary diversity and nutrient adequacy. Given the prevalence of high levels of under-nutrition and a large population dependent on agriculture, recent thinking globally on leveraging agriculture for nutrition security has encouraged the agricultural sector to realign its focus not only to increase food production, but also to address under-nutrition. Against this background, an exploratory study was conducted in resource poor villages of Wardha and Koraput districts in the states of Maharashtra and Odisha in India, to investigate how location-specific Farming System for Nutrition (FSN) interventions can potentially improve the diversity of household diets and nutrition outcomes. A detailed baseline study was undertaken to identify the existing disconnect between agriculture-nutrition linkages. In the study locations, the proportion of all forms of under-nutrition, vitamin A deficiency and iron-deficiency anaemia among children < 5-years of age appeared unacceptably high. A high prevalence rate of chronic energy deficient (CED) women and anaemic pregnant women was also observed. A higher risk of under-nutrition and micronutrient deficiency among household members was associated with substandard living conditions of the surveyed households. Cropping systems in Wardha were primarily dominated by rain-fed commercial cash crops while rain-fed subsistence farming predominated in Koraput. Households in both study locations were found to have cereal-dominated diets with average daily consumption of pulses, fruits and vegetables, and milk and milk products well below the recommended daily intake level, indicating low dietary diversity. In both Wardha and Koraput, CED in adults (> 18 years) significantly increased as the dietary diversity score (DDS) decreased from high to low. In Koraput, the prevalence rate of anaemia in adolescent girls and women significantly increased, as the DDS decreased. We conclude that food and diets lacking diversity and without nutrition-sensitive farming systems (either commercial- or subsistence-based) may not be appropriate to improve household nutrition and health status. Our findings provide a basis for structuring integrated agriculture-nutrition programmes or a FSN approach to diversifying household food and diets, for improving nutrition and health in India.

TI Analysis of energy and carbon and blue water footprints in agriculture:
   a case study of tomato cultivation systems
SO EURO-MEDITERRANEAN JOURNAL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRATION
AB Agroecosystem energy analysis is a useful tool for tracking some of the measures taken in the agricultural sector to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in order to achieve the Paris Agreement climate targets. The objectives of this study were to (a) determine differences in energy inputs among tomato farming systems (greenhouse, open-field, and hydroponic), (b) group tomato farms according to energy productivity, energy efficiency, and carbon and blue water footprints, and (c) compare the carbon and blue water footprints of farming systems. Twenty farms (ten open-field and ten greenhouse farms) were selected via proportional stratified random sampling from the municipalities of Volvi and Lagkadas in northern Greece for study during 2015-2016, and one hydroponic farm (the "gold standard") in the prefecture of Imathia in northern Greece was chosen for study during the same period. A combination of univariate and multivariate statistical methods was applied. Previously unrevealed similarities between farming systems were demonstrated by applying hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) with energy productivity, energy efficiency, carbon footprint, and blue water footprint as variables. HCA indicated that seven of the ten greenhouse farms and the hydroponic farm were in the same cluster. The energy productivity and energy efficiency were highest for the hydroponic farm and statistically significantly higher in the greenhouse farms than in the open-field farms. The hydroponic farm had the smallest carbon footprint, while the greenhouse farms had the smallest blue water footprints. The greenhouses used statistically significantly less fuel, fertilizers, herbicides, stringing, and total energy than the open-field farms. The most important energy inputs were irrigation, fuel, and fertilizers for the open-field farms and greenhouses, and electricity and fertilizers for the hydroponic farm. Overall, the hydroponic system was found to be the most environmentally friendly. The above agrienvironmental indices may be useful to decision makers attempting to regulate the fragile balance between climate change and agricultural production.

TI Biocultural approaches to pollinator conservation
SO NATURE SUSTAINABILITY
AB Pollinators underpin sustainable livelihoods that link ecosystems, spiritual and cultural values, and customary governance systems with indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs) across the world. Biocultural diversity is a shorthand term for this great variety of people-nature interlinkages that have developed over time in specific ecosystems. Biocultural approaches to conservation explicitly build on the conservation practices inherent in sustaining these livelihoods. We used the Conceptual Framework of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services to analyse the biocultural approaches to pollinator conservation by IPLCs globally. The analysis identified biocultural approaches to pollinators across all six elements of the Conceptual Framework, with conservation-related practices occurring in 60 countries, in all continents except Antarctica. Practices of IPLCs that are important for biocultural approaches to pollinator conservation can be grouped into three categories: the practice of valuing diversity and fostering biocultural diversity; landscape management practices; and diversified farming systems. Particular IPLCs may use some or all of these practices. Policies that recognize customary tenure over traditional lands, strengthen indigenous and community-conserved areas, promote heritage listing and support diversified farming systems within a food sovereignty approach are among several identified that strengthen biocultural approaches to pollinator conservation, and thereby deliver mutual benefits for pollinators and people.

TI Transhumant Sheep and Goat Farming Sector in Greece
SO IRANIAN JOURNAL OF APPLIED ANIMAL SCIENCE
AB Transhumance is an extensive farming system developed by livestock farmers, that moved their herds between lowlands and uplands, in order to cope with the seasonality of the available forage. 'l'he purpose of this study was to examine the transhumant sheep and goat system in Greece highlighting differences in management aspects among the country's regions. Non-parametric statistical methods in a sample of 551 herders were applied to depict management practices while the regions were separated into four groups according to climate and geographical features. Results revealed differences between the groups, adoption of crossbreeding and limitation of grazing in pastures mainly by sheep breeders. The breeding of goats and on average larger herds were met mainly in southern Greece while sheep and mixed type of herds, as well as smaller on average herds were more common in the northern regions of the country. Evidently, transhumance in Greece nowadays preserves its traditional character being accustomed to the demand of the market for larger production however the introduction of the cross or improved dairy breeders should be controlled in order to protect diversity of indigenous mountain breeds.

TI Soil management effects on the nonlimiting water range
SO GEODERMA
AB Water, oxygen, temperature, and mechanical resistance (MR) are soil physical properties that directly affect plant growth. In this research, the nonlimiting water range (NLWR), defined as the range of soil water content in which neither water, oxygen, nor MR is limiting for plant growth, was measured on soil samples from three field experiments. Undisturbed soil core samples were collected from an experimental field on Wasco silt loam (coarse-loamy, mixed, nonacid, thermic Typic Torriorthents) amended with dairy manure (25 and 50 ton/ha), sludge composting biosolids/green waste (25 and 50 ton/ha), and a control treatment from Shafter Field Experiment Station, Kern County. Similar samples were collected from a Reiff loam (coarse-loamy, mixed, nonacid, thermic Mollie Xerofluvents) and Yolo silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, nonacid, thermic Mollie Xerofluvents) treated with conventional 4-year rotation, conventional 2-year rotation, low-input, and organic farming systems in the Sustainable Agricultural Farming System (SAFS) in Davis, CA. The third set of samples were from a fine sandy soil (mixed, thermic, Typic Haplargid) irrigated with four saline waters with EC values of 0.5, 4.0, 8.0, and 12.0 dS m(-1) in a pistachio orchard located at Paramount Farms, Kern County, CA. The core samples were used to determine saturated hydraulic conductivity and water retention at - 1500 kPa (wilting point) and - 10 kPa (field capacity) to calculate the available water content and the NLWR. Oxygen diffusion rates (ODRs) were measured on the soil cores after they were equilibrated to field capacity, and MR was measured using an automated mini-penetrometer after the soil was equilibrated to - 1500 kPa. The results showed that organic amendments did not significantly change the ODR, MR, NLWR, and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K,). Mean values of MR and ODR were not significantly different in the four agricultural systems either, but soil under organic farming system had a relatively narrow NLWR because less water was retained at field capacity, indicating that the soil surface under this farming system has more large pores. The mean K-s was significantly higher in conventional 4- and 2-year rotations than in organic and low-input treatments. Increasing irrigation water salinity above 4 dS m(-1) progressively decreased the saturated hydraulic conductivity but had relatively little effect on other physical properties. In general, the treatment variables had relatively little effect on the NLWR, ODR, MR, or of surface soils, except for a decrease in K-s when irrigated with waters with more than 4 dS m(-1).

TI Multicriteria sustainability evaluation of thirteen extensive rearing
   and fullcycle family livestock farming systems of Uruguay
SO AGROCIENCIA URUGUAY
AB In the context of agrarian intensification and unsustainability of family livestock farming in Uruguay, it is important to understand the critical elements of productive units to guide possible improvement strategies. This study integrates socioeconomic and environmental information collected through a system of records of the project "Improvements in Family Livestock Farming Sustainability in Uruguay" (INIA, MGAP and the Agricultural Plan Institute). The system evaluated, interpreted and identified critical points for extensive family farming systems. This study presents the constructions of a multicriteria approach of sustainability indicators incorporating environmental, social and productive aspects to evaluate 13 Uruguayan family livestock systems. The results show low relative values in the indicators of the environmental dimension, allowing to direct possible changes in the practices of the productive system. On the other hand, with this case study, the importance of considering a multidimensional vision in the analysis of production systems is evident in order to contemplate all their complexity and identify the critical aspects to take into account.

TI Adaption to climate change: a case study of two agricultural systems
   from Kenya
SO CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT
AB This study contributes to a better understanding of climate change adaptation by investigating different farming systems and by including cognitive factors as explanatory variables. We compared a food crop and a horticultural farming system, regarding applied adaptation measures and factors influencing adaptation. The data were based on a field survey of 267 smallholder farmers in Laikipia County of Kenya. A binary logistic regression was conducted against individual adaptation measures to identify determinants of adaptation. Adaptation measures employed by food crop farmers were mainly risk-reducing, such as mixed- and inter-cropping, planting early-maturing crop varieties and early planting. In contrast, horticultural farmers tended to focus more on intensifying crop production and applied crop rotation, irrigation and application of agro-chemicals, artificial fertilizer and manure. Factors positively influencing adaptation included access to extension services and risk perception among horticultural farmers, and access to workforce and farmers groups among food crop farmers. Furthermore, food crop farmers with access to less risk-prone income sources than agriculture seemed to have less motivation to adapt. The study showed that as climate change progresses, social differences between horticultural and food crop farmers are likely to increase, hence leading to inequalities in adaptation at local levels. Adaptation planners need to address these differences if sustainable adaptation is to be achieved.

TI Agroecological practices to support tropical livestock farming systems:
   a Caribbean and Latin American perspective
SO TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
AB With global climate changes currently occurring, and particularly given the severe energy and food shortages occurring throughout tropical regions, agroecological (AE) systems are drawing renewed attention as an efficient alternative to intensive models of production, particularly unsuitable in regions of the world such as the Caribbean or Latin America. There is a pressing need to focus on livestock farming systems (LFS) and characterize their potential contributions to global sustainability. A multidisciplinary approach is needed to address these multiple and complex problems. Traditionally, LFS have shown their sustainability high potential. The purpose of this work is to highlight solutions to minimize inputs, by describing some success and diverse case studies through the Caribbean. These systems were analyzed at different levels: animal/function, farm/family, and territory/society. This produced a set of guidelines that help to increase the efficiency of tropical systems, particularly those concerned with (1) choosing the best-suited genotypes, while enhancing population biodiversity; (2) matching the farming system to the available resources, feed, and by-products; (3) steering the whole farming system through reproduction management with no hormonal treatment, while facilitating system reproducibility and increasing performances; (4) controlling health constraints instead of annihilating risks and implement an integrated management design to reduce chemical treatments or increase the use of nutraceuticals; and (5) mitigating climate constraints by using soft techniques. In the second part of this work, some integrated systems are described. The Tosoly farm of Colombia, for instance, is conceived as a totally integrated crop-livestock system, allowing the additional production of energy at the farm level. Thus, it epitomizes the positive impact that livestock can exert upon the environment. The case study of Haiti indicates how AE practices can help in designing a pro-poor sustainable milk production system. It concerns an entire dairy sector built all over the country on the basis of micro-units of milk production and processing.

AB On newly cultivated lands in deserts as in the majority of dryland areas, the sustainability of agricultural systems is often debated in terms of socioeconomic viability and agro-ecological longevity. In these contexts, livestock production systems have raised controversial debates regarding their roles and effects in terms of sustainable development. The objective of this paper is to assess the level (and types) of crop-livestock integration in the dryland systems and whether they result in different well-being and improved efficiency of these agroecosystems. Using an empirical study in the newly reclaimed desert lands of the west part of the Nile Delta (Egypt), we proposed an assessment of the sustainability of the family farming systems using two approaches: a) multiple factor analysis and b) multi-criteria assessment. The multi-criteria assessment highlighted how family farm sustainability depends highly on the integration of livestock into the system, with technical or economic efficiency effects. The multiple factor analysis allowed the distinction of two types of farm systems in which livestock activity could be a source in increasing labour productivity or ensuring the viability of the farm in both short and long terms. So, the two approaches brought out the critical role of livestock in the overall efficiency of the system. However, factor analysis highlighted different profiles of integration and diversification based on-farm assets, and the multi-criteria assessment provided a comprehensive framework for conceptualizing aggregated indicators for the development of sustainable farming systems for the end-users. So these two methods may be complementarity to develop and assess the causal processes of a sustainability assessment.

AB Needs for continued work on the nutritional requirements of root crops were identified, particularly the diagnosis, prognosis and correction of nutrition disorders within the farming systems in which the crops are produced. Further work is needed also on the extension of research results, focusing on identifying and correcting local problems using means acceptable to farmers. Work shop participants recognised that good progress had been made in identifying visible symptoms of nutrition disorders of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam) and taro (Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott), and recommended that this information be made available to agriculturalists of the region as soon as possible. Other crops on which similar research should be conducted include yam (Dioscorea spp.) and Xanthosoma sagittifolium (L.) Schott, and perhaps Alocasia macrorrhiza (L.) Schott and Cyrtosperma chamissonis (Schott) Merr. Overall, it was concluded that the identification and correction of nutrition disorders of root crops is an important factor contributing to sustainable farming systems in the Pacific.

TI Improving Hill Farming: From Maize Monocropping to Alternative Cropping
   Systems in the Thai Highlands
SO LAND
AB Lately, the Hill Pond Rice System (HPRS) is being promoted as a form of alternative farming systems in selected northern provinces of Thailand, in which the land conversion is designed to maximize rainwater harvesting in farmland consisting of forest trees, water reservoirs, paddy fields, and high-value crop cultivation to serve environmental and livelihood needs. This study employed the double-hurdle model and the tobit technique to investigate the farm-level factors associated with land conversion from maize monocropping to the HPRS using primary data collected from 253 households in Nan, Chiang Mai, Tak, and Lampang Provinces. It was found that education, farming knowledge, understanding benefits of the HPRS, access to water sources, access to advis, and workforce sharing raised the likelihood and extent of farmland conversion into the HPRS. In contrast, perceived complexity of the HPRS, experiences with negative shocks, and land tenure security lowered the likelihood and extent of land conversion. The findings suggest that on-farm collective action should be promoted to mitigate labor constraints in implementation and that access to equipment should be enhanced through HPRS advisors' visits.

TI Are Traditional Food Crops Really 'Future Smart Foods?' A Sustainability
   Perspective
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This study attempted to assess the potential of traditional food crops (TFCs) to be 'future smart foods' through the lens of sustainability. Our study mainly relied on the primary data collected from farm households (n = 89) in the high mountains of Nepal and the hills of Bangladesh. The study found that farmers are gradually abandoning the cultivation of TFCs. In the last decade, cash crops such as mustard and cardamom in study villages in Nepal (SVN) and fruits and coffee in study villages in Bangladesh (SVB) were adopted to replace TFCs. In overall calorie intake at the household level, TFCs contributed only 3% and 7% respectively, in SVN and SVB. A sustainability analysis showed that TFCs have a huge potential to be 'future smart foods' because they are socially acceptable, have high nutritional values (social sustainability), and are key to the agrobiodiversity and resilience of farming systems (environmental sustainability). They also have the potential to improve famers' income and are more efficient in energy use during production cycles (economic sustainability). To promote TFCs as a sustainable solution for local farming systems and nutrition security, there is the need for a behavior change of both farmers and consumers, respectively, through the favorable policy environment and public awareness.

TI Nutrient flows and balances at the field and farm scale: Exploring
   effects of land-use strategies and access to resources
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB Nutrient flux and balance studies are valuable tools to assess the sustainability of agro-ecosystems and potential consequences for agricultural productivity. This paper presents results from a study at the field/farm scale representing mixed farming systems typical for the East African Highlands. We selected catchments in the Dega (cool highlands and Woina Dega (warm-to-cool mid-highlands) of the Central Highlands of Ethiopia, to get more insight on how individual land use strategies and access to resources affect the magnitude of nutrient flows and resulting balances and to explore some of reasons of the variability within and between farming systems at different altitudes. Our results show that environmental condition, farming system (e.g. choice of crop), access to resources (e.g. land, livestock and fertilizer) and smallholders' source of off farm income influence the magnitude of nutrient fluxes and the degree to which nutrient fluxes may be imbalanced.
   In some respects our results differ from studies carried out at larger (i.e. more aggregated) spatial scales, which consistently show that homestead fields are zones of accumulation and distant fields as zone of depletion. Our results indicate that this is not always the case, and highlight the need for studies at the field and farm scales to include detailed biophysical and socioeconomic information to help explain major nutrient fluxes and to evaluate the system with respect to sustainable production.

AB Taro leaf blight caused by Phytophthora colocasia is one of the most destructive diseases of Colocasia esculenta throughout the Pacific basin and has been responsible for the progressive loss of the favoured staple food in Micronesia, Melanesia and Polynesia. Nutrition is known to play a significant role in Phytophthora-induced diseases in many crop plants. However, there is a paucity of information regarding the effect of nutrients on the incidence of taro leaf blight.
   In American Samoa and other island countries where traditional farming systems use no additional fertilizers, the disease devastates the crop. Many of these traditional farming systems utilise organic mulches, which suggests the mulch alone may not offer sufficient nutrition to the plant under attack. This is a preliminary report on the evaluation of balanced nutrition in a sustainable, integrated management strategy to reduce the incidence of taro leaf blight.

AB Public expectations of farming practices are changing from a demand for environmentally,sustainable farming practices" to farming making an "enhanced contribution to the development of the rural areas", the so-called multifunctionality. Based on our research model of including farmers in the development of eco-friendly farming systems, we propose that the achievement of these changed expectations could be facilitated through an appropriate research and development initiative in several European regions. Key elements in such a project should include: (i) the establishment of platforms for dialogue and development of relevant indicators of multifunctional effects (ii) documentation of results obtained from a number of farms and (iii) analysis of development opportunities in the Light of the changes "requested". Participants in the regional platform for communication will include farmers, regional policy makers and administrators, grassroots movements and research staff. It is expected that such a coordinated research initiative can revitalize the contribution of farming to rural development and yield important insight to be used by the individual farmer in coping with future challenges.

TI A model to examine farm household trade-offs and synergies with an
   application to smallholders in Vietnam
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB Farm models have the potential to describe farming systems and livelihoods, identify trade-offs and synergies, and provide ex-ante assessments of agricultural technologies and policies. We developed three new modules related to budget, labor, and human nutrition for the bio-economic whole-farm model 'FarmDESIGN'. The expanded model positions the fanning enterprise within the farm household. We illustrate the model's new capabilities for farm households in two villages in Northwest Vietnam, where we conducted multi-objective optimization to identify options for improving the farm households' current performance on key sustainability and livelihood indicators. Modeling results suggest trade-offs between environmental, economic, and social objectives are common, although not universal. The new modules increase the scope for modeling flows of resources (namely cash, labor, and food) between the farm enterprise and the farm household, as well as beyond the farm gate. This allows conducting modeling explorations, optimization routines, and scenario analyses in farming systems research.

   SYSTEM IN SOUTHERN AUSTRALIA
SO NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
CT 1st National Perennial Grass Workshop
CY OCT 27-29, 1993
CL HAMILTON, AUSTRALIA
AB Land degradation, associated with farming systems based on annual pastures and crops, is threatening the long-term viability of Australian agriculture. Perennial pastures could play a significant role in reducing some forms of land degradation i.e. dryland salinity, erosion, and soil structure decline. In terms of sustainability, the key differences between perennial and annual pastures relate to rooting depth and the water uptake pattern throughout the year. Deep-rooted perennials can use water when annual pastures are dead, recover leached nitrate (and reduce acidification), and can provide soil cover and root mass to restrict wind and water erosion. Deeply penetrating roots also create biopores and improve soil structure and drainage. In addition, problems normally associated with water repellency are reduced as perennials are not required to germinate each year. There is an urgent need to breed plants that can colonise hostile Australian subsoils characterised by high soil strength, acidity, and high concentrations of toxic elements. In terms of the four perennial grasses considered in this workshop, we believe that the deeper rooting habit of phalaris and tall fescue offer more scope for overcoming degradation than cocksfoot and perennial ryegrass. Plant breeders need to consider the considerable benefits of deep-rooted lines and lines which are able to colonise soils with hostile subsoils.

SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE
AB Fisheries in Tripura form an integral part of the economy of the state. Indigenous technical knowledge in the field of fish farming is a practical knowledge of the local farmers of this district. This is based on intimate experience accumulated over generation after generation. Such traditional practices were sustainable in terms of land use, utilization of local available materials, labour, money, and could be easily operated without any specially skills. The study was conducted in the villages of Balaram and Maracherra clusters of Dhalai district of Tripura to collect the indigenous technical knowledge in fish based farming system, to characterize and catalogue the available bio-resources in the locality and to protect the IPR issues for future uses. Information was documented by using Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) like observation and discussion. In this study, the traditional knowledge of fish farmers were identified and described on integration of animal and plant component in fish based farming system, protection of fishes from enemies, ponds used for the protection of bamboo from damage and fishing methods. The ITKs on fish-cum-vegetable (bottle gourd) culture, paddy-cum-fish culture, fish-cum-duckery, practice of protection of fishes from enemies, ponds used for the protection of bamboo from damage, and different types of bamboo made fishing traps were recorded in the present paper.

TI Livestock carrying capacity evaluation in an integrated farming system:
   A case study from the mid-hills of Nepal
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
AB The crop livestock integrated farming system practiced in hilly regions of developing countries largely depends on the ecosystem as a whole. More especifically, the livestock component of the farming system relies heavily on natural resources such as forest, grazing and agricultural land for the supply of feed and fodder. The importance of animals as agents of nutrient recycling, sources of rural energy in terms of draft power and fuel, as well as being major contributors to the farm economy, has resulted in an increased population of ruminants in these regions, creating a threat to the sustainability and productivity of these land resources. This paper is an attempt to evaluate the livestock carrying capacity of land resources and to formulate the optimum herd size compatible with the differently resourced farm categories within the sub-watershed region of the mid-hills in Nepal. Our analysis reveals that the livestock carrying capacity of the land resources at the watershed level is 11696 Livestock Units (LU), whereas current stocking is 12985 LU, suggesting an overstocking of 1289 LU at the watershed level. Total feed supply from different sources is 12668 mt/yr whereas current Total Digestive Nutrient (TDN) demand is 14060 mt/yr, a negative balance of 1393 mt/yr. The excess livestock at the sub-watershed level directly implies excess livestock holding, producing a poor nutritional status for the farm household. Linear programming analysis reveals that the farmers of large, medium and small category farms can optimize their livestock holding by a combination of 3 LU buffaloes and 4 LU goats, 2 LU buffaloes and 4 LU goats and 1 LU buffaloes and 4.4 LU goats, thus giving maximum return to the farm family without exerting pressure on fragile natural resources.

TI Investigating the impacts of EU CAP reform 2014-20 and developments in
   sustainable olive farming systems
SO NEW MEDIT
AB In this paper, we investigate the adoption of sustainable olive growing practices in relation with the possible impacts of the recent EU CAP reform 2014-20 on diverse olive farming systems, taking Southern Spain as a representative case study. The analysis uses statistical methods and a Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) model calibrated with the neutral procedure. The PMP model compares the situation of the average olive farm in the baseline year with its position in a simulated year considering two policy scenarios: 1) all production systems are under CAP green payments, 2) only organic and integrated systems are under CAP green payments. Simulations show that for scenario I there is no variation in the area under the different farming systems with respect to the baseline year, nor in the gross-margin-before-aid. Subsidies increase slightly because agricultural policy does not consider the reduction for modulation included in the baseline year. In contrast, in scenario II, areas under integrated and organic farming increase to the detriment of conventional farming. It can be concluded that the distribution rules for green payments set out in the new CAP do not incentivize the adoption of integrated and organic farming. However, alternative policy options, allowing the implementation in the olive sector of environmental measures equivalent to the green schemes implemented in annual crops, could bring about additional positive effects in terms of redistribution of aid from less to more environmentally friendly farming practices. This outcome would contribute to both better rewarding the public goods generated through this public aid and boosting the legitimacy of the CAP transfers.

AB In this study, the economic profitability of hazelnut production in central Italy using conventional and organic farming systems was evaluated using the cost-benefit analysis methodology. Viterbo's province is the leading province in Italy in terms of quantity produced. Three indicators were calculated for both farming systems: net present value, payback time, internal rate of return. The analysis was conducted utilizing primary data collected by means of interviews and surveys with local farmers and organizations of producers. The collected production data refer to the decade 2008-2018; a global area of 100.34 ha and 76.14 ha were considered for conventional and organic cultivation, respectively. Sensitivity analysis was carried out considering different discount rates, price variability, and inflation rates. The net present value is equal to 92,800 euro/ha and to 3778 euro/ha, the payback time is 10.47 years and 42.94 years, while the internal rate of return is 12.2% and 1.1% for the conventional and organic production systems, respectively. The conventional production system performs significantly more remuneratively, considering that the price premium paid by the market for the organic product and the subsidies granted to organic farmers are not sufficient to balance the lower yield.

TI An integrated sustainability assessment of mediterranean sheep farms
   with different degrees of intensification
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB In the European Mediterranean basin, pasture-based sheep farming systems are mostly located in marginal/High Nature Value areas. These production systems are multifunctional, and their economic, environmental and social roles are equally important and recognised by policy makers and by society. However, the number of animals and holdings is decreasing, and there is great uncertainty regarding the reproducibility of these farming systems, which depends on many internal and external farm factors and their interactions. The aim of this paper was to perform a comprehensive assessment of sustainability in different sheep farming systems in north eastern Spain using the MESMIS framework. We followed a case-study approach to perform an in-depth investigation of 4 sheep meat and dairy farms with different intensities of reproduction management. Critical points of sustainability, including weaknesses and opportunities, were obtained using a participatory process with stakeholders (farmers and technical advisers) that resulted in the selection of 37 sustainability indicators that were classified according to the systemic attributes defined by MESMIS (productivity, stability, self-reliance, adaptability, equity) and according to the classical sustainability pillars (social, economic and environmental). Some underlying patterns could be observed when analysing sustainability pillars, attributes and indicators. A positive relationship between productivity and intensification level in meat farms was observed: however, economic sustainability was determined not only by on-farm but also by off-farm activities. The economic efficiency of farming (without considering subsidies) was mainly explained by the capture of added value in the dairy systems and the combination of high animal productivity as well as high forage and feed self-sufficiency in the meat systems. Social issues were also central to explaining sustainability at the farm level, including the prospects of generational turnover and the manner in which farmers perceive and rate their activity. A clear trade-off between economic and environmental indicators was observed, i.e., the higher the economic sustainability, the lower the environmental sustainability. Each farm scored differently for diverse attributes, pillars and individual indicators. The scores differed according to size, structure, resource availability and managerial skills, which implies that it would be difficult to apply a holistic sustainability analysis to farming systems instead of individual farms. A number of methodological questions arose during the evaluation process relative to the stakeholders perception of these indicators, their relevance and meaning, the reference values for comparison, or their validity to assess sustainability across spatial and temporal scales.

TI Approach for evaluating sustainable development in aquaculture: A
   methodological protocol
SO CAHIERS AGRICULTURES
AB In becoming a reference, a constraint, a high performance action for all economic activities, sustainable development transforms not only productive and organisational practices but equally produces new subjects and research situations that require methodological renewal. On the event of a research programme on the elaboration of an evaluation approach of sustainable development in aquaculture, a methodological protocol was elaborated in a multidisciplinary manner while taking into consideration the representations of actors. This protocol also makes it possible to give an account of the territorial and institutional insertion (introduction) of fish farming systems. The logic of the coconstruction approach that is carried out, starting from the principles to identify the criteria and indicators, constitutes a standard dimension which could be applied to other fish farming systems and even to other sectors. After presenting the hypothesis and assumptions that justify the approach, the actors present the research programme while emphasising methodological aspects. In conclusion, they debate the importance and terms of generalising the method as well as the types of relationship built with the actors in this event.

TI Landscape-scale analysis of cropping system effects on soil quality in a
   context of crop-livestock farming
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB Crop-livestock systems are complex farming systems in which many agricultural practices are combined. Sustainable management of soils in these farming systems requires comprehensive assessment of soil quality and consideration of soil properties and functions in an integrated way. This study evaluated soil quality in a 12-km(2) watershed that contains intensive crop-livestock farming systems typical of western France and characterized by high animal density and the co-existence of annual crops (cereals and forages, sometimes in rotation with temporary grasslands) and permanent grasslands. Physical (bulk density, aggregate stability), chemical (pH, copper, organic carbon, nitrogen, available phosphorus, C:N) and biological properties (bacterial and fungal abundance and diversity) of the soil were measured in the upper 15 cm of soil at 164 sampling points. Cropping systems at each point were described in detail from farm surveys, which collected data on crop rotations, manure and crop-residue management, fertilizer application and tillage. The variability in soil properties and the impact of cropping systems were quantified at the watershed scale. The percentage of variance of soil properties explained by the cropping system ranged from 6 to 47%, reaching 47%, 36% and 29% for aggregate stability after a fast wetting test, total nitrogen and organic carbon, respectively. Soil biological properties were explained less, but significantly so, by the cropping system as well. Soil properties were combined into a soil quality index. Among variables, crop rotation influenced soil quality the most, much more than manure application. Permanent grasslands and crop rotations with temporary grasslands had significantly higher soil quality indices than annual crops. This approach requires further development to analyze trade-offs among soil properties in crop-livestock systems.

TI Indigenous farming transitions, sociocultural hybridity and
   sustainability in rural Senegal
SO NJAS-WAGENINGEN JOURNAL OF LIFE SCIENCES
AB For many centuries, the indigenous agricultural and cultural systems of the Serer people of Senegambia ensured soil fertility, crop rotation, tree preservation, mixed farming and herding, yielding one of the highest population densities in the pre-colonial Sahel. In the 20th century, as population grew, soil fertility declined and climate change produced regular droughts, Serer farming systems changed to creatively combine many indigenous techniques with some modern practices. The Serer hybrid farming system that emerged especially after the late 1960s is demonstrably more productive than modern or indigenous techniques practiced in pure form (Faye et al., 2020). Given the productivity of hybrid farming techniques, this article asks: Who adopts them? And under what circumstances? Building on years of participant observation supplemented with a survey of 742 Serer farmers, I tested several competing explanations from neo-liberal, feminist, and cultural ecological approaches to understand why and among whom hybrid farming occurs. Multiple regression analysis shows a strong relationship between cultural syncretism and hybrid farming. Farming techniques are not just a matter of isolated, individual choice, but also work through the social and cultural systems that support agriculture. The more these systems reflect established patterns of mixing cultural elements, borrowing from outside and blending into and transforming Serer tradition, the greater the likelihood that farmers will use hybrid techniques. These findings have implications both for agricultural sustainability and for recognizing the sociocultural embeddedness of seemingly individual choices.

TI Transitions to agroecological farming systems in the Mississippi River
   Basin: toward an integrated socioecological analysis
SO AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB Industrial agriculture has extensive environmental and social costs, and efforts to create alternative farming systems are widespread if not yet widely successful. This study explored how a set of grain farmers and rotational graziers in Iowa transitioned to agroecological management practices. Our focus on the resources and strategies that farmers mobilized to develop opportunities for, and overcome barriers to, transitioning to alternative practices allows us to go beyond the existing literature focused on why farmers transition. We attend to both the ecological and socioeconomic context of innovation by comparing processes of technical change in two contrasting regions of Iowa. Farmers cultivated farm-level biodiversity and enterprise diversity, developed new cognitive and psychological competencies, and overcame barriers to innovation by developing external network linkages with peers, knowledge organizations, and federal policies. Our research provides insights into how biophysical, cognitive, structural and market considerations can be integrated into research efforts that aim to make sense of innovation toward sustainable agriculture.

TI Is highly intensive agriculture environmentally sustainable? A case
   study from Fugou County, China
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB The intensive cropping system of ''four-crops four-harvests" or "five-crops five-harvests" per year developed in Fugou County, Henan Province is a rotation system with very high productivity. The yield reached 15,825 kg/ha, which is 2.5 times of the yield per unit area in the traditional cropping systems of two crops per annum practiced in Henan Province. However, the concern has been whether these highly intensive agricultural practices are environmentally sustainable. This study attempts to address this concern by investigating the environmental, impact of the highly intensive farming system in Fugou County. Based on the production and economic results and analysis of key environmental indicators (soil fertility change, groundwater level change and content of NO3-N in groundwater) over 12 years, we concluded that there is no significant resource depletion nor environmental degradation that occurred on the farm. However, more research should be oriented to the existing major problems and constraints affecting the highly intensive farming system since the data of the case study is still a short period of time. Finally, policy options for further improvement of the highly intensive farming are recommended.

TI The traditional farming system of a Mexican indigenous community: the
   case of Nuevo San Juan Parangaricutiro, Michoacan, Mexico
SO GEODERMA
AB The objective of this paper is twofold: first, to describe the dynamics of the traditional farming system (TFS) of a rural indigenous community in Central Mexico and second, to detect the contribution of local knowledge to potential indicators of sustainable development.
   The method included the following steps: (a) field description of the TFS; (b) survey of local knowledge on both landscape and land qualities; (c) soil and maize grain yield sampling; and (d) statistical analyses relating local knowledge to field and laboratory data. A participatory approach was used; every field technique was carried out together with local producers.
   Statistical analyses of both field and laboratory data proved the consistency of peasant-defined land quality classes. Land quality was related to the distribution of available P, slope position and depth of recent volcanic ash cover. In addition, we detected a well-structured relief and soil quality knowledge-base.
   The TFS is a highly complex integrated scheme serving as a conceptual basis for decision-making procedures. The TFS does not attempt to maximize profit in cash. Its goal is self-sufficiency. These principles are at the core of decision-making procedures. The system represents a substantial part of the culture of Nuevo San Juan traditional producers. Family participation in the TFS is a key element; self-sufficiency gives security to the family. This explains the survival of the TFS despite its drawbacks, basically of a social nature rather than a technical nature. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Design of farming systems for low input conditions: principles and
   implications based on scenario studies with feed allocation in livestock
   production
SO NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
AB This study addresses the issue of designing farming systems for low input conditions. By focusing on the problem of feed (=resource) allocation in livestock systems it provides clues for the design of alternative agricultural systems and systems in general. Linear programming (LP) is used to examine system behaviour under conditions of varying feed resource qualities, for individual animal production levels that range from 0.75 to 3.00 times maintenance. Milk yield, animal numbers and amounts of feed offered or refused are measures of system performance in two hypothetical Cases representative for actual fanning systems. Case 1 considers available feed as one aggregated resource, with an average nutritive value ranging from that of straw to that of high quality forage. It establishes the individual animal output level that is required to achieve maximum total system output from a given feed resource. In Case 2, animals of different production levels are allowed to select between two feed resources that, through proper definition of the their proportions on offer, on average represent the same feed quality scale as in Case 1. The possibility of selection, however, allows the nutritive value of the actual intake to differ from the average nutritive value of feed offered. Better feed and higher (potential) individual animal output tend to increase total system output in terms of milk, by reducing the number of animals, Nevertheless, the term 'damning objective' is introduced to express that high targets for subsystem output reduces total system output if subsystem requirements exceed resource availability. Moreover, heterogeneity of (feed) resources can increase system output by using more production units with lower individual output. The results are tested against farmers' practice and situations reported in literature. Implications for the design of sustainable systems and further research are discussed.

TI Quantified Soil Evolution Under Shifting Agriculture in Southern
   Cameroon
SO FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB In the tropical rain forest zone of Southern Cameroon, shifting cultivation and perennial plantations of cocoa are the main farming systems practiced by small-scale farmers to ensure subsistence food crop production and a small income. This research used scientific modeling tools to produce quantitative information on the evolution of soils under this shifting agricultural system. An analysis of farming system led to the development of a conceptual model of the spatio-temporal dynamics of shifting agriculture, including transition matrices of rotational cycles that guided the sampling strategy for the study of soil evolution under the system. The study of soil variability showed that 30-35% of the total variance of some topsoil (0-20 cm) properties was due to the influence of land use practices. Five soil properties (pH, calcium, available phosphorus, bulk density and organic carbon) that are the most sensitive to these agricultural practices were empirically modeled and linear/quadratic fractional rational functions were successfully fitted to time series soil variables to derive quantitative measures on temporal changes in soil with land use. Data and methods produced are useful for soil quality assessment and spatio-temporal dynamic simulation in order to guide decision-making for sustainable land-use planning and soil resources management.

TI Land pressures, the evolution of farming systems, and development
   strategies in Africa: A synthesis
SO FOOD POLICY
AB Evidence assembled in this special issue of Food Policy shows that rising rural population densities in parts of Africa are profoundly affecting farming systems and the region's economies in ways that are underappreciated in current discourse on African development issues. This study synthesizes how people, markets and governments are responding to rising land pressures in Africa, drawing on key findings from the various contributions in this special issue. The papers herein revisit the issue of Boserupian agricultural intensification as an important response to land constraints, but they also go further than Boserup and her followers to explore broader responses to land constraints, including non-farm diversification, migration, and reduced fertility rates. Agricultural and rural development strategies in the region will need to more fully anticipate the implications of Africa's rapidly changing land and demographic situation, and the immense challenges that mounting land pressures pose in the context of current evidence of unsustainable agricultural intensification, a rapidly rising labor force associated with the region's current demographic conditions, and limited nonfarm job creation. These challenges are manageable but will require explicit policy actions to address the unique development challenges in densely populated rural areas. (C) 2014 The Authors.

TI Evaluating the Sustainable Intensification of arable farms
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Sustainable Intensification (SI) of agriculture has recently received widespread political attention, in both the UK and internationally. The concept recognises the need to simultaneously raise yields, increase input use efficiency and reduce the negative environmental impacts of farming systems to secure future food production and to sustainably use the limited resources for agriculture. The objective of this paper is to outline a policy-making tool to assess SI at a farm level. Based on the method introduced by Kuosmanen and Kortelainen (2005), we use an adapted Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to consider the substitution possibilities between economic value and environmental pressures generated by farming systems in an aggregated index of Eco-Efficiency. Farm level data, specifically General Cropping Farms (GCFs) from the East Anglian River Basin Catchment (EARBC), UK were used as the basis for this analysis. The assignment of weights to environmental pressures through linear programming techniques, when optimising the relative Eco-Efficiency score, allows the identification of appropriate production technologies and practices (integrating pest management, conservation farming, precision agriculture, etc.) for each farm and therefore indicates specific improvements that can be undertaken towards SI. Results are used to suggest strategies for the integration of farming practices and environmental policies in the framework of SI of agriculture. Paths for improving the index of Eco-Efficiency and therefore reducing environmental pressures are also outlined. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Yield and fruit quality of watermelon (Citrullus lanatus (Thumb.)
   Matsum. & Nakai.) and melon (Cucumis melo L.) under protected organic
   and conventional farming systems in a Mediterranean region of Turkey
SO BIOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE & HORTICULTURE
AB Protected conventional and organic farming systems for watermelon and melon were compared over a two-year period in the Mediterranean Amik plain of southern Turkey. Yield, fruit quality and growth responses of the vegetable crops were measured and compared as a function of conventional management, and three composted sheep-cattle manure treatments of 6 kg m(-2), 12 kg m(-2) and 18 kg m(-2). On average, total and marketable yields of watermelon and melon grown organically under low plastic tunnels showed a two-fold increase under the organic treatments of 12 kg m-2 and 18 kg m(-2) relative to the protected conventional management system (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in watermelon and melon yields between the manure application levels of 12 and 18 kg m(-2). There were significant changes in mean fruit weight and width between the control and the manure level of 18 kg m(-2) for watermelon and in mean stem diameter between the control and the manure levels of 12 and 18 kg m(-2) for melon (p < 0.05). Multiple linear regression (MLR) models accounted for about 49% and 52% of variations in marketable yields of melon and watermelon as a function of the control and the manure levels of 12 and 18 kg m(-2), respectively. The findings indicate that protected organic watermelon and melon systems in this Mediterranean region can produce more total and marketable yields than protected conventional systems. Protected organic farming systems can assist in compliance with maximum residue limits imposed on exported agricultural commodities and reduce dependency on industrial fertilizers as well as emissions of fertilizer production-related greenhouse gases.

TI Going sustainable or conventional? Evaluating the CAP's impacts on the
   implementation of sustainable forms of agriculture in Greece
SO LAND USE POLICY
AB The extensive use of conventional farming has brought about numerous negative effects in the environment and the quality of agricultural products, emerging the introduction of alternative forms of agriculture, including organic and integrated farming. The recent reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) implemented a policy scheme to encourage the engagement in organic and integrated farming, in an effort to ensure the quality and safety of agricultural production and enhance environmental protection. The objective of the present study is to investigate the main factors of the CAP that contribute to the implementation of these two alternative farming systems in Greece, furthermore, analysing the farmers' characteristics, opinions and attributes, towards the significance of each factor. The results indicate that the three main CAP's measures that affect the application of organic and integrated farming refer to the importance of farm certification, the product's promotion by other EU programmes and, predominantly the subsidized support of agricultural production.

AB Prototypes of Integrated Farming Systems for arable farming are being developed in the Netherlands based on a coherent methodology elaborated in an European Union concerted action. The role of crop protection in Integrated systems is, additional to all other methods, to efficiently control the remaining harmful species, with minimal use of well selected pesticides. The overall aim of more sustainable fanning systems is to reduce the exposure of the environment to pesticides in order to prevent short-and long term effects on all species over all the biosphere. An innovative approach to quantify this exposure of the environment to pesticides, based on molecular-chemical properties of the pesticides, is presented. The results of prototyping on an experimental farm in the Netherlands shows that not only drastic reductions in pesticide use are possible but that subsequent careful selection of pesticides can also lead to minimal environmental impact.

TI Assessing agro-ecological practices using a combination of three
   sustainability assessment tools
SO LANDBAUFORSCHUNG-JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AND ORGANIC AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB The alignment of the environmental, economic and social sustainability of farms is necessary for enhancing the provision of public goods in farming. This study combines the use of three tools for the assessment of farm sustainability. It provides first insights into the sustainability performance of farms at different stages of agro-ecological transitions in 15 case studies covering a range of different farming systems across Europe. Each case study reflects a different-transition towards agro-ecological farming. The tools applied were COMPAS (an economic farm assessment tool); Cool Farm Tool (a greenhouse gas inventory, water footprint and biodiversity assessment tool); and the SMART Farm Tool (a multidimensional sustainability assessment tool).
   First results of the use of combined sustainability assessments deepen the understanding of different farming systems. Sustainability performance varies greatly between farms, but overall, agro-ecological farms tend to enhance biodiversity and water quality. For soil quality, no clear patterns could be identified. The same applies to economic performance at different stages of the agro-ecological transition. Quality of life was generally rated medium to high on all investigated farms. The combined sustainability assessment enabled the identification of areas for further policy development.
   Aligning the tools required harmonising definitions, simplification and assumptions with regard to the input data of the tools.

TI Scaling up climate-smart regenerative agriculture for the restoration of
   degraded agroecosystems in developing countries
SO SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
AB Climate change and anthropogenic forces have increased the soil and water vulnerability of arid and semi-arid developing countries. Particular interventions are required to mitigate the soil, water, and food insecurity crises, and enhance the resilience of farming systems to climatic and anthropogenic stressors. This research contributes to the development of such systems by identifying the most efficient interventions for the restoration of soil and water resources and investigating the principal drivers of resilient farming. Given the complexity of the farm eco-systems, the challenges and problems of agricultural development in a vulnerable community (Kerman Province, Iran) were assessed. Using qualitative research, 37 barriers were identified. Also, AHP analysis identified climate -smart regenerative agriculture (CSRA) as a plausible and prominent solution for restoring degraded agroecosystems. However, CSRA development is in the incipient stage in developing countries, and its adoption rate is low. Interpretive structural modeling and MICMAC analysis indicated that political, strategic, economic, in-stitutional, structural, technological, ecological, social, cultural, and psychological changes are required to give the CSRA a chance at prosperity. Demand-driven and interactive research, regime transformation, mobilization of re-sources, market development, and multilateral coordination are keys to successful scaling up CSRA in soil and water vulnerable areas.(c) 2023 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

TI Drivers of change in mountain agriculture: A thirty-year analysis of
   trajectories of evolution of cattle farming systems in the Spanish
   Pyrenees
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB Mountain regions are characterized by complex interrelations between human and natural systems. Political and socioeconomic drivers at various scales affect mountain farming systems functioning, resulting in farm structural changes (management, structure and economic performance). Longitudinal studies help fully understand the dynamics of these systems, identify their main drivers of change, and prepare for foreseeable future events. This study aimed to (i) analyse the main changes of cattle farming systems in the Pyrenees from 1990 to 2018, (ii) identify the different trajectories of farm evolution and (iii) to determine the key drivers of those trajectories at global, regional and household levels. We monitored 50 cattle farms in three valleys with different socioeconomic contexts, which were surveyed in 1990, 2004 and 2018. We observed clear changes regarding land and labour production factors. Over the 1990-2004 period, farming systems experienced a land use extensification (one-month increase of grazing season) and capital intensification (55% increase of livestock units (LU) per work unit (WU)) processes, coinciding with a switch from dairy to beef farming with on-farm fattening. Over the 2004-2018 period, land use stabilised but the capital intensification process went on (17% increase of LU/WU) while farms reduced their inputs (43% decrease of feeding costs per LU), in parallel to the decreasing importance of fattening. These changes allowed to globally maintain stable farm economic margins (around 40,000 Euro/WU). Multivariate statistical analyses enabled to identify four trajectories of evolution, three of them specific to each valley under study and a common across-valleys trajectory. These trajectories resulted from the interaction between global and regional drivers and household particularities. The CAP played a major role at the global level (representing an average of 70% of farm gross margin in 2004 and 2018), while tourism development and household characteristics were the main drivers at the regional level. Several farms responded by maximising their output related to the most limiting production factor (i.e. agriculture land or labour) in each valley. However, the across-valleys trajectory, which comprised 44% of farms, showed limited changes during the studied period. The ability of farms to maintain their adaptation capacity while keeping economic and social viability will determine the future of cattle farming in the region. Our findings highlight the need of reorienting agricultural policies towards promoting new entrants into mountain farming, better integrating CAP instruments with other EU sectorial policies and improving farm monitoring by disaggregating follow-up processes by agroecosystem and management regimes.

TI Sustainable animal production systems in India: Issues and approaches
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES
AB Sustainable animal production as applicable to small farm production system in Indian context has been discussed. Livestock farming systems practised are mainly traditional and guided by socio-economic considerations, available feed resources and market demand. The present status of livestock production and the contribution of livestock to Indian economy through milk, meat, egg, fibre and draught animal power (DAP) have been examined along with future perspectives. The major issues as related to animal production are (i) environmental degradation, (ii) low external input, (iii) impact of technologies on livestock improvement and resource base, and (iv) large number of ruminants and methane emission. Role and impact of technologies as related to animal health, breeding and reproduction, frozen semen, crossbreeding, feeds and feeding and institutional structure in improving livestock productivity and production have been examined. Effects of high livestock density, over grazing and desertification on natural resources and environment and that of large number of ruminants on global warming have been deliberated. Number of livestock specially cattle and buffalo, that can be sustained to meet the higher food needs, DAP, clean environment and maintenance of natural resources have been discussed. A sustainable model for higher productivity of livestock has been proposed.

TI Econometric Analysis of the Determinants of Rice Farming Systems Choice
   in Cote d'Ivoire
SO SAGE OPEN
AB In sub-Saharan African countries, rice is grown through different rice farming systems (RFSs). Despite the growing interest of policymakers and significant research in ensuring sustainable rice production, little is known about the factors that underline the choice of the different RFSs. This study empirically examines key determinants of RFSs choice with Cote d'Ivoire, a case study, where three rice production systems are distinguished. Considering that farmers can make multiple choices, we use a Multivariate Probit model. Data were collected from 588 rice farmers randomly sampled in seven rice areas. The results show that the determinants of the choice of RFSs vary from one production system to another. More specifically, land tenure, presence of an irrigation system, intercropping system, access to extension services, membership in a rice farmers' organization, access to credit, paddy rice marketing, rice farm size, farming experience, off-farm income, gender, and household size influence the choice of the different RFSs. Our results suggest increasing investment in irrigation infrastructure, strengthening technical and organizational support to rice farmers, and defining guidelines for the intercropping system.

TI THE ROLE OF AGROECOLOGY AND INTEGRATED FARMING SYSTEMS IN AGRICULTURAL
   SUSTAINABILITY
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB Maintenance of biological diversity and nutrient cycling mechanisms are global principles that are common to all agroecosystems and therefore essential in the design of sustainable agricultural systems. Regional or site-specific factors include climate, soils and socio-economic preferences and conditions. These regional factors differ greatly among agroecosystems and may assume major importance in some. Research and development on global commonalities has potentially the most universal impact across all agroecosystems. Interdisciplinarity, participation of farmers and a whole farm level approach are fundamental to such research and development.

TI Transition from conventional to organic farming systems: I. Challenges,
   recommendations, and guidelines for pest management
SO HORTTECHNOLOGY
AB Conventional agricultural systems increase per-area food production, but deplete natural resources and degrade both crop and environmental quality. Many of these concerns are addressed by sustainable agricultural systems, integrated pest management, biocontrol, and other alternative systems. Environmental and social concerns have escalated the need for alternative agricultural systems in the last decade. One alternative, the organic farming system, substitutes cultural and biological inputs for synthetically made fertilizers and chemicals for crop nutrition and pest management. Practices used for crop and pest management are similar during transition from conventional to organic farming systems, but produce is not certified to be organic during the transition period. During the transition from conventional to organic farming, growers may face pest control difficulties and lower yields when conventional practices are abandoned. The objectives of this paper are to 1) give an overview of the reasons for converting to organic farming and the challenges that growers face during the transition period, 2) outline some potential strategies for crop, soil, and pest management, and 3) list guidelines and recommendations for pest management during the transition to organic farming. Implementation of crop and pest management practices depends on geographical location, climate, available onsite resources, and history of the land. During transition, growers rely on cultural mechanisms and on organic and mineral sources to improve soil fertility, to build a population of natural enemies to suppress pest populations. Pest management practices during the transition period that reduce pest populations to economically manageable levels include crop rotation, cultivation, cover crops, mulches, crop diversification, resistant varieties, and insect traps. These practices also enrich the soil biota and increase crop yields before produce is certified organically grown.

AB Various organic technologies have been utilized for about 6000 years to make agriculture sustainable while conserving soil, water, energy, and biological resources. Among the benefits of organic technologies are higher soil organic matter and nitrogen, lower fossil energy inputs, yields similar to those of conventional systems, and conservation of soil moisture and water resources (especially advantageous under drought conditions). Conventional agriculture can be made more sustainable and ecologically sound by adopting some traditional organic farming technologies.

TI Alternative upland grazing systems: Impacts on livestock performance and
   sward characteristics
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB Grazing management influences both economic sustainability and ecosystem change within farming systems. As part of an integrated study we progressively added elements to an upland sheep farming system in order to quantify the impacts on livestock performance and sward characteristics of (i) introducing cattle, (ii) incorporating semi-natural rough grazing (SNRG), (iii) altering the cattle:sheep stocking ratio, and (iv) replacing the mainstream breed of cattle (Limousin cross) with a rare breed (Belted Galloway). Data were collected for four years from 2005. Mixed grazing with cattle improved the liveweight gains of lambs, particularly post weaning, regardless of the duration of cattle grazing or the cattle:sheep ratio. Calf growth rates were highest on improved pasture, but acceptable weight gains were also recorded for both breed types when grazing the SNRG, with the Limousin cross calves gaining in excess of 1.0 kg d(-1). Overall, there was little evidence that altering the grazing system led to increased sward heterogeneity at the field scale under conditions representative of normal agricultural practice. Utilisation of Molinia caerulea was similar for the traditional and modern breeds of cattle. The results challenge common perceptions regarding the relative value of different elements within upland livestock systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A basic characterization of small-holders' goat production systems in
   Laghouat area, Algeria
SO PASTORALISM-RESEARCH POLICY AND PRACTICE
AB In order to investigate the practices of goat breeding and establish a classification of goat herds, a survey was conducted with 106 goat breeders in the semi-arid region of Laghouat. Two indigenous breeds were encountered in this survey: the Arabia and the Mekatia; the Arabia being found as the dominant. The results show that breeders choose the breeding goats with a goal of generating more income in cash from the sale of products. The goat milk marketing chain appears to be weak. The milk produced is primary used for home consumption. A multivariate analysis categorized the goat farming of Laghouat region into three groups corresponding to three different farming systems: cluster 1 (pastoral system), cluster 2 (mixed crop-livestock system) and cluster 3 (small herds in zero grazing system). The in-depth study of the goals and contexts of goat farming in Laghouat will allow policy makers to design strategies for sustainable development of goat breeding in the region.

TI Water Use and Productivity of Maize-based Cropping Systems in the
   Alqueva Region (Portugal)
SO CEREAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
AB In intensive irrigated farming systems, the way to improve productive efficiency depends on the proper management of resources. With the implementation of the Alqueva global irrigation system in the southern Portugal region of Alentejo, agricultural intensification is a reality that imposes to farmers the challenge of producing more and more efficiently, ensuring the farming systems sustainability. This work resulted from an on-farm demonstration project carried out in two locations in the Alqueva region. Water use and water productivity were studied during 2012/2013 and 2013/2014, in three double cropping systems: a maize monoculture (MM) and two rotations, barley + maize-barley (BM-B) and sunflower-barley + maize (S-BM). Maize yields were influenced by the length of the crop cycle. In the rotation BM-B, with a predominance of autumn-winter crops, water requirements were lower and the total volume of irrigation applied was approximately half of the monoculture (5930 m(3)/ha and 13,230 m(3)/ha, respectively). When the potential crop yield was reached, maize had the higher water productivity (the highest value achieved was of 2.7 kg/m(3)). Overall, as a result of the lower yields achieved, the water productivity values indicate a less balanced performance of the S-BM rotation.

TI Sustainability of agroecological interventions in small scale farming
   systems in the Western Highlands of Guatemala
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB The Western Highlands of Guatemala are dominated by small-scale farming in indigenous communities. Mountain conditions and overpopulation have led to expansion of the agricultural frontier with consequent degradation, decreasing yields, poverty and malnutrition. Several non-government organizations (NGO) have carried out interventions to rescue themilpasystem and diversify farming systems. We used the Framework for the Evaluation of Management Systems using Indicators (MESMIS) to evaluate farm sustainability after such interventions. We analysed data from four participating NGOs, interviewing 50 farmers with several years of collaboration as alternative systems, and 50 farmers of recent incorporation as reference systems. A trend towards moderate improvements was found in yields, food availability and reduced losses due to pests, diseases and climatic events. Given the environmental conditions and farm size it seems unlikely that most farms could achieve food self-sufficiency. In some cases, the increase in yields and food security correlate with a higher external input dependence. Even with agroecological interventions, external inputs might be needed. Direct indicators need to be measured in future studies for soil quality and erosion control. Even though the study cases showed regional differences, it was possible to develop a common, robust group of indicators, along with some case-specific ones.

TI Sustainable public procurement and constrained agricultural
   entrepreneurship
SO AIMS AGRICULTURE AND FOOD
AB This paper analyzes the relevance of green public procurement (GPP) in boosting the transition to more sustainable and innovative regional and localized agrifood systems. Many scholars have emphasized the importance of the GPP in stimulating various positive effects and impacts on the sustainability of agrifood systems. Framed within the context of the sustainable competitiveness of localized agrifood systems, the GPP represents an excellent opportunity for a more sustainable farming sector. If well exploited, it may relaunch smallholder farms' competitiveness on a regional scale. Moreover, the GPP effectively addresses sustainability issues like fighting food insecurity and reducing food waste. The possibility of adhering to these localized modes of food provisioning engenders constrained rural entrepreneurship due to the regulatory system which mandates compliance by the farming sector. The paper provides an empirical analysis of the region Lazio of Italy to evidence the eventual propensity of regional farms and eventual entry barriers. The results of the analysis show, on the one side, high interest primarily within regional organic farms; on the other side, the results evidence that compliance with mandatory regulation and organizational and logistic assets represent the principal limit to exploit this opportunity fully. Consequently, reduced exploitation of this opportunity is translated into a rate of transition to more sustainable regional farming systems.

TI Responses of soil microbial biomass and activity for practices of
   organic and conventional farming systems in Piaui state, Brazil
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY
AB The aim of this work was to investigate the response of soil microbial biomass and activity to practices in organic and conventional farming systems. The study was carried out at the Irrigation District of Piaui, Brazil. Five different plots planted with "acerola" orchard (Mal-pighia glaba) and established at the following management were evaluated: (1) under 12 months of soil conventional management (CNV); (2) under six months of soil organic management (ORG6); (3) under 12 months of soil organic management (ORG12); (4) under 18 months of soil organic management (ORG18); and (5) under 24 months of soil organic management (ORG24). Soil microbial biomass C (C-mic), basal respiration, organic carbon (C-org, C-mic-to-C-org ratio and metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) were evaluated in soil samples collected at 0-10 cm depth. The highest C-org and C-mic levels occurred in organic system plots ORG18 and ORG24 compared to the conventional system. Soil respiration and C-mic-to-C-org. ratio were significantly enhanced by the organic system plots. The qCO2 was greater in conventional than in organic system. These results indicate that the organic practices rapidly improved soil microbial characteristics and slowly increase soil organic C. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB The characters of spices seed production varied amongst regions as influenced by physical, social-economic, and environmental factors, therefore, seeding institutions are specific to each type of plant and development area. This study aims to analyze the clove seed institutions in West Java and formulate an institutional development model to improve sustainability of clove farming system. The study was conducted in Garut and Tasikmalaya Regencies, West Java in June-November 2018. The surveys were conducted using the snowball sampling method. Research data were qualitatively analysed using the SWOT method. The results showed that the source of clove seeds in West Java mostly originated from the Garut High Producing Block which had been established by the Directorate General of Plantation. The certification and supervision of seed quality were carried out by the Regional Quality Certification and Supervision Board. There were three existing clove seed institutional models, namely Direct Model, Recommendation Model, and Plantation Seed Business Permite Model. The majority of the clove seed growers (100 of 115) in West Java did not have Plantation Seed Business Permits. The study suggests that the institutional model of clove seedling should encourage farmer/grower to partnerships with the seed certification institutions, research institutions, and universities, as well as financial institutions and distributors.

TI Sustainable Agriculture and Good Agricultural Practices in Turkey
SO KSU TARIM VE DOGA DERGISI-KSU JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURE
AB Good agricultural practices (GAP) first initiated in Europe to provide food security and quality. Good agricultural practices in Turkey have been started at 18 provinces in 2007 and it showed great development due to increasing subsidies within the last three years. However, it is important to increase the demand to these products in order to sustain GAP. Adoption of a marketing strategy considering consumers' preferences will probably increase the production as well as competition among companies involved in this process. In this paper, developments of GAP in the world and its reflections over Turkey have been examined.

TI New approach combining food value with nutrient budgeting provides
   insights into the value of alternative farming systems
SO FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY
AB Sustainable farming systems provide food for humans while balancing nutrient management. Inclusion or exclusion of livestock has nutrient management implications, as livestock produce food from otherwise inedible crops and their manure is a valuable soil conditioner. However, plant-based diets are becoming more widespread due to perceived environmental benefits. We measure both food production in terms of nourishment to humans (in this study measured by protein, fat, starch and sugar production) and nutrient sustainability in terms of fertiliser use of six rotational farming systems with differences in nutrient management approaches. The arable practices included were the application of synthetic fertilisers, a range of organic amendments, incorporation of crop residues and legume cultivation. Livestock and associated products were included in some systems but excluded in others. The production of protein, fat, starch and sugar was combined with the balance of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) into an overall measure of nutrient use efficiency of human macronutrient production. Across all systems considered, N use efficiency (5-13 kg protein/kg applied N) was lower than P (84-772 kg protein/kg applied P) or K (63-2060 kg protein/kg applied K), and combining synthetic fertiliser use with organic amendment applications raised production significantly while balancing P and K management, regardless of which organic amendment was used. Legume-supported rotations without livestock produced more protein, starch and sugar per unit area than those with livestock. Nutrient balances and nutrient use efficiencies were more sensitive to management changes than purely food production. Using this approach allowed us to identify areas for improvement in food production based on the specific nutritional value of offtakes as opposed to yield overall.

TI Conservation agriculture for food security and climate resilience in
   Nepal
SO AGRONOMY JOURNAL
AB Achieving the sustainable development goals of the United Nations requires innovations in agriculture and development of climate-smart and economically feasible approaches for smallholder farmers in developing countries. Historical climate data of Nepal, which include 116 yr since 1901, has shown an increasing trend for average temperature by 0.016 degrees C yr(-1) whereas precipitation has shown a decreasing trend by 0.137 mm yr(-1). Such weather trends could enhance glacier melt associated flooding, and delayed monsoon rainfalls negatively impacting the agricultural production. The Nepalese government is promoting conservation agriculture (CA) through development of low-cost technologies that can be used effectively in difficult terrains. Such techniques include crop diversification, crop rotation, cover crops, and minimum tillage; all of which can reduce soil degradation. In addition, increasing crop residue retention can result in greater C sequestration and crop yield and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. However, there is still lack of consensus on the merits of CA in the context of smallholder farming systems in Nepal. This paper reviews existing literature and provides an overview of farming practices in Nepal, highlights near-term challenges associated with climate change and food security, and discusses the role of CA as a climate-smart strategy to minimize soil degradation and improve food security.

TI A review of agricultural research issues raised by the system of rice
   intensification (SRI) from Madagascar: opportunities for improving
   farming systems for resource-poor farmers
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB The "system of rice intensification" (SRI) that evolved in the 1980s and 1990s in Madagascar permits resource-limited farmers to realise yields of up to 15 t of paddy/hectare on infertile soils, with greatly reduced rates of irrigation and without external inputs. This paper reviews the plant physiological and bio-ecological factors associated with agronomic practices that could explain the extraordinary yields in terms of synergies resulting from the judicious management of the major crop production factors: time, space, water, plant nutrients and labour. The findings underscore the importance of integrated and interdisciplinary research, combining strategic and adaptive (on-farm participatory) approaches that explore and link bio-physical and socio-economic factors in crop production. Such approaches would permit to unlock currently untapped production potentials of rice and other major cereal grain crops, without extra costs to farmers or to the environment.

TI Potentialities of an agricultural cooperative for agroecology
   transformation
SO AVANCES
AB One of the most pressing problems in the production of tobacco in the province of Pinar del Rio, has been the degree of physical, chemical and biological deterioration of the soils dedicated to the crop. The human activity on the ground constitutes one of its main causes, for that reason several investigations have been made to solve this problem. The objective of the work was to determine the potential of a tobacco cooperative for agroecological transformation. A study was carried out based on the following indicators: economic control, management of pests and diseases, existence and use of water, selection of varieties and species of seeds and indicators of use, management and conservation of soils. Two fundamental techniques were applied: the interview and the survey of 32 landowners. The results obtained indicate that producers are not motivated and identified with the need to change the traditional farming system to agroecological or soil conservation systems; expressed in a low motivation due to ignorance and application of techniques and measures, limiting the transformation of traditional farming systems to agroecological or soil conservation systems, on the other hand there is a clear identification of the producers with the policies of the state conservation and improvement of soils.

TI Understanding and Changing Farming, Food & Fiber Systems. The Organic
   Cotton Case in Mali and West Africa
SO OPEN AGRICULTURE
AB Science should be capable of covering issues as diverse as farming systems, technology, innovation, climate change adaptation, poverty alleviation, extension, policy and practice, as they all relate to sustainable agriculture and development. Some years ago, the call for a new farming systems approach was raised to accommodate the principles of interdisciplinary, systems thinking and participatory research. Society calls for systems performance that provides stability and sustainability (SDGs!), multi-scale and territorial approaches and looks for solutions for critical issues such as employment, migration and inclusion/exclusion at the global level (World Society). We propose here a way in dealing with this complexity by addressing the mentioned problem from the communication and symbolic perspective, i.e. to consider the "object" within agricultural science but mainly observe the dedicated systems of communication. By using the concept of social systems, we can accommodate under it systems as diverse as farms, extension organizations, innovation patterns, (agricultural) sciences, policy and politics, farmer and indigenous knowledge, markets and value chains, but always in the form of communication. As such, we remain within a discipline with the potential to evolve towards a promising sub-discipline of agricultural sciences (or of sociology?). The relatively new farming approach of certified organic in combination with agroecology is relevant for family farms and small-scale entities. It depends much more on societal support for extension, technology development and policy coherence than commercial farms. Organic agriculture, with its standards, technological requirements and consumer preferences is nested in socio-economic and political networks, which makes it challenging for researchers to integrate the various components. This challenge applies particularly to countries with poorly developed institutions, weak organizations and within the context of poverty and rural exodus. We therefore use a unified approach under a single scientific system. This system observes, analyses and reports on communication aspects of involved (observed!) social systems (including networks and interactions) within the society of any given nation, including the realities of globalized markets. We are developing a case study based in Mali, in which we apply this method. The case is describing a planning process involving cotton farmers from the Sikasso region, the cotton industry, public and private extension systems, farmer organizations, local governments, the NARS (IER), FiBL, donors and the national institutions involved in climate change adaptation and food security. Various technological options of production (conventional, organic) and farming systems are available. The reflexive use of science dealing with human behavior may facilitate the pragmatic participation of researchers from various disciplines in addressing the uncertainties and opportunities that lie ahead of us and achieve the required impacts together with the practitioners.

TI Capturing the diversity of Mediterranean farming systems prior to their
   sustainability assessment: The case of Cyprus
SO LAND USE POLICY
AB Prior to any sustainability assessment and/or any effort to understand or develop the agricultural sector, the acknowledgment of the diversity of farming systems (FSs) is crucial. Typologies are often used for this purpose. The goals of this study were, for the first time, to identify and characterize the divergent FSs that exist in southeastern Cyprus, and analyse the main drivers of variability among FSs. Beyond this empirical exploration, this study explores the suitability of typology delineation for understanding the heterogeneity of FSs prior to their sustainability assessment and for the potential of adoption of sustainable intensification technologies. The multivariate statistical techniques of principal component analysis and cluster analysis were employed on data from a representative sample of 324 farms in the study area. Results proposed six FSs, differentiated by land use, livestock, production pattern, farm, household, labour and economic variables. FS1-FS4 were crop-oriented and FS5-FS6 were livestock-oriented cultivating cereals and fodder crops for on-farm consumption. Only FS1 was profitable without subsidies, which were negatively associated with economic results. This casts doubt on the effectiveness of subsidies in providing the basis for a more profitable agricultural sector. FS3-FS5 households sought off/no-farm income mainly for their survival (i.e. complementary source of income), but not to cross-subsidize the farm. Small crop-oriented farms (FS4) and medium-sized livestock-oriented farms (FS5) had several weaknesses, such as elderly, low-educated managers and low profitability; thus, their viability should be the priority of decision makers. It was also observed a weak complementarily between the main system components (crop, livestock, off/non-farm income), which might negatively affect sustainable intensification. The importance of group membership for farm sustainability was also highlighted. The results of this study can be used for a more focused agricultural policy, tailored to the different constraints and opportunities of FSs, but also to inform public decision makers who are responsible to design and implement agricultural policy in Cyprus, or in other European Mediterranean regions with similar FSs and agro-ecological conditions.

TI Mechanization in Ghana: Emerging demand, and the search for alternative
   supply models
SO FOOD POLICY
AB Influential studies in the 1980s and early 1990s drew on the Boserup-Ruthenberg theories of farming systems evolution to argue that African countries were not yet ready for widespread agricultural mechanization. Through applying the theories of farming systems evolution and of induced innovation in technical change, this paper shows that demand for certain mechanized farming operations particularly plowing has emerged even among smallholders, suggesting that supply issues may now be the main constraint to successful mechanization. We therefore adopt a supply chain approach to analyze two types of mechanization practices in Ghana, i.e., a recent state-led mechanization program and the private sector-led service hiring market, against an international perspective by drawing on three Asian supply models. We identify two major flaws in existing policies. First, the agricultural mechanization service centers that the government promotes fail to use tractors services with sufficient intensity. Second, direct importation of agricultural machinery by the government inhibits imports of appropriate and affordable machinery. In contrast, the development of mechanized service hiring market in which medium and large scale farmers who are tractor owners provide hiring-out services to small-scale farmers represents a promising model for sustainable mechanization in Ghana. This private sector-led second model is consistent with international experiences. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Towards sustainable productivity enhancement of rice-based farming
   systems in sub-Saharan Africa
SO FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
AB In the past 50 years, rice has become an important crop for food security in sub-Saharan Africa. However, rice yields remain relatively low, and large yield gaps exist. This Special Issue brings together agronomy research on rice-based farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa and addresses three main, overarching questions: (1) what has been achieved in the past decades in terms of rice agronomy in sub-Saharan Africa, (2) what is the state-of-the-art regarding development of technologies and (3) what will be likely or required future directions? The broad topics included in this Special Issue are (1) yield trends and yield gap analyses, (2) soil & nutrient, water, weed and integrated crop management practices, (3) cropping systems, (4) genetic improvements, (5) crop simulation modeling, and (6) assessment of farmers' rice cultivation practices and the sustainability of these practices. The papers cover different sub-regions, from the Sahel to the highlands of Madagascar and three major rice growing environments (irrigated lowlands, rainfed lowlands, and rainfed uplands). In this paper we describe the major challenges in the rice production sector in sub-Saharan Africa and historical efforts on agronomy research, and we provide a short introduction and discussion on the papers presented in this Special Issue. This Special Issue arrives at six main recommendations. 1. There is a need to increase research and development efforts focusing on rainfed rice-based systems. 2. More attention needs to be paid to research on the farming system or landscape level, aimed at development of integrated cropping and farming systems and integrated agronomic solutions. 3. Current and future agronomic rice research should thematically center around sustainability, including judicious natural resources management, climate change adaptation and mitigation, and conservation of biodiversity and environments. 4. To operationalize this, sustainability performance indicators need to be developed and used. 5. There is broad consensus regarding the need for more labor-saving technologies, including mechanization op-tions, provided these do not increase the ecological footprint of production systems. 6. Future rice agronomy research work should be interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary, to better address the myriad of challenges of smallholder farmers in Africa. Papers presented in this Special Issue should inform on the state-of-the art in rice agronomy in SSA, and on ways to sustainably enhance rice production and self-sufficiency in this region.

TI Assessing the well water pollution problem by nitrates in the small
   scale farming systems of the Niayes region, Senegal
SO AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
AB Human activities exert many pressures on the quality of groundwater, and advanced assessment programmes are needed to design sustainable water management strategies. To contribute to this challenge, the nitrate pollution problem of groundwater wells in the small scale farming systems of the Niayes region in Senegal is assessed and explained in terms of well characteristics and land use properties. A field campaign was performed in 2007 to collect basic background data of the small scale farming systems and well water was analysed in 131 wells for nitrate content, pH and electrical conductivity. For a subset of wells, soil analyses were made of the well environment for assessing the attenuation properties of the protecting soil. Cluster analysis was used to define a well typology, while principal component and multiple correspondence analyses were used to relate the nitrate pollution to well characteristics and land use properties.
   The study confirms that the wells are seriously affected by the nitrate pollution problem. Wells can be classified in three well classes which exhibit highest nitrate content in the southern part, while the salinity affects particularly the wells in the northern area of the region. The nitrate levels exceeding 50 mg/L are more common in residential areas than in the horticultural fields. The results further show that, even if direct pollution problem of wells cannot be excluded, pollution from leaching out of the root zone of vegetable crops to the groundwater is likely. This is confirmed by the assessment of the farming activities in this area and this is consistent with the low attenuation properties of the soils characterizing this region.
   Considering the nitrate pollution threshold, very few non-polluting crops can be distinguished in this region, which calls for an urgent adoption of agriculture management to protect water resources from further deterioration. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Agronomic and environmental causes of yield and nitrogen use efficiency
   gaps in Chinese rice farming systems
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
AB Yield (YG) and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) gap analysis is a key tool in addressing the sustainable intensification of agricultural systems. Distinguishing and quantifying the underlying agronomic and environmental causes of these gaps is as important as estimating their magnitude. We applied a field experimental framework that allowed us to partition YGs and NUE gaps due to crop management, climatic factors and/or inherent soil productivity. YG and NUE gaps were determined as the differences between yields and NUE under standard farm practices and the attainable yield and NUE using optimum management practices. In farmers fields in China, the rice YG and NUE gap (expressed as the partial factor productivity of applied N, namely kg rice grain per kg fertilizer N applied, PFPN) averaged 1900 kg ha(-1) and 18 kg kg(-1), respectively. However, both were subject to large variability within and across different rice farming systems in response to key agronomic and environmental variables, with larger gaps in moderate- and low-yielding fields and in single rice systems. Management practices such as optimizing N and water management and increasing rice transplanting density simultaneously narrowed the YG by 38% and the NUE gap by 39% on average. Climatic- (YG-C) and inherent soil productivity-based YGs (YG-S), which represented fractions of YG derived from climate and soil variability, accounted for on average 16% and 38% of the total YG across low- and moderate-yielding fields in single rice systems, and by 14% and 27% in early and 11% and 20% in late rice farming systems, respectively. Growing-degree days (GDD) for early rice and daily minimum temperature (T-MIN) for late rice were the best predictors of YG-C. For single rice in the Yangtze Delta, YG-C included multiple factors such as lower daily mean temperature and GDD, and higher daily maximum temperatures and precipitation during rice growing periods. Soil nutrient supplying capacity was partially responsible for YG-S in those under-performing fields. Significant and exploitable potential exists for increasing rice productivity with higher NUE, especially in moderate- and low-yielding fields. However, national and regional agricultural policies should place more emphasis on supporting good agronomy and soil management, thus moving towards a soil-climate smart management approach in rice farming systems.

TI Farmers' perceptions and management of risk in rice/shrimp farming
   systems in South-West Coastal Bangladesh
SO LAND USE POLICY
AB Farmers in Bangladesh face considerable risk due to fluctuations in biophysical and economic conditions, but the response to these risks is poorly understood. In particular, there is a need to better understand the endogenous management of risk in the rice/shrimp farming systems that have emerged in the inner coastal zone of Bangladesh. This paper draws on a case study of a typical rice/shrimp farming village in Khulna District to explore: (a) farmers' perceptions of risks and their management responses, (b) risk-return trade-offs within small-, medium-, and large-farm households, and (c) the role of other farm and non-farm activities in mitigating risks to household livelihoods. Farm-level data were collected through a reconnaissance survey, a village census, household case studies, and a sample survey of 73 households. Representative farm budgets were constructed for the three farm-size classes. The key performance indicators calculated were gross margin (GM), net income (NI), and GM per workday of family labour. The riskiness of the rice/shrimp system was assessed for each farm type using farmers' estimates of low, normal, and high yields and prices to specify triangular distributions. Cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) for GM, NI, and GM per workday were generated. A whole-farm economic analysis was also conducted to assess the relative contributions of different sources of income for each farm type. With access to saline water for shrimp farming in the dry season and fresh water for rice in the wet season, farmers have developed and progressively adapted an alternating rice/shrimp farming system that has minimised the trade-offs between the two crops and provides a good return to household and village resources for all farm types. The system is subject to significant production and market risks, especially the shrimp component. However, farmers have clearly perceived these risks and ameliorated them through a range of production, marketing, and management strategies. With these risk management practices, the rice/shrimp cropping system is economically viable, given the current variation in yields and prices. The greater risk associated with the shrimp component was offset by the renewed stability of the rice component over the past decade, and the risks of the whole cropping system were offset by other farm and non-farm sources of livelihood. Development interventions need to work with farmers to provide further options (suitable rice varieties, solutions to shrimp disease, improved village and transport infrastructure) if this resilience is to be maintained.

TI INTERCROPPING - AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SUSTAINABLE FARMING SYSTEMS. A REVIEW
SO SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES A-AGRONOMY
AB As population expansion, urbanization, environmental pollution, and climate change, the global food crisis is currently aggravated in the world. One strategy for coping with the effects of climate change in arid regions is intercropping. The purpose of this paper is to review the main types of intercropping- Row intercropping, Mixed intercropping, Strip intercropping, Relay intercropping and present their advantages. Intercropping is as a multiple cropping system, in which two or more crops species planted simultaneously in a field during a growing season. An example of sustainable farming systems is intercropping, which creates balance with the environment, contributes to better use of resources, and reduces damage from diseases and pests. Potential advantages of this practice include higher crop yields- due to extra sunlight that taller crops receive on their borders. Intercropping enables plants to efficiently utilize plant growth resources like water, nutrients, sun light; to improve soil erosion control. Intercropping patterns are more effective than monocropping in suppression of weeds, but their effectiveness varies greatly. Intercropping is ways to increase diversity in an agricultural ecosystem.

TI Carbon Footprint and Sustainability of Agricultural Production Systems
   in Punjab, India, and Ohio, USA
SO JOURNAL OF CROP IMPROVEMENT
AB Sustainability of agricultural systems depends on their carbon (C) footprint, and the C-output :C-input ratio. Thus, this study was conducted with the objectives to: (i) assess the agricultural C emissions in relation to predominant farming systems in Punjab, India, and Ohio, USA; (ii) evaluate C-use efficiency of production systems; and (iii) determine the relative sustainability of agronomic production systems as determined by their C footprints. The data collated on C-based input into the soil for predominant crops for both regions included the amounts of fertilizers (N, P, K), herbicides and pesticides used for each crop annually, tillage methods, cropland area, total production of each crop, area under different farming systems, water-management practices (e.g., tubewell irrigation), and total number of livestock. These data were used to compute C equivalent (CE) per hectare of input and output, and the relative sustainability indices as a measure of the C-production efficiency. There existed a linear relationship observed between C input and C output for Punjab, indicating that an increase of 1 Tg/yr (1 Tg = teragram = 10(12) g = million ton) of C input resulted in the corresponding C output of similar to 12 Tg/yr. A similar linear relationship between input and net C output between the 1930s and 1980s was observed for Ohio, and the ratio reached a plateau during 1990s. The average C-sustainability index (increase in C output as % of C-based input) value for Ohio from 1990 to 2005 was 35-43, almost 2.5 times that of Punjab. Since 1989, there has been a major shift in Ohio from conventional tillage to reduced and conservation tillage along with a decline in fertilizer use. No-till farming is practiced on about 35% of the cultivated area, which involves elimination of plowing, retention of crop residue mulch, and judicious use of chemicals. In Punjab, crop residues are removed, resulting in loss of C from the soil organic carbon pool. Hence, the C-based sustainability index is much higher in Ohio than in Punjab. C-efficient systems are more sustainable than inefficient farming systems, and residue removal reduces agricultural sustainability by depleting the soil C pool.

TI Agroecology: A Global Paradigm to Challenge Mainstream Industrial
   Agriculture
SO HORTICULTURAE
AB Considerable controversy continues to exist in scientific and policy circles about how to tackle issues of global hunger, malnutrition, and rural economic decline, as well as environmental issues, such as biodiversity loss and climate change adaptation. On the one hand, powerful vested interests, with close ties to government, media, and academic institutions, propose high-input technology-based solutions, speculative and neoliberal "market-based" solutions, and export-oriented agricultural models. On the other hand, an international scientific and grassroots Food Movement has emerged, calling for a redesign of the Global Food System in support of small-scale agroecological farming systems. A call to re-evaluate our current Food Systems was made in 2008 by the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD). Here, using the IAASTD study as a backdrop, we review the recent literature to outline key contentious points in the controversy between the need for high-input and "techno-based" versus agroecological farming models. A critical assessment is made of proposed strategies to protect soil resources, improve nutrient and energy cycles, protect agrobiodiversity, and promote social well-being in rural communities. With an increase in the number of affluent consumers (i.e., the middle class) in the developing world, and with the continued problem of extreme and chronic poverty with other larger sectors of society, Organic Farming and Agroecology models are put forward as a sound social, scientific, and rural development strategy.

AB Cloves are one of the main Malagasy agricultural exports and their production is based on family farming. Helping farmers to develop their cropping systems towards more sustainable systems calls for a comprehensive picture of the diversity of their practices. This study set out to fill knowledge gaps on this point. Three scales were considered, i.e. plot structure, cropping system and farming system, in order to identify the principal characteristics, functions, and constraints of clove-based farming systems. We applied a double typology: one focused on cropping systems and the other on farm functioning. A study of practices showed three types of cropping systems and a main tendency to associate cloves with other species, both annual and perennial, in agroforestry systems (AFS). In wet tropical areas, AFS are often the only means of subsistence for poor farmers, but also potential vectors of economic and social development. A study of complex AFS structures on a restricted sample showed that cloves, which accounted for nearly 70% of perennial species in the plot, are mainly associated with fruit species, structural timber and firewood, and sometimes coffee. The global farm level approach made it possible to identify highly contrasting situations: from young and dynamic farms geared toward food production or livestock farming, to old, poor and only slightly diversified farms.

TI Long-Term Nutrient Cycle in Improved Grain Yield of Dryland Winter Wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L.) under Hydrological Process of Plant Ecosystem
   Distribution in the Loess Plateau of China
SO PLANTS-BASEL
AB Precipitation is the major cause of crop yield variation in rainfed agriculture production in the Loess Plateau. As over fertilization is economically and environmentally undesirable, and crop yield and the resulting returns for N input are uncertain when rainfall variability is high, optimizing N management according to precipitation during fallow season is vital for efficient crop water use and high yield in dryland rainfed farming systems. Results show that the nitrogen treatment rate of 180 treatment significantly increased the tiller percentage rate, and the leaf area index at anthesis, the jointing anthesis, anthesis maturity dry matter, and nitrogen accumulation was closely related to yield. N150 treatment compared to N180 treatment significantly increased the percentage of ear-bearing tiller by 7%, dry substance accretion from jointing to anthesis by 9%, and yield by 17% and 15%, respectively. Our study has important implications for the assessment of the effects of fallow precipitation, as well as for the sustainable development of dryland agriculture in the Loess Plateau. Our results indicate that adjusting N fertilizer inputs based on summer rainfall variation could enhance wheat yield in rainfed farming systems.

TI The relationship between grand river dairy farmers' quality of life and
   economic, social and environmental aspects of their farming systems
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB During early 1997, after focus groups, interviews and a mail survey were administered to a random sample of Grand River watershed dairy farmer in the Grand River watershed of southwestern Ontario. This paper Summarizes the main results of the study. We concluded that these farmers have achieved a very good average quality of life. Their farming systems display good productivity, excellent viability and stability and moderate average environmental protection-all important elements of sustainability. This is mainly because they have steady incomes as a result of their supply managed system, excellent cattle genetics, strong family relationships and spirituality. If they had to leave their dairy farms they would miss the open space and country living more than anything else. There is some concern that international free trade agreements may threaten supply management to which the majority attribute their stable and reasonably good incomes. Environmental protection may also be at risk for many dairy farmers. For instance, their present manure management system is a limiting factor preventing as many as a third of them from expanding their herds in addition to such other barriers as the high price that they must pay for the milk quota that they must purchase.

TI Potential strategies of adaptation of mixed sheep-crop systems to
   changes in the economic environment in a Mediterranean mountain area
SO LIVESTOCK SCIENCE
AB In the Mediterranean regions, sheep farming systems are mostly located in less favoured areas and play a multifunctional role. Nevertheless, those systems have experienced a strong decline in the last decades, which has led to the abandonment of pasturelands and other socio-economic changes in some areas. Traditionally, sheep farming systems are associated to cereal crops and remain common in Mediterranean areas. The objectives of this study were (i) to evaluate the possible adaptation strategies for sheep-crop mixed systems in the Sierra and Cafiones de Guara Natural Park (SCGNP) to changes in the agricultural policy measures and the labour market, and (ii) to approximate the value of grazing as an environmental function provided by these systems. Four types of mixed sheep-crop systems (MSCS) in SCGNP were established in a previous typology (Bernues et al., 2004. Cahiers Options Mediterraneennes 62,195-198). In 2007-2008, a survey was carried out 46 farms (95% of sheep farms that used the Natural Park). From that information, four farms were selected, one for each type of MSCS to be modeled. Mixed linear programming models were developed. Five socio-economic scenarios were simulated depending on CAP conditions, availability of labour (farmer pluriactivity), and prioritization of grazing. Under the scenario of total decoupling of the CAP subsidies, the best Gross Margin was obtained by the mixed farm with large flock and oriented to cereal cultivation (MSCS3) and the mixed farm with a large flock (MSCS2), but labour productivity was highest in the most cereal-oriented mixed systems. Off-farm work was economically profitable in the majority of the MSCS, which may lead to a decrease in the livestock farming activity and changes in land use with a reduction in the area leased for grazing, and in the area used for the cultivation of lucerne and sainfoin. Under current conditions (total decoupling of subsidies, high cereal prices), the total production of barley was sold, i.e., not fed to livestock. In contrast, in the scenarios of no subsidies, maximization of the use of pastures, or reduction of barley price, the farmhouse barley consumption for feeding livestock increased. The most livestock oriented farm (MSCS2) was the type of mixed farming system that should receive the least economic compensation for grazing as an environmental function provided by this farm and the most cereal-oriented systems required the most compensation. Nevertheless, the MSCS studied were highly diverse in the distribution of land use and trade-offs exist among the environmental functions performed by them. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI Regenerative, semiclosed systems: A priority for twenty-first-century
   agriculture
SO BIOSCIENCE
AB This overview draws attention to several reasons to encourage the design of new agronomic systems, shifting from conventional open or leaky systems to more closed, regenerative systems: Current systems cause over consumption of environmental resources, contribute to climate change, rely on increasingly expensive fossil fuel, and result in environmental (e.g., groundwater) contamination. Moreover, the agronomic-urban interface is growing, as are markets for ecologically friendly produce, the need for low-input farming systems in low-income regions, and disenchantment with the subsidization of conventional agriculture. There is reasonable biological and economic evidence to support advocacy for a shift to regenerative systems. Such a shift presents challenges-for example, although higher labor input enhances community well-being and rural social capital, it is costly. It also offers opportunities-for example, to adapt technologies to monitor and minimize wastage. Shifting to semiclosed systems would be accelerated by (a) routine life cycle analysis and costing; (b) calculation of the full costs to society of farm inputs such as pesticides; (c) food labeling and standards that draw attention to energy and other inputs; (d) government grants supporting the transition to semiclosed systems; (e) changing priorities for agronomic research; and (f) greater engagement of urban societies in agriculture through recreation and philanthropy.

TI Integrating fish into irrigation infrastructure projects in Myanmar:
   rice-fish what if...?
SO MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
AB With rapidly increasing investment in water control infrastructure (WCI) and a recently ratified agriculture development strategy that promotes integrated farming of high-value products such as fish, agricultural production, already fundamental to Myanmar's economy, will be central to driving the countries' socioeconomic transformation. Water planners and managers have a unique opportunity to design and manage WCI to incorporate fish and, in so doing, reduce conflicts and optimise the benefits to both people and the ecosystem services upon which they depend. Results from rice-fish culture experimental trials in Myanmar's Ayeyarwady Delta are providing an evidence base for the importance of integrating fish into WCI, highlighting a range of both environmental and social benefits. By using less than 13% of paddy land area and through best management practices, existing rice productivity is sustained, alongside a 25% increase in economic returns for the same land area from fish. In addition, there are considerably more protein and micronutrients available from the fish produced in the system. Should these farming system innovations be adopted at scale, Myanmar stands to benefit from increased employment, incomes and nutritional value of farm plots (alongside associated reductions in pesticide pollution) and water use benefits.(1</SUP)

TI Spatial analysis and characteristics of pig farming in Thailand
SO BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH
AB Background: In Thailand, pig production intensified significantly during the last decade, with many economic, epidemiological and environmental implications. Strategies toward more sustainable future developments are currently investigated, and these could be informed by a detailed assessment of the main trends in the pig sector, and on how different production systems are geographically distributed. This study had two main objectives. First, we aimed to describe the main trends and geographic patterns of pig production systems in Thailand in terms of pig type (native, breeding, and fattening pigs), farm scales (smallholder and large-scale farming systems) and type of farming systems (farrow-to-finish, nursery, and finishing systems) based on a very detailed 2010 census. Second, we aimed to study the statistical spatial association between these different types of pig farming distribution and a set of spatial variables describing access to feed and markets.
   Results: Over the last decades, pig population gradually increased, with a continuously increasing number of pigs per holder, suggesting a continuing intensification of the sector. The different pig-production systems showed very contrasted geographical distributions. The spatial distribution of large-scale pig farms corresponds with that of commercial pig breeds, and spatial analysis conducted using Random Forest distribution models indicated that these were concentrated in lowland urban or peri-urban areas, close to means of transportation, facilitating supply to major markets such as provincial capitals and the Bangkok Metropolitan region. Conversely the smallholders were distributed throughout the country, with higher densities located in highland, remote, and rural areas, where they supply local rural markets. A limitation of the study was that pig farming systems were defined from the number of animals per farm, resulting in their possible misclassification, but this should have a limited impact on the main patterns revealed by the analysis.
   Conclusions: The very contrasted distribution of different pig production systems present opportunities for future regionalization of pig production. More specifically, the detailed geographical analysis of the different production systems will be used to spatially-inform planning decisions for pig farming accounting for the specific health, environment and economical implications of the different pig production systems.

   strategies in the eastern Himalayan mountain ecosystem (India)
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Land degradation caused by soil erosion (SE) in forests converted into cropland under climate change, particularly with increased rainfall intensity, is of great concern to the agricultural sustainability of the tropical mountain ecosystem. We evaluated the response of six hilly micro-watersheds (HMW) under different Integrated Farming Systems (IFSs) to SE in multi-model climate change scenarios using the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model. The IFSs were forestry (HMW1), abandoned shifting cultivation (HMW2), livestock with fodder crops (HMW3), agroforestry (HMW4), agri-horti-silvi-pastoral (HMW5), and horticulture (HMW6) established on a hilly slope (32.0-53.2%) of the eastern Himalayas (Meghalaya, India). The WEPP model was calibrated and validated with measured runoff and soil loss data of 24 years for each of the six IFSs. The projected annual SE (average) for all HMWs increased in all RCPs. The IFS based on shifting cultivation (HMW2) was the most vulnerable, with the highest percentage increase in SE (46-235%) compared to the baseline years (1976-2005) under RCP 8.5. The cultivated IFSs (HMW3 to HMW6) had 47.8-57.0% less runoff and 39.2-74.6% less soil loss than HMW2 under RCP 8.5. Of these, HMW6 followed by HMW4 and HMW5 were the most effective at minimizing soil loss. Simulation results showed a reduction in soil loss through adaptive strategies such as mulching with broom grasses, stones, field beans, and the introduction of subsurface drainage. Adoption of IFS based on horticulture and agroforestry with bio-mulching on steep slopes is an effective measure to control soil erosion in the eastern Himalaya (India).

TI Predictable patterns of unsustainable intensification
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB To increase understanding of agricultural intensification processes over time and their sustainability, we studied dimensions of sustainability in the context of ongoing expansion of intensive, commercial mono-cropping of banana in Southwestern Uganda. In our approach we considered five dimensions of sustainability: economic, agricultural productivity, environment, social and human. We compared farming systems in 1998 and 2018 and integrated a gender lens. A total of four focus group discussions, two group interviews and fifteen individual interviews (8m / 7f) were conducted, complemented with a discourse analysis of newspaper articles. Results show that although intensification of banana production increased the average income level indicating improvement in the economic dimension, it did not yield sustainable outcomes in the other dimensions. The integrated analysis of five dimensions of sustainability illuminated aspects often neglected in assessment studies or policy-making around agricultural intensification, in particular socio-economic and gender dynamics. We further recognized that the observed local trends are part of a set of patterns that take place throughout the world. We conclude that to advance sustainable development, stakeholders should move away from the current over-emphasis on economic values prioritizing the individual, and that avoiding patterns of unsustainable development requires broadening to environmental and community values.

TI Economic and social impacts of organic production systems
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE
AB Given relatively low adoption levels to date, the potential benefits of organic farming systems are not yet very visible. However, there is growing evidence in the literature that adoption of such systems produces multiple environmental, social, and financial benefits that can solve pressing agricultural problems in Canada. Compared with their duration as conventional operations, most organic farms in North America perform better under organic management. This outcome is usually a product of lower input costs, more diversified production and marketing channels, resilience in the face of variable market conditions, higher premiums, and a better capacity to adapt to weather extremes. However, the performance of farming systems including some horticultural and animal production systems, for which our ecological understanding is limited, is still frequently inferior. The data on social impacts are less conclusive, but there is some evidence that when a community has many sustainable (including organic) producers, there are positive shifts in community economic development and social interaction. The reasons appear to be related to the need to hire more labour, the increased demand for local goods and services, and a greater commitment to participation in civic institutions.
