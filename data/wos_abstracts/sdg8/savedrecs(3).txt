AB People in the developing countries who lack basic services and economic opportunities are primarily concerned with improving their living conditions. At present, unemployment problem in the rural areas of the developing countries are diversifying the moral values and social responsibilities of unemployed youth. To solve the problem, rural development centres (involving vocational training, IT services and other productive activities) can contribute significantly for the upliftment of these rural youths and can transform them into grass-root entrepreneurs. One critical factor hindering the establishment of such rural development centers is access to affordable and reliable energy services. Under this backdrop, environmentally benign renewable energy systems can contribute significantly in providing much needed energy in the unserved or underserved rural development centers in the developing countries to achieve both local and global environmental benefits.
   The paper demonstrates that energy deficient, economically backward communities in the off-grid areas of the developing countries, can be given an array of opportunities for income generation and social progress through rural development centers with the aid of renewable energy sources (such as wind, solar photovoltaics, solar thermal, biomass and micro-hydro), thereby improving their standard of living. Poverty alleviation in rural areas can be accomplished and the critical role of access to adequate level of energy services, Information Technology (IT) and modem communication facilities in it demonstrated. Furthermore, the production, implementation, operation and maintenance of renewable energy applications being labor-intensive, will also result in job growth in the village context, preventing migration of labor force, especially of young men, from rural areas to overcrowded industrial areas. An appropriately designed renewable energy systems can also have a significant role in reducing the impact of climate change through non production of green house gases.

AB The main challenge to energy policy makers in the 21st century is how to develop and manage adequate, affordable and reliable energy services on a sustainable manner to fuel social and economic development. About 60 per cent of the world's two billion population, who do not have access to modern energy services, live in Asia and the Pacific region. The demand for energy is expected to continue growing at a high rate well into the century, often at a greater rate than economic growth. Latest assessment of conventional energy resources shows that their availability is not going to be an immediate threat to the security of supply but the question is can the region afford to allow current patterns of production and consumption of energy to continue in a rapidly deteriorating health of the environment? Changing these unsustainable patterns is the main challenge for the developed and developing countries alike. The paper dwells upon what are the major issues facing the region in promoting sustainable energy development and what are some of the policy options and possible strategies that the countries could consider to attain the objective of sustainable energy development. In this respect, the paper also dwells upon the need for strategic planning and management of energy resources. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Global population aging: Unequal distribution of risks in later life
   between developed and developing countries
SO GLOBAL SOCIAL POLICY
AB Much of the existing research on population aging has focused on its impact, including both opportunities and challenges, on developed countries, particularly those in Europe and North America. This article discusses how unequally population aging will distribute risks in securing socio-economic resources for the wellbeing of individuals in later life between developed and developing countries around the world. Based on a documentary analysis of relevant literature and findings from the survey data drawn from Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), United Nations (UN), and World Health Organization (WHO), this article discusses four main areas of the unequal distribution of risks in later life: (1) burden of disease in epidemiological transition, (2) financial security in retirement, (3) familial resources for elderly care, and (4) care workforce for elderly care. While population aging is a global trend, its impact is not equal; over the next decades, today's developing countries will likely contend with double challenges at least in these areas.

TI THE APPLICATION OF GLOBAL-MODELS FOR COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT STRATEGIES
   ON SUSTAINABLE LIVING
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB A global model was developed to enable a comparison of different strategies for transfer of economic resources from industrialized countries to developing countries. The model is based on a part of the recent published model ''Beyond the Limits'', but distinguishes between the industrialized countries and the developing countries for comparison of different strategies for transfer of resources from the rich to the poor world. The model has 8 state variables: production capacity, population and agricultural production in both industrialized and developing countries, pollution level and resources. The model equations and the tested scenario arc presented in detail. Global models arc not able to make accurate prognoses, but provided that the most crucial relationships are qualitatively correct, our previous experience in global modelling has shown that it may be possible to a certain extent to assess the relative difference between the application of different strategies. The results of the various simulations. based on alternative strategies, are compared and it is found that a much more massive transfer of economic resources is needed to assure development towards better pollution abatement and a reduction in the population growth, i.e., more sustainable development. Furthermore, it seems extremely important that the rich world spends considerably more money on pollution abatement and allocates sufficient resources directly to the family planning program in the developing countries. This seems the only method to stop population growth before it goes ''beyond the limits'' and thereby prevents all possibilities for sustainable development.

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Environmentally friendly behaviour and the equitable and sustainable use of natural resources can contribute to solving various environmental, economic, and social problems in different countries. The analysis of the perception of young students is important because schools are suitable for educating future generations and shaping their attitudes to also include a greater concern for the environment. This research aims to determine the degree of influence that a series of Likert-type questions of knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours about sustainable development has on a series of items of the student profile (gender, age, course, and household members) in a developing country. For this, an artificial neural network is used that allows us not only to quantify the degree of influence but also to obtain an estimation of the student's profile according to the responses obtained on sustainable development. The network developed allows us to obtain, through a determined collection of answers to questions about sustainable development, the estimation of a specific profile of a student from a developing country. This can be useful to educational communities interested in optimising economic resources through sustainable development, allowing them to know which issues they should focus more (or less) on according to the profile of the student they are targeting.

AB This research analyses the long run and short run relationships among economic growth, poverty and energy using the Colombian case. In this study, we use the time-series methodologies. The results regarding the relationship among economic growth, poverty and energy show that increases in gross domestic product and energy supply per capita should lead a decrease of poverty, which should demonstrate that access to modern and adequate energy services help to decrease poverty and to increase economic growth. Moreover, the improvements in energy efficiency have contributed to increase economic growth from an approach of sustainable development. These results are important for the adequate design, formulation and application of policies and strategies that encourage a better energy use to improve economic growth and decrease poverty, especially in developing countries.

TI Understanding the political economy and key drivers of energy access in
   addressing national energy access priorities and policies
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB Globally, 1.5 billion people lack access to electricity and nearly 3 billion lack access to modern cooking energy options. Of the world's "energy poor", 95% are in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Within Asia, almost 80% of electricity-deprived and 86% of biomass-dependent populations are in the "Big 5" countries: Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan. In this paper, we discuss the broad contours of the political economy of energy access in these countries. The political economy is assessed through an examination of three sustainability objectives: accessibility of physical infrastructure; energy service delivery; and conformance to social goals. The key areas of concern include emphasis on supply-driven grid electricity; vested power dynamics favouring affluent and urban areas; unreliability of energy service provision; and misdirected and misappropriated subsidies. The above-mentioned issues are responsible for limiting accelerated achievement of universal energy access in the "Big 5" countries and need to be addressed through innovative approaches. The paper emphasizes the need for firm commitments, policy convergence, and the implementation of 'pro-poor' equitable energy policies through a broad-based energy framework of bench-marked, technology-neutral energy provisioning that ensures reliability and equity. It highlights the need for reorienting of the subsidy regime and incorporating energy service delivery indicators in monitoring and reporting mechanisms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Environmental problems are very often ascribed to pollution. Nevertheless, various other environmental impacts are also associated with abusive exploitation of natural resources that remain abundant in many developing countries. An urgent public intervention Boncoeur [1], therefore, seems necessary and reasonable public policies must be found. Since economic resources and coastal environment in some countries, notably in developing ones, lack expertise, the recourse to the Expert System triggers public attention and intervention for sustainable management of resources. In this respect, the present article examines advantages of expert systems, notably the P6chakour Expert System (PES), as being helpful tools in decision-making. Another objective of this article is to highlight the efficiency and practical character of such expert systems.

TI CANCER IN DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES - OPPORTUNITY AND CHALLENGE
SO JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE
AB Epidemiologic observations indicate that environment and lifestyle are the major determinants of the geographical patterns of cancer. The developing countries, which account for 75% of the world's population, have lower incidence rates of cancer compared with the industrialized nations but bear more than half the global cancer burden. Demographic trends resulting from economic progress (decreasing incidence of infectious diseases, population growth, aging, and urbanization), coupled with increased tobacco consumption and dietary changes, indicate that developing countries will bear a continually increasing proportion of the world's cancer burden and its accompanying demand for the provision of costly treatment programs. Yet the developing countries command only 5% of the world's economic resources, and health care programs are already fully extended and frequently inadequate. Thus, cancer control in the developing countries, including preemptive prevention of the anticipated increases in cancers presently more common in the industrialized nations (e.g., lung, breast, and colon), should include much greater emphasis on cancer prevention than is presently the case. But there is another perspective. The developing countries, with their dramatic contrasts in lifestyles and environments and equally diverse patterns of cancer, provide an unparalleled, and often neglected, opportunity for studies directed toward understanding the mechanisms of environmental carcinogenesis. Such an understanding should eventually lead to the development of novel intervention approaches. Unfortunately, cancer research is much more difficult to conduct in the developing countries because of the lack of population-based registries, poor communication and transportation systems, and deficiencies in infrastructure, financial support, and the training of health professionals. These difficulties could be overcome, to the benefit of all, if the extent of collaboration in cancer research between the developing and industrialized nations were to be greatly expanded.

AB About 2 billion people of the world, mostly in rural areas of the developing countries, do not have access to grid-based electricity. The most critical factor affecting their livelihoods is access to clean, affordable and reliable energy services for household and productive uses. Under this backdrop, renewable and readily available energy from the nature can be incorporated in several proven renewable energy technology (RET) systems and can play a significant role in meeting crucial energy needs in these remote far flung areas. RETs are ideal as distributed energy source and they can be incorporated in packages of energy services and thus offer unique opportunities to provide improved lighting, health care, drinking water, education, communication, and irrigation. Energy is also vital for most of the income-generating activities, both at the household or commercial levels. Access to energy is strongly connected to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which set targets for poverty reduction, improved health, and gender equality as well as environmental sustainability. Environmentally benign renewable energy systems can contribute significantly in the above-mentioned unserved or underserved areas in the developing countries to achieve both local and global environmental benefits. This is important in the context of sustainable development in: (i) poverty alleviation, (ii) education, (iii) gender equity and empowerment, (iv) health including other benefits like improved information access through Information and Communication Technology (ICT) centers, (v) better security, and (vi) increase in social or recreational opportunities. It is evident that proliferation of renewable energy resources through implementing their applications for meeting energy demand will promote all the three dimensions namely, social, economic and environmental of sustainable development in the developing countries.
   Several small scale enabling RET systems have been suggested in this paper in the light of above-mentioned issues of energy sustainability and they can significantly contribute to the improvement of the livelihood of the remote impoverished rural communities of the developing countries. With the current state of technology development, several RET systems (such as wind, solar photovoltaics, solar thermal, biomass and micro-hydro) have become successful in different parts of the world. In this paper, an exhaustive literature survey has been conducted and several successful and financially viable small-scale RET systems were analyzed. These systems have relevance to the economies of the developing countries that can be utilized for electrification of domestic houses, micro enterprises, health clinics, educational establishments and rural development centers.

While energy is a multifaceted issue, the issue that has attracted the most attention has been the need to provide universal access to modern energy services. Without access to energy services, people are destined to live in poverty. The provision of such services is a key ingredient to providing a sustainable way of living for all the world's population. This article first outlines the significance of access to energy services in the poverty debate. Secondly, this article considers what strategies have so far been adopted by states to confront this issue and the difficulties that such initiatives have encountered. Against this background, the final section makes the case for access to energy services as a human right and commences the task of providing a content for such a right.

SO ENERGIES
AB Renewable energy can help to tackle energy poverty issues of the availability ofmodern energy services and the sustainability of energy supply. Based on the concept of the Energy Development Index, published by International Energy Agency, this paper builds the clean energy development index and applies the Grey incidence decision method to analyze regional energy poverty issues in China. A model using panel data investigates the influencing factors that are governing energy poverty alleviation and the relationship between energy poverty and social development. The improved index system not only considers the access to modern energy services, but also addresses the cleanliness of energy supply and the transition to clean energy consumption for cooking. The results indicate that due to insufficient clean energy development, China's Northeast and West regions have experienced increasing energy poverty problems, while energy poverty in the Southwest region has improved considerably because of its renewable energy development. Urbanization, affordability, and renewable energy development can increase access to modern energy services, contributing to energy poverty alleviation. However, the role of rural household consumption levels in energy poverty alleviation should be considered in rural energy policy.

AB As an important factor of production, economist traditionally considers entrepreneurship as a key factor for encouraging economic growth, especially in developing countries. With tourism is one of the fastest growing economic sectors and closely linked to development of most developing countries, this study aims to examine the effect of tourism on entrepreneurship by using panel data of 56 developing countries for the period between 2010 and 2017. Using a panel data technique, namely the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator, the results suggest that tourism play an important role in improving the level of entrepreneurship in developing countries, which are robust across different specification. Therefore, governments should aim to further develop the tourism industry to support a more sustainable entrepreneurship development in developing countries.

TI Microhybrid Electricity System for Energy Access, Livelihoods, and
   Empowerment
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE
AB Ensuring reliable and affordable access to modern energy services, especially for the poorer and deprived section of the population, is a basic requisite for sustainable development. Given that a majority of the energy-deprived population lives in rural regions of developing countries, an effective rural electrification is critical for bridging the rural-urban divide. Building on energy access intervention, implementing productive energy services can influence the next stages of development through livelihood activities, microenterprises, lifestyle energy services, value-added activities, survival irrigation, and so on. Social benefits of access to healthcare, education, and longer productive hours have an equally important impact on sustainable development. In India, for example, 240 million people lack electricity access. While grid extension in India is on the rise through various government programs, specific rural problems of low energy demand, poor rural economy, inaccessible terrain, and low purchasing power can render grid extension expensive and inefficient. Microgrid electricity systems, especially with hybrid renewable energy resources, can be a good alternative for addressing above-mentioned challenges. India enjoys high solar intensity, and the predominantly agrarian rural society has enough biomass resources, abundant cattle dung, forest foliage, and agricultural waste. A solar-biomass hybrid electricity system can solve the problem of intermittency of solar. Such a hybrid electricity system is being implemented in a remote Indian unelectrified village for electricity access, livelihoods, and economic empowerment. In this paper, we report the technoeconomic feasibility and sustainability analysis of this hybrid system. The system consists of 30-kW solar photo voltaic (PV) and 20-kW biomass gasifier modules. Energy demand and resource availability are estimated with inputs from extensive stakeholder discussions and field surveys, and they account for daily and seasonal variations in both supply and end uses and availability and productive hours. The expected temporal electricity demand is estimated for households, community, irrigation, and commercial needs. The technoeconomic feasibility is assessed using hybrid optimization model for electric renewable energy (HOMER). Furthermore, opportunities for the development of productive uses and their expansion through a sustainable business model are explored.

AB The urge of sustainable development has received increasing interests among construction industry stakeholders. The construction industry is considered having a major role to participate in implementing the principles of sustainable development, which leads to the development of the discipline of sustainable construction. The International Council for Research and Innovation in Building and Construction (CIB) in partnership with the United Nations Environment Programme has commissioned the important report on Agenda 21 for Sustainable Construction in Developing Countries (A21 SCDC) to facilitate the development of a strategy for introducing sustainable construction into developing countries. In line with this development, many research works have been conducted in investigating challenges and solutions for promoting sustainable construction in developing countries. It is well appreciated in the existing studies that implementation of sustainable construction in developing countries needs special attention concerning economics and social issue. This article presents comprehensive understanding on the comparison of practising sustainable construction between developed and developing countries. Focus is given to the investigation on the challenges to sustainable construction in developing countries. An empirical study using questionnaire survey was conducted in Malaysia and Hong Kong. The results revealed that the government is the main driver to implement sustainable construction. Suggestion of adopting efficient construction procurement systems to meet sustainable construction challenges is presented.

SO MILBANK QUARTERLY
AB Context: Developing countries face critical choices for introducing needed, effective, but expensive new vaccines, especially given the accelerated need to decrease the mortality of children under age five and the increased immunization resources available from international donors. Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is a tool that decision makers can use for efficiently allocating expanding resources. Its use in developing countries, however, lags behind that in industrialized countries. Methods: We explored how CEA could be made more relevant to immunization policymaking in developing countries by identifying the limitations for using CEA in developing countries and the impact of donor funding on the CEA estimation. We conducted a comprehensive literature search using formal search protocols and hand searching indexed and gray literature sources. We then systematically summarized the application of CEA in industrialized and developing countries through thematic analysis, focusing on pediatric immunization and methodological and contextual issues relevant to developing countries. Findings: Industrialized and developing countries use CEA differently. The use of the Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) outcome measure and an alternative generalized cost-effectiveness analysis approach is restricted to developing countries. In pediatric CEAs, the paucity of evaluations and the lack of attention to overcoming the methodological limitations pertinent to children's cognitive and development distinctiveness, such as discounting and preference characterization, means that pediatric interventions may be systematically understudied and undervalued. The ability to generate high-quality CEA evidence in child health is further threatened by an inadequate consideration of the impact of donor funding (such as GAVI immunization funding) on measurement uncertainty and the determination of opportunity cost. Conclusions: Greater attention to pediatric interventions and donor funding in the conduct of CEA could lead to better policies and thus more worthwhile and good-value programs to benefit children's health in developing countries.

TI How effective are small-scale energy interventions in developing
   countries? Results from a post-evaluation on project-level
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB In many developing countries large parts of the population are negatively affected by the lack of access to clean and affordable energy. Providing sustainable energy services to these people has been acknowledged as a key component to reduce poverty. One form of development assistance to address the needs of the energy-poor at the local level are small-scale renewable energy projects. Like all development interventions, these energy projects are not intended to produce short-term outputs, but to create long-term impacts. Thus, it has become increasingly important to evaluate and accurately assess their sustainability. But despite the widely recognized need to identify successes factors and explain failure only few studies exist that address the sustainability of small-scale of energy development efforts post implementation. Against this background the paper presents the results of a post-evaluation of 23 projects supported via the Sustainable Energy Project Support (SEPS) scheme of the WISIONS initiative run by the Wuppertal Institute. The analysis provides insights on the influence that socio-economic, environmental, geographic and gender factors can have on the sustainability of small-scale renewable energy projects in developing countries.

TI Spatial data infrastructures for cities in developing countries -
   Lessons from the Bangkok experience
SO CITIES
AB The cities of the developing world face major problems in managing growth and their urban infrastructure. The experiences of cities in the developed world have usually proved inappropriate in developing countries and consequently new and innovative solutions are continually being explored for these cities, Geographic information systems and the underlying spatial data infrastructures appear to offer significant potential to assist in managing human settlements in developing countries. In examining the status of spatial data infrastructures in developing countries, the first part of the paper compares cities in developing countries to those in the developed world. It then highlights issues facing developing countries in establishing spatial data infrastructures to support efficient urban land management. The paper describes the Bangkok Land Information System as an example of a city attempting to use spatial information technologies to manage the urban environment. This case study, together with the experience of the authors, are used to describe generic issues involved in the development of spatial data infrastructures for cities in similar socio-economic conditions. The paper provides a technical and institutional framework for the development of spatial data infrastructures for cities in developing countries. The paper concludes by suggesting that simple, low cost, project oriented, easily maintained and user-friendly spatial information technologies have the best chance of success.

AB GHG emission from the developing countries is projected to contribute to 61% of the global GHG emission by 2030. With less economic resources, the developing countries face the unique challenge of balancing their economy growth and GHG emission reduction. The prevailing technologies such as renewable energy are still expensive, dependent on sufficient local renewable resources and require high level of technical expertise. Therefore, the developing countries cannot adopt these technologies in large scale to reduce the GHG emission effectively. Alternative technologies need to be explored. In this paper, the potential of advanced coal and gas combustion technologies in reducing GHG emission in developing countries was studied. From the study, the advanced combustion technologies were found to be more cost effective than wind and photovoltaic technologies. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Universalization of access to modern energy services in Indian
   households-Economic and policy analysis
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB Provision of modern energy services for cooking (with gaseous fuels) and lighting (with electricity) is an essential component of any policy aiming to address health, education or welfare issues; yet it gets little attention from policy-makers. Secure, adequate, low-cost energy of quality and convenience is core to the delivery of these services. The present study analyses the energy consumption pattern of Indian domestic sector and examines the urban-rural divide and income energy linkage. A comprehensive analysis is done to estimate the cost for providing modern energy services to everyone by 2030. A public-private partnership-driven business model, with entrepreneurship at the core, is developed with institutional, financing and pricing mechanisms for diffusion of energy services. This approach, termed as EMPOWERS (entrepreneurship model for provision of wholesome energy-related basic services), if adopted, can facilitate large-scale dissemination of energy-efficient and renewable technologies like small-scale biogas/biofuel plants, and distributed power generation technologies to provide clean, safe, reliable and sustainable energy to rural households and urban poor. It is expected to integrate the processes of market transformation and entrepreneurship development involving government, NGOs, financial institutions and community groups as stakeholders.

AB Most studies on the global warming issue neglect the impact of proposed measures (eg carbon tax) on the economies of the developing countries in their anlayses. In this paper, an attempt has been made to bridge this gap. By using a standard econometric model, the major (possible) impacts of an OECD carbon tax on developing countries under different policy options were examined. Implementing a carbon tax policy could set serious restrictions to the developmental efforts of the developing countries. The role of non-commercial energy-use vis-a-vis global warming was also investigated. The need for a global perspective when designing effective environmental policies is inevitable.

   Ethiopia
SO ENERGY STRATEGY REVIEWS
AB Access to modern and sustainable energy services is a real challenge for countries where the majority of rural population is living in austere poverty. The importance of sustainable energy access is recognized in many developing countries, and there is growing international development assistance in the sector. However the achievements are still meager particularly in Sub Saharan African countries. Most countries often fail to prioritize sustainable energy services at the local level as a means to achieve economic growth at the national level as well as the Millennium Development Goals. This study is focused on Ethiopia and investigates the existing challenges and future prospects of mainstreaming sustainable energy access into the development planning process of the country, and the implications this may have for international donor agencies, national policy makers, private actors and local energy planners. The paper analyzes the institutional framework, sector policy and financial mechanisms in the country. It also discusses operational modalities of state and non-state actors in the process, and extracts policy recommendations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The energy crises revealed by COVID: Intersections of Indigeneity,
   inequity, and health
SO ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB The global COVID-19 pandemic is a health crisis, an economic crisis, and a justice crisis. It also brings to light multiple ongoing, underlying social crises. The COVID-19 crisis is actively revealing crises of energy sovereignty in at least four ways. First, there are many whose access to basic health services is compromised because of the lack of energy services necessary to provide these services. Second, some people are more vulnerable to COVID-19 because of exposure to environmental pollution associated with energy production. Third, energy services are vital to human wellbeing, yet access to energy services is largely organized as a consumer good. The loss of stable income precipitated by COVID-19 may therefore mean that many lose reliable access to essential energy services. Fourth, the COVID-19 crisis has created a window of opportunity for corporate interests to engage in aggressive pursuit of energy agendas that perpetuate carbon intensive and corporate controlled energy systems, which illuminates the ongoing procedural injustices of energy decision making. These four related crises demonstrate why energy sovereignty is essential for a just energy future. Energy sovereignty is defined as the right for communities, rather than corporate interests, to control access to and decision making regarding the sources, scales, and forms of ownership characterizing access to energy services. Energy sovereignty is a critical component in the design of a post-COVID-19 energy system that is capable of being resilient to future shocks without exacerbating injustices that are killing the most vulnerable among us.

TI Absolute wealth and world region strongly predict overweight among women
   (ages 18-49) in 360 populations across 36 developing countries
SO ECONOMICS & HUMAN BIOLOGY
AB This paper proposes a benchmark for comparing SES gradients across countries, based on gross domestic product apportioned to members of differing wealth categories within countries. Using this approach, we estimate absolute wealth in 360 populations in 36 developing countries and model its relationship with overweight (BMI >= 25) among nonpregnant women ages 18-49. A simple model based on absolute wealth alone strongly predicts odds of overweight (R-2 = 0.59), a relationship that holds both between countries and between different groups in the same country (10 populations for each of 36 countries). Moreover, world region modifies this relationship, accounting for an additional 22% of variance (R-2 = 0.81). This allows us to extract a basic pattern: rising rates of overweight in lower and middle income countries closely track increasing economic resources, and the shape of that gradient differs by region in systematic ways.

TI Community-Managed Water Services: The Case of Peru
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT & DEVELOPMENT
AB Due to lack of economic resources and the geographical dispersion of the population, state and private for-profit water provision is not feasible in many remote rural areas of developing countries. In such instances, community-managed water systems emerge as an alternative mechanism to provide safe water. Despite their importance, little is known about this type of organizations. This article examines the Juntas Administradoras de Servicios de Saneamiento (JASS), communal organizations that provide water services to more than 3 million people in rural and peri-urban areas of Peru. We focus on two important and related dimensions of the JASS. First, we empirically identify the factors associated to their existence (economic resources of the municipalities, tradition of communal work, and ethnic homogeneity). And second, we examine their organization and how they manage the water systems, which is importantly affected by the socioeconomic characteristics of the communities. Using the Peruvian JASS as a showcase, this article sheds then some light on the potential viability of this type of organizations. We conclude that the JASS might be an important and effective alternative to organize the provision of water services in rural and isolated areas. However, the consolidation of these institutions requires adequate supervision to ensure that water systems are correctly designed and managed and that internal governance problems do not compromise their sustainability.

SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Solid waste management (SWM) has become an issue of increasing global concern as urban populations continue to rise and consumption patterns change. The health and environmental implications associated with SWM are mounting in urgency, particularly in the context of developing countries. While systems analyses largely targeting well-defined, engineered systems have been used to help SWM agencies in industrialized countries since the 1960s, collection and removal dominate the SWM sector in developing countries. This review contrasts the history and current paradigms of SWM practices and policies in industrialized countries with the current challenges and complexities faced in developing country SWM. In industrialized countries, public health, environment, resource scarcity, climate change, and public awareness and participation have acted as SWM drivers towards the current paradigm of integrated SWM. However, urbanization, inequality, and economic growth; cultural and socio-economic aspects; policy, governance, and institutional issues; and international influences have complicated SWM in developing countries. This has limited the applicability of approaches that were successful along the SWM development trajectories of industrialized countries. This review demonstrates the importance of founding new SWM approaches for developing country contexts in post-normal science and complex, adaptive systems thinking. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Water resources management for agricultural growth in dry lands in
   developing countries
SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB Water resources are critical for human consumption, agriculture and industrial development. They have been and will remain very important commodities for human survival and economic development. Addressing water resources management requires action at the local, national and international levels. The need to provide all people with adequate supplies of clean water is becoming a more challenging task. The need for water increases with increase in population, food production and the level of economic activities. A lack of water inhibits socio-economic development and economic progress. As economic development and population growth are taking an increasing toll on water resources in each and every country, water resources management becomes even more critical. High prices of water remains of concern in most developing countries as the majority of households are poor. This study explores issues related to water resources management for both human consumption and economic growth in developing countries, using secondary information obtained through a document methods study. The examination of such information assists in looking at water resources management in developing countries, holistically.

TI PSYCHOSOCIAL RISKS AND WORK-RELATED STRESS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES:
   HEALTH IMPACT, PRIORITIES, BARRIERS AND SOLUTIONS
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
AB Objectives: The current research explores experts' perceptions of psychosocial risks and work-related stress in emerging economies and developing countries(1). This paper focuses on knowledge of potential health impact of psychosocial risks and preliminary priorities for action, and discusses potential barriers and solutions to addressing psychosocial risks and work-related stress in developing countries. Materials and Methods: This research applied a mixed methodology including semi-structured interviews, two rounds of an online Delphi survey, and four focus groups. Twenty nine experts with expertise in occupational health were interviewed. Seventy four experts responded to the first round of an online Delphi survey and 53 responded to the second round. Four groups of experts with a total of 37 active participants with specific or broader knowledge about developing country contexts participated in focus group discussions. Results: High concern was expressed for the need to address psychosocial risks and work-related stress and their health impact. Developing country experts' knowledge about these issues was comparable to knowledge from industrialized countries, however, application of expert knowledge was reported to be weak in developing countries. Socio-economic conditions were regarded as important considerations. Priorities to be addressed were identified, and barriers to implementing possible solutions were proposed. Conclusion: The future research and action paradigms in relation to psychosocial risk management will need to be broadened to include the larger social, political and economic contexts in developing countries beyond issues focusing solely on the working environment. Work-related psychosocial risks and the emerging priority of work-related stress should urgently be included in the research and political agendas and action frameworks of developing countries.

AB Good governance is essential for sustaining economic transformation in developing countries. However, many developing countries currently lack the capacity, as opposed to the will, to both achieve and sustain a climate of good governance. This article addresses, from a practitioner's field perspective, the fundamental objectives, principles, and key areas that need to be addressed for developing capacity for good governance. These frameworks are now beginning to be recognized as both governments and donor institutions attempt to take advantage of the current demand and opportunities for addressing governance deficits. In pursuing capacity development for good governance, developing countries must ensure that such initiatives are comprehensively designed to be simultaneously related to change and transformation at the individual, institutional, and societal levels and be owned and controlled locally.

TI Expanding renewable energy access with pro-poor public private
   partnerships in the developing world
SO ENERGY STRATEGY REVIEWS
AB The provision of energy services through renewable energy is capital intensive and requires significant upfront costs compared to conventional energy technology. In most of cases, government investments and public budgets have proved insufficient to expand access to electricity and modern energy in rural areas in a sustainable manner. There is a great need for mobilizing financial resources to expand local energy services delivery in the developing world. Pro-poor publiceprivate partnerships are one of the best mechanisms to supplement and overcome government budgetary constraints for widening access to energy services, especially to the poor, as they can allocate project-risks between the public and private sector. This article explores eight case studies throughout the world of where pro-poor public private partnerships for renewable energy have expanded access to energy services for those most in need of them.

AB Several models and frameworks abound to guide knowledge management (KM) implementation and strategy in organisations. These are mostly based on experiences and studies in Western industrialised countries that are already becoming knowledge economies. Application of these models and frameworks in developing countries might not yield expected results. For organisations in developing countries to participate in this new economy, there is need to understand the issues of KM in their local context. Towards this goal, we present the results of an empirical study of KM in six research organisations in sub-Saharan Africa. Requirements for a context specific framework for KM in organisations in developing countries are then presented.

TI Sustainable Agrifood Value Chain-Transformation in Developing Countries
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB To service high-value international markets, many agrifood value chains in developing countries are required to transform to meet the strict quality and safety standards. This transformation process has become further complicated by increased sustainability expectations. The key players in these countries, typically smallholders, are struggling to meet this new sustainability value focus. Economic drivers pervade in this context, whilst the lack of integration often decouples producers from the end market. To address these challenges, this paper develops a framework to enable sustainable agrifood value chain transformation in developing countries. A narrative review was used to analyse the major enablers and barriers in sustainable agrifood value chain transformation specifically in developing countries. The framework novelty lies in the synthesis and prioritisation of transformations actions, by integrating three central dimensions: sustainability, governance, and value addition. The incorporation of sustainability drivers into value chain governance provides a holistic approach that balances profit maximization with social and environmental impacts, thus enabling smallholders in developing countries to access higher value markets. The framework can assist these value chain actors in identifying their transformation trajectory and guide policymakers, along with the public sector, in prioritising their intervention to overcome barriers.

TI Linkages between climate change and sustainable development
SO CLIMATE POLICY
AB Climate change does not yet feature prominently within the environmental or economic policy agendas of developing countries. Yet evidence shows that some of the most adverse effects of climate change will be in developing countries, where populations are most vulnerable and least likely to easily adapt to climate change, and that climate change will affect the potential for development in these countries. Some synergies already exist between climate change policies and the sustainable development agenda in developing countries, such as energy efficiency, renewable energy, transport and sustainable land-use policies. Despite limited attention from policy-makers to date, climate change policies could have significant ancillary benefits for the local environment. The reverse is also true as local and national policies to address congestion, air quality, access to energy services and energy diversity may also limit GHG emissions. Nevertheless there could be significant trade-offs associated with deeper levels of mitigation in some countries, for example where developing countries are dependent on indigenous coal and may be required to switch to cleaner yet more expensive fuels to limit emissions. The distributional impacts of such policies are an important determinant of their feasibility and need to be considered up-front. It follows that future agreements on mitigation and adaptation under the convention will need to recognise the diverse situations of developing countries with respect to their level of economic development, their vulnerability to climate change and their ability to adapt or mitigate. Recognition of how climate change is likely to influence other development priorities may be a first Step toward building cost-effective strategies and integrated, institutional capacity in developing countries to respond to climate change. Opportunities may also exist in developing countries to use regional economic organisations to assist in the design of integrated responses and to exploit synergies between climate change and other policies such as those designed to combat desertification and preserve biodiversity.

TI Determining technology strategy in developing countries
SO OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB Technology has added a new dimension to strategic thinking in an international context. Developing countries are subject to the same global pressures as their developed counterparts, but have the additional burden of dealing with domestic conditions which place them at a significant, and perhaps, insurmountable disadvantage. This does not absolve managers from formulating technology policies that can best make their firms competitive. The research described in this paper studies issues in technology strategy confronting managers in developing countries, with specific reference to South Africa. The country has a developing economy, while exhibiting characteristics found in developed countries. South Africa's history presents its managers with challenges not encountered elsewhere, but the country provides a model for other developing countries. The paper examines the perceptions of a sample of South African managers regarding technology strategy in a manufacturing environment. The importance of different factors in formulating technology policy is studied in relation to the extent to which managers are able to control these variables. An importance-control grid framework is used to identify critical parameters and to assess how these can be managed in a complex environment. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Frameworks, methods and evidence connecting modern domestic energy
   services and gender empowerment
SO NATURE ENERGY
AB The world remains far from meeting Sustainable Development Goals 5 (gender equality) and 7 (universal access to modern energy). Energy access may empower women even as empowered women are more likely to adopt and use modern energy services. Such bidirectional linkages are underappreciated in the empirical literature, which typically estimates unidirectional relationships based on simple binary indicators. Here we review theoretical frameworks on women's empowerment, take stock of the empirical literature on the connections between women's empowerment and energy access, and place empirical results in the context of the theoretical literature. We highlight major knowledge gaps that require further attention from researchers and practitioners. In particular, we recommend the use of more comprehensive measures of energy services, the consideration of a richer set of gender empowerment indicators and the application of pluralistic methods to address the challenges of understanding how energy intersects with gender.
   There are strong bidirectional links between access to energy services and women's empowerment, but they are often overlooked in the literature. This Review examines these connections as they are discussed in theoretical and empirical work, identifying gaps in knowledge and approaches to the relationships between gender and energy.

TI Sign here, please! On developing countries' market access conditions in
   regional trade agreements
SO REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB Have regional trade agreements (RTAs) improved market access conditions for developing countries? Employing a measure expressing effective tariff margins and using disaggregated panel data for a sample of 45 developing country exporters, 60 export destinations, and the period between 1991 and 2015, it is shown that this question can generally be answered in the affirmative. Although the effect is estimated to be moderate, RTAs might thus be an important long-run building block in the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in order to increase developing countries' participation in world trade. On closer inspection, however, for the countries included in the sample, there is considerable variation depending on the choice of integration partners and economic sectors. More specifically, market access improvements cannot be found for African economies in South-South agreements and developing countries engaging formally with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) or the Republic of Korea, while leading industrialized nations are reluctant to grant improved market access to developing countries in RTAs especially in capital-intensive (high-productivity) manufacturing sectors.

TI Global scenarios of household access to modern energy services under
   climate mitigation policy
SO NATURE ENERGY
AB Energy system scenarios to meet climate mitigation goals rarely explore the evolution of energy access and equity. Now, Poblete-Cazenave et al. show that, under many baseline and decarbonization scenarios, energy access for people in Africa and South Asia remains insufficient.
   Emission reduction scenarios to meet climate change mitigation policy goals rarely explore the differential impact of alternative pathways on access to energy for different economic strata of society across countries. Here we show that even under optimistic socioeconomic growth scenarios, inequalities in use of modern energy in homes could persist. We find that, although access improves in high growth scenarios, over 10% of populations in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia could lack access to energy services for thermal comfort, food preparation and conservation, and cleaning in 2050. Ambitious climate mitigation scenarios do not substantially alter household access to energy services in the Global South, and only affect gas consumption in high-income regions. Our work suggests that efforts to meet climate mitigation policy goals are not at odds with progress towards universal access to modern energy services in the Global South, however, directed policy will be needed to meet access goals.

TI A Phage Therapy Guide for Clinicians and Basic Scientists: Background
   and Highlighting Applications for Developing Countries
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB Approximately 10% of global health research is devoted to 90% of global disease burden (the so-called "10/90 Gap") and it often neglects those diseases most prevalent in low-income countries. Antibiotic resistant bacterial infections are known to impact on healthcare, food security, and socio-economic fabric in the developing countries. With a global antibiotic resistance crisis currently reaching a critical level, the unmet needs in the developing countries are even more striking. The failure of traditional antimicrobials has led to renewed interest in century-old bacteriophage (phage) therapy in response to the urgent need to develop alternative therapies to treat infections. Phage therapy may have particular value in developing countries where relevant phages can be sourced and processed locally and efficiently, breaking specifically the economic barrier of access to expensive medicine. Hence this makes phage therapy an attractive and feasible option. In this review, we draw our respective clinical experience as well as phage therapy research and clinical trial, and discuss the ways in which phage therapy might reduce the burden of some of the most important bacterial infections in developing countries.

TI Social consequences of economic globalization: experience of developed
   and developing countries and perspectives of optimization
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL POLICY
AB Purpose The purpose of the research is to determine the social consequences of economic globalization based on experience of developed and developing countries and to determine the perspectives of optimization of this process through regulation. Design/methodology/approach The research method is correlation analysis, for it allows determining dependencies between the indicators without requirements to their close mutual dependence. The research objects are top ten developed and top ten developing countries as to the KOF globalization index in 2019. Findings It is determined that, contrary to high economic risks, social risks of globalization are very low. Instead of this, in the course of globalization the social advantages increase - they are expressed in the form of harmonization of the labor market, development of digital society and increase of population's quality of life - in particular, provision of balance of the global society by leveling the social disproportions between developed and developing countries. It is substantiated that consequences that stimulate the increase of population's quality of life in developing countries are more expressed than in developed countries. This means that developing countries, which are traditionally more inclined to limiting the influence of globalization on them due to economic reasons, have to reconsider their foreign economic policy and include the measures on stimulation of globalization in the interests of social development. Other than that, the differences in consequences for developed and developing countries are minimal. There is no imbalance of consequences that is peculiar for the economic sphere, in which the main advantages are obtained by developed countries, and developing countries bear most of the costs. From the social point of view, globalization could be characterized as a positive phenomenon of modern times. Originality/value The offered authors' recommendations will allow optimizing the influence of globalization on the social environment in developed and developing countries and ensuring usage of economic globalization as a mechanism of implementation of the global goals in the sphere of sustainable development.

TI Adverse implications of the Montreal Protocol grace period for
   developing countries
SO INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS
AB The multilateral consensus that led to the signing and ratification of the Montreal Protocol in 1987 and its London (1990) and Copenhagen Amendments (1992), resulted in the near-complete phase-out of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) use in industrialized countries by the end of 1995. To meet their economic development needs, the treaty permits developing countries to continue producing and consuming CECs for an additional fifteen years, until 2010. This delay in eliminating ozone-depleting substances slows the recovery of the atone layer, and has generated a global black market in CFCs. The estimated cost of replacing CFCs with hydrofluorocarbon (HPC) and hydrochlorofluorocarbon. (HCFC) technological options is substantially greater than available financial resources, and this cost rises as CFC replacement is postponed. Furthermore, manufacturing and maintenance problems with the pre dominant HPC refrigeration alternative make it less suitable for developing-country markets. We propose that the grace period offered to the developing countries be used to encourage a rapid shift to not-in-kind (NIK) technologies as soon as possible. Available NIK technologies are environmentally and economically sounder alternatives than HFC/HCFC substitutes for both developed and developing countries, but the failure of industrial countries to agree on a common option is slowing the transition by developing countries to a CFC-free economy.

TI The determinants of the inequality in CO2 emissions per capita between
   developing countries and their implications for environmental policy
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB We analyze the differences in CO2 emissions from fuel combustion per capita between developing countries and how these are influenced by a series of affluence, structural, demographic, and climatic variables. First, a regression analysis provides new evidence on the determinants of CO2 emissions in developing countries. We find an N-shaped relationship with GDP per capita and a negative impact of the agriculture share and average daily minimum temperatures, while urbanization and the share of potentially active population would be positively correlated with emissions per capita. Second, by using the regression-based inequality decomposition method, we indicate the weight of each significant determinant in explaining the inequality in CO2 emissions per capita between developing countries. The main contributors are economic affluence and the potentially active population, in this order. We study the relevance of each factor in the changes experienced by inequality over time. Some of our results contrast with previous evidence for more heterogeneous samples. We derive some relevant implications for environmental and energy policy in developing countries.

TI ENERGY POLICIES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB Energy use and environmental degradation associated with its use in developing countries are expected to increase well into the 21st century, with adverse ramifications on sustainable development prospects worldwide. This paper examines various energy policies to promote sustainable development in developing countries, noting that many such policies imply lower overall growth rates. Short-term policies such as measures encouraging efficient use of energy are generally energy specific, while long-term measures encompass broader development policies having an impact on energy resource development and use patterns. Economic and institutional barriers and constraints which may impede the effectiveness of these policies exist in many developing countries. These barriers and constraints often constrain general development prospects as well.

SO ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB Human engagement with modern energy services is foundational to social and economic welfare, as is their disengagement with welfare inhibiting traditional energy services. With modern energy access often leading to the stacked use of modern and traditional energy services, there is a need to understand the drivers and determinants of the energy decision-making of the energy poor. This study draws on 83 semi-structured in-depth interviews with 67 energy poor households in rural Lagos to explore what their lived realities reveal about the nature of their energy decision-making. We observe three important drivers behind household decision to consistently engage with a fuel-technology combination in practice: their organisation of daily life and by extension their vocational activity, the urgency of operating the service, and experience with and exposure to an energy service. Findings suggest that if traditional energy services are to be displaced, then in addition to using modern energy services to develop people's lives, we need to develop people's lives to use modern energy services.

TI The impact of microfinance on poverty and income inequality in
   developing countries
SO ASIAN-PACIFIC ECONOMIC LITERATURE
AB Economic growth in developing countries provides an opportunity to accelerate progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, in reality, the number of people living in extreme poverty remains unacceptably high. Utilising the experiences of 34 developing countries for the period 2009 to 2016, the role of microfinance on poverty in these countries is examined. The results imply that the degree to which the existing forms of microfinance effectively reduce extreme poverty is less workable in developing countries, particularly when the hardcore poor are likely being deprived of receiving access to microfinance. It is suggested that governments may need to revise the structure and strategy of microfinance to be more hardcore poor oriented. The hardcore poor have needs beyond pure monetary assistance. More hand-holding types of assistance are needed as most are also poor in respect of literacy, assets, and skills.

TI FACTORS OF INTERNATIONALIZATION OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES' CURRENCIES IN
   THE POST-COVID-19 ECONOMY
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
AB Over the past three decades, economic transformations and dynamic growth in a number of developing countries have led to a significant increase of their role in the global economy. However, despite the shift in the centre of global economic activity from West to East, the US dollar continues to dominate the international monetary system. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted sustainable trade and financial flows, limiting the access of governments and companies in developing countries to international liquidity. The global recession has increased the importance of regional and local factors in the recovery of global economic growth. The current trends in the regionalization of international economic relations, along with the need to finance external debt, create objective prerequisites for a more active use of the currencies of developing countries in the international monetary system. To identify this potential, the authors conducted a comparative analysis of the current positions of developed and developing countries in the world economy and world finance. Internationalization of developing countries> currencies in the international monetary system depends on creation of a number of favourable macroeconomic, institutional and structural conditions. Macroeconomic conditions are: control over the dynamics of nominal per capita income to ensure competitive advantages for exporters; an increase in the share of sovereign debt obligations as a potential reserve asset in the total volume of external debt; improving the performance of the international investment position by increasing the share of high-yield assets of developing countries. Institutional conditions include the internationalization of high-tech companies and the creation of nationally oriented mechanisms and standards for regulating financial markets. The development of existing and creation of new payment and settlement systems based on digital currencies and distributed ledger technology are the main structural conditions for increasing the international competitiveness of the developing countries' currencies. The authors conclude that only a comprehensive implementation of these conditions will provide a more decentralized nature of the international monetary system in the long term.

TI Analyzing the Effect of Corporate Environmental Performance on Corporate
   Financial Performance in Developed and Developing Countries
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The relationship between corporate environmental performance and corporate financial performance has been extensively studied in developed countries, and has received less attention in developing countries. For this reason, the main objective of this paper is to examine the effect of corporate environmental performance on corporate financial performance during a global financial crisis, depending on the economic development level of the country where a firm is located. To this end, we obtain data for a sample of 2982 large firms from 2008 to 2015. We apply Petersen's approach to these data, adjusting the standard errors for clustering by both firm and year. The results obtained show that the adoption of environmental practices significantly and positively affects the corporate financial performance in developed and developing countries. However, this effect is stronger for firms located in developing countries than those located in developed countries.

TI Risk Severity Matrix for Sustainable Public-Private Partnership Projects
   in Developing Countries
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The concept of a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) is not new for developing countries, although many initiatives are being contemplated for potential implementation. This paper evaluates the crucial success factor for the effective execution of PPP projects and it also investigates the appropriate distribution of the risks involved in PPP projects. Quartile analysis of features has been made after a detailed literature review for risk identification. The risk severity analysis is done using a quartile assessment. The data is collected from various contractors working on PPP projects in Pakistan. The comparative analysis has been conducted using available research work on PPP in developing countries. A risk severity rank model is created using 47 key risks in PPP projects for developing countries. Finally, the top risks identified by this research are compared with the previous studies conducted in China, India and Egypt. It is concluded that inflation, revenue risk from end-user, foreign exchange fluctuation, political situation, law and order, and corruption are the major risks in developing countries for better management of PPP projects. Most of the PPP projects are public-oriented. The society of any city is directly affected by most PPP projects. This paper presents the identified key risks of PPP projects in developing countries which are mostly financial and public-oriented. This work will support the PPP concept significance, meeting United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8 and 11. Recent countries' political and economic circumstances and sustainability have transformed PPP ventures into a successful way to support the governments to develop roads, energy and facilities through private partners' financial and technological capacities. Although PPP is used worldwide, its effective utilization in developing countries is still lacking. This paper is an enhancement to its successful use of the PPP domain for developing countries.

AB Access to electricity is one of the most essential requirements for development. Furthermore, the U.S. Energy Information Administration has predicted that growth in electricity use is projected to largely come from developing countries as defined by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). However, the transition to clean energy is occurring too slowly in rural parts of developing countries. Renewable energy provides the opportunity for sustainable energy to be provided to those living in rural areas of developing countries, who have not had access to clean energy. Renewable energy technology is necessary because traditional measures of energy access are not able to address the deficiencies in the affordability, reliability, and other barriers associated with renewable energy distribution.
   While there have been several successful rural electrification technologies in the past few years, sustainable technologies still have the potential to be unsuccessful if they fail to overcome the many barriers that stand in the way of energy progression in developing countries. Moreover, a product's technical performance is not a sound indicator of how well that product will be adopted by users. This paper argues that technical and social barriers to renewable energy dissemination have not been surmounted due to a lack of innovation in terms of engineering solutions. Innovative "grid-free" engineering products can enable developing countries to avoid a possible industrial revolution while still growing their economy, since they are not hindered by an electricity grid. This paper identifies technical barriers to renewable energy development from the literature, and suggests possible innovations that can aid rural areas of developing countries in achieving electrification. The technology explored in this paper include super capacitors, a ground-air thermoelectric generator, and photovoltaic solar cells, which all have the potential to provide energy access to those living in less urbanized areas of developing countries.

TI Climate change and extreme weather events: can developing countries
   adapt?
SO CLIMATE POLICY
AB Developing countries are vulnerable to extremes of normal climatic variability, and climate change is likely to increase the frequency and magnitude of some extreme weather events and disasters. Adaptation to climate change is dependent on current adaptive capacity and the development models that are being pursued by developing countries. Various frameworks are available for vulnerability and adaptation (V&A) assessments, and they have both advantages and limitations. Investments in developing countries are more focused on recovery from a disaster than on the creation of adaptive capacity. Extreme climatic events create a spiral of debt burden on developing countries. Increased capacity to manage extreme weather events can reduce the magnitude of economic, social and human damage and eventually, investments, in terms of borrowing money from the lending agencies. Vulnerability to extreme weather events, disaster management and adaptation must be part of long-term sustainable development planning in developing countries. Lending agencies and donors need to reform their investment policies in developing countries to focus more on capacity building instead of just investing in recovery operations and infrastructure development.

Appropriate technologies for developing countries were screened based on their function and their use of operational sustainability features; this list of technologies can then be used to elaborate design options. Sustainability indicators are used to enable a parallel comparison of the options from environmental, economic, and socio-cultural perspectives. For illustration, the indicator approach is applied to a case study of the sanitation options for peri-urban/rural areas of the eThekwini Municipality in South Africa.

AB Health research is essential for improving global health, health equity, and economic development. There are vast differences in the disease burden, research budget allocation, and scientific publications between the developed and the low-middle-income countries, which are the homes of 85% of the world's population. There are multiple challenges, as well as opportunities for health research in developing countries. One of the primary reasons for reduced research output from the developing countries is the lack of research capacity. Many developing countries are striving to build their research capacity. They are trying to understand their needs and goals to solve their fundamental health problems, but the opportunity for research education and training remains low. The first joint research meeting of the Bangladesh Gastroenterology Society and the British Society of Gastroenterology took place in February 2020 at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University in Dhaka, Bangladesh, aimed at providing an overview of medical research for young, aspiring medical researchers. This review article provides an outline of the research day and covers a number of useful topics. This review aims to provide a basic guide for early career researchers, both within the field of gastroenterology and, more generally, to all spheres of medical research.

AB Building Information Modelling (BIM) is widely seen as a catalyst for innovation and productivity in the construction industry. BIM can assist a more sustainable construction process that in turn may contribute to eradicating poverty in developing countries (United Nation Millennium Goals). While BIM is increasingly being adopted in developed countries, implementations in the developing country context are rare. Research has established how construction firms struggle from several limitations having to do with the socio-economic and technological environment found in developing countries. Examples of issues preventing BIM adoption include a shortage of IT-literate personnel as well as an absence of national BIM implementation programs. Based on a review of recent research, this article addresses some of the hurdles and solutions for BIM implementations particular to low-and middle-income economies. Findings include that developing countries' construction firms rely on outsourcing of IT services or developing tweaks or workarounds, like using 'fake' IT licenses, for saving cost and enabling BIM. The article highlights shortcomings of existing research on BIM implementation in developing countries, and may serve as a starting point for researchers interested in how BIM technology can be adopted in a developing country context.

This leads to significant wastage of economic resources that could otherwise be deployed to productive ends. While information and communication technologies (ICTs) have been viewed as a potent tool to transform education and make it efficient and sustainable, in this paper, we examine whether ICT can help reduce dropouts in primary education. Using structuration theory and capability approach, we propose a conceptual framework illustrating that process by which ICT can improve retention and quality of learning through teacher empowerment and capability improvement. Our study deviates from the prior literature by (1) focusing on the role of teachers in the education process, and (2) elaborating the process of empowerment and capability development by which ICT may influence education outcomes.

TI Climate policy and the concept of co-benefits in India
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
AB Until the late 1990s, developing countries had perceived the pursuit of development as coming into conflict with the mitigation of climate change. Research showed that mitigation and development can go hand in hand, giving rise to the co-benefits approach. In this paper, the relationship between aiming for development and aiming for climate change mitigation is analyzed from the perspective of the developing country India. While industrialized countries prefer the approach of co-benefits of mitigation, developing countries tend to follow the development-first paradigm with mitigation co-benefits, as a literature and document study show. India had a long way to come from the notion that mitigation was threatening economic growth to adopting the co-benefits approach. The paradigms of "differentiated responsibilities" and of having a right to emit as much as the industrialized countries are deeply rooted. This is also shown by India's reaction to the current economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The current research also explored the challenges faced by developing countries regarding GI legislation and suggested relevant policies to address the identified problems for the sustainable development of the handicraft communities. This study is exploratory and based on a thorough review of relevant theoretical and empirical literature, including policy documents. Secondary data regarding Handicraft GIs worldwide were utilized to provide empirical evidence of GI legislation's importance for developing countries. This study argues that protected GIs potential benefits include not only social and economic but also cultural and environmental, which previous studies have not explored deeply. Arguably, in the case of handicrafts, besides economic benefits (such as value addition, price premium, quality assurance, increase in sales, and profit), GIs also help in the development of local communities through generating employment opportunities, improving living condition, poverty alleviation, and social cohesion (social benefits). GIs also play a crucial role in promoting, elevating, reinforcing, and preserving cultural traditions (cultural benefit). Finally, GIs also help in biodiversity and sustainable use of raw materials (environmental benefit).
   This study also underlined key challenges regarding GI legislation in developing countries.

TI Health sector reform in South Asia: new challenges and constraints
SO HEALTH POLICY
AB In early 1990s. Jamison, Mosley and others concluded that a profound demographic and consequent epidemiological transition is taking place in developing countries. According to this classical model, by the year 2015. infectious diseases will account for only about 20% of deaths in developing countries as chronic diseases become more pronounced. These impending demographic and epidemiological transitions were to dominate the health sector reform agenda in developing countries. Following an analysis of fertility, mortality and other demographic and epidemiological data from South Asian and other developing countries, the paper argues that the classical model is in need of re-evaluation. A number of new 'challenges' have complicated the classical interplay of demographic and epidemiological factors. These new challenges include continuing population growth in Some Countries, rapid unplanned urbanization, the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Sub-Saharan Africa (and its impending threat in South Asia), and globalization and increasing marginalisation of developing countries. While the traditional lack of investment in human development makes the developing countries more vulnerable to the vicissitudes of globalization. increasing economic weakness of their governments forces them to retreat further from the social sector. Pockets of poverty and deprivation, therefore. persist giving rise to three simultaneous burdens for South Asia and much of the rest of the developing world: continuing communicable diseases, increasing burden of chronic diseases, and increasing demand for both primary and tertiary levels of health care services. While these complex factors, on the one hand, underscore the need for health sector reform, on the other, they make the task much more difficult and challenging. The paper emphasizes the need to revisit the classical model of demographic and epidemiological transition. It is argued that the health sector in developing countries must be aware of and effectively address these 'new challenges'. Although it has included data from many developing countries. the focus is primarily on South Asia. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Dynamic linkages between globalization, human capital, and carbon
   dioxide emissions: empirical evidence from developing economies
SO ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB This study examines the impact of human capital and globalization on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for a sample of 78 developing countries, from Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean, over the period from 1990 to 2016. As opposed to the existing studies in the literature, this study considers three types of globalization namely economic, social, and political globalization. The econometric analysis involves the use of the two-stage least squares-generalized method of moment method to account for endogeneity issues. The findings, overall, indicate that human capital development decreases CO2 emissions in developing countries across all regions. In contrast, social globalization increases CO2 emissions in all developing countries. Moreover, the empirical results also reveal that political globalization boosts CO2 emissions in the Latin American and Caribbean region, but helps to curb CO2 emissions in Asia, Africa, and in overall panel. Additionally, economic globalization significantly reduces CO2 emissions in the Latin American and Caribbean region but increases CO2 emissions in Asia, Africa, and in overall panel countries. Furthermore, human capital and globalization (in all three forms) jointly boost CO2 emissions. Hence, in line with this major finding, we recommend that the globalization policies should also incorporate the human capital development agenda of the developing countries in order to comprehensively tackle the aggravation of CO2 emissions.

TI Impact of Digitalization on Economic Sustainability in Developed and
   Developing Countries
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN DIGITAL ECONOMY: Perspectives from
   Russian Experiences
SE Research for Development
AB Purpose The purpose of the work is to determine the impact of digitalization on the sustainability of the economy and to justify its specificity in developed and developing countries. Design/methodology/approach The authors use the regression analysis method. Using this method, a multiple regression dependence of each stability indicator is established on a set of aspects of digitalization. Based on regression dependencies, simplex optimization is carried out. The top 10 developed and top 10 developing countries were selected as the objects for the study in the global IMD ranking by the value of the digital competitiveness index for 2019. Findings In developing countries, digitalization in general has a much more pronounced and extremely positive impact on sustainable development in all its manifestations. Digitalization of society and knowledge is key to sustainable development. Digital infrastructure is in second place, and digitalization of business and the state is the least important. In developed countries, digitalization had a controversial impact on sustainable development, contributing to faster economic growth, increased per capita GDP and sustainable development goals, but hampering global economic competitiveness. Digital infrastructure, digital society and knowledge are key to sustainable development, and the digitalization of business and the state needs to be limited. Originality/value Significant differences in the impact of digitalization on the sustainability of economic development in developed and developing countries are justified, proving the need to develop and implement separate management approaches in these categories of countries.

AB Through his research experience in developing countries, Eric Arnould asserts that questions about sustainable development are historically linked to problems of access by populations in the global South to development programs financially, socially and environmentally fit to ensure their well-being. Therefore, thinking through marketing's potential contribution and taking action in the context of sustainable development in the global South requires posing questions at two levels: at a macro level, to understand the links between local and international markets and the local effects of these linkages; and at cultural level, to understand economic stakeholders' behaviors within their specific cultural and institutional contexts.

TI Decoupling analysis of world economic growth and CO2 emissions: A study
   comparing developed and developing countries
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB This study discusses decoupling trends in world economic growth and CO2 emissions based on decoupling theories. The decoupling trends of economic growth and CO2 emissions in typical developed and developing countries in 1965-2015 are compared by using an OECD decoupling factor model, and Tapio elastic analysis (TEA) method, and the IGTX decoupling model. On this basis, this study evaluates correlations of these three decoupling models by employing the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. The research indicates that, owing to the IGTX decoupling model being easily affected by other non environmental factors, the shorter the research period of interest, the more easily the decoupling indices distort, while the accuracy of the TEA method is not limited by the length of the research period of interest. With respect to the overall decoupling trend, the research shows that: (1) strong decoupling is found in developed countries and slightly increases in the stabilisation thereof. The decoupling state in the United Kingdom and Germany is more stable than that of the United States and France. (2) Developing countries demonstrate weak decoupling that fluctuates significantly and lacks regularity. The stabilisation and optimisation of China in decoupling process are better than those of Brazil and India. Finally, according to research conclusions, relevant policies and suggestions are proposed in view of energy savings and emissions reduction in developing countries. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Remittances and energy poverty: Fresh evidence from developing countries
SO UTILITIES POLICY
AB A growing body of literature highlights the importance of access to energy for economic growth and its crucial role in achieving other sustainable development goals. Given that this branch of the literature is relatively new, the determinants of energy poverty have not yet been fully explored. This study takes a fresh look and contributes to the growing literature by providing one of the first studies of the effect of remittances on energy poverty in developing countries. We employed the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Square and the Dynamic Ordinary Least Square. The results survive a battery of robustness checks, providing robust evidence supporting the claim that remittances reduce energy poverty in developing countries. Further analyses from the three-stage least squares estimator enable us to identify income inequality, economic growth, and education as some transmission channels through which remittances may reduce energy poverty. This study provides important implications in terms of policy recommendations.

TI Digital Transformation as a Demographic and Economic Integrated Policy
   for Southeast Asian Developing Countries
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The age of Southeast Asian developing countries' populations is still younger than that of other regions around the world. However, recent statistics show that the tide is now turning in this regard, with many of these populations beginning to age at rates much faster than many other countries. Such developments require immediate policy action in order to create a sustainable path towards economic growth before demographic changes become less benign in the medium term. In this study, we discuss the economic consequences of population aging, increases in the economic support ratio, and a declining potential growth rate. We argue that it is essential for Southeast Asian developing countries to raise total factor productivity (TFP) growth rates so as to achieve more sustainable economic outcomes. By conducting panel regressions using data from 82 countries across the 1996-2019 study period, our study shows that increasing research and development (R&D) spending and the facilitation of structural changes that transform the digital economy landscape are key policy options that promote TFP growth.

SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB This review provides the history and current paradigms of waste management (WM) practices in developing nations during the last five decades. It explores the evolution of the challenges, complexities, and trends during this period. This paper, for the first time, presents an estimation of the amount of municipal solid waste (MSW) generated in developing nations in the last five decades based on the material flow analysis approach. Overall, the amount of MSW in developing countries has increased from about 0.64 billion Mt in 1970 to 2 billion Mt in 2019. This review demonstrates the importance of finding new WM approaches in developing nations in the context of formulating policies, strategies, and highlights the major trends that re-define WM in developing countries. It also aims to present the holistic changes in technology, economic and environmental feasibility aspects to attain an integrated sustainable WM system in developing countries. Specific focus on open-burning, open-dumping, informal recycling, food waste, plastic pollution, and waste collection with reference to Sustainable Development Goals are explained. Drivers for the way forward including circular economy are investigated.

SO E-WASTE RECYCLING AND MANAGEMENT: PRESENT SCENARIOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL
   ISSUES
SE Environmental Chemistry for a Sustainable World
AB Recycling and sustainable development issues are increasing in importance around the world. This aspect is more prominent in developing countries, in which there are many informal recycling activities and few environmental legislations regulating waste management. This chapter discusses the recycling challenges regarding the adoption of e-waste reverse logistics under the perspective of developing countries. For this purpose, we gathered information from papers published in international databases and reports such as the United Nations Environment Programme and Global e-waste Monitor, thus identifying data available to American countries (Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Mexico), South Africa and Asian countries (China, India, Russia, Indonesia, Turkey, Pakistan, South Korea, Thailand and Singapore). As key findings we can point out the categorization of the barriers into financial/economics, environmental, market related, legal, policy related, management, knowledge related and technical and technological related. As main contributions of this chapter, we can highlight (i) the compilation of information related to recycling challenges of e-waste in developing countries, and (ii) the identification of some solutions and actions to overcome these barriers is also performed, which can be useful for practitioners and researchers in this field.

TI Determinants of responsible innovation for sustainability transition in
   a developing country: Contested narratives for transition in the Sri
   Lankan power sector
SO NORSK GEOGRAFISK TIDSSKRIFT-NORWEGIAN JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY
AB Global efforts towards sustainable energy transition remain uneven. Developing countries are embedded in a vulnerable setting requiring rapid but responsible action to meet increasing energy demands due to their specific projected economic and population growth. Consequently, such countries have addressed the challenges of achieving sustainable energy transition differently compared with developed countries with regard to renewable energy development and its governance. Theories of sustainability transition and responsible innovation (RI) have their origin in developed countries, and the application of this Western-centric version has been found incompatible with the contexts of developing countries. The aim of the paper is to explore how contextual understandings of RI are discursively constructed and how such understandings enable or constrain sustainable energy pathways in developing countries. The author draws on empirical evidence relating to the power sector in Sri Lanka and analyses three narratives in play revealed by a qualitative case study. The findings indicate that developing countries must place greater emphasis on aligning technological innovation systems with RI in efforts to achieve sustainability transitions by being vigilant with regard to contextual narratives on RI. The author concludes that prevalent narratives should be regarded as a bridge for linking sustainability transitions to RI.

TI Does national culture matter for environmental innovation? A study of
   emerging economies
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB Environmental innovation is regarded as an essential tool to achieve the Paris Climate Conference agreement and Net Zero by 2050. Despite the extensive studies on the determinants of environmental innovation in developed countries, little attention has been paid to developing countries despite their dominance of emissions and different institutional characteristics. This paper fills the gap in the literature by investigating the determinants of environmental innovation in developing countries. In addition, the paper examines the role of national culture, an informal institutional factor, as a potential determinant of environmental innovation. Using 10,764 firm-year observations for a sample of 15 developing countries from 2015 to 2019, we find that environmental innovation is mainly driven by the demand-pull factor, rather than the technology-push factor, in developing countries. In addition, certain national cultural dimensions such as masculinity and long-term orientation enhance environmental innovation, while other dimensions such as power distance, individualism, uncertainty avoidance, and indulgence reduce it. The paper makes a theoretical contribution by extending the Porter Hypothesis towards institutional theory to include informal institutional factors (i.e. national culture) as a determinant of environmental innovation. The finding also suggests a rethink of policy in developing countries to focus more on demand-pull factors to promote environmental innovation.

TI Reproductive rights approach to reproductive health in developing
   countries
SO GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION
AB Background: Research on reproductive health in developing countries focuses mostly on the role of economic development on various components of reproductive health. Cross-sectional and empirical research studies in particular on the effects of non-economic factors such as reproductive rights remain few and far between.
   Objective: This study investigates the influence of two components of an empowerment strategy, gender equality, and reproductive rights on women's reproductive health in developing countries. The empowerment strategy for improving reproductive health is theoretically situated on a number of background factors such as economic and social development.
   Design: Cross-national socioeconomic and demographic data from a number of international organizations on 142 developing countries are used to test a model of reproductive rights and reproductive health.
   Results: The findings suggest that both economic and democratic development have significant positive effects on levels of gender equality. The level of social development plays a prominent role in promoting reproductive rights. It is found that reproductive rights channel the influences of social structural factors and gender equality on reproductive health.

TI Breast health in developing countries
SO CLIMACTERIC
AB Breast cancer is one of the leading cancers world-wide. While the incidence in developing countries is lower than in developed countries, the mortality is much higher. Of the estimated 1 600 000 new cases of breast cancer globally in 2012, 794 000 were in the more developed world compared to 883 000 in the less developed world; however, there were 198 000 deaths in the more developed world compared to 324 000 in the less developed world (data from Globocan 2012, IARC). Survival from breast cancer depends on two main factors - early detection and optimal treatment. In developing countries, women present with late stages of disease. The barriers to early detection are physical, such as geographical isolation, financial as well as psychosocial, including lack of education, belief in traditional medicine and lack of autonomous decision-making in the male-dominated societies that prevail in the developing world. There are virtually no population-based breast cancer screening programs in developing countries. However, before any screening program can be implemented, there must be facilities to treat the cancers that are detected. Inadequate access to optimal treatment of breast cancer remains a problem. Lack of specialist manpower, facilities and anticancer drugs contribute to the suboptimal care that a woman with breast cancer in a low-income country receives. International groups such as the Breast Health Global Initiative were set up to develop economically feasible, clinical practice guidelines for breast cancer management to improve breast health outcomes in countries with limited resources.

AB Basic requirements of sustainable smart cities in a developing country are the entitlement of facilities. Here, an index named Smart Sustainable City Development Index (SSCDI) has been developed for three Indian Smart Cities. A hierarchical method has been used to construct the index with multiple layers of indicators capturing characteristics of the dimensions such as social, economic, environment, culture and lifestyle. This index is used to assess performances of the three case study cities based on the scores in various indicators. This SSCDI framework provides a conceptual landscape for developing countries for planning their sustainable urban development and evaluation of performances.

TI The Sustainability of the WTO Dispute Settlement System: Does It Work
   for Developing Countries?
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE
AB Our study provides an econometric analysis of whether developing countries are disadvantaged by the World Trade Organization's (WTO's) dispute settlement procedure. Despite the many successes of the Dispute Settlement Board (DSB), there is a need to better understand the overall effectiveness of the dispute mechanism. Using bilateral data of WTO members from 1995 to 2017, this article describes the influencing factors for developing countries' participation in the dispute settlement process. By conducting a rare events logistic regression analysis, the results from this study show that the key factors that determine the ability for a developing country to initiate a dispute against another country include the export intensity, retaliation capability, economic power, and economic threat from potential defendant countries. This means that not all developing countries can participate in trade dispute settlement mechanisms, so the WTO dispute settlement system has relative legitimacy. In addition, we further compare and analyse the influence of these four dimensions over different time periods and in different target countries through seemingly unrelated estimations.

TI Genetically modified crops in developing countries: Savior or traitor?
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Genetic modification has been used as a method to produce higher yields for consumption. However, the impact of genetic modification technology on agriculture in developing countries at the farm level often remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the environmental, social and economic consequences of genetically modified (GM) crops at the farm level in developing countries. Using a meta-analysis on 40 empirical studies conveyed in developing countries, this article reports farmers' reflections on the influences of GM crops in the framework of sustainability, including environmental, economic, and social impacts. Results indicate that genetic modification technology has been able to enhance the socio-economic and environmental efficiency of farmers in developing countries. This study showed genetic modification as a lifesaving technology in the short term, while in the long term, the sustainability of genetic modification production is reduced, according to farmers. Furthermore, this meta-analysis study showed that legal and administrative challenges and less access to relevant information are the main dilemmas of farmers dealing with GM crops in developing countries. Accordingly, the study concluded that conducting meta-analysis can provide useful information for policy makers who plan for the development of GM production.

The qualitative multiple case study conducted allows the study of BMI within real life and contemporary context. Findings show that small organisations are influenced by internal and external factors towards BMI. Case organisations showed resilience to the crisis by adjusting accordingly to allow uninterrupted operation during lockdown; developing new products, services and processes that would ensure sustained demand during COVID-19 pandemic. The study explores theoretical implications of the findings. Also, lessons from this research could be useful for practitioners from developed and developing countries. Policymakers could benefit from focusing their activities on supporting firms to find novel ways of operating during the pandemic preventing further economic damage and unemployment.

TI Widening energy access in Africa: Towards energy transition
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB The discussion to widen access to modern energy services has been influential in shaping some of the discussions on energy at the international level. The practice of widening modern energy services access to the poor in Africa is complex, and exacerbated by the dual nature of the energy system across Sub-Saharan Africa where traditional and modern energy systems and practices co-exist. This presents major challenges for policy makers who have to contend with a fragmented energy system, which requires the mobilisation of an array of actors at cross-sectoral levels in order to develop effective institutions and implement innovative policy frameworks. This paper further argues that, the 'energy access' discussion needs to take place in the context of energy transitions, giving due consideration to the productive sector as an important vehicle for change. As the link between energy and development is context specific, each African country needs to chart its own energy transition pathway into the future, and there are ample lessons that they can draw from previous energy transitions.

TI Global value chains, technological progress, and environmental
   pollution: Inequality towards developing countries
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The production and trade activities of global value chains (GVC) increasingly contribute to the gross domestic product (GDP) of developing countries. However, while the development of domestic economies brings about technological progress, it also may have negative consequences such as environmental pollution. Technological progress can be conducive to reducing pollution emissions. Our motive is to realize the dual effects of technological progress and energy saving and emission reduction in developing countries' participation in the global value chain through research on GVC, technological progress and environmental pollution. Improving environmental quality through technological advances and reducing the adverse effects of inequality in trade status, enabling developing countries to obtain dividends from participating in the value chain as much as possible, and mitigating the adverse effects of environmental pollution during development. And lay the policy foundation for developing countries to go green. However, most of the current researches focus on the relationship between GVC and technological progress or GVC and environmental pollution, and the research on the relationship between the three is scarce. We use the WIOD database to try to find the relationship between developing country global value chain participation, technological progress and environmental pollution. Wang's method for GVC embedding is adopted for empirical research on input and output, energy utilization, high-skilled labor ratio, and pollution emissions in five typical developing countries, namely, Brazil, Russia, India, China, and Mexico. The relationships among the degree of participation in GVC, technological progress, and environmental pollution is studied from the perspective of industries in each country. The outcomes indicate that there is a value chain threshold in developing countries. When the degree of participation in a value chain is lower than the threshold, technological progress can result in an increase in pollution; otherwise, technological progress can reduce emissions. These results provide a theoretical basis and practical suggestions for developing countries to realize their own energy conservation, emission reductions, and green development while participating in globalized value chains. However, because the data related to the WIOD database is limited to 1995-2009, there are a few flaws in data integrity, which is also a challenge we face.

TI Modernization as a Condition for Sustainable Economic Development
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN DIGITAL ECONOMY: Perspectives from
   Russian Experiences
SE Research for Development
AB Purpose: The authors objective is to identify the applied features of modernization as conditions for sustainable economic development in developed and developing countries and to determine the Paretooptimality for each of these categories of countries. Design/methodology/approach: The top 8 developed and top 8 developing countries that demonstrated the highest level of digitalization in the IMD digital competitiveness rating for 2019 were selected as the objects for this research. The methodology of this research is based on the method of regression and scenario analysis, as well as the optimization method. Findings: It was revealed that in developed countries it is possible to simultaneously comply with all criteria for the sustainability of the economy, but this requires a slowdown in the pace of modernization, that is, moderate digitalization. This puts the interests of sustainable development in sharp contradiction to the interests of economic growth and global competitiveness, impeding the practical implementation of the identified Pareto-optimal. In developing countries, it is impossible to simultaneously meet all the criteria for economic sustainability-the identified Paretooptimality leads to a decrease in the average value of sustainability indicators, eliminating the need for optimization. At the same time, the general logic implies a more active modernization, that is, accelerated digitalization of the economy in developing countries. Originality/value: It has been proved that modernization, currently carried out on the basis of digitalization, is a condition for the sustainable development of the economy. However, at the same time, all criteria for sustainable development are difficult to meet in modernization. The results offer an opportunity for more accurate modelling and planning of public economic policies, taking into account the specificities of developed and developing countries, and also prove the variability of economic modernization for its sustainable development.

TI Exploring the Implications of a Needs-Based Pharmacy Education Framework
   Modelled on Population Health: Perspective from a Developing Country
SO PHARMACY
AB Globally, health education reform is directing efforts to strengthen the health system through collaboration between health education and health services. However, collaborative efforts vary between developed and developing countries as the health needs, economic constraints, and resource availability differs. In developing countries, resource allocation is weighed in favor of interventions that will benefit the majority of the population. The question that emerges is: How could health education, service, and research activities be (re-)aligned to optimize return on investment for the health system and society at large? This paper proposes a needs-based pharmacy educational approach by centralizing population health for a developing country like South Africa. Literature on systems-based approaches to health professional education reform and the global pharmacy education framework was reviewed. A needs-based pharmacy educational approach, the population health model which underpins health outcome measurements to gauge an educational institution's effectiveness, was contextualized. An evaluation framework to determine the pharmacy school's effectiveness in strengthening the health system could be applied. A needs-based pharmacy educational approach modeled on population health could: Integrate resources from education, service, and research activities; follow a monitoring and evaluation framework that tracks educational outcomes; and engage with external stakeholders in curricular development and assessment.

TI ENVIRONMENTAL VALUATION IN DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES - THE RECREATIONAL VALUE
   OF WILDLIFE VIEWING
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB Few environmental valuation studies have been carried out in developing countries.  This study shows that the Travel Cost (TC) and the Contingent Valuation (CV) methods can be successfully applied to value natural resources in developing countries.  These two independent methods were used to estimate the recreational value of wildlife viewing, which is a valid, but very conservative, estimate of the total economic value of the wildlife species.  The annual recreational value of wildlife viewing in Lake Nakuru National Park in Kenya was found to be 7.5-15 million USD.  The flamingos accounted for more than 1/3 of the value.  Recognizing that this is only one of many parks in Kenya, and that wildlife viewing is becoming an important part of the global trend of increasing ecotourism, this clearly shows that sustainable management of wildlife resources could provide a very significant and much needed revenue source for developing countries in the future.  The challenge for the developing countries is to find ways to realize this economic potential, which also secures the preservation of wildlife.

TI Social and environmental accounting in developing countries: contextual
   challenges and insights
SO ACCOUNTING AUDITING & ACCOUNTABILITY JOURNAL
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to review most recent developments of social and environmental accounting (SEA) in the context of developing countries and to offer insights for the latest research in this field. It also provides an introduction to the AAAJ special issue. Design/methodology/approach The authors have undertaken a conceptual overview of the field developed in the past two decades (2001-2020) with a view to identify major themes, trends and future research directions. Findings The overview reveals that only 43 SEA papers addressing contextual challenges of developing countries have been published in leading accounting journals in the last 20 years. The coverage of these publications is concentrated in a small number of countries and regions. Interdisciplinary accounting journals, especially AAAJ, are the main publishing outlets in this field. The topic areas are dominated by social accounting challenges, with much less focus on environmental accounting, although developing countries are particularly exposed to the threats of climate change, water pollution and biodiversity loss. The literature reviewed uses elaborating, problematising and theorising contexts as three main contextualisation approaches to analyse contextual themes framed around regulatory, political, cultural and religious, and social-economic systems. Although various conceptual lenses have been adopted in the developing country SEA literature, the use of institutional theory and its various extensions to address political and cultural complexities seems to become more prominent, as shown in most of the contributions included in this special issue. Research limitations/implications This review is limited to leading accounting journals. SEA research increasingly published in other disciplines such as in management, social and environmental areas might provide a more comprehensive view in this research field. Originality/value In this paper, inter alia, the authors review and synthesise the previous literature in a conceptual framework, illustrating and highlighting the importance of contextual framing of SEA in developing countries. Based on this review, the authors propose some ideas for a future research agenda aiming to advance the field. The authors expect this paper and the special issue to act as a reference point for emerging SEA researchers from developing countries to raise more scholarly impactful enquiries in this area.

TI Industrial Transformation and Sustainable Development in Developing
   Countries
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB We examined the relationship between industrial transformation and the positive and negative impacts of industry on sustainable development in developing countries. We started by assigning developing countries to five groups based on the extent to which they have transformed and reoriented their manufacturing sectors. We then compared the changes in economic, social and environmental variables that occurred in these groups between the years 1990 and 2004. We found that those groups that experienced the greatest industrial transformation were the ones with the greater positive impacts in terms of per capita industrial output and employment and greater reductions in impacts in terms of energy intensity.

TI Infectious Diseases, Trade, and Economic Growth: a Panel Analysis of
   Developed and Developing Countries
SO JOURNAL OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY
AB The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of infectious diseases on trade and economic growth in 88 countries (44 developed countries and 44 developing countries). Annual panel data from 1996 to 2018 are examined using the Pedroni panel cointegration test in order to check the existence of a long-run relationship; FMOLS, DOLS, and the VECM techniques to detect the causality direction. The following findings are established. First, in the long run, infectious diseases are more destructive on economic growth in developing countries than in developed countries. Second, infectious diseases have a negative and significant influence on the trade openness, but more intensively in developed countries than in developing countries. Finally, using the VEC model, our results demonstrate that the short run causality between diseases, economic growth, and trade openness is unidirectional running from infectious diseases to trade and economic growth. However, in the long run, there is bidirectional Granger causality among the running variables. Based on these results, government makers should concentrate more on the healthcare delivery in order to realize higher rates of economic growth and trade.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB The developing countries and emerging economies are crucially contributing to global economic development, energy transition, and climate governance. This paper employs panel cointegration technique to investigate the long-run relationship between carbon emissions and five impacting factors (per capita GDP, primary energy consumption, international trade, fossil proportion, and quadratic per capita GDP) in 50 representative developing countries during 1995-2017. The empirical findings confirm the existence of long-run equilibrium, and the regressing coefficients of fully-modified OLS (FMOLS) indicate that (a) impacting features of the inverted U-shaped curve of Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) theory appear in a few countries, such as Mexico, Croatia, Kazakhstan, Iran, Algeria, Indonesia, and Thailand; (b) the energy consumption has statistically positive and significant impacts on boosting the carbon emissions; (c) the negative effect of international trade emerges in the developing nations enjoying trade surpluses; and (d) fossil energy share poses a mixed impact. This paper reveals that the vast and inspiring contribution of developing countries to global carbon emission reduction should attract more international attention and assistance.

TI Environmental and economic analyses of the carbon tax based on the
   imputed price using applied general equilibrium model: taxation on the
   upper industrial sectors
SO ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND POLICY STUDIES
AB Considering the latest arguments on global warming, CO2 emissions reduction by not only developed countries but also by developing countries is becoming a pivotal issue. Although the worldwide uniform-rate carbon tax (UCT) is thought to be a cost-effective method to reduce CO2 emissions, it places heavy economic burdens on developing countries. Because such a policy is likely to be opposed by developing countries and is against "common but differentiated responsibilities" of the UNFCCC, it is unlikely to be successfully implemented. This article discusses the effects of the worldwide differentiated-rate carbon tax from the policy viewpoint regarding environmental (CO2) and economic (gross domestic product) aspects. The tax, based on the imputed price of carbon (lCT), was compared with UCT by simulation analysis using the applied general equilibrium model. The world economy was classified into 15 industries and 14 regions in the model. Each tax was imposed on the upper industrial sectors. As ICT reduced CO2 emissions slightly less than UCT, it was found to generate positive GDP effects on developing countries, unlike UCT. With regard to the importance of worldwide introduction of CO2 abating policies and avoidance of excessive economic burdens on developing countries, ICT has higher economic equity and policy effectiveness than UCT.

TI Energy provision in South African informal urban Settlements - A
   multi-criteria sustainability analysis
SO ENERGY STRATEGY REVIEWS
AB In South Africa, as in much of sub-Saharan Africa, strong urbanization trends lead to people settling in ever less suitable informal locations, which are often considered ineligible for basic service provision. This study explores how access to basic energy services can be provided to informal urban households in South Africa that are ineligible for grid electrification. This is done through a multi-criteria sustainability analysis of current and alternative ways of accessing energy services. The case of the Western Cape Province is explored, showing that barriers for electrification can be overcome in some cases, given that there is political will at the local level to do so. When electrification is unviable, off-grid electricity alternatives combined with support for access to modern cooking fuels may provide short or mediumterm solutions. This study further suggests that governmental efforts of meeting basic energy needs must be persistently oriented and structured towards access to energy services, as opposed to supply of electricity.

SO NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM
AB This study is not only important for policy creators but also useful for governments of both developed and developing countries in which to improve their carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and also to maintain growth in renewable electricity production. This study is concerned with the impact that renewable energy consumption, economic factors, globalisation and natural resources have on CO2 emissions in 31 developed and 155 developing countries over the period 1991 to 2018, and utilises time pair dynamic fixed effect and time pair dynamic generalised method of moments (GMM) and system generalised method of moments (system GMM) estimators. The results indicate that renewable energy and social globalisation play a very important role in a CO2 emission reduction of both developed and developing countries. Moreover, in developed countries fuel exports, economic growth, and economic globalisation increase CO2 emissions. Although in developing countries, fuel exports and economic globalisation reduce CO2 emissions, and economic growth and political globalisation increase CO2 emissions. Therefore, policy implications are suggested for both the developed and developing countries' not only for environmental reasons, but also for sustaining growth in fuel exports and for increasing renewable electricity.

TI Business models for sustainable innovation - an empirical analysis of
   frugal products and services
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Sustainable innovations are inventions providing an essential progress concerning social, economic and ecological concerns. The emergence of Base of the Pyramid markets and the growing importance of the developing economies as new sources of frugal innovations has attracted the interest of scholars and practitioners. Frugal innovation is an inclusive approach to innovation that maximizes value for customers, shareholders, and society while significantly reducing the use of financial and natural resources in developing countries. Reverse innovations are frugal products and services successful in developing markets that make their way back to industrialized countries by creating new market segments. Therefore, both concepts are crucial for facing sustainability challenges in developing countries and may also lend insights to business models in industrialized countries. As the relationship between frugal and reverse innovation and sustainability remains largely unexplored in the literature, this study aims to fill in this gap and answer the research question: How can frugal and reverse innovation strengthen sustainable development, and how can business models in this context be systemized and described? Employing a multiple case study design, a total of 59 frugal products and services were investigated from a business models and sustainability strategy perspective from June 2014 until June 2015. The direction of innovation was distinguished between (a) from developing countries to developing countries, (b) from industrialized countries to developing countries, (c) from industrialized countries to industrialized countries, and (d) from developing countries to industrialized countries with the purpose to find differences between different directions of innovation and economies. Findings show that entrepreneurs and companies offering frugal and reverse products and services manage to combine the business model elements in an insightful manner and create economic, social and environmental value.

TI Sequential Methodology for the Selection of Municipal Waste Treatment
   Alternatives Applied to a Case Study in Chile
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Most municipalities in developing countries lack technical and economic resources to improve their municipal solid waste management (MSWM) system. Therefore, tools are needed that enable the most appropriate solutions to be identified to put waste to better use. This study presents an easy-to-apply sequential methodology for the analysis of MSWM alternatives. The method consists of two stages: (1) screening available technologies based on a small set of key variables; (2) ordering the selected alternatives by a combination of multicriteria methods that integrate local priorities. For this second stage, a basic series of technical, environmental, economic and social indicators is proposed. The methodology is applied to a case study where current management is limited to mixed municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal in a landfill without gas recovery. Seven options for implementing energy recovery in landfill, using mechanical plants to recover part of recyclable material, treating the organic fraction, and employing refuse-derived fuel and/or waste to energy incineration, were evaluated together with the current situation and considering four scenarios. The results identify various alternatives that allow the sustainability of MSWM in the case study to improve. Notwithstanding, today, it is necessary to introduce economic instruments that discourage final disposal to make municipal waste recovery viable.

AB Purpose: As cities in the developing countries are expanding at an alarming rate with resulting increase in demand for shelter, energy and means of livelihood, smart growth planning approach provides a means of making the cities more sustainable. And for the cities to grow smartly there is the need to train urban planners to think and act on how to help create and maintain cleaner, healthier and more sustainable communities. Using University of Dammam in Saudi Arabia as a case study, this study evaluates the efforts of higher institutions of learning in promoting smart growth in a country that is experiencing high population growth and its cities are rapidly expanding due to oil boom. The paper then highlights the critical role universities could play in promoting smart growth in planning and managing the rapidly growing cities of developing countries.
   Design / Methodology / Approach: In order to determine the extent to which the University promotes the principles of smart growth in its Bachelor of Urban and Regional planning program, data was collected through a review of bachelor of urban and regional planning curriculum and syllabi and final year projects and other relevant secondary literature. Descriptive statistics and contents analyses were used for data analyses.
   Originality / Value: The role of higher institutions in promoting smart growth principles in planning cities has been under utilized in the developing countries. This study highlights the critical role of universities in promoting smart growth principles in planning and managing cities in developing countries.
   Practical Application: This paper draws the attention of higher institutions of learning on the ways they can contribute in making our cities grow smarter. Colleges and universities can inculcate smart growth planning strategies in training urban planners and future decision makers and help local governments with technical ability, and intellectual and institutional resources to ensure that growth and development protects and enhances the natural environment, promotes economic prosperity, and enhances quality of life for all citizens.

SE Sustainable Production Life Cycle Engineering and Management
AB The challenges associated with achieving sustainable development goals and stabilizing the world's climate cannot be solved without significant efforts by developing and newly-emerging countries. With respect to climate change mitigation, the main challenge for developing countries lies in avoiding future emissions and lock-ins into emission-intensive technologies, rather than reducing today's emissions. While first best policy instruments like carbon prices could prevent increasing carbonization, those policies are often rejected by developing countries out of a concern for negative repercussions on development and long-term growth. In addition, policy environments in developing countries impose particular challenges for regulatory policy aiming to incentivize climate change mitigation and sustainable development. This chapter first discusses how climate policy could potentially interact with sustainable development and economic growth. It focuses, in particular, on the role of industrial sector development. The chapter then continues by discussing how effective policy could be designed, specifically taking developing country circumstances into account.

TI Environmental standards as a strategy of international technology
   transfer
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB Political scientists have shown that regulations diffuse from importing nations to exporting nations through international trade channels. However, this exporter-importer logic cannot explain why some key developing countries, such as China, have adopted automobile emission standards despite their local manufacturers' inability to compete in international markets. We develop a theory of environmental regulations as a strategy of international technology transfer. We argue that developing countries benefit from adopting environmental regulations if they enjoy substantial foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows in the concerned economic sectors and hold promise as automobile markets for foreign producers with access to advanced technology. In these circumstances, developing countries can use environmental regulations to force foreign producers to supply new technologies. We support the theory with a quantitative analysis of new data on the relationship between automobile FDI and developing countries' adoption of emission standards. We find that automobile FDI has a strong positive effect on the probability of adoption. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper argues the potential of small and medium sized enterprises to stimulate sustainable economic growth for transition countries. Firstly, the article discusses that SMEs are more successful tool to accelerate job creation process and to distribute economic resources efficiently. SMEs' flexibility is also mentioned as a key characteristic that allows them to adapt quickly to the changes in market and institutional conditions. Then, we stress on the SMEs capability to deepen the technological diffusion, which can be crucial for developing countries' economic prosperity. It is also shown that, competitive markets, as an essential determinant of sustainable economy, can be achieved only by the high presence of SMEs. And this competition can bring the innovative production and management strategies and cost-efficiency to the economies of developing countries. Finally, the paper introduces the necessary policy steps that governments of developing countries must follow to enhance the competitiveness and efficiency of the SMEs and to create a satisfactory business environment for them.

TI Poverty and stroke in India - A time to act
SO STROKE
AB In developed countries, the predominant health problems are those lifestyle- related illnesses associated with increased wealth. In contrast, diseases occurring in developing countries can largely be attributed to poverty, poor healthcare infrastructure, and limited access to care. However, many developing countries such as India have undergone economic and demographic growth in recent years resulting in a transition from diseases caused by poverty toward chronic, noncommunicable, lifestyle- related diseases. Despite this recent rapid economic growth, a large proportion of the Indian population lives in poverty. Although risk factors for stroke in urban Indian populations are similar to developed nations, it is likely that they may be quite different among those afflicted by poverty. Furthermore, treatment options for stroke are fewer in developing countries like India. Well- organized stroke services and emergency transport services are lacking, many treatments are unaffordable, and sociocultural factors may influence access to medical care for many stroke victims. Most stroke centers are currently in the private sector and establishing such centers in the public sector will require enormous capital investment. Given the limited resources available for hospital treatments, it would be logical to place a greater emphasis on effective populationwide interventions to control or reduce exposure to leading stroke risk factors. There also needs to be a concerted effort to ensure access to stroke care programs that are tailored to suit Indian communities and are accessible to the large majority of the population, namely the poor.

   in developed and developing countries
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB Understanding the approach of developed countries to the sustainable development of nature-based tourism (NBT) can be a model for developing countries. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the differences of opinion from different aspects. This study aimed to highlight the differences between the attitudes of experts in developing and developed countries on sustainable development indicators of NBT. Given that no such comparison has been made so far, this study intends to address this gap. Indicators were identified from three aspects: economic, social, and environmental, and they were approved through the use of the Delphi approach. The mean scores were determined based on a 7-point Likert scale and compared using an independent t-test. In developing countries, economic indicators (Mean = 5.779) and in developed countries, environmental indicators (Mean = 6.296) were the most crucial. Paying more attention to environmental indicators in developing countries can be an excellent way to improve the sustainable development of NBT.

TI Application of an alternative framework for measuring progress towards
   SDG 7.1
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Global progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 7.1: 'By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services' continues to be measured by mere access to energy carriers, using binary indicators that inadequately reflect the multi-dimensional nature of the goal. In this work, we describe and apply an alternative framework to track critical dimensions of energy provisioning and household capabilities that aligns more closely with the original SDG 7.1 target wording. We provide new empirical evidence from ten countries describing the extent to which the current indicators underestimate energy poverty and neglect decent access. We find that households officially counted as having access to modern energy sources, in many instances, still benefit only from minimal energy services, receive unreliable energy supply, and struggle with being able to afford energy services they need to enjoy a decent standard of living. We also find that poorer households are systematically over-represented in this population and are more likely to suffer multi-dimensional constraints when counted served by the current indicators. Notwithstanding challenges in data collection and standardisation, we argue that we must improve on binary indicators for measuring progress towards SDG 7.1, to pave the way for agenda setting and policy development that recognises and addresses broad inequities in household capabilities to use modern energy towards achieving a decent living standard.

SO EMERGING MARKETS FINANCE AND TRADE
AB Green finance provides an important impetus to green innovation and sustainable development. This study investigates the connection between green finance and green innovation using cross-country panel data that cover 75 developing countries from 2000 to 2019. First, we find that green finance significantly boosts the number of green patent applications in developing countries, which is crucial for promoting green development. Second, we divide countries according to whether they are members of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or the Belt and Road Initiative, and their environmental performance. Heterogeneity results show in countries with poor environmental performance, non-RCEP member countries, and non-BRI member countries that the contribution of green funding is more obvious and significant. Furthermore, we consider several cross-items to explore how green finance influences green innovation differently depending on the circumstance, such as the degree of corruption, political stability, and government effectiveness. Overall, our findings highlight the key role that green finance plays in advancing green innovation, particularly for emerging economies that urgently need a policy foundation for green innovation and sustainable development.

AB Low-volume roads (LVRs) constitute an integral component of the road system in all developing countries, where their importance extends to all aspects of the social and economic development of rural communities. However, the original documentation. relating to the provision of such roads is based in many respects on technology and research carried out in Europe and the United States some 30 to 40 years ago in environments very different from those prevailing in developing countries. As a result, these traditional approaches are often inappropriate for application in developing countries. Moreover, they tend to focus on the technical environment of road provision, with inadequate consideration of other interrelated environments that critically influence the types of LVRs that should be provided. As a result, a need for new, more holistic approaches to low-volume road provision has been engendered to satisfy the various needs of rural communities in a more sustainable manner. The objective of this discussion is to provide an insight into new, more holistic and sustainable approaches to the provision of LVRs in developing countries. Embodied in these new approaches is a need to rethink the old ways of providing such roads based on research and development work that has been carried out in these countries during the past 20 years. Examples include aspects of planning and project appraisal, geometric and pavement design, construction and drainage, and environmental issues, all of which need to be reconsidered in a more appropriate manner.

SO ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS IN STATISTICS
AB Due to the impact of agricultural sector on economic growth especially in developing countries, study of the factors affecting agricultural growth, including export diversification and trade liberalization is important. Export diversification is considered as increasing the number of export goods in the agricultural sector which leads to sustainable earnings from export and finally income growth. This article provides evidence on the relationship between export diversification and agricultural growth using a panel data set of 20 developing countries during 2000-2014. The study adopted Herfindahl index for export diversity and generalized least squares (GLS) to examine dynamic interactions among the variables. Main results showed that openness, export diversification, rainfall, agricultural areas, labor force and total factor productivity had a positive effect on agricultural growth. Estimated model reveals convergence theory and the hump-shaped relationship between mentioned variables. This finding suggested that, to achieve agricultural growth under trade liberalization, countries should diversify their agricultural export and develop economic cooperation with other countries.

SE Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences
AB Chronic diseases are increasing in global prevalence and seriously threaten developing nations' ability to improve the health of their populations. Although often associated with developed nations, the presence of chronic disease has become the dominant health burden in many developing countries. Chronic diseases were responsible for 50% of the disease burden in 23 high-burden developing countries in 2005 and will cost those countries $84 billion by 2015 if nothing is done to slow their growth. The rise of lifestyle-related chronic disease in poor countries is the result of a complex constellation of social, economic, and behavioral factors. Variability in the prevalence of chronic disease is found both at the country level and within countries as differences in risk factors are observed. This upward trend is forecast to continue as epidemiologic profiles and age structures of developing countries further shift. More research is needed to identify a full range of prevention-focused, cost-effective interventions against chronic diseases in the developing world.

TI Determinants of women's satisfaction with maternal health care: a review
   of literature from developing countries
SO BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
AB Background: Developing countries account for 99 percent of maternal deaths annually. While increasing service availability and maintaining acceptable quality standards, it is important to assess maternal satisfaction with care in order to make it more responsive and culturally acceptable, ultimately leading to enhanced utilization and improved outcomes. At a time when global efforts to reduce maternal mortality have been stepped up, maternal satisfaction and its determinants also need to be addressed by developing country governments. This review seeks to identify determinants of women's satisfaction with maternity care in developing countries.
   Methods: The review followed the methodology of systematic reviews. Public health and social science databases were searched. English articles covering antenatal, intrapartum or postpartum care, for either home or institutional deliveries, reporting maternal satisfaction from developing countries (World Bank list) were included, with no year limit. Out of 154 shortlisted abstracts, 54 were included and 100 excluded. Studies were extracted onto structured formats and analyzed using the narrative synthesis approach.
   Results: Determinants of maternal satisfaction covered all dimensions of care across structure, process and outcome. Structural elements included good physical environment, cleanliness, and availability of adequate human resources, medicines and supplies. Process determinants included interpersonal behavior, privacy, promptness, cognitive care, perceived provider competency and emotional support. Outcome related determinants were health status of the mother and newborn. Access, cost, socio-economic status and reproductive history also influenced perceived maternal satisfaction. Process of care dominated the determinants of maternal satisfaction in developing countries. Interpersonal behavior was the most widely reported determinant, with the largest body of evidence generated around provider behavior in terms of courtesy and non-abuse. Other aspects of interpersonal behavior included therapeutic communication, staff confidence and competence and encouragement to laboring women.
   Conclusions: Quality improvement efforts in developing countries could focus on strengthening the process of care. Special attention is needed to improve interpersonal behavior, as evidence from the review points to the importance women attach to being treated respectfully, irrespective of socio-cultural or economic context. Further research on maternal satisfaction is required on home deliveries and relative strength of various determinants in influencing maternal satisfaction.

AB Background: Breast and Cervical cancer are the two most common cancers among women in developing countries. Regular screening is the most effective way of ensuring that these cancers are detected at early stages; however few studies have assessed factors that predict cancer screening in developing countries.
   Purpose: To assess the influence of household socio-economic status (SES), healthcare access and country level characteristics on breast and cervical cancer screening among women in developing countries.
   Methods: Women ages 18-69 years (cervical cancer screening) and 40-69 years (breast cancer screening) from 15 developing countries who participated in the 2003 World Health Survey provided data for this study. Household SES and healthcare access was assessed based on self-reported survey responses. SAS survey procedures (SAS, Version 9.2) were used to assess determinants of breast and cervical cancer screening in separate models.
   Results: 4.1% of women ages 18-69 years had received cervical cancer screening in the past three years, while only 2.2% of women ages 40-69 years had received breast cancer screening in the past 5 years in developing countries. Cancer screening rates varied by country; cervical cancer screening ranged from 1.1% in Bangladesh to 57.6% in Congo and breast cancer screening ranged from 0% in Mali to 26% in Congo. Significant determinants of cancer screening were household SES, rural residence, country health expenditure (as a percent of GDP) as well as healthcare access.
   Discussion: A lot more needs to be done to improve screening rates for breast and cervical cancer in developing countries, such as increasing health expenditure (especially in rural areas), applying the increased funds towards the provision of more, better educated health providers as well as improved infrastructure.

TI Critical success factors (CSFs) for integration of sustainability into
   construction project management practices in developing countries
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT
AB This study looks at the critical success factors (CSFs) affecting integration of sustainability into project management practices of construction projects in developing countries. Having innovation diffusion theory as the theoretical point of departure, CSFs pertaining to the triple bottom line of sustainability (environmental, social and economic) were identified through a comprehensive review of literature. These were customised for the context of developing countries by conducting 16 semi-structured interviews and were presented in form of a conceptual model. The model was validated through a survey returning 101 completed questionnaires with partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) as the method of analysis. This study contributes to the field by presenting one of the first studies in its kind focusing on CSFs for integration of sustainability into project management practices for construction projects within the context of developing countries.

TI Basic Science Research and Education: A Priority for Training and
   Capacity Building in Developing Countries
SO INFECTIOUS DISEASE CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA
AB This article provides evidence that basic science research and education should be key priorities for global health training, capacity building, and practice. Currently, there are tremendous gaps between strong science education and research in developed countries (the North) as compared to developing countries (the South). In addition, science research and education appear as low priorities in many developing countries. The need to stress basic science research beyond the typical investment of infectious disease basic service and research laboratories in developing areas is significant in terms of the benefits, not only to education, but also for economic strengthening and development of human resources. There are some indications that appreciation of basic science research education and training is increasing, but this still needs to be applied more rigorously and strengthened systematically in developing countries.

TI Scenarios of animal waste production and fertilizer use and associated
   ammonia emission for the developing countries
SO ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
AB Livestock production and the use of synthetic fertilizer are responsible for about half of the global emission of NH3. Depending on the animal category between 10 and 36% of the N in animal excreta is lost as NH3. The current annual NH3 emission in developing countries of 15 million ton N accounts for 2/3 of the global emission From animal excreta. In addition, 7.2 million tons NH3-N of synthetic N fertilizers are lost as NH3 in developing countries. This is 80% of the global NH3 emission from synthetic fertilizer's use. Along with human population increase and economic growth, livestock production in developing countries may even increase by a factor of 3 between now and 2025. The net result of rapid increase of livestock production combined with higher efficiency is an increase in NH3 emissions of only 60% from 15 to 24 million tons NH3-N between 1990 and 2025 in developing countries. Livestock production is an important consumer of feedstuffs, mainly cereals, thereby inducing additional demand for synthetic fertilizers. Despite the projected major increase of synthetic fertilizer use from 42 to 106 million ton N between 1990 and 2025, the NH3 loss in developing countries may decrease if a shift towards other fertilizer types, that are less vulnerable to NH3 volatilization, is realized. According to the scenario, the total emission of NH3 associated with food production in developing countries will increase from 22 to 30 million ton N yr(-1) between 1990 and 2025. Although the NH3 emission increases more slowly than food production, in particular, animal production may show geographic concentration in certain regions, which may lead to high local emission densities and associated environmental problems.

TI Globalization and slums: How do economic, political, and social
   globalization affect slum prevalence?
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB This study examines how globalization affects slum prevalence in developing countries. Recognizing that globalization is a multifaceted phenomenon, we disaggregate globalization into three conventional subdimensions - economic globalization, political globalization, and social globalization - and propose the hypotheses that economic globalization is likely to increase slum prevalence while political and social globalizations are likely to reduce it. To test the hypotheses, we utilize the cross-national dataset on urban slum population in developing countries assembled by the UN-Habitat and the KOF globalization index, the most commonly used dataset of globalization. We report strong empirical support for our hypotheses: political and social globalizations indeed reduce urban slum populations but economic globalization increases urban slum populations. The findings suggest that diverse aspects of globalization should be considered regarding slum prevalence in developing countries.

TI Representation of Developing Countries in Orthopaedic Journals: A Survey
   of Four Influential Orthopaedic Journals
SO CLINICAL ORTHOPAEDICS AND RELATED RESEARCH
AB The developing world contains more than A3/4 of the world's population, and has the largest burden of musculoskeletal disease. Published studies provide crucial information that can influence healthcare policies. Presumably much information regarding burden in the developing world would arise from authors from developing countries. However, the extent of participation of authors from the developing world in widely read orthopaedic journals is unclear.
   We surveyed four influential English-language orthopaedic journals to document the contributions of authors from developing countries.
   We surveyed Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma, and the American and British volumes of The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, from May 2007 through May 2010. The country of origin of all authors was identified. We used the designations provided by the International Monetary Fund to define countries as either developed or developing.
   Two hundred sixty-five of 3964 publications (7%) included authors from developing countries. Ninety percent of these had authors from developing countries with industrialized and emerging-market economies. Publications from Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for only 0.4% of the 3964 articles reviewed and 5.6% of the 265 articles with developing world authorship. Countries with the least robust economies were least represented. Less than 1/3 of articles with authors from the developing world had coauthors from developed or other developing countries.
   Additional studies are needed to determine the reasons for the low representation noted and to establish strategies to increase the number of orthopaedic publications from parts of the world where the burden of musculoskeletal disease is the greatest.

TI Agriculture and Green Economy for Environmental Kuznets Curve Adoption
   in Developing Countries: Insights from Rwanda
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Development and climate change are crucial global concerns with significant contrasts between developed and developing nations. Contrary to several developing countries, Rwanda opted for a green growth policy pathway while struggling with its economic emergence through the alternative green sectors, including agriculture. No research has yet been conducted on the choice's performance on emission sequestration or the country's income, allowing the formulation of strategies accordingly. The environmental Kuznets curve (EKC), mostly adopted by developed countries, is applied for the Rwandese scenario to verify its adoption in developing countries. The within and between effects of the agricultural sector (AGRc) and gross domestic products (GDPc) on CO2 emission (CO2) are examined with an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) cointegration and coupling methods in January 2008-December 2018 period. Results confirm the short-run and long-run cointegration relationships of variables, where CO2-GDPc and CO2-AGRc are relatively decoupling and absolute decoupling, respectively. The EKC adoption to CO2-GDPc relationship, and the significant negative causality from GDPc and AGRc to CO2, are confirmed. The performance resulted from the country's environment conservation policies, and Rwanda is a learning example as a developing country. However, the green economy through the agro-economy is at a low level and should be reinforced.

SO BUILDINGS
AB Green growth has emerged as a strategy for addressing environmental concerns while also promoting economic development. This study assesses the impact of renewable energy technologies and policies on green growth in the built environment. It investigates 20 developed and 20 developing countries from 2010 to 2021. Panel data estimators such as generalized least squares and generalized method of moments are employed. The results reveal that the contribution of renewable energy sectors to green growth varies between developed and developing countries. In developed countries, solar, wind, and biomass capacities have facilitated green growth, while hydroelectric capacities have not. By contrast, in developing countries, wind capacity has not been effective, while other sectors show a positive contribution. The study also confirms the criticality of judicious renewable energy policies in stimulating investment and technological innovation required for a sustainable built environment.

TI Occupational Exposure and Occupational Asthma: Difference in Practices
   in Developed Countries v/s Developing Countries
SO CURRENT RESPIRATORY MEDICINE REVIEWS
AB Occupational asthma (OA) has emerged as the commonest occupational lung disease in developed countries and the second commonest in developing countries. Nearly 9-15% of the global adult asthma is occupation associated. However, this is an underestimation as large proportion of occupational asthma remains unidentified in developing world. The economic burden of OA is enormous but the disease is potentially preventable. The western models of documenting and legislation implementation models have provided a scaffold to curb various occupation morbidities of the world. Many government and non-government bodies along pertinent political inclination have been instrumental in the risk factor identification and sensitizer dose assessment for OA in the developed countries, and also ensuring that patients are adequately treated and compensated by the employers, with execution of good ergonomic practices in work places. The characteristic of OA epidemiology in developing world is contrary to the poor diagnosis, inappropriate treatment and inadequate compensation, with lack of political will. This mandates necessity of learning from developed country occupational disease models context to understanding of OA, along with reliable and feasible diagnostics and interventions that will have the potential to minimize the health hazards from the exposures at workplace environments in developing countries.

TI The effect of institutions on intrapreneurship: An analysis of developed
   vs developing countries
SO JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB This article examines the interaction effects of formal and informal institutions on intrapreneurship in developed and developing countries. We use a multilevel logistic regression technique and data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) for the years 2014-2020 with information from 29 developed countries (237,053 observations) and 31 developing countries (177,201 observations). The main findings highlight that informal institutions (fear of failure and media attention) are more relevant than the social status of entrepreneurs as predictors of intrapreneurship, in both developed and developing countries. In addition, the moderation of economic freedom as a formal institution differs depending on the economic development context. In developed countries, economic freedom enhances to a greater extent the relationship between social status and intrapreneurship, as well as between media attention and intrapreneurship. These findings can be useful for the design of intrapreneurship policies in adapting their strategies to the specific institutional environment.

SO ENERGY
AB This is a discussion and response to "Global 100% energy transition by 2050: A fiction in developing economies?" authored by Anthony Afful-Dadzie and published in Joule 5 (2021) 1634-1643. The preview has raised concerns around the feasibility of energy transitions towards 100% renewable energy and sustainable technologies in developing economies, after examining the article Bogdanov et al. (2021) in Afful-Dadzie (2021). Although, the author has rightly pointed out the disparity in the recent growth of renewable energy across the developed and developing countries of the world, along with highlighting a pertinent issue of 'availability of finance' for energy transitions across developing countries, the preview fails to contextualise the issue of financing energy transitions, in particular across developing countries, and has trivialised complex and cumbersome cost optimal energy transition modelling with vague and unscientific illustrations. In response, the authors of Bogdanov et al. (2021) have contextualised, clarified and confuted the issues raised in Afful-Dadzie (2021).(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Certainly, one of the most important challenges about the higher education system is the issue of accessibility. In developing countries, due to socio-cultural, economical and geographical barriers and unequal distribution of human and technical infrastructures in the country, access to new types of education such as e-learning for rural and suburban citizens is a fiction rather than a reality. For this, literacy divide becomes more and more extended in these countries. The development of local universities as a solution for eliminating educational discrimination will provide a good opportunity for both rural citizens to overcome literacy divide and the society to move toward sustainable development. In this study, we provide a comprehensive understanding of local universities, their role and position in higher education, and their contribution in overcoming literacy divide and sustainable development of developing countries.

With the global transformations eLearning has become an important element of students' higher education experience in developed countries. Although students of developed countries have digital exposure at an early age, many students from developing countries, on the journey of becoming international students, are inadequately prepared for eLearning. The lack of digital skills, prior experience, cultural differences and language barriers together with the drastic changes in learning environments require international students to not only adapt to the host environment but also to negotiate technology for learning. The scarcity of research exploring the eLearning experiences of international students from developing countries and the benefits of this understanding is discussed in an effort to promote research in this area.

TI Management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Asia and Africa
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TUBERCULOSIS AND LUNG DISEASE
AB This review examines whether the comprehensive programme recommended by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), developed mostly by physicians in industrialised countries, can be applied in developing countries. In developing countries, there are several major limitations to the implementation of the programme. First, management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients is not a priority in competing for health care resources. Second, only major medical centres in developing countries have spirometers; the reliance on spirometric testing for diagnosis, staging and treatment options, as recommended by the GOLD guidelines, makes it almost impossible for the programme to be implemented. Third, in many Asian and African countries, regular monitoring is often restricted to patients with severe COPD who have frequent hospitalisations or clinic visits for exacerbations and complications. Fourth, the choice of therapy usually depends on the availability and cost of drugs. Finally, given the aetiological role of sequelae of lung infections, including tuberculosis, the appropriateness and safety of using intermittent courses of oral steroids during acute exacerbations and of long-term, high-dose inhaled corticosteroids for moderate to severe COPD in developing countries has not been evaluated. Developing countries in Asia and Africa may need to adapt the GOLD guidelines according to varying aetiology, local health care resources, socio-economic and cultural factors and development of health services. Prevention programmes, especially for tobacco control, are of paramount importance. National and international efforts must be directed towards controlling the tobacco epidemic in developing countries to reduce the burden of COPD and other tobacco-induced diseases.

AB Space Tourism is a rapidly developing activity that has the potential to become a major industry and lower the cost of access to space by several orders of magnitude. Sustainable Development is increasingly recognised by governments, organisations and individuals as a vital response to several interlinked problems such as population growth, the need to create wealth in developing countries, future energy and mineral supplies and environmental degradation. This paper presents a summary of the two fields, Space Tourism and Sustainable Development, and explores links between the two at five levels; operations, cultural, economic, resources and human survival. The two fields are not often linked and indeed, space tourism may be perceived as "unsustainable development". The paper argues that; the two fields are very closely linked, space tourism will enable low cost access to space which will help to ensure true sustainable development and space tourism companies need to recognise these links and position themselves appropriately.

Poultry systems in developing countries cover all four of the poultry sectors defined by FAO and the OIE, each with particular economic aspects that might motivate farmers to take part in vaccination programmes or to initiate and finance them. Outbreaks in flocks of different types have different potential impacts in terms of disease spread and economic effects, which influence the potential benefits of vaccination as a means to prevent or control outbreaks. We use data from three countries to illustrate the costs of vaccination and discuss measures of cost-effectiveness and ways to improve it. We also consider the question of funding sources and their impact on the sustainability of vaccination programmes.

In contrast with developed countries, where urban regeneration assumes a perspective of renewal and adjustment to new trends, in developing countries it represents an opportunity to implement urbanization to improve the quality of life and provide the minimum conditions to ensure its inhabitants a dignified life. This paper presents and discusses a method to respond to the challenges of expansion and regeneration of urban areas in developing countries based on the strategy of transforming informal areas into formal ones through urbanization. The Wall-Up method is validated through its application in the case study of Pante Macassar, Oe-Cusse Region in Timor-Leste, resulting in a small allotment plan ready to be implemented and to satisfy the current necessity in terms of urban regeneration and housing provision. In this case study Wall-Up is shown to be a reliable way to improve the quality of life and on to create a basis for the future development of housing for locals through urban regeneration that is viable in political, economic and social terms.

AB Library services in the 21st century have moved from the four corners of physical location and printed books to the virtual and ubiquitous solution that includes digital contents accessible in many forms and from anywhere. These new ways of accessing information, managing, and providing library and information services, depend largely on a solid and scalable Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure, which is supported by stable sources of electrical power and backed by ease of software applications to empower digital platforms for library solutions. Therefore, the lack of reliable ICT platforms, access and policies supported by relevant skill sets are a major challenge to developing countries.
   This paper is about raising the challenges and issues that affect the basic ICT infrastructure for delivering library and information services in some African countries in the 21st Century. The method used is the mixed methodology approach of interviewing and observations. The paper also covers the major challenges facing these countries in developing ICT infrastructure
   It is argued that developing countries have similar issues and challenges with respect to availability of reasonable ICT infrastructure, reliable sources of electric power, high cost of internet bandwidth and ICT equipment as well as lack of technical expertise to manage the life cycle support of technological advancement. To help deal with these challenges, developing countries need the support of global forces and partners to deal with the present ICT infrastructure gaps in order to integrate their economies to accelerate the developmental progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

TI The economic implications of greater global trade in livestock and
   livestock products
SO REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES
AB The Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) established the World Trade Organization to supervise the reduction of barriers to, and liberalisation of, world trade. The application of sanitary and phytosanitary measures will be standardised to avoid use for protectionist purposes by countries or regional trade blocks. Harmonisation of animal disease control measures within regional blocks is essential if benefits to freer trade are to occur, but this harmonisation must be balanced against potential disease risks and costs associated with disease outbreaks. World trade in livestock products is concentrated among developed countries, although developing countries are responsible for approximately a third of poultry meat imports and exports. Despite liberalisation, the share of global trade by developing countries is unlikely to increase greatly in the short term. The benefits of trade and of freer trade are emphasised. Examples are given of the impacts of trade barriers on developing countries and of the harmonisation of European Union animal health standards. Economic implications for the future of greater global trade are assessed.

SO JOURNAL OF SURVEY STATISTICS AND METHODOLOGY
AB Motivated by the United Nations' Education Sustainable Development Goal of all young people achieving at least basic literacy and numeracy skills, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has undertaken a pilot study of the Programme for the International Student Assessment (PISA) for developing countries. In this study, PISA is administered in five developing countries to 14- to 16-year olds who are either out of school or in school below grade 7. The target population is about 1-3 percent of the overall population for the participating countries. Several options to achieve adequate representation were presented to countries. To simplify operations, reduce costs, reduce bias, and achieve sample size goals, a probability-based link-tracing approach was designed and attempted in countries as one of the several approaches administered. In this article, we provide an evaluation of the approach and describe its application toward providing proficiency estimates with adequate representation of the target population.

SO MANAGEMENT DECISION
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to report three main findings. First, the paper reports why local organizations in developing countries would demand self-initiated expatriates (SIEs); second, the paper reports why SIEs accept employment with such organizations; and third, the paper reports the factors that seem to govern the role allocation to SIEs. Design/methodology/approach The authors used semi-structured interviews to elicit and collect data. The authors followed the procedures of grounded theory for data analysis. Findings Local organizations in developing countries seem increasingly willing to employ SIEs. Emergence of hitherto nonexistent businesses, rapid expansion, global ambition and organizational maturity seem to drive the demand for SIEs. Industrial decline elsewhere, attractiveness of emerging economies, challenging role, prior experience within similar countries and non-working spouse are factors that enable the SIEs' acceptance of employment with such organizations. Required boundary spanning and repatriation status determine the role allocation for SIEs.
   Originality/value Unlike the typical SIEs studied in literature, the authors theorize about SIEs who move from developed countries to work in developing countries and occupy senior positions. Additionally, unlike a typical SIE study, the authors gathered the perspectives of both SIEs and organizations. Lastly, the paper is about an emerging trend: SIEs' employment in the local organizations of developing countries.

AB The subject of research in this paper refers to the analysis of the impact of free zones on the economic growth of developing countries. The objective of the research is to explain to the scientific and professional public the way of functioning and the transmission mechanism of free zones in generating economic growth ceteris paribus. The analysis covers free zones in three countries in the development of compatible characteristics: Serbia, Croatia and Belarus. The research problem is sublimated in the question of whether and in what way free zones have an impact on the economic growth of developing countries? The research was conducted by analyzing the relevant literature and by using the panel analysis. The results of the research showed the existence of statistically significant determination of GDP per capita, as an indicator of economic growth, by variations of macroeconomic parameters of the functioning of free zones. That is, the operation of free zones has a statistically significant impact on the economic growth of targeted developing countries ceteris paribus. Whether growth will be inclusive and sustainable in the long run depends on political and economic decision makers and defined economic policy. In this way, the hypothesis was confirmed that the establishment of free zones in developing countries, with the condition of integration of the national economy into the work of zones, creates preconditions for sustainable and inclusive economic growth.

TI Geopolitical risk and the sustainable utilization of natural resources:
   Evidence from developing countries
SO RESOURCES POLICY
AB Geopolitical risk has attracted global attention in recent years, as it becomes a threat to the sustainable utilization of natural resources. From the perspective of developing countries, this research explores how geopolitical risk impacts the level of natural resource utilization with panel data from 2001 to 2020. The empirical results first manifest that geopolitical risk leads to a significant reduction in the level of natural resource utilization. Second, heterogeneity analysis denotes that geopolitical risk exerts more significant impacts on developing countries with low-level science and technology, high-level openness, high-level economic growth, and high-level of natural resource abundance. This further reveals that the effect of geopolitical threats is more evident and the level concerning oil and forest resources are reduced more significantly. Third, the levels of economy and finance enhance the negative effect of geopolitical risk on natural resource utilization. Fourth, a non-linear correlation exists between geopolitical risk and natural resource utilization, which provides a broader perspective for the estimation of geopolitical risk's effects. Moreover, instrumental variable and several methods are conducted to boost the robustness of the basic conclusion. Finally, result-based policy recommendations are proposed for developing countries.

TI Economic and environmental impacts of raising revenues for climate
   finance from public sources
SO CLIMATE POLICY
AB In response to anthropogenic climate change, developed countries have committed themselves to raising 100 billion USD a year from 2020 onwards to address the needs of developing countries. In this paper, we investigate the economic consequences and CO2 emission impacts of three options for raising climate funds from public sources in developed countries: (i) CO2 emissions pricing, (ii) an electricity consumption tax, and (iii) the removal of fossil fuel subsidies. Using computable general equilibrium analysis, we find that these three options not only induce very different global costs to raise given amounts of climate funds, but also have quite diverging implications for the cost incidence between developed and developing countries. Likewise, the global CO2 emission impacts of alternative fund-raising policies differ significantly.
   Key policy insights
   CO2 emission pricing and a tax on electricity consumption in developed countries shift substantial shares of the cost burden for raising climate finance to developing countries, while the removal of fossil fuel subsidies in developed countries leads to welfare gains for developing countries.
   While CO2 pricing and a tax on electricity consumption lead to positive carbon leakage, i.e. increased emissions in developing countries, the removal of fossil fuel subsidies incentivizes decarbonization of developing economies through higher prices for fossil fuels.
   From a global cost-effectiveness perspective the removal of subsidies is the least attractive option, but it gains in attractiveness for a policy portfolio when taking into account the cost incidence between developed and developing countries, and also the impact on CO2 emissions in developing countries.

   India: challenges and opportunities
SO REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND BIO-TECHNOLOGY
AB Management of municipal solid waste is a global problem and is faced by all developing countries. The rapid pace of increase in population, economic growth, urbanization and industrialization is coupled with accelerated solid waste generation. In most of the developing countries wastes are either scattered in urban centers or disposed off unplanned in low lying areas or open dumps. The lack of infrastructure for collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of solid waste, proper solid waste management planning, insufficient financial resources, technical expertise and public attitude have made the situation exasperating due to which several environmental and health related problems are increasing. Though, there are many negative issues related to solid waste, it also provides many opportunities that not only mitigates its negative impact but also helps in meeting the demand for energy and employment generation as well as in soil health improvement. Keeping in mind the present situation the current review was planned with the objective to overlook the challenges and opportunities faced during urban solid waste management in developing countries like India.

TI World Heritage Sites in developing countries: Assessing impacts and
   handling complexities toward sustainable tourism
SO JOURNAL OF DESTINATION MARKETING & MANAGEMENT
AB The current study addresses several concerns regarding World Heritage Sites (WHSs) in developing countries. Using a novel super-efficiency parallel framework, this research firstly elucidates how WHS designation impacts the tourism sector in the 21 developing nations with the greatest number of WHSs from 2000 through 2016. The proposed parallel model assesses the tourism industry at both the macro level in the context of resource-oriented efficiency and the micro level in facility-oriented efficiency. The results demonstrate that the WHS brand positively impacts the tourism demand in developing countries and can be used as a promotional tool. Secondly, this work draws attention to the socio-ecological concerns related to WHSs in developing countries. It sets out a critical and factual discussion based on the current designation and conservation status of WHSs. The analysis highlights an unfair distribution of WHSs between developing and advanced economies and reveals negligence in their preservation, since around 94% of sites labeled In Danger are located in developing nations. The study concludes that the conservation of WHSs is a complex societal problem and offers policy implications for handling heritage inscription and preservation issues in developing countries. Finally, it explores pathways toward sustainable conservation of WHSs, based on United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs) for safeguarding heritage and sustainable communities (SDG 11), for more effective institutions (SDG 16), and for fair and nonhegemonic partnership between advanced economies and developing countries (SDG 17). The outcomes may be of practical value to policymakers aiming to improve tourism and heritage management.

TI Hydrogen for Cooking: A Review of Cooking Technologies, Renewable
   Hydrogen Systems and Techno-Economics
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB About 3 billion people use conventional carbon-based fuels such as wood, charcoal, and animal dung for their daily cooking needs. Cooking with biomass causes deforestation and habitat loss, emissions of greenhouse gases, and smoke pollution that affects people's health and well-being. Hydrogen can play a role in enabling clean and safe cooking by reducing household air pollution and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This first-of-a-kind review study on cooking with hydrogen assessed existing cooking technologies and hydrogen systems in developing country contexts. Our critical assessment also included the modelling and experimental studies on hydrogen. Renewable hydrogen systems and their adoptability in developing countries were analysed. Finally, we presented a scenario for hydrogen production pathways in developing countries. Our findings indicated that hydrogen is attractive and can be safely used as a cooking fuel. However, radical and disruptive models are necessary to transform the traditional cooking landscape. There is a need to develop global south-based hydrogen models that emphasize adoptability and capture the challenges in developing countries. In addition, the techno-economic assumptions of the models vary significantly, leading to a wide-ranging levelized cost of electricity. This finding underscored the necessity to use comprehensive techno-economic assumptions that can accurately predict hydrogen costs.

SO EUROPEAN BUSINESS REVIEW
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a theoretical model for evaluating the international competitiveness of small and medium multinational enterprises (SMNEs) located in Latin American developing countries.
   Design/methodology/approach - Industrial economics and international business theories were linked for establishing the firm international competitiveness model. Literature on each variable determining of firm competitiveness is reviewed and the linkages between them are discussed.
   Findings - The use of a global strategy is one of the most important factors to compete abroad. Domestic environment and national industry might help its use. Human resources background of staff working within the SMNEs affects the global strategy as well.
   Practical implications - SMNEs should be more taken into account as they are the main generators of the economic development of countries and, consequently, foster the progress of underdeveloped countries through creating jobs.
   Originality/value - This study is one of the pioneers in developed a model for evaluating the international competitiveness of firms based on developing countries of Latin America. Researchers and professionals will count on a theoretical tool for evaluating the Latin American international competitiveness in global contexts. Additionally we include the full survey for testing the competitiveness model.

TI THE ROLE OF AGRICULTURE AND ITS PREREQUISITES IN ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT -
   A VISION FOR FOREIGN DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE
SO FOOD POLICY
AB The aim of this paper is to establish a vision for foreign development assistance based upon the evolution of thought and empirical evidence found in the development literature. The paper spotlights the agricultural-led approach. The empirical record shows that agricultural growth had a more pronounced impact on increases in developing-country income than did growth in the nonagricultural sector. The reason for the differential impact is that developing countries focusing on agricultural development experienced more broad-based income growth and increases in the demand for domestically-produced goods; whereas the developing countries promoting rapid industrialization experienced narrow-based income growth, with a demand pattern oriented toward nonfood and capital-intensive products. A precondition for agriculture to play its proper role is the existence of a conducive environment in which private enterprise can flourish. Developing-country governments need to assume responsibility for the creation and maintenance of essential institutions. Government investments are required in education, infrastructure, and other areas where the commercial market is not capable of delivering critical services. Finally, governments must responsibly manage the macroeconomy, pursuing sustainable pricing policies and fiscal and monetary policies that are consistent with real equilibrium exchange rates.

TI Potential emissions reduction in road transport sector using biofuel in
   developing countries
SO ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
AB Use of biofuels as transport fuel has high prospect in developing countries as most of them are facing severe energy insecurity and have strong agricultural sector to support production of biofuels from energy crops. Rapid urbanization and economic growth of developing countries have spurred air pollution especially in road transport sector. The increasing demand of petroleum based fuels and their combustion in internal combustion (IC) engines have adverse effect on air quality, human health and global warming. Air pollution causes respiratory problems, adverse effects on pulmonary function, leading to increased sickness absenteeism and induces high health care service costs, premature birth and even mortality. Production of biofuels promises substantial improvement in air quality through reducing emission from biofuel operated automotives. Some of the developing countries have started biofuel production and utilization as transport fuel in local market. This paper critically reviews the facts and prospects of biofuel production and utilization in developing countries to reduce environmental pollution and petro dependency. Expansion of biofuel industries in developing countries can create more jobs and increase productivity by non-crop marginal lands and wastelands for energy crops plantation. Contribution of India and China in biofuel industry in production and utilization can dramatically change worldwide biofuel market and leap forward in carbon cut as their automotive market is rapidly increasing with a souring proportional rise of GHG emissions.

TI SOIL-EROSION IN DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES - A POLITICOECONOMIC EXPLANATION
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Soil erosion is accelerating in developing countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.  It has threatened the livelihood of millions of peasants, for agriculture is their economic mainstay.  A probe into the forces causing erosion reveals that the elite's resolve to accumulate ever more wealth and to maintain, consolidate, or expand their sociopolitical power and the necessity of the poor to fulfill their requirements of food, fuelwood, and fodder are the two major factors accelerating soil erosion.  Unless the vast masses of poor people are integrated into the national mainstream through the implementation of equitable and redistributive development policies, it is impossible to control the accelerating rate of soil erosion and thus to achieve the objective of sustainable development.

CL Chicago, IL
AB There has been much discussion of the role that recent advances in information and communication technologies (ICTs) could play in improving health systems in developing countries. There is no doubt that the advancement of ICTs has brought both brought opportunities and challenges to developing countries in their efforts to ensure socio-economic development and improve public governance. In the wake of globalization, developing countries have no choice but to take advantage of the opportunities and face the challenges. Despite the fact that many developing countries are taking actions to strengthen their ICT capabilities in both private and public sector organizations, the process has been limited mostly to national and provincial capitals leaving behind majority of the communities and institutions operating in remote areas.
   This paper took a case study of implementing computerized Health Information Systems (HIS) in the context of the Ethiopian public health care system and investigated the potentials of the new ICT based system and the challenges encountered at provincial and district levels. The findings also revealed that even those with access to modern ICT infrastructure do not get maximum benefit from ICT advancements due to inadequacies in data quality and lack of knowledge in data management and use for decision making and action. To this end, there is an urgent need for governments of most developing countries in general and for sub-Saharan African countries in particular to double their efforts to address constraints threatening to increase technology gap between urban minority and marginalized rural majority by setting up favorable policies and appropriate strategies. For example, the empirical analysis of this study revealed that in order to make IT-based systems work in the Ethiopian public health seating, there is an urgent need to develop proper strategies that took into account the local context.

TI How could emissions trading benefit developing countries
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB This paper aims to show how an emissions trading system could work if some participating entities are allocated an "emissions budget" or non-binding target. This will allow them to sell allowances if their actual emissions are less than their budget, but will not obligate them to buy allowances if their emissions exceed their budget. Different rules aiming at ensuring the environmental integrity of such a system are considered. Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change may wish to consider building a regime where developing countries are allocated emissions budgets on some provisions of the Kyoto Protocol and in full respect with the principles of the Convention. In any case such system would be complementary to the Clean Development Mechanism. The potential benefits would be
   to provide non-Annex-I (developing) countries with substantial capital inflows, and stimulate their economic growth;
   to allow Annex-I (Industrialised) Countries achieving their Kyoto commitments at the lowest possible cost;
   and to achieve global participation towards the objective of the Convention while reducing the risk of creating "'tropical hot air" by giving some developing countries more allowances than they need under a "business-as-usual'' scenario. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The ethical dilemma of sustainable development: Guyana
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide the ethical justification for an argument regarding compensatory sustainability programs in general and for small developing nations such as Guyana.
   Design/methodology/approach - This is a conceptual paper. A logical argument is presented and objections are analyzed.
   Findings - Compensatory sustainability programs can be seen to be justified by influential ethical theories such as Utilitarianism and Distributive Justice. Free market objections to compensatory sustainability initiatives are shown to be ethically and practically problematic.
   Research limitations/implications - While this is a conceptual study, further empirical research is needed regarding the interplay between the social, economic and ecological systems in developing countries, leading to the formulation of the specifics of practical legislation.
   Practical implications - The findings in this paper will lead to innovative policy decisions that will increase sustainable practices in small developing countries.
   Originality/value - During the Copenhagen climate change conference in 2009, it was agreed that developing countries should be compensated for their participation in sustainability initiatives. The ethical and theoretical parameters of this debate were not articulated in a sustained and comprehensive manner. The paper provides the theoretical underpinnings for compensatory sustainability programs in third world countries. In the context of defending their argument, the authors also examine larger philosophical issues regarding human nature in general and how these debates relate to the issues of sustainability and globalization.

TI Productive use of energy - Pathway to development? Reviewing the
   outcomes and impacts of small-scale energy projects in the global south
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB It is widely recognised that access to sustainable and affordable energy services is a crucial factor in reducing poverty and enhancing development. Accordingly, various positive effects beyond simple access to energy are associated with the implementation of sustainable energy projects. One of these assumed positive outcomes is the productive use of energy, which is expected to create value - for example in the form of increased local availability of goods or higher incomes - thereby having a positive impact on local livelihoods. Many projects and programmes are based on such expectations regarding the productive use of energy but systematic evidence of these outcomes and impacts is still limited. This study analyses the results of an impact evaluation of 30 small-scale energy development projects to better understand whether and how the supply of sustainable energy services supports productive use activities and whether these activities have the expected positive impacts on local livelihoods. A contribution analysis is applied to systematically evaluate the impact pathways for the productive use of energy. The results show that access to sustainable energy does not automatically result in productive activities and that energy is only one of the input factors required to foster socio-economic development. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that activities, materials and information to support the productive use of energy - such as training, equipment or market research - need to be an integrated part of the energy project itself to allow for productive activities to develop on a wider scale.

CY AUG 11, 1998
CL JOKIOINEN, FINLAND
AB On a global basis, livestock products - meat, milk, eggs and fibre - account for 40% of the value of total marketed agricultural product. Animal products provide essential amino acids, vitamins and minerals to help ensure nutritionally balanced diets. In developing countries, livestock traction and manure also contribute to food production through improved cultivation and soil fertility which increase crop yields. On average, the proportional contribution of livestock product to dietary calories and protein in developed countries is double that for developing countries. Demand for livestock products is fuelled by the population increase, income growth and urbanisation in developing countries. Therefore, over the past decade, consumption of livestock product has sharply increased in developing countries, while slightly decreasing in developed countries where consumption is already relatively high on average. Increased demand in developing countries increases income for producers, but also stresses the environment through pollution, soil erosion, overgrazing and deforestation. Research involving global partnerships of scientists and institutes can help ensure that the increased demands for livestock product in developing countries will be met in economically feasible and environmentally sustainable ways.

AB In different countries the growth of the middle class is considered as the main force of political and economic changes in society. On the basis of world experience, we can say that in a democratic society the formation and development of the middle class is considered the basis of the state, but in the authoritarian regime its is considered the main source of threat to the state or government. Studies show that there are socio-economic and political changes in the formation of the middle class in developing countries. Representatives of this class also act as a driving force in addressing important issues, such as increasing employment, creating new business areas, improving infrastructure, creating an attractive environment for mobilizing new resources and ensuring sustainable and proportional economic development for the long term period. In the paper factors affecting the formation of the middle class in developing countries will be grouped and their impact levels will be determined. At the same time, comparative analysis of the current situation in this area will be carried out, the characteristic features of formation of this layer in developing countries will be summarized and appropriate proposals will be given.

TI Sustainability reporting and bank performance after financial crisis
   Evidence from developed and developing countries
SO COMPETITIVENESS REVIEW
AB Purpose
   This study aims to examine the relationship between sustainability reporting and bank performance after financial crisis in developed and developing countries.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This study examines 882 banks from developed and developing countries covering 11 years after the 2008 financial crisis. The independent variable is environmental, social and governance (ESG) scores. The dependent variables are return on assets, return on equity and Tobin's Q. This study uses bank- and country-specific control variables to measure the relationship between sustainability reporting and bank performance.
   Findings
   The findings deduced from the empirical results demonstrate that ESG improves banks' accounting and market-based performance in developed countries, supporting value creation theory. Using pooling regression and instrumental variable - generalized method of moments, this study finds that ESG weakens banks' performance in developed and developing countries.
   Originality/value
   To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first study to investigate and compare the impact of sustainability reporting on banks' performance in developed and developing countries. The study found similarities in the impact of sustainability reporting and the improvement of banks' current and future performance.

TI FACTORS INFLUENCING THE ADOPTION OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES
   IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES: A REVIEW
SO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB Developing countries have seriously low adoption rates of sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs) and there is a need to understand why. This paper reviews 31 past studies focusing on the factors influencing the adoption of SAPs. Using a vote count methodology, SAPs adoption is revealed as a complex set of behaviors which depend on a range of socio-economic, agroecological, institutional, informational, psychological factors and perceived attributes. Identified within these six dimensions, male farmers, higher educational attainment levels, bigger farm size, steeper farms, and the presence of land right security emerge as common factors which often lead to adopt SAPs. These factors imply the general importance of economic motivations in facilitating sustainable farm management. In particular, gender, farm topography, and land tenure have a special role in the context of developing countries. These common factors, and other converged factors, lend support to drawing general policymaking guidelines by identifying the characteristics of potential adopters, promotion strategies, and effective communication channels. For effective local management, future research should consider a range of factors from multiple categories and identify the relative importance of statistically significant ones.

CL UDINE, ITALY
AB Over the years, diseases and epizootics have caused significant production losses to the East-growing aquaculture sector and to the natural aquatic populations in the wild. As a result, disease control and health management have been considered as key contributors to aquaculture sustainability. The risk of diseases and pathogen transfer through trans-boundary movement of infected animals, risk of aquatic environmental pollution, risk to human health and environment due to excessive use of chemicals and drugs, underdeveloped genetic improvement and broodstock management programmes, and lack of adequate knowledge on the role of good nutrition in aquatic animal health management have been identified as key constraints to realizing the full potential of aquaculture. Implementation of the 'systems-approach' has been recognized as an effective means of overcoming such constraints, and strong international cooperation is required to achieve this and the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (CCRF) provides a platform for such cooperation. Guidelines for the implementation of CCRF are envisaged to provide a range of technical, legal, and economic options and tools to the concerned parties to assist rectifying the above shortfalls. However, such technical guidelines, which could be practically applied within developing country situations, can only be developed once adequate information and appropriate technologies are available, and all stakeholders agree to cooperate and collaborate closely. Therefore, considering (a) the need for the developed countries to cooperate on the health management for sustainable aquaculture development in developing countries and (b) the role that the CCRF can play towards achieving responsible aquaculture, this paper describes the possible investment opportunities, which are mutually beneficial to both the developed and developing countries. It emphasizes in particular the collaboration on investment for development and transfer of technologies appropriate for developing countries.

TI Towards sustainable urban water services in developing countries:
   tariffs based on willingness-to-pay studies
SO URBAN WATER JOURNAL
AB Water supply and sanitation (WASH) service providers in most towns of developing countries, such as Godey Town in Ethiopia, the case study reported in this paper, deliver less than basic services. The costs for meeting the more ambitious WASH targets of the Sustainable Development Goals will be much higher than what has previously been invested in the sector. This study showed that a tariff structure designed using affordability and willingness-to-pay data would provide higher revenues than one solely based on estimated customers' affordability, or Ethiopian government's tariff guidelines. As in previous studies in Ethiopia, this study highlights government's low willingness-to-charge amidst a high customers' willingness-to-pay. Yet, there is need to increase water tariffs in developing countries, hence, moving towards financial sustainability and supplementing the other two Ts - taxes and transfers. Based on accurate and updated socio-economic data, the tariff can also be optimised to fulfil the social equity objective.

TI Non-linearities in the relationship between public debt and inequality
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB This paper examines the possible nonlinear relationship between public debt and income inequality. The literature extensively examines the non-linear growth effects of public debt, whereas its inequality effects are not investigated sufficiently. Public debt can be used to finance distributive policies, thereby improving income equality. However, high public debt levels can also harm economic growth and decrease the fiscal space due to sustainability concerns, high risk premia, and large debt service burden. Hence, it is possible that public debt can have non-linear effects on inequality. The empirical analysis documents that the relationship between public debt and inequality is positive with a declining marginal effect in the case of advanced countries. However, developing countries display a U-shape relationship, implying that public debt is initially associated with declines in inequality, while higher levels of debt are associated with higher levels of inequality. The analysis also shows that the determinants of inequality can differ greatly between advanced and developing countries.

TI Sea cucumber management strategies: challenges and opportunities in a
   developing country context
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
AB Sea cucumbers play a critical role in maintaining healthy marine ecosystems. Sea cucumbers are also a key source of income for millions of small-scale fishers worldwide. The lucrative nature of this industry has led to severe reductions in sea cucumber populations in numerous regions globally. A large proportion of sea cucumber fisheries are located in developing countries, which present unique challenges to management, including addressing highly decentralized methods of extraction and processing, limited economic and technological resources for governance and, in many cases, a high dependency on sea cucumbers as a primary source of income for small-scale coastal fishers. In this review, we review the benefits and challenges of seven categories of sea cucumber management strategies used globally in developing countries, including gear restrictions, size and weight limits, effort and catch controls, temporal closures, area closures, value chain licensing and territorial use rights in fisheries. We conclude that sea cucumber management in developing countries could benefit from focusing regulatory solutions on narrowed parts of the value chain, coupling production-based management strategies with processing and export regulations and providing avenues for local fishers to inform policy at the local, regional and national levels.

AB Adapting sustainability practices through extended enterprises has been deployed by academics and practitioners in order to gain not only long-term profits but also competitive advantages to embrace the global market. Profit organisations in developed countries have been comprehensively mature in adapting environmental and social sustainability in response to the consciousness of the society with regard to sustainable business. Since production-sites have been shifted to developing countries in the last three decades, nowadays enterprises in developing countries urge to implement planet and people sustainability indicators into their business operations. This research aims to instigate sustainability practices with respect to environmental, social, and economic aspects which are initially employed in the business performance of enterprises from developed nations in order to underline the opportunities for their implementation in developing countries. Empirical evidences is used to unveil people, planet, and profit sustainability criteria linked to supply chain management with a view to compare and contrast such criteria in business practice implementation. This research suggests that the size of enterprises and country classification lead to maturity in adopting sustainability business practices.

TI Stakeholders' perspective on strategies to promote contaminated site
   remediation and brownfield redevelopment in developing countries:
   empirical evidence from Pakistan
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Due to the potential of reducing negative outcomes of brownfields on environment and contribution to urban sustainability, brownfield redevelopment (BR) gained considerable recognition in the more recent era. Comprehensive literature shows that many studies proposed strategies to promote BR in developed nations; however, studies focusing on developing economies are scarce. Therefore, this study intends to identify significant strategies to promote BR in developing countries by taking the case of Pakistan. A comprehensive literature review and expert opinion were commenced to identify potential strategies. Data were collected from the main stakeholders involved in BR process through an empirical questionnaire. The findings revealed that "Low-interest loans and subsidies with the collaboration of government and financial institutions," "Standardized definition, guidelines, and simplified brownfield process," "Development of technical and infrastructure support," "Create investors interest," "Strengthening remediation technologies R&D" were the five most important strategies to promote BR in Pakistan. Theoretically, the novelty of the current study is to highlight the key strategies to promote BR in developing countries. Practically, the study facilitates governments, urban policymakers, environmentalists, and stakeholders to propose and implement appropriate strategies for promoting BR. Future studies can consider modeling the interactions between strategies and their impact on BR adoption.

TI Key global climate governance problems and Chinese countermeasures
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF POPULATION RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Presently, the full implementation of the negotiations and collaborations under the Paris Agreement faces new key problems and severe challenges. These problems and challenges include the following: how to honor the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities" to facilitate a comprehensive, balanced, and effective implementation of the key elements of the Paris Agreement, such as adaptation, mitigation, finance, technology, capacity building, and transparency; how to uphold and maintain the status of China and other emerging countries as developing countries in light of the requirements of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the historical responsibilities of these countries; and how to assess the goal of limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C and what constitutes an equitable carbon mitigation pathway for different types of countries. Developed countries and developing countries have drastically diverging views on carbon border adjustment measures for trade with developing countries proposed by several developed countries such as the European Union. Developed countries have demonstrated obvious intentions and actions designed to weaken and neglect the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities", to impose mitigation pressure on developing countries, to shift the responsibilities for emissions onto others, and to pass on the costs of mitigation. The maneuvering among different types of countries and interest groups has become increasingly intense. In response, China must maintain its strategic focus, adhere to the goals and principles established by the Paris Agreement, stick to its strategic positioning as a developing country, solidify strategic support from the developing world, and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries. China played a conducive role in facilitating the Paris Agreement and has become an active participant, contributor, and leader in global climate governance. China must continue to follow Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and its conception of ecological civilization and the concept of building a community of common destiny, to actively lead the cooperation process in the construction of a global climate governance system characterized by equity, justice, and win-win collaborations, and to promote compliance with the Paris Agreement. At the same time, China should accelerate the green, low-carbon, circular transformation of its economy; accelerate the coordinated governance of the economy, environment, and climate change; and formulate and implement a long-term low-carbon development strategy. By the middle of the 21st century, while achieving the goal of building a great modern socialist country, China can also achieve a deep decarbonization development path that is in line with the goal of limiting the global temperature increase to well below 2 degrees C and pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees C.

TI Economic impacts of policies affecting crop biotechnology and trade
SO NEW BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Agricultural biotechnologies, and especially transgenic crops, have the potential to boost food security in developing countries by offering higher incomes for farmers and lower priced and better quality food for consumers. That potential is being heavily compromised, however, because the European Union and some other countries have implemented strict regulatory systems to govern their production and consumption of genetically modified (GM) food and feed crops, and to prevent imports of foods and feedstuffs that do not meet these strict standards. This paper analyses empirically the potential economic effects of adopting transgenic crops in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. It does so using a multi-country, multi-product model of the global economy. The results suggest the economic welfare gains from crop biotechnology adoption are potentially very large, and that those benefits are diminished only very slightly by the presence of the European Union's restriction on imports of GM foods. That is, if developing countries retain bans on GM crop production in an attempt to maintain access to EU markets for non-GM products, the loss to their food consumers as well as to farmers in those developing countries is huge relative to the slight loss that could be incurred from not retaining EU market access.

TI Green human resource management and environmental performance: The role
   of green innovation and environmental strategy in a developing country
SO BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB A vast literature supports the notion that green human resource management leads to superior environmental performance. This study argues that green innovation, environmental strategy and pro-environmental behaviour facilitate the relationship between green human resource management and environmental performance in the manufacturing industry of developing countries. To test the mediating effect of green innovation and pro-environmental behaviour alongside the moderating role of environmental strategy in the proposed model, we collected and analysed data from 410 manufacturing firm managers operating in Pakistan using partial least square structural equation modelling. The mediating and moderating results highlighted the significance of green innovation, environmental strategy and pro-environmental behaviour to excel in environmental performance through operational efficiency, appropriate environmental strategy and human willingness to indulge in environmental activities. The findings also suggest implications for theory and practice in similar developing countries. The study offers generalisability in developing countries sharing the same economic and social structure.

AB Proceeding from Moravcsik's paradigmatic ideas of how to build indigenous capability and sustainable science systems in developing countries, we attempted to further focus on the peculiarities of the twenty-first century and the new challenges of globalisation. In doing so, we selected three particular topics deemed relevant in this context: increase of international visibility and reception by the international community, international collaboration and the participation in research in emerging fields. We analysed these issues using the example of 16 developing countries and emerging economies. We found that several countries achieve an impressive citation impact with a considerable share of highly cited papers. The high impact proved to be associated with international collaboration. We also found two extreme situations in international collaboration, both of which might form challenges in building sustainable national science systems and research structures. Research activity in emerging research topics, finally, showed the presence of developing countries in highly topical research and their capability to contribute also to newest research trends.

AB This paper evaluates the potential of transition economies for achieving sustainable improvements in living standards vis-a-vis developing countries based on their productivity performance. The comparison is made using a bootstrapped Malmquist productivity index and its technological and efficiency change components. The results of estimation indicate that transition economies enjoy significantly higher increases in technical efficiency than developing countries with comparable rates of real GDP growth. Therefore, these results suggest that the former group of countries may have better growth prospects than the latter group, giving empirical support to Stern and Fries' (Foreign Policy 111: 164-165, 1998) optimism that transition economies are the "tiger" economies of tomorrow.

SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB To reduce the effects of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and achieve Sustainable Development Goals, financial resources and renewable energy are utilized in developing countries in Asia. Moderate economic development and renewable energy effects have determined the environmental impacts. The cross-sectional dependency second-generation stationary test and CS-ARDL approach were used to analyze the data from 2005 to 2021 from developing countries, which showed that institutional quality decreased negative environmental externality while globalization increased it. The environmental externalities produced by human capital and renewable energy are raised by both globalization and institutional quality. The effects of modifiers on evolution were quantified using dynamic elasticity measurements. Based on the findings of this study, a policy framework centered on the SDGs is advised.

TI The Role of Institution on FDI and Environmental Pollution Nexus:
   Evidence from Developing Countries
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB The research aim is to empirically study the role of institutions in the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) and environmental pollution in 86 developing countries during 2008-2018. This study collects key data from the World Development Indicators (WDI). Institution indicators are collected from the Global Governance Indicators (WGI). To carry out the research objectives, the authors conducted quantitative analysis through System Generalized Method of Moments (S-GMM). The research results indicate that FDI positively impacts on environmental pollution. In particular, governmental efficiency, political stability and non-violence, quality regulations, the rule of law and the voice and accountability play an important role in the FDI-environmental pollution nexus in developing countries. The findings of this study suggest that these countries in question need to consider very carefully welcoming FDI inflows. In other words, host governments should build 'filter funnel' to attract FDI for long-term development. Moreover, they also have to manage strictly foreign invested enterprises domestically in order to minimize negative impacts on environment quality. For a stable governance environment, each country must strictly follow international environmental agreements, and people and businesses must comply with environmental regulations and raise awareness of environmental protection as the foundation for economic growth and environmental sustainability.

SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The purpose of this article is to comprehensively describe the impact of sustainability strategic planning and management (SSPM) on organisational sustainable performance in a developing country context. A mixed method approach was adopted; data were collected using an interview and a survey targeting 126 organisations operating in the foremost polluting Palestinian manufacturing private sectors. The analyses were conducted employing thematic analysis and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The results from data analysis confirm that SSPM had a positive effect on the three dimensions of organisational sustainable performance (i.e. social, ecological and economic). Furthermore, the paper has developed a framework to facilitate integrating SSPM into the business model of manufacturing organisations in a developing country context. This paper is considered among the very few studies exploring the 'questioned' impacts of SSPM on organisational sustainable performance in a developing country.

AB Mitigating environmental deterioration and curbing CO2 emissions has moved center stage in policy debate and academic research. Employing data from 14 developing countries with a large share of carbon emissions at a global scale, we examine the effect of human capital on environmental deterioration over the period 1980 to 2019. We account for human capital by focusing on current education expenditure to offer a better insight into the role of policy making in averting environmental deterioration in developing countries. Results show that human capital advancement is robustly associated with reductions in CO2 emissions. We additionally provide a comprehensive analysis of the human capital-environmental deterioration nexus along the conditional distribution by employing the Machado and Silva (J Econom 213(1):145-173, 2019) estimation method of quantile regressions with fixed effects. Human capital is affecting CO2 emissions negatively and statistically significantly across the distribution, except for the upper tail.

TI The impacts of economic globalization on agricultural value added in

SO PLOS ONE
AB Countries in the world have various indices for the implementation of economic globalization (EG). This refers to positive and negative impacts arising from its implementation, especially in agriculture. This sector is still a basic source of existence in developing countries. At the same time, these countries have been unable to optimize their agricultural value-added (AVA) and only earn a low level of income. That way, developing countries need to take advantage of EG to increase income from agricultural exports and farmers' welfare. Other than that, there has been no study examining the impacts of EG on AVA in developing countries. So, this study intends to evaluate the impacts of the exchange rates, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, total agricultural export values, agricultural import duties, and fertilizer imports on AVA in developing countries. The panel data technique is used to assess its impact in 17 developing countries during 2006-2018. The study showed that FDI inflows and agricultural export values increase AVA in developing countries. In this study, EG positively impacts developing countries, but its implementation must pay attention to achieve sustainable development goals. We recommend developing countries focus on investments in human capital and technologies (or R&D), ensure foreign investors collaborate with local agricultural firms, increase agricultural exports, and create a conducive economic system

However, in such countries the development and management of nature-based tourism destinations are bedeviled by structural and operational limitations in local planning processes. The Malaysian experience provides a salient case in point. This article outlines the problems and constraints facing local and national decision makers during the development and promotion of nature-based tourism in the State of Perlis. Three key governance issues constraining the effective development of natural tourism opportunities are discussed. These issues are identified as (1) weaknesses of government policies, (2) disorganized administration systems, and (3) limited operational budget. The article proposes that in order for the State of Perlis to pursue and develop a sustainable nature-based tourism industry these issues must be urgently addressed.

AB Sustainable development presents particular challenges for developing countries, where the need for rapid economic development to overcome poverty and inequality often makes environmental protection a low priority. Market-based instruments (MBIs), which make it possible for environmental considerations to be built into everyday economic decision-making, and for environmental objectives to be achieved at the lowest possible cost to society, may be appropriate policy instruments for addressing these types of challenges. However, despite their potential advantages in the developing country context, MBIs may not always be appropriate for developing countries, and should not be seen as panaceas that can simply be transferred to developing countries without considering local circumstances. By way of example, this paper reviews the use of MBIs for solid waste management in South Africa, and presents results from a survey of waste management authorities regarding the opportunities and constraints associated with their implementation. It is found that a number of fundamentals need to be put in place before MBIs can be implemented. However, this does not imply that the potential of MBIs should be ignored. Indeed, it is proposed that MBIs can be designed and implemented in an innovative, incremental way whereby capacity and experience are gradually developed over time.

This systematic review of reviews determines and summarizes ICTD research trends, and methodologies and conceptual frameworks used in ICTD research discuss the findings and evidence and then suggest approaches for further research. We reviewed existing systematic reviews published on ICT and development between January 1990 and July 2017. The review of reviews shows that a growing number of ICTD research works have used qualitative research approaches for data collection and analysis. We note several attempts to develop and apply models/frameworks over explanatory and predictive theories, most notably in the area of social, sociotechnical, and technical. Nevertheless, there is limited evidence on the long-term contribution of ICT use on livelihoods, patterns of economic inequality, human freedom, and well-being in developing countries. This review of reviews synthesizes existing systematic reviews on the contribution of ICT for development than was previously available for developing countries. This review has the potential for several stakeholders, including the public and private sector, intermediaries, and nonprofit organizations, to utilize the accumulated evidence from selected systematic reviews to enable/improve the appropriate and sustainable use of ICTs for development.

TI Globalization and Paradoxes of Ethical Transnational Production: Code of
   Conduct in a Chinese Workplace
SO COMPETITION & CHANGE
AB Neo-liberal economic globalization and acceleration in information and communication technologies have strengthened the competitiveness of transnational corporations by making it easier for them to stretch their global commodity chains to developing countries. Such control from a distance threatens national states' capacity to regulate TNCs and their impact upon environment, labour and human rights in developing countries. This has prompted anti-TNC sentiments and campaigns that challenge brand-named TNCs on labour exploitation in the south. These changes have triggered discussions on setting labour standards in the international arena. With the WTO distancing itself from the 'social clause', this has prompted the TNCs, NGOs and other stakeholders to self-regulate by introducing codes of conduct. Concentrating on the clothing industry, this paper examines the emergence of company and multi-stakeholder codes of conduct that require the involvement of subcontractors and NGOs in developing countries. The moving of ethical codes to developing countries condenses and reproduces, under the twin pressures of competitiveness and social auditing, the paradoxes of ethical transnational production in the internal organizations of local firms. These paradoxes are demonstrated from a case study of a workplace in China. The paper ends by outlining three paradoxes and commenting on the development of a managerialist 'audit culture' in workplace practices as commodification of ethical code.

TI Meat production in developing countries
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NUTRITION SOCIETY
CT Symposium on Meat or Wheat for the Next Millennium
CY JUN 29-JUL 02, 1998
CL UNIV SURREY, GUILDFORD, ENGLAND
HO UNIV SURREY
AB Developing countries have very diverse food consumption patterns and agricultural production systems. The proportion of meat in national diets varies from negligible in some countries in central Africa to 30-40% in some countries in Latin America and Mongolia. However, the demand for meat in developing countries is increasing rapidly (53 %/year from 1982 to 1993), as the result of population growth and the trend for people to move to the cities. Growth rates in consumption are greatest in Asia, with China dominating the statistics, in view of the size of its population. Theoretically, livestock production can be increased to meet this demand, but the multiple roles of livestock in developing countries must be recognized if this is to be achieved in a sustainable manner. Resource-poor farmers who keep livestock may value more highly their contribution to livelihoods and to crop production, through provision of draught power and improvements in soil fertility through the recycling of manure, than the production of more meat. Recognition of the goals of the farmer and the wishes of the consumer regarding meat quality need to be reflected in the way in which opportunities for increasing meat production are identified and communicated to farmers. The impact of the global economy on cereal prices, for example, will also influence which interventions will be economically viable. Interpretation of information in an integral manner, using geographical information systems, mathematical models and/or simple spreadsheet models will be an important ingredient in turning scientific knowledge into increased meat production in developing countries.

TI How do clean fuels and technology-based energy poverty affect carbon
   emissions? New evidence from eighteen developing countries
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Clean fuels and technology-based energy is an essential source to achieve sustainable economic growth and development. Therefore, the relationship between all types of poverty and other socioeconomic indicators has been studied extensively; nevertheless, clean fuels and technology-based energy poverty, adjusted for carbon emissions, has not been studied. The current study examines the impact of clean fuels and technology-based energy poverty on carbon emissions (Co2e). Using System-Generalized Method of Movement (SGMM) estimators, this study utilized panel data from eighteen developing countries in Asia from 2006 to 2017. The empirical findings obtained from econometric model suggest the presence of clean fuels and technology-based energy poverty and its curse on environment, i.e., energy poverty positively affects Co2e growth in Asian developing countries. Furthermore, economic growth (GDP), trade, and population are also positively associated with Co2e growth and negatively affect environmental quality. Based on the empirical findings of the current study, we recommend robust policy implications that the governments of targeted countries should invest more to increase clean fuels and technologies.

TI The role of renewable energy consumption and commercial services trade
   in carbon dioxide reduction: Evidence from 25 developing countries
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB Developing countries play a dominant role in global carbon emissions. This study, for the first time, uses a panel of 25 major developing countries during the years 1996-2012 to explore the role of renewable energy consumption and commercial services trade in generating carbon emissions. The share and size of renewables consumption are both analysed for comparison purpose. Granger causality tests show that long-run bidirectional Granger causalities exist between economic growth, renewable energy consumption, international commercial services trade, and carbon emissions. Panel co-integration tests identify that long-run equilibrium exist between analysis variables. We also apply fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) and dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) for panel estimates. The Empirical results indicate that economic growth has significant effects on carbon emissions; the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis is verified; increasing the share of renewable energy consumption contributes to carbon reduction; increasing the size of renewable energy consumption contrarily raised emissions; expanding commercial services trade could reduce carbon emissions. Our findings suggest that developing countries should promote commercial services trade and the share of renewable energy consumption for low-carbon economic growth.

TI Public Debt, Economic Growth, and Public Sector Management in Developing
   Countries: Is There a Link?
SO PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT
AB The article investigates whether differences in public sector management quality affect the link between public debt and economic growth in developing countries. For this purpose, we primarily use the World Bank's institutional indices of public sector management (PSM). Using PSM thresholds, we split our panel into country clusters and make comparisons. Our linear baseline regressions reveal a significant negative relationship between public debt and growth. The various robustness exercises that we perform also confirm these results. When we dissect our data set into weak and strong county clusters using public sector management scores, however, we find different results. While public debt still displayed a negative relationship with growth in countries with weak public sector management quality, it generally displayed a positive relationship in the latter group. The tests for non-linearity shows evidence of an inverse-U-shape relationship between public debt and economic growth. However, we fail to see a similar significant relationship on country clusters that account for PSM quality. Yet, countries with well-managed public sectors demonstrate a higher public debt sustainability threshold. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Market-based incentives in developing countries: geographical
   dispersion, antecedents and implications of the Clean Development
   Mechanism
SO CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT
AB The implementation of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) provides a flexible market-based incentive for addressing environmental risk in developing countries. While there has been a significant amount of ex-ante anecdotal and qualitative research regarding the CDM, there has been little ex-post, quantitative analysis of its antecedents based on a levelized comparison across developing countries. This article provides a quantitative analysis of CDM dispersion worldwide and investigates the relationship between the CDM and the overall host country governance, economic and social environment. Using multivariate regression analysis on a levelized basis, we find the Human Development Index to be a strong determinant of the CDM. This suggests the importance of non-economic factors and the need to tailor market-based instruments to the host country's level of social development. One-size-fits-all approach to reducing emissions in developing countries will not be effective to all countries.

TI USING THE DELPHI METHOD FOR DETERMINING CRITERIA IN AGROFORESTRY
   RESEARCH PLANNING IN DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES
SO AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB Planning agroforestry research programs requires the participation of people from many disciplines. They may have different interests in allocating financial resources for research purposes and, therefore. the decision-making is complex. Guidelines are needed to improve the decision-making process. Such guidelines may include a fist of weighted criteria identified by experts through group processes. This study used a qualitative approach (the Delphi method) to identify criteria to be used when planning agroforestry research programs in the developing countries. The panel of respondents was comprised of agroforestry experts who have experience and expertise in the developing countries. Fourteen (14) criteria were identified in questionnaire 1. These criteria were ranked in questionnaires 2 and 3. A Friedman test of analysis of variance followed by a Mann-Whitney U test of pairwise comparison produced four groups of criteria: group 1, the most highly ranked, comprises local people's needs, sustainability, adoptability and research quality; group 2 includes existing systems and economic criteria; group 3 encompasses biophysical effects, institutional capabilities, partnership and transferability; and group 4, the least ranked. includes diversity of products, tree/crop interface, flexibility and species selection. A Kruskal-Wallis test on each criterion and several respondent characteristics showed that the respondent characteristics of current work, highest degree held, ecosystem experience, geographic area of experience, and number of years experience influenced respondent criteria rankings. The test was not significant for background and respondent origin characteristics.

TI 'THEY SHOULD BE GRATEFUL TO GOD': CHALLENGING CHILDREN'S PRE-CONCEPTIONS
   OF THE GLOBAL SOUTH THROUGH HUMAN RIGHTS EDUCATION
SO POLICY & PRACTICE-A DEVELOPMENT EDUCATION REVIEW
AB This article proposes the value of using human rights as a foundation for exploring development issues in the classroom. The article draws on research exploring children's engagement with issues of global justice. The research was conducted with seven to nine year olds in three school settings in the Dublin area. The research explored children's responses to photographs set in different global contexts and to the concepts of money, fairness, decision making and the environment. The findings highlight a tendency amongst the participant children to characterise poverty as extreme deprivation, to marry their understandings of poverty and of developing countries so that one is synonymous with the other and to perceive the relationship between Ireland and developing countries principally in charitable terms. The findings further indicate that, for some children, there was an expectation that people living in developing countries should show gratitude where they have basic facilities, perceiving these facilities as exceptional in developing contexts. Human Rights Education (HRE) provides a basis from which to address these problematic assumptions and perspectives. Promoting universal entitlement to civil, political, cultural, social as well as economic rights, it provides a premise against which these preconceptions can be challenged. This article proposes that HRE might be used to re-orientate children's conceptualisations of 'developing countries', advancing perspectives rooted in solidarity and universalism.

TI Convergence Between Developed and Developing Countries: A Centennial
   Perspective
SO SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB Are countries at a low level of socio-economic development catching up with developed countries over time or rather falling further behind? Existing work on the subject is not conclusive, partially due to methodological differences. The aim of the paper is to carry out a broader analysis with longer time series and a more diverse set of indicators. The study divides countries of the world into 21 developed "benchmark" countries and 156 developing countries. The distance between the benchmark and developing countries is measured using the "time lags" method, applied here to nine indicators covering topics such as the economy, health, education and the environment. The study further utilizes a probabilistic approach to extrapolate missing historical data for developing countries, so that the analysis can cover a full century starting in 1920 and ending with short-term projections to year 2020. The study finds that a majority of developing countries, and the population-weighted developing world as a whole, has reduced its lag in most indicators between 1920 and 2020. Progress was unevenly distributed, with East Asian and European countries converging the most with the benchmark, while most African countries have diverged along with some American ones. Catch-up in education attainment and life expectancy has been more successful than in infant survival rate, GDP per capita or technology adoption. The findings are put in context of United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, showing how the time lag method could improve setting targets for some of the goals. Further, time lags are used to analyze the current demographic, economic and political situation of developing countries, identifying opportunities and risks for future catch-up with developed countries.

TI Marine Stewardship Council sustainability certification in developing
   countries: Certifiability and beyond in Kerala, India and The Gambia,
   West Africa
SO MARINE POLICY
AB The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) features small-scale and developing country fisheries prominently in promoting its sustainability program, yet the problem of low levels of certification in developing country fisheries is a long-standing and important issue in marine policy. The objective of this paper is to better understand small-scale, developing country fishery experiences with the oldest fisheries certification program globally. It does so primarily through a comparative case study of fisheries that were among the first in their wider regions to engage the program. The paper assesses fisheries in Kerala, India, and The Gambia, West Africa, detailing the evolution of engagement with MSC sustainability certification. Analytically, the paper assesses experiences, successes and frustrations in these cases across ecological, economic, social, and institutional dimensions-categories that have gained widespread appeal in sustainability studies. The paper finds that what makes a fishery certifiable or uncertifiable is not just levels of performance against the sustainability certification standard but also a broader range of relations and interactions that influence paths of development and change in fisheries. We, therefore, call for more explicitly integrated and critical explanatory social science and interdisciplinary evaluations of fisheries certifiability, broadly understood as impacted by diverse ecological, social, economic and political factors and relationships. Technical certifiability, social-ecological certifiability, and uncertifiability will be introduced to broaden our understanding.

TI A justice and wellbeing centered framework for analysing energy poverty
   in the Global South
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB Approximately one billion people in the Global South, a large proportion of which reside in rural sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian sub-continent, live without access to electricity. Meanwhile, there is a growing appreciation of the vital role that energy access plays in advancing human wellbeing. This is epitomised by the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal Seven, which ambitiously aspires to achieve universal access to modern energy by 2030. I argue that while such global initiatives represent important normative pursuits, their technical orientation tends to occlude consideration of issues relating to justice in energy systems. Drawing upon recent critical scholarship, I demonstrate how issues of distributive, recognition and procedural injustice are generated in the course of provisioning energy services for populations in the Global South. I argue that a failure to recognise and address these injustices has negative consequences for the wellbeing of several populations, including future generations. In order to better elucidate these issues in Global South contexts, I build upon Brand-Correa & Steinberger's (2017) analytical energy-wellbeing framework to include an ethical imperative to ensure energy justice when provisioning energy services. The paper concludes with three avenues for future research that can help mobilise this analytical framework in practice.

TI An outlook of end-use energy demand based on a clean energy and
   technology transformation of the household sector in Nepal
SO ENERGY
AB About two-thirds of Nepal's final energy is consumed by households. Traditional solid biomass constitutes most of the households' energy needs, and cooking is by far their most important energy consuming activity. This paper analyzes household energy use patterns in Nepal through the year 2051 based on a bottom-up simulation accounting framework for seven provinces and the capital city, differentiated by rural and urban areas and seven end-uses. Six scenarios involving different growth paths for socio-economic and energy system development are considered. Unlike in developed economies, the study finds that country's household energy demand will continue to rise in the future, but it is heterogeneous across the provinces. With the government's recent SDG7 initiatives, electricity is expected to play a key role in the household's future energy mix, although biomass use will remain significant but in declining trends. The study also identifies priority provinces where additional action is needed to improve access to clean and affordable modern energy services. Assertive policy initiatives are needed beyond 2030 to pursue clean energy market establishments and end-use technological developments for the expected growth of household clean energy demand.

Heated discussion has risen in how to comply with such a goal and how should energy policy drive the needed actions.
   Mitigation of the effects of climate change has been mainly in the center of the discussion everywhere, however adaptation to climate change effects is probably the key element if the premise that the earth's temperature will continue to increase before mankind can effectively change current GHG trends.

TI A Capabilities-Led Approach to Assessing Technological Solutions for a
   Rural Community
SO ENERGIES
AB To improve access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy in rural areas of the global south, off-grid systems using renewable generation and energy storage are often proposed. However, solution design is often technology-driven, with insufficient consideration of social and cultural contexts. This leads to a risk of unintended consequences and inappropriate systems that do not meet local needs. To address this problem, this paper describes the application of a capabilities-led approach to understanding a community's multi-dimensional energy poverty and assessing their needs as they see them, in order to better design suitable technological interventions. Data were collected in Tlamacazapa, Mexico, through site visits and focus groups with men and women. These revealed the ways in which constrained energy services undermined essential capabilities, including relating to health, safety, relationships and earning a living, and highlighted the specific ways in which improved energy services, such as lighting, cooking and mechanical power could improve capabilities in the specific context of Tlamacazapa. Based on these findings, we propose some potential technological interventions to address these needs. The case study offers an illustration of an assessment method that could be deployed in a variety of contexts to inform the design of appropriate technological interventions.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
CT Conference on Market Challenges of Fuel Cell Commercialisation
CY SEP 12-13, 2002
CL BERLIN, GERMANY
AB Fuel cells are still in development as power generation technologies. They are potentially efficient and low-emissions power generation technologies with a wide range of applications. Their deployment world wide and in developing countries in particular could result in mitigation of future greenhouse gas emissions and possibly other environmental and social benefits. The economics of the systems and their competitiveness with other power generation systems will be heavily dependent on local costs and infrastructure.
   Modelling, based energy demand projection and on fuel cell demand curves derived from expert interviews, suggests that worldwide, projected future cost reductions in fuel cells could result in fuel cell penetration of up to 50% of the world distributed generation market by 2020. This penetration, coupled with the use of a mix of low-carbon fuels, such as natural gas, would result in significant avoided emissions Of CO2 over the same period.
   Also, a comparison of the levelised costs of generation for the Philippines and South Africa suggests that some fuel cell technologies could become competitive with centralised generation within the next decade.
   Assuming that fuel cell durability can be demonstrated, the potential for fuel cells to be introduced into distributed generation in certain developing countries appears high, from a technical, economic and environmental perspective.

TI From perceptual corporate sustainability to customer loyalty: a

SO ECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAZIVANJA
AB The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of customer-based perceptual corporate sustainability on customer loyalty in a comparative manner, in four important industries (mobile telecommunications services, retail banking services, dairy products and personal care products) in a developing country. A consumer survey was implemented among a sample of 1464 consumers from the urban area of a developing European country. Our research reveals that customer-based perceptual corporate sustainability significantly and positively impacts customer loyalty in all investigated industries, with a stronger impact in retail banking services and a lower one in the case of personal care products. The research identifies those perceptual corporate sustainability dimensions which significantly impact customer loyalty and on which companies should focus within their marketing communication in order to increase customer loyalty. The paper brings relevant multi-sectorial insights, filling a regional knowledge gap, in the particular socio-cultural and economic context of a developing country, and thinking forward the general theoretical knowledge regarding the relationship between customer loyalty and perceptual corporate sustainability as complex constructs. Moreover, by using a quasi-exhaustive manner to conceptualise corporate sustainability, this paper complements previous research on the topic, in which corporate sustainability was constructed narrowly, within limited conceptual frameworks.

AB Trade policy barriers and high transaction costs hinder developing countries from taking the full advantages of the global trading system. In order to help developing countries overcome the problem, the World Trade Organization (WTO) launched the Aid for Trade (AFT) initiatives in its Ministerial Conference held in Hong Kong in 2005. We examine the effects of AFT inflows on bilateral trade costs facing 133 developing countries while accounting for differences in their location on the contours of various measures of institutional quality. Our results from the estimation of a mixed effects (random-intercept and random-coefficient) model indicate that institutional quality significantly affects the extent to which AFT reduces bilateral trade costs. An important policy implication of our findings is that an economically robust and sustainable reduction in bilateral trade costs facing developing countries requires the presence of both promulgated and effectively functioning institutions such as regulatory power and the rule of law.

TI Ensuring environmental inclusion in developing countries: the role of
   macroeconomic policies
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB In every society, there exist disadvantaged groups who have failed constantly to take part in the development of the economy and reap the benefits of economic growth as well. Along with economic and social factors, environmental factors are also accountable in making inclusion a challenge for the marginalized group. Contaminated drinking water, inappropriate sanitation systems, and pollution are the factors that affect health and wellbeing of the poor class by affecting their productivity. Thus, the lack of a clean environment leads the poor section towards further poverty and income inequality. Since the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development emphasizes three components to achieve sustainable development, namely economic, social, and environmental, this study inspects the role of macroeconomic policies in ensuring an inclusive clean environment in developing countries. Moreover, it considers the composite effect of fiscal policy and monetary policy on environmental inclusion by including interactive terms. This investigation uses FE-2SLS on a panel of 51 developing countries for the period of 1995-2019 to analyse the impact of macroeconomic policies on environmental inclusion. The study provides empirical evidence that fiscal and monetary policy has the potential to ensure an inclusive clean environment in developing countries. The findings imply that the macroeconomic policy actions depend on each other. Furthermore, governments in developing regions are required to cut nondeveloping expenditures and use expansionary monetary policy to promote green growth.

TI The spillover effects of outward FDI on environmental sustainability in
   developing countries: exploring the channels of home country
   institutions and human capital
SO ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB Foreign direct investments (FDI)-induced environmental effects have become a crucial and frequently discussed issue that has attracted the attention of the international community. On this account, several studies have examined FDI and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission relationship but with focus on the environmental impact of FDI inflow for host countries. While the strand of study examining CO2 emissions and outward FDI relationship are scarce, the mediating mechanism of home country's institution and human capital level in outward FDI-CO2 relationship remains unexplored. This study aims to fill this research gap by using the extended Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) framework, for a panel of 86 developing countries. Findings revealed that national institutions facilitate outward FDI reverse technology spillover effects to reinforce its effectiveness in mitigating carbon emission via environmentally friendly technologies. However, high human capital level shows to strengthen the quality of home country institutions which in turn facilitate more outward FDI spillover that improves environmental quality. Furthermore, overseas direct investment spillovers promote high human capital level in home countries to encourage green technological capabilities and innovations that boosts cleaner production strategies toward environmental sustainability goals. The study supports Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis which validates the non-monotonic inverted-U-shape relationship between CO2 emissions and per capita GDP. On policy recommendation, developing countries should prioritize human capital development and update local institutions to facilitate new and advanced technologies that enhances sustainability.

TI Potential of mathematical model-based decision making to promote
   sustainable performance of agriculture in developing countries: A review
   article
SO HELIYON
AB In developing countries like Ethiopia, agriculture takes the leading role in the economy and enhancing the efficiency of agriculture resource decision making remains essential to eradicate extreme poverty through promoting sustainable agricultural production. Recent economic growth efforts in agriculture dependent economies are aggravating to further natural resource degradation, environmental pollution, and climate change. One of the main challenges is the use of inefficient conventional land use decision-making. Conventional land use decision making refers to the practice of traditional land use decision-making, which is inefficient to capture spatial and temporal land use decision dynamics and trade-offs. This paper reviewed existing literatures on decision-making models in agriculture targeting to document the potential of mathematical model-based decision making to enhance the sustainable performance of agriculture in developing countries compared to the existing conventional agricultural practice decision approach. From over 400 literatures collected from the Google Scholar search engine; 63 articles were selected for the synthesis. The literatures were screened through inclusion and exclusion criteria. Literatures that used any mathematical model as a decision support tool in agriculture and related sectors, included a clear description of the model type, aim of the study, the key attribute characterizing the application of the model, decision support system, and output were included in the review. The synthesis result uncovered that with varying degrees of impact, flexibility, and complexity, mathematical model-based land use decision making has greater potential to enhance sustainable performance of agriculture and resource use efficiency in developing countries.

TI Integrating energy access, efficiency and renewable energy policies in
   sub-Saharan Africa: a model-based analysis
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB The role of energy in social and economic development is recognised by sustainable development goal 7 that targets three aspects of energy access: ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services, substantially increase the share of renewable energy, and double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency. With the projected increase in population, income and energy access in sub-Saharan Africa, demand for energy services is expected to increase. This increase can be met through increasing the supply while at the same time improving households' energy efficiency. In this paper, we explore the interactions between the three SDG7 targets by applying two integrated assessment models, IMAGE and MESSAGE, that incorporate socio-economic heterogeneity of the end-user. The results of the study depict the synergistic relationships between the three SDG7 objectives. Relative to pursuing only the universal access target, integration of all three targets could (a) reduce residential final energy consumption by up to 25%, enabling the use of mini-grid and stand-alone systems to provide better energy services, (b) cut annual energy-use-related residential emissions by a third, and (c) lower energy related investments by up to 30% to save scarce finance.

TI Energy in the development strategy of Indian households-the missing half
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB There is a growing consensus that universalization of modern energy services is central to reducing major elements of poverty and hunger, to increase literacy and education, and to improve health care, employment opportunities, and lives of women and children. In India, as per 2011 census, over 700 million people lack access to modern energy services for lighting, cooking, water pumping and other productive purposes. Devoid of these services people, mostly women, are forced to spend significant amounts of their time and effort on subsistence activities like firewood collection, carrying these head load for miles, and then burning these hard earned fuels inefficiently in traditional chullas. These adversely affect the health and standard of living for women and act as a barrier to gender development (here 'gender' means women unless otherwise specified). Although the links between gender inequity, poverty, and energy deprivation have been studied by many, not many practical solutions to the above problems have emerged. The present paper explores the nexus among gender-energy-poverty, highlights areas of gender concern, and suggests actions. We analyze how women from rural areas and low income households are at the receiving ends of energy poverty. We then analyze the roles women as an important stakeholders in universalizing modern energy services. We show how women self-help groups can be a vital link in large-scale diffusion of energy-efficient and renewable technologies. The paper concludes with policy pointers for sustainable development and gender empowerment through energy solutions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Impact of tropical cyclones on sustainable development through loops and
   cycles: evidence from select developing countries of Asia
SO EMPIRICAL ECONOMICS
AB Asian developing countries are frequently devastated by tropical cyclones. While the literature is replete with their impacts on economic growth, the impacts on critical sustainable development indicators, namely income inequality, health, and human capital accumulation, have seldom been explored. In this study, we measure the direct, indirect, and spillover impacts of tropical cyclones on the sustainable development of eight developing countries in Asia. This study uses the dynamic generalized method of moments model to estimate the impact of occurrences and casualties in these countries over 28 years. Our results indicate that recurrent tropical cyclones increase income inequality, reaching the threshold at 0.4 cyclone. The mortality rate tends to rise, which decreases after 2.5 cyclonic occurrences. Similarly, cyclones seem to initially reduce the expected years of schooling, which starts increasing after one cyclonic occurrence. These weakening impacts provide evidence of negative feedback loops. We also find evidence of domino effects and gender effects. The resilience factors are controlled for, as it helps the developing countries recover from the vicious cycles. The feedback loops can be broken by taking timely interventions, mitigation and adaptation.

TI A review on technological options of waste to energy for effective
   management of municipal solid waste
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Approximately one-fourth population across the world rely on traditional fuels (kerosene, natural gas, biomass residue, firewood, coal, animal dung, etc.) for domestic use despite significant socioeconomic and technological development. Fossil fuel reserves are being exploited at a very fast rate to meet the increasing energy demands, so there is a need to find alternative sources of energy before all the fossil fuel reserves are depleted. Waste to energy (WTE) can be considered as a potential alternative source of energy, which is economically viable and environmentally sustainable. The present study reviewed the current global scenario of WTE technological options (incineration, pyrolysis, gasification, anaerobic digestion, and landfilling, with gas recovery) for effective energy recovery and the challenges faced by developed and developing countries. This review will provide a framework for evaluating WTE technological options based on case studies of developed and developing countries. Unsanitary landfilling is the most commonly practiced waste disposal option in the developing countries. However, developed countries have realised the potential of WTE technologies for effective municipal solid waste management (MSWM). This review will help the policy makers and the implementing authorities involved in MSWM to understand the current status, challenges and barriers for effective management of municipal solid waste. This review concluded WTE as a potential renewable source of energy, which will partly meet the energy demand and ensure effective MSWM. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Genetically modified and biofortified crops and food security in
   developing countries A review
SO NUTRITION & FOOD SCIENCE
AB Purpose In recent times, science and technology has taken a front seat in revolutionizing agricultural production and food processing globally with noticeable impact on food, nutrition and family health. This study was carried out to have a critical review of genetically modified (GM) foods and the use of GM and biofortified crops for food security in developing countries where foods are not adequately available and people are not food secured. Design/methodology/approach A critical review of GM foods was undertaken and the use of GM and biofortified crops for food security in developing countries where foods are not adequately available and people are not food secured was carried out. Findings Currently, there are no recent patents on GM and biofortified crops and this shows that there are more works to be done by policymakers, regulatory agencies, consumers and right organizations on environmental, health and biosafety of GM and biofortified crops. Advances in science and technology have changed our relationship with nature which enables crops to be modified and improved through selective breeding to obtain more stronger and productive crops. However, despite the benefits and improvements from GM and biofortified crops, controversy and arguments have continued to trail the consumption of GM and biofortified crops because of the perceived safety issues. Although genetic engineering has helped in developing fast-growing and pest-resistant crops, as well as reduction in use of pesticides, however, its impact on the environment and the consumers cannot be overemphasized. In conclusion, this study showed that the role of GM and biofortified crops for food security is the subject of public controversy; however, genetic engineering has the potential to improve world food production, increase food availability and influence farmers' income and thus their economic access to food but the attendance potential risks related to food safety and avoidable environmental hazards should not be overlooked. There is need for comprehensive information on the impact of GM and biofortified crops on environment, human health and biosafety of the crops. Research limitations/implications - Few available literatures on the subject matter were critically reviewed. Practical implications - The paper helps in creating awareness for more in-depth research on GM and biofortified crops and their impacts on food security in developing countries where foods are not adequately available and people are not food secured. Originality/value This research is of value to the researchers, policymakers and regulatory agencies in developing countries on food safety.

TI Informal Sector Employment and Economic Growth: Evidence from Developing
   Countries in SDG Perspective
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The understanding of the role of informal employment in economic growth is important to facilitate developing countries in safeguarding the decent work, productive employment, and inclusive growth agenda mentioned in Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 8. The present study attempts to this end by investigating the role of informal employment on economic growth with an aim to assist in fulfilling target 8.3 of SDG. This study utilizes the data available for 20 developing countries for the period 2011-2019. Panel data analysis techniques have been applied, considering the percentage of total employment in the informal sector as the main explanatory variable of the models. The relevant macroeconomic indicators are included in the model as control variables. Empirical findings from Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS), Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS), and Dynamic Fixed Effect (DFE) models indicate a positive effect of informal employment on the economic growth of developing countries. The other macroeconomic indicators, per capita income, national expenditure, money supply, and economic freedom, are also found to contribute to the economic growth of the selected countries. This study reveals an important bidirectional causal association between informal employment and economic growth, a unidirectional causal link from per capita income to informal employment and from informal employment to national expenditure. Taking into account the contribution of the informal sector to the economy, this study fosters the need for achieving the targets mentioned in SDG 8 by adopting appropriate policies rather than punishing this sector immediately.

To this circle one must add international commerce as a generator and provider of resources. We are interested in measuring in this sense, the fairness used to assign resources, trade openness, taking care on how big the demand of natural resources is by industrialized nations, which can support developing countries, since it affects the terms of trade relationship, the environment, giving origin to an economic imbalance between nations.

Among the available interventions for micronutrient malnutrition, food-based approaches have been considered as most acceptable, safe and sustainable. These food-based strategies include nutrition education, dietary diversification and food fortification. Supplementation still remains an important therapeutic intervention for critical deficiency status. Dietary diversification and nutrition education are more long term but require lot of perseverance. In this contest, food fortification is a broad, effective and immediate way to target a widespread problem like micronutrient malnutrition. The present review is an attempt to appraise the current status of food fortification in developing countries with specific reference to its technological, nutritional, beneficial and economical aspects.

SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE & ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
AB This paper examines the role of globalization in the creation and dissemination of technology across firms operating in 30 emerging and developing economies. Firm-level data from four rounds of Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Surveys from 2002 to 2014 is pooled to assess whether international exposure translates into greater propensity for firms to innovate. The viability of different channels of international technology transmission, i.e. exporting and importing activities, foreign licensing agreements and foreign direct investment are studied to analyze whether they indeed succeed in delivering the push to the firms operating in developing countries to innovate and as a result push them closer to the world's technology frontier. The empirical results endorse the view that exporting and importing activities and foreign licensing agreements are important channels for technology transfer. This study also acknowledges country, sector and firm specific characteristics and their differential capacity to benefit from foreign exposure.

TI Situating Intellectual Property Policy Into a Human Development Paradigm
SO JOURNAL OF WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
AB Human development emphasizes creating an enabling environment for people to cultivate initiatives and promote their freedoms, choices and capabilities to lead economic, social and cultural progress. Knowledge is a key component in that enabling environment. It is also the subject of intellectual property (IP) protection. In its current shape, the global IP regime increasingly contributes into locking up knowledge under private control. This approach does not necessarily promote human development objectives, particularly in developing countries with weak knowledge base. Developing countries need to ensure that their IP laws are situated within a human development paradigm. To achieve this, policymakers need to create the infrastructure to empower people to capitalize on knowledge by making knowledge inputs widely available. IP may assist in enhancing human development so long as it does not unduly undermine people's opportunities to access, reuse and recreate knowledge. I introduce two proposals to assist in situating IP into the human development paradigm. Firstly, developing countries should keep knowledge resources in open zones unless the privatization of knowledge is justified. Secondly, they should introduce policy and legislative measures to expand the open zone for people to access, use and re-create knowledge and culture.

TI Energy access in Small Island Developing States: Status, barriers and
   policy measures
SO ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
AB The lack of access to modern energy services, sometimes also referred to as energy poverty, is a significant global development challenge. This paper provides an analysis of energy access in Small Island Developing States (SIDS), sheds light on current challenges and provides insights on opportunities to improve access to modern energy services in these countries. It provides an overview of energy access levels within the African, Caribbean and Pacific SIDS regions to refocus attention on their frail economies and dependence on imported fossil fuels. The focus here is on three specific factors that are still not well investigated: issues which relate to grid-extension, the lack of trained personnel for decentralised electrification and a high reliance on imported energy which drains Gross Domestic Product (GDP). A selection of SIDS case studies highlighting endeavours to expand energy access provide a basis on which key measures to expand electrification are suggested. Enabling conditions identified included a high level of commitment from the government and the setting up of an independent regulatory body with rulemaking and adjudicative powers. Additionally, the setting up of a cost-reflective tariff structure and appropriate fiscal framework are highlighted which can contribute towards electricity access expansion in island context.

TI Just electrification: Imagining the justice dimensions of energy access
   and addressing energy poverty
SO ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB Billions of people live without access to modern energy services around the world, the majority of whom are in sub-Saharan Africa. In order to address this issue, efforts to increase energy access, especially in electrification for the energy-poor, have increased globally. However, current electrification planning largely relies on technoeconomic criteria and fails to incorporate ethical and fairness considerations. These deficiencies in the planning phase result in the construction of energy infrastructure that fails to provide energy services to those who need them the most further exacerbating energy access inequalities at a local level. This paper aims to consider an approach for a justice-based electrification planning framework that reevaluates the electrification planning and decision-making process.

In the developed world, where the potato thrived and became a food for the poor, prices of the inferior potato attract little interest due to general welfare, which further complicates discerning economic effects by computation. Contrarily, in many developing countries, due to supply constraints the potato is a relative expensive, non-staple, normal good, with little social significance. Whereas it is a common misconception that tastes in developing countries differ from advanced economies, low incomes, together with relatively high potato prices, present a real and obvious hindrance to wider potato use among the poor in the underdeveloped world. Local regressions on FAO data reveal empirical advantages favoring potato price system research in developing countries, more likely yielding predictable, statistically significant, unbiased results. Correct policies could increase potato importance in developing countries and stimulate sustainable and pro-poor growth where consumers receive affordable potatoes, while also producer incentives for greater productivity improve. Furthermore, potato-led research presents widening potential into also understanding general social structures of underdevelopment as similar factors explain both cross-border incomes and potato prices.

TI Decentralized approaches to wastewater treatment and management:
   Applicability in developing countries
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Providing reliable and affordable wastewater treatment in rural areas is a challenge in many parts of the world, particularly in developing countries. The problems and limitations of the centralized approaches for wastewater treatment are progressively surfacing. Centralized wastewater collection and treatment systems are costly to build and operate, especially in areas with low population densities and dispersed households. Developing countries lack both the funding to construct centralized facilities and the technical expertise to manage and operate them. Alternatively, the decentralized approach for wastewater treatment which employs a combination of onsite and/or cluster systems is gaining more attention. Such an approach allows for flexibility in management, and simple as well as complex technologies are available. The decentralized system is not only a long-term solution for small communities but is more reliable and cost effective. This paper presents a review of the various decentralized approaches to wastewater treatment and management. A discussion as to their applicability in developing countries, primarily in rural areas, and challenges faced is emphasized all through the paper. While there are many impediments and challenges towards wastewater management in developing countries, these can be overcome by suitable planning and policy implementation. Understanding the receiving environment is Crucial for technology selection and should be accomplished by conducting a comprehensive site evaluation process. Centralized management of the decentralized wastewater treatment systems is essential to ensure they are inspected and maintained regularly. Management strategies should be site specific accounting for social, cultural, environmental and economic conditions in the target area. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Does Ethical Behaviour Affect Sustainable Development? Evidence from
   Developed and Developing Countries
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This paper examines the relationship between ethical behavior and green growth for a large sample of 109 countries, comprised of developed and developing countries. We applied panel corrected the standard error (PCSE) and system generalized moment of method (S-GMM) to achieve the set-aside objectives. We use the recent data from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OCED). Our results show that high ethical behavior is associated with an increase in green growth, suggesting that the ethical standard plays a significant role in achieving sustainable development. We also find that the relationship between ethical behavior and green growth is more pronounced in developed countries than in developing countries. This is attributed to the ethical standard laid down in most of the developed countries. The results are unaffected by alternative variable measurements and econometric estimations. Our findings highlight the need for policymakers to consider non-economic and technological factors such as ethics to achieve growth that is both environmentally and economically sustainable.

AB Sustainability of supply chains is achieved through the consideration of the economic, environmental and social aspects in the decision making process. The majority of research concentrates on integrating two out of these three aspects, with limited inclusion of the social aspect. In developing countries, where the production supply chains are usually labour intensive, and where environmental regulations are still developing, both social and environmental aspects should be given considerable importance. This work presents a supply chain assessment model integrating the three dimensions of sustainability. An illustrative numerical example demonstrates how the proposed model may aid in the assessment and improvement of supply chain sustainability. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Conceptualizing the Role of Social Entrepreneurial Orientation in the
   Triple Bottom Line in the Social Enterprise Context: Developing Country
   Perspective
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Social entrepreneurship is becoming widely recognized as essential to developing economies and societies. However, we find that the lack of a clear and cohesive conceptualization for understanding the distinctive context and reliable role of social entrepreneurship is a challenging aspect. Furthermore, the research is lacking in developing country perspectives. Accordingly, this study argues that a social entrepreneurship conceptual model needs to be developed from a developing country perspective to advance the literature on the social entrepreneurship notion. Specifically, this study followed a qualitative research approach and conducted in-person semi-structured interviews with 24 Sri Lankan social enterprises by adopting the maximum variation sampling technique. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Consequently, our model explicates how social entrepreneurial orientation leads to the triple bottom line through dynamic capability and social innovation. The proposed model anticipates that social entrepreneurial orientation alone cannot achieve the triple bottom line in social entrepreneurship. Thus, based on existing research evidence, we believe that the following constructs-social entrepreneurial orientation, dynamic capabilities, social innovations, and the triple bottom line-can be integrated to provide a solid conceptual model for social entrepreneurial ventures in developing countries.

TI The Ecological Intensity of Well-Being in Developing Countries: A Panel
   Data Analysis
SO HUMAN ECOLOGY REVIEW
AB Recent sustainability research into balancing the demands for ecosystem services and benefits in the form of human well-being has developed into a study of the ecological intensity of well-being (EIWB). Research into EIWB focuses on its reduction, as a pathway to sustainability. Here, we present a revised measure of EIWB by using a ratio of ecological footprint per capita (EF) to infant survival rate (ISR). EF per capita is included as an indicator of anthropogenic environmental stress and ISR serves as a measure of well-being, well suited to the context of developing countries. By using panel data for 81 developing countries, we mainly draw our hypothesis from a modernization perspective and check the effects of economic growth and urbanization on EIWB. The results indicate that economic growth has a positive effect on EIWB; also increasing urbanization can increase EIWB. Overall, these findings suggest that developing countries are less likely to achieve sustainability with current modernization practices.

TI The role of older workers in population aging-economic growth nexus:
   evidence from developing countries
SO ECONOMIC CHANGE AND RESTRUCTURING
AB This study explored the relationship between population aging and economic growth in 74 developing countries between 1990 and 2019, highlighting the vital role of older workers (as measured by labor force participation of older people) in the national economy. A static panel estimator was used to examine the relationship between population aging, labor force participation of older people and economic growth. Results showed a negative association between population aging and economic growth, but the inverse relationship was mitigated by the labor force participation of older people. This indicates that the marginal impact of population aging on economic growth depends on the labor force participation of older people. The mitigating role of labor force participation of older people remained robust in a series of robustness checks. This study provides some policy recommendations to raise the labor force participation of older people to reduce the negative impact of population aging on economic growth. Effective utilization of human resources of older people is essential to bring about sustainable economic development.

TI Strategies and challenges for safe injection practice in developing
   countries
SO JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY & PHARMACOTHERAPEUTICS
AB Injection is one of the important health care procedures used globally to administer drugs. Its unsafe use can transmit various blood borne pathogens. This article aims to review the history and status of injection practices, its importance, interventions and the challenges for safe injection practice in developing countries. The history of injections started with the discovery of syringe in the early nineteenth century. Safe injection practice in developed countries was initiated in the early twentieth century but has not received adequate attention in developing countries. The establishment of "Safe Injection Global Network (SIGN)" was an milestone towards safe injection practice globally. In developing countries, people perceive injection as a powerful healing tool and do not hesitate to pay more for injections. Unsafe disposal and reuse of contaminated syringe is common. Ensuring safe injection practice is one of the greatest challenges for healthcare system in developing countries. To address the problem, interventions with active involvement of a number of stakeholders is essential. A combination of educational, managerial and regulatory strategies is found to be effective and economically viable. Rational and safe use of injections can save many lives but unsafe practice threatens life. Safe injection practice is crucial in developing countries. Evidence based interventions, with honest commitment and participation from the service provider, recipient and community with aid of policy makers are required to ensure safe injection practice.

TI PUBLIC HEALTH RATIONALE FOR INVESTMENTS IN EMERGENCY MEDICINE IN
   DEVELOPING COUNTRIES - GHANA AS A CASE STUDY
SO JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
AB Background: Ghana is a developing country that has strategically invested in expanding emergency care services as a means of improving national health outcomes. Objectives: Here we present Ghana as a case study for investing in emergency care to achieve public health benefits that fuel for national development. Discussion: Ghana's health leadership has affirmed emergency care as a necessary adjunct to its preexisting primary health care model. Historically, developing countries prioritize primary care efforts and outpatient clinic-based health care models. Ghana has added emergency medicine infrastructure to its health care system in an effort to address the ongoing shift in disease epidemiology as the population urbanizes, mobilizes, and ages. Ghana's investments include prehospital care, personnel training, health care resource provision, communication improvements, transportation services, and new health facilities. This is in addition to re-educating frontline health care providers and developing infrastructure for specialist training. Change was fueled by public support, partnerships between international organizations and domestic stakeholders, and several individual champions. Conclusion: Emergency medicine as a horizontal component of low- to middle-income countries' health systems may fuel national health and economic development. Ghana's experience may serve as a model.

TI FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO WOMEN'S VENTURE SUCCESS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES:
   AN EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AB Although the body of literature on female entrepreneurs is relatively small when compared to that of men; the majority of articles that have focused on female entrepreneurs and issues surrounding them center on women in developed countries. Few studies place emphasis on female entrepreneurs in developing countries. Guided by the resource-based view of human and social capital, the article explores the relationship among individual and entrepreneurial factors, institutional factors and women's venture success in developing countries. Hypotheses are tested with a sample of 350 female entrepreneurs using individual and country level data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) database and the Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom. Female entrepreneurs were chosen from six developing countries: Argentina, Brazil, Hungary, India, Mexico and South Africa. Results indicate certain factors (i.e. household income, knowing an entrepreneur, and country of origin) play a role in venture success for female entrepreneurs in developing countries. Secondary analyses demonstrated that the developing country's economic freedom, cultural norms, financial support and government supportiveness may also impact women's venture success.

AB Globalisation of world societies, cultures, politics and economies is compelling countries world over to initiate and reinvent government systems to deliver efficient and effective services to citizens, businesses and other agencies. This transformation and reform in the way governments operate presents significant challenges and issues that developing countries need to fully take into account when implementing eGovernment projects. Governments in developing countries face challenges different from those in developed countries, challenges include amongst others; limited resources with competing national priority needs; lack of interoperability standards for build up of eGovernment systems; and limited and weak telecommunication platforms resulting into inaccessibility and poor internet connections speed and efficiency. The potential for eGovernment in developing countries remains largely unexploited despite that information and telecommunication technologies (ICTs) offers considerable potential for sustainable development of eGovernment. Developing countries in comparison to developed countries lack in (1) history and culture; (2) technical capabilities; (3) Infrastructure; (4) e-citizen development and (5) public service focus. There is digital divide between developed and developing countries, not withstanding that the world is in reality a one globally competitive market. Hence a need for eGovernment research specifically focused on developing countries. This paper takes both the theoretical and empirical approaches to address the study, a theoretical approach is used to explore and discuss the general challenges faced by developing countries with a view to create adequate awareness of the challenges to give focus and enable developing countries to capture in their plans effective strategies to tackle these challenges when formulating implementation programmes. Whereas the empirical approach applies a case study based research conducted in Botswana mainly not to provide the solution at this point, but rather to highlight that though there are generic challenges facing developing countries, there is however, no one size fits all solution as some challenges are peculiar and specific to countries and would need differentiated approaches and strategies. Further the paper discusses the present benefits of eGovernment to developing countries in three broader categories of; political and public sector administration benefits; economic benefits; and social and cultural benefits. Presentation of how developing countries can benefit from implementing eGovernment projects coupled with awareness of what challenges to address and specification of challenges per each country is expected to assist developing countries to set appropriate goals for pursuing eGovernment, define and set clear vision, mission and priorities for eGovernment as well as determine the eGovernment their nations may be ready for.

AB The purpose of the article is to determine the influence of traffic safety on transport infrastructure and competitiveness of economic system in view of developed and developing countries of the world and to develop the concept of managing traffic safety based on the new ICT in the interests of reduction of differentiation of developed and developing countries and unification of the global transport infrastructure. The methodology of the research is based on regression analysis, which is used for determining regression dependence between traffic safety, which indicator is death rate from vehicle accidents according to the World Health Organization, (x), transport infrastructure index (y(1)), and index of global competitiveness of the countries (y(2)) according to the World Economic Forum. The research is performed in view of developed and developing countries, which have the first and the least positions in the international ranking of traffic safety. The developed countries include Malta, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Norway, and Sweden, and developing countries include Kazakhstan, Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania, and Montenegro. It is substantiated that absence of consideration of such factor as traffic safety does not allow for full and precise evaluation of development of transport infrastructure. Application of new information and communication technologies to managing traffic safety allows improving transport infrastructure and thus increasing competitiveness of the economic system. For that, the authors' concept of managing traffic safety on the basis of new ICT in the interests of differentiation of developed and developing countries and unification of the global transport infrastructure is developed.

TI Nexus between renewable energy consumption, foreign capital flows, and
   financial development: New evidence using CUP-FM and CUP-BC advanced
   methods
SO STRUCTURAL CHANGE AND ECONOMIC DYNAMICS
AB The study tries to explore the impact of foreign capital flows and financial development on renewable energy consumption. The empirical analysis is conducted using data for 17 developing countries for the period 1990 to 2020. The analysis is conducted for three sets of countries i.e. high-income developing countries, low-income developing countries, and all developing countries. The study uses sophisticated panel data estimation approaches to find the results, i.e. continuously-updated and fully modified (CUP-FM) and continuously updated and bias-corrected (CUP-BC) panel estimation techniques. The results show that financial development and capital flows positively affect renewable energy in all three samples of developing countries. The study also employs the Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012) panel causality test to analyze the causal relationship among variables. Bidirectional causality is found between FD and RE and between CF and RE in all income developing countries group and high-income developing group but a unidirectional causality is found from FD and CF to RE in low-income developing countries group. On the basis of the findings of the study, it is recommended that to promote RE in developing countries it is imperative to encourage FD and CF in these countries. Further, developing countries ought to support the concept of green financing and need to allocate funds for investments in green energy to promote sustainable energy resources.

   Subregion
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Biodiesel has the potential to economically, socially, and environmentally benefit communities as well as countries, and to contribute toward their sustainable development. Nonetheless, the complex nature of biodiesel development makes it susceptible to exogenous problems that could hinder sustainable development. To ensure that biodiesel development actually leads to a sustainable path, all possible issues and challenges need to be identified and analyzed up front, so that they can be prepared for and handled in the planning and management stages. Building upon lessons learned from biodiesel developments in the Greater Mekong Subregion, this work examines biodiesel development in developing countries in the aspects of policy, governance, management, infrastructure, technology, feedstock, impacts on the rural poor and local livelihood, climate change, and the environment. Issues within each aspect are also analyzed in the context of developing countries. As a result, this review can serve as a guideline for ensuring that biodiesel development contributes toward sustainable development in developing countries. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Frugal innovation and sustainable business models
SO TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
AB This study aims to explore how frugal innovations (FIs) emerge at the grassroots level of developing countries and employ novel business models to contribute to sustainable development. It explores various business model elements, mainly viewed through the lens of value proposition, value creation, and value capture. FIs transform underserved customers at the grassroots level into novel consumer groups. By exploring three FI cases, this study contributes to the literature about FI business models. It shows how individuals with limited education, funds, and resources can bring affordable products to market using outside the box thinking to meet the needs of underserved customers in developing countries.

TI Political economy of Southeast Asian borderlands: Migration,
   environment, and developing country firms
SO JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ASIA
AB Borderland zones in Southeast Asia have become sites of increased economic investment for developing country firms, intra-regional and transnational corporations. As a result of deregulation, these investment opportunities have led to the exploitation of natural and human resources in an unsustainable and unjust way. This article argues that the flows of people and natural resources across borders are connected intimately and that this has been facilitated politically by the acceptance of the porosity of territorial boundaries by all governments in the region and the imperative to export environmentally degrading development projects into neighbouring countries where political mobilisation on environmental issues is much less effective. Conveyed through a series of cases studies (on resource extraction, dam and reservoir construction, and working conditions in apparel companies), this article explores how developing country companies comply with the codes of conduct on corporate responsibility on human rights, labour standards and environmental sustainability) within the context of the governance of the global supply chain.

Healthcare in Pakistan, like many other developing countries, is divided into public and private sectors. The public sector is not always completely free of cost. Patients seeking specialised care in the public sector may find lengthy waiting times for an urgent procedure due to a struggling system and a lack of specialists and technical expertise. Families of many patients find themselves facing 'catastrophic healthcare expenditure', an economic global health quandary much ignored.

TI Cross-country evidence on the role of national governance in boosting
   COVID-19 vaccination
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Background Frequent mutations of the COVID-19 virus, such as the Delta and Omicron variants, have prolonged the pandemic. Rich countries have approved the booster shots (3(rd) doses) of vaccine, but this causes further delay of vaccination in developing countries. This raises the risk of further mutations, which may lower the efficacy of currently available vaccines. As herd immunity by universal vaccination is essential to end the pandemic, the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) facility has been established to provide developing countries with subsidized vaccines. However, a critical issue is that the developing countries also need to effectively deploy vaccines to citizens. Although this argument suggests positive effects of good national governance on vaccination coverage, to the best of our knowledge, there is no cross-country evidence on the role of national governance in increasing the coverage of COVID-19 vaccines among citizens. The goal of this study was to examine the association between the national governance and vaccination coverage among developing countries. Methods Using cross-country data, an ordinary least squares regression was conducted to examine the association between the national governance index and three outcomes: (1) the number of days until the administration of the first dose in the country since December 2019, (2) the number of doses per 100 citizens as of the end of July 2021, and (3) the selection of approved vaccine manufacturers. The results were compared between the model including all countries and the model excluding the member countries of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Results A one standard deviation increase in the national governance index was associated with 9.1 days (95%CI: -15.76, -2.43) earlier administration of vaccines in the country, and a 12.1 dose increase (95%CI: 4.76, 19.34) per 100 citizens. These associations were larger in the non-OECD sample. The results also indicated the role of governance in the selection of the administered vaccines. Conclusion The provision of subsidized vaccines alone is not sufficient to control the spread of infection in developing countries; logistical and administrative support should also be offered, especially in countries with poor governance.

TI Diversity-development nexus: Why determine economic development without
   diversity? A comparative analysis between developed and developing
   countries
SO SOCIETY AND BUSINESS REVIEW
AB Purpose
   Diversity plays a vital role in the sustainable development of any country. Discrimination, segregation and bigotry are rampant causes of social evil and do great harm to our society. This study aims to investigate whether ethnic and religious diversity affects the country's well-being or not, via a comparative analysis between developing and developed countries.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This study used a generalized method of moments technique for empirical analysis of 158 developing and developed countries. For measurement of ethnic and religious diversity, this study used ethnic fractionalization index of Alesina (2003).
   Findings
   The empirical findings indicate that ethnic and religious diversity both increases the economic prosperity for developed countries, and alternatively, it makes it more miserable for developing countries. This study suggests that organizing a diverse society is a difficult task; thus, developing countries need to promote a cohesive society like developed countries by providing equal, secure and peaceful opportunity to get fruitful results of diverse populations.
   Originality/value
   This study investigates a comparative analysis between developing and developed countries regarding impact of ethnic and religious diversity on economic development.

TI The end of economic growth? A contracting threshold hypothesis
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB This paper argues that GDP growth in both developed and developing countries has associated costs that can outweigh the benefits and thus reduce sustainable well-being. This conclusion is based upon the findings of empirical applications of the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) to a range of countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The studies conducted on seven Asia-Pacific countries indicate that, in the case of five of the seven nations, more recent GDP growth has reduced the sustainable well-being experienced by the average citizen residing within them. Moreover, the threshold point at which the costs of GDP growth outweigh the benefits appears to be contracting (i.e., occurring at a much lower per capita level of GDP). This paper therefore introduces a new contracting threshold hypothesis: as the economies of the Asia-Pacific region and the world collectively expand in a globalised economic environment, there is a contraction over time in the threshold level of per capita GDP. As a consequence, the threshold point confronting growth late-comers (i.e., developing countries) occurs at a much lower level of sustainable welfare than what wealthy nations currently enjoy. The consequences of this for developing countries are clearly significant and require a new approach to economic development. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Determinants of neonatal, infant and under-five mortalities: evidence

SO JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY
AB We investigated the macroeconomic determinants of neonatal, infant, and under-five mortalities in Bangladesh for the period 1991-2018 and discuss implications of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) and Millennium Development Goal 4 (MDG 4) for developing countries. We used annual time series data and the econometric techniques of Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) and Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) regressions for analysis. Determinants most effective in combating neonatal, infant, and under-five mortalities include variables such as 'protecting newborns against tetanus', 'increasing healthcare expenditure', and 'making sure births are attended by skilled healthcare staff'. Employing more healthcare workers and assuring more and improved healthcare provisions can further reduce the neonatal, infant, and under-five mortalities. Developing countries with similar macroeconomic profiles can achieve similar SDG 3 and MDG 4 outcomes by emulating the policies and strategies Bangladesh applied to reducing child mortalities over the last three decades.

TI Sustainable vaccine manufacturing in low- and middle-Income countries
SO VACCINE
AB The sustainable manufacturing of vaccines in developing countries is critical to increasing equitable access to vaccines and pandemic preparedness globally. Sustainable manufacturing requires that organi-zations engaged in the development, production and supply of vaccines have viable business models and incentives to manufacture vaccine products.The expanding manufacturing capabilities and capacities of developing countries vaccine manufactur-ers (DCVMs) are increasingly positioning these organizations to meet the national and regional public health needs in developing countries; however, key industry challenges such as regulatory barriers, low prices and demand uncertainty for vaccine products, and limited R&D funding threaten the long-term viability of vaccine manufacturers.This study assesses the technical capabilities, manufacturing capacities, and aspirational plans of DCVMs, exemplifying the business models and strategies undertaken to sustainably manufacture vacci-nes in developing countries. The public health importance of a healthy vaccine industry which enables manufacturers is discussed throughout.Vaccine manufacturers reported diverse product portfolios and R&D pipelines and utilized an array of vaccine technology platforms. Large manufacturing capacities were reported, a critical factor in manufac-turers achieving economies of scale and supplying large volumes of vaccine doses to the world's most populous regions. Partnerships and collaboration within the industry and with international organiza-tions along the vaccine value-chain were cited with high frequency. Manufacturers also reported aspira-tional plans to enter new markets, acquire new technologies and invest in the development of novel and improved vaccines.As DCVMs aim to have an increasing impact on the global vaccine ecosystem, a coordinated multi -stakeholder approach is required alleviate critical industry barriers to ensure that all efforts produce vac-cines are sustainable and enable developing countries to realize the public health benefit of vaccines.

TI Urban river pollution in the densely populated city of Dhaka,
   Bangladesh: Big picture and rehabilitation experience from other
   developing countries
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Rapid urbanization and economic development caused urban river pollution globally. In the developing countries' megapolis, the situation is especially critical in response to the United Nation's sustainable development goal for 2030. Dhaka, Bangladesh, is one of the most densely populated cities in the world. Around 21 million people are living in this city of 1464 km(2). Currently, 98% of untreated domestic sewage as well as significant amounts of industrial wastewater discharge from over 7000 industries are contributing to the presence of black and foul water in the urban rivers. In this study, a driving force-impact-challenge-response (DICR) framework is formed to create a big picture of urban river pollution situation, which incorporates nine factors of social, environmental, and governmental aspects. Using this framework, a comparative study was performed between Dhaka rivers and other rivers in developing countries with successful rehabilitation experiences. Accordingly, a strategy for Dhaka's urban river pollution control was developed, which included improvement of sewerage systems, appropriate planning of industrial enterprises, construction of hydraulic structures to modify and improve the water flow, and an efficient management framework and finance investments for river rehabilitation. The key actions necessary to further improve the river water quality in the far future are also suggested, under the condition that dry-weather black and foul occurrence in the Dhaka rivers could be eliminated. The river assessment framework and associated strategies may also help policymakers, the government, and researchers to develop a plan for the rehabilitation of seriously polluted rivers in other developing countries.

TI Global assessment of research and development for algae biofuel
   production and its potential role for sustainable development in
   developing countries
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB The possibility of economically deriving fuel from cultivating algae biomass is an attractive addition to the range of measures to relieve the current reliance on fossil fuels. Algae biofuels avoid some of the previous drawbacks associated with crop-based biofuels as the algae do not compete with food crops. The favourable growing conditions found in many developing countries has led to a great deal of speculation about their potentials for reducing oil imports, stimulating rural economies, and even tackling hunger and poverty. By reviewing the status of this technology we suggest that the large uncertainties make it currently unsuitable as a priority for many developing countries. Using bibliometric and patent data analysis, we indicate that many developing countries lack the human capital to develop their own algae industry or adequately prepare policies to support imported technology. Also, we discuss the potential of modern biotechnology, especially genetic modification (GM) to produce new algal strains that are easier to harvest and yield more oil. Controversy surrounding the use of GM and weak biosafety regulatory system represents a significant challenge to adoption of GM technology in developing countries. A range of policy measures are also suggested to ensure that future progress in algae biofuels can contribute to sustainable development. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, for education to deliver on these expectations, it must be of sufficient quantity and quality to lead to meaningful learning among young people, a task known to pose considerable challenges. One of the most important challenges is to make the educational macro and governance environment more conducive to reform. This paper aims to deliberate on how the developing countries ought to be reconceived for better educational outcomes. It suggests that there are opportunities for collaboration between advanced and developing countries to nurture human capital, address any skill gaps and mismatches in the labour market. Challenges facing developing countries in the framework of the imperatives and importance of International Dimensions to improve the education system for sustainable development will be discussed.

TI Energy poverty in the COVID-19 era: Mapping global responses in light of
   momentum for the right to energy
SO ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB This article presents the results of the COVID Energy Map, a novel, global mapping exercise tracking emergency responses undertaken by governments, regulators, utilities and companies in the Global North and South to mitigate energy poverty by keeping energy affordable and available. The map constitutes a comprehensive open access evidence-based database, so far collating 380+ emergency measures, in 120+ countries. This paper particularly shows and discusses how the response has been developing until early 2021, highlighting various emerging longer-term concerns and strategies across Global North and South. The global COVID-19 response merits close attention in our view, as it reveals both the universal importance of household energy services access and important underlying existing narratives and policy-making questions about securing energy services access as a vital basic need, and even a 'basic right'. In fact, the paper additionally evaluates whether and how COVID-19 responses seem to fall in step with a nascent global trend of (legal) recognition of 'rights to energy' in international, regional and national policy, including for example in the EU, India, Philippines, and Colombia. We conclude that while the COVID-19 response clearly reflects broad recognition of the vital importance of affordable, continuous energy services access for basic human well-being and capabilities during the pandemic, a right to energy perspective could additionally lay bare or give shape to important concerns about some households' too minimal (insufficient) forms of modern energy access, questions of equity, and the role of the state and other actors. In terms of equity the article particularly raises issues with the manner in which support was made available only to some consumers (e.g. on-grid, off-grid, regulated, or non-regulated, post-paid or prepaid), or only for specific fuels, and not others. In addition, the lack of attention to clean (renewable) (off-grid) energy services in COVID-19 responses is striking, and worrying, both in terms of immediate response, and green recovery from COVID-19. We argue that a right to (clean) energy perspective would help to reflect on, and inform, both shorter-term and longer-term responses to energy poverty and COVID-19, and should aid the realization of sufficiently equitable, robust, modern energy systems in line with universal UN Global Sustainable Development Goal 7. Specifically, it should also help to fulfil SDG7.1.'s promise of 'leaving no one behind'.

TI A Framework for Improving Policy Priorities in Managing COVID-19
   Challenges in Developing Countries
SO FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to societies and threatened humanity and global resilience. All countries are challenged, but low-income and developing countries are facing a more challenging situation than others due to their limited health infrastructure, limited financial and human resources, and limited capacity of governments to respond. Further, the interconnected nature of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis demands an integrated approach and coordinated action, which complicates decision making even more. Identifying the best set of policies and instruments to address COVID-19 challenges, and aligning them with broader social goals will be critically important for sustainable recovery from the pandemic. The key practical challenge facing the policy makers of developing countries is how to prioritize policies to achieve the interconnected goals of managing the health crisis, recovering the economy, and achieving environmental sustainability. We present a framework for identifying and prioritizing policy actions to address the COVID-19 challenges and ensure sustainable recovery. The framework outlines principles and criteria and provides insights into developing shared policy goals, identifying smart strategies, assessing policy compatibility, aligning policy instruments, and factoring sustainability into short and long-term policy decisions. This framework can assist policy makers in linking short and long-term goals, mapping the interactions of different policy options, and assessing anticipated consequences and cross-sectoral implications. This will enable policy makers to prioritize policy choices and allocate limited resources in such a way that they are directed toward actions that generate synergy and co-benefits, have multiplier effects, and achieve interconnected solutions for health, the economy and environment.

To realize the aims of the study, a model that represents pollution is established utilizing the panel two-stage least square (TSLS) and the generalized method of moments (GMM). The results for both regressions similarly indicated that GDP growth, electricity consumption, urbanization, and trade openness are the main factors that increase CO2 emission in the investigated countries. Although the results show that Internet retailing reduces CO2 emission in general, a disaggregation occurs between developed and developing countries whereby Internet retailing has a significant negative effect on CO2 emission in the developed countries while it has no significant impact on CO2 emission in the developing countries. From the outcome of this study, a number of policy implications are provided for the investigated countries.

TI Financing for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the Era of
   COVID-19 and Beyond
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB The economic and social impact of covid-19 pandemic both on developing and developed countries has been significant. In addition to the impact of the pandemic, the current Ukraine war has also led to severe supply chain disruptions leading to a sharp increase in food and commodity prices globally. Due to a combination of external shocks and the impact of the pandemic global economic growth is expected to slow down from 6.1% in 2021 to 3.2% in 2022 and further to 2.7% in 2023 (IMF in: World economic outlook, International Monetary Fund, 2022). The above factors have led to a sharp increase in government expenditure constraining both developed and developing countries' fiscal capacity. This has further implications for the achievement of SDGs especially for low-income countries. The challenge for developing countries in the current scenario is to mobilise adequate resources both from domestic and international sources, not just for the achievement of SDGs as such, but also to sustain the livelihoods, health, and welfare of people. This special issue aims to examine some of these issues in the context of developing countries.

TI FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
SO GLOBAL ECONOMY JOURNAL
AB What are the economic, political, institutional, socio-cultural, and geographical determinants of financial development in developing countries? This paper uses the two-way fixed effects (with clustered standard errors) and annual panel data from 1980 to 2018 for 69 developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East and North Africa, East and South Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean to address this question. The principal component analysis is employed to construct a financial development index based on three financial development indicators. This study builds on the previous studies by introducing new potential determinants of financial development such as the perception of corruption, and by exploring important quadratic and interaction effects. The results show that national income, trade openness, indices of political stability and Polity2 (a democracy score), perception of corruption, the predominant religion in the countries, and geographical factors such as territorial access to the sea explain the differences in the levels of financial development across countries and regions. A rise in national income leads to a higher level of financial development and countries with a high perceived level of corruption have a lower level of financial development. There is strong evidence of threshold effects as trade openness has a diminishing marginal effect on financial development while the auxiliary growth regressions show that financial development has an increasing marginal effect on national income. Of the five regions studied, East and South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have the highest and lowest levels of financial development, respectively. Also, fuel-exporting countries, least developed countries, and landlocked countries tend to have lower levels of financial development. These results have relevant policy implications for developing countries in their continued efforts to achieve better financial development and ultimately, sustainable economic development.

AB The greenhouse effect, and other transnational and global environment, health and safely issues, require energy system planning on an international scale. Consideration of equity between nations and regions, particularly between the industrialized and developing countries, is an essential ingredient. For the immediate future, the next several decades at least, fossil fuels will remain the predominant energy sources. More efficient use of energy seems to be the only feasible strategy for the near to mid-term to provide growing energy services for the world economy while moderating the increasing demand for fossil fuels. In the longer term, nonfossil sources are essential for a sustainable world energy system, and nuclear power can play an important, if not dominant, role. The challenge is to design and implement a safe and economic nuclear power world enterprise which is socially acceptable and is complimentary to other nonfossil sources. The elements of such an enterprise seem clear and include: much safer reactors, preferably passively safe, which can be deployed at various scales; development of economic resource extension technologies; effective and permanent waste management strategies; and strengthened safeguards against diversion of nuclear materials to weapons. All of these elements can best be developed as cooperative international efforts. In the process, institutional improvements are equally as important as technological improvements; the two must proceed hand-in-hand.

TI THE ADOPTION OF E-COMMERCE IN THE LESOTHO TOURISM INDUSTRY
SO ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
AB Over the years, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has been revolutionising global markets. In developed nations, for example, there has been a push for developing countries to adopt ICT as leverage towards improving their economic development. However, in the current era, ICT adoption has not been as widespread as anticipated in some parts of the world, with its use in developing countries especially, lagging behind. This is particularly so amongst the small, medium, micro-enterprise (SMME) sector, important drivers of the economy in the developing world. SMMEs in developing countries have been hindered in the uptake of ICTs, largely due to underlying issues such as the high cost of ICT, inadequate and unreliable infrastructure, as well as lack of policy necessary to promote competition and growth within the ICT sectors.
   Amongst varying applications of ICTs, e-commerce is one area in particular which SMMEs have been relatively reluctant to adopt. Presently, many African countries have already taken firm steps to address infrastructure and ICT access issues. However, improved access on its own will not result in economic growth. It is important, therefore, to also understand aspects of ICT adoption in developing countries. The purpose of this research was to investigate the factors affecting e-commerce adoption in a typical developing country. Lesotho presented itself as an ideal case to investigate e-commerce adoption amongst SMMEs, specifically within the Lesotho tourism industry. This study, then, provides a detailed explanation of the factors influencing e-commerce uptake in the Lesotho tourism sector. In the extant literature, several studies and a number of generic models and frameworks on technology adoption offer a generalised understanding of technology adoption. None of these, however, provide a contextualised perspective prevalent to businesses in the typical developing country environment. Evidence for the study was collected using interviews with businesses. Data collected via interviews was used to examine the actual adoption issues amongst tourism SMMEs in Lesotho. In addition, where applicable, each organisation's online activities or websites was assessed. The study was premised on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model as its framework. The findings revealed that dimensions of the UTAUT model provided a sensible explanation regarding behavioural intention to adopt and use e-commerce amongst tourism SMMEs within the Lesotho tourism sector. In addition, a new dimension in respect of adoption was identified, viz. national culture. In this regard, masculinity, type of business ownership, and orientation to online purchasing were found to be mitigating factors against e-commerce adoption amongst SMMEs in the Lesotho tourism industry. Finally, an adapted UTAUT model is proposed for further study of e-commerce adoption in a developing country context.

TI Clean energy, clean water, and quality education: Prospects of achieving
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Sri Lanka
SO NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM
AB The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 targets universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy services by 2030. Modern or clean energy is perceived to be the golden thread that connects economic growth, human development, and environmental sustainability. However, one third of the world's population still uses solid fuels for cooking, endangering human health, and the environment. This paper, therefore, analyses demographic, socio-economic, and housing characteristics that affect the fuel choice for cooking. Further, it identifies how SDG 4 (quality education) and SDG 6 (clean water) create synergies with SDG 7 (clean energy). The data are obtained from the four waves of the Sri Lankan Households Income and Expenditure Survey, covering more than 79,000 households. The random-effects panel multinomial logit results reveal that household income, wealth, marital status and education of the head, age and education of the spouse, household size, number of children, housing characteristics, and residential sector are vital in selecting clean fuel for cooking. Furthermore, advanced sustainability analysis shows SDG 4 and 6 have a strong synergistic effect on SDG 7. Policymakers can use the findings to prioritise educational, water, and sanitation programmes in national policies aimed at enhancing the use of clean cooking fuel and technologies to meet SDG 7 by 2030.

SO GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS AND ITS RAMIFICATIONS ON CAPITAL MARKETS:
   OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS IN VOLATILE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS
SE Contributions to Economics
AB Unusual financial market conditions have affected the flow of capital and debt investment into renewable energy projects all over the world as a result of the 2008 financial crisis. The crisis collapsed trade and financial systems, decreased the movement of capital flows, and caused lower growth and inflation as well as tighter credit, lower profitability, and declining demand. The crisis spilled over from advanced economies to emerging and developing countries and the financial system in the world has deteriorated after the crisis.
   Financial sector development and sustainability have an important role at the renewable energy financing. Although a well-developed financial sector was said to support economic growth and stability, the crisis reminded that advanced financial systems could pose a threat to all the economy. Policy makers and international regulators have worked to assure financial sustainability, prevent global crises and encourage fair global competition in the markets during and after the crisis.
   The main purpose of this chapter is to define the meaning of the sustainable financial system and to analyse how the renewable energy investments were affected since the beginning of the crisis in developing countries. In the light of the literature survey, this chapter discusses renewable energy financing with a sustainable financial system following the crisis in developing countries.

TI Supporting the Sustainable Development of Railway Transport in

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Generally, the development process of the railway transport system is determined by the market pull effects initiated by the economy and society and the market push effects induced by technological progress. The policymakers can provide a balance between these two effects; this results in more effective, safer, and greener future railway systems. In developing countries, the railway systems lag compared to the developed economies. Therefore, the supporting management tools and legal supports for policymakers and strategic management play significant roles in the development of future sustainable transport systems. This paper deals with such required tools and the potential legal framework that support the development of sustainable railway systems in developing countries. The major novelty and advantages of the introduced methodology is the harmonised interaction between society, economic demands, technological development, and regulation. The proposed tools are applied to the Kenya rail system development.

TI Environmental effects of intensification of agriculture: livestock
   production and regulation
SO ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND POLICY STUDIES
AB This article deals with the relationship between industrialization of agriculture and the environment in developing countries. We specifically focus on livestock production and regulation. We develop a simple economic framework to demonstrate the effect of location on intensification of industrial activity in farming, and discuss this issue in the context of urbanization and economic growth in developing countries. Policy implications of the model are discussed in light of the experience of developed countries in regulating livestock pollution and other externalities. We argue that environmental problems from agricultural industrialization in developing countries may pose major challenges. In the case of livestock production, these are compounded by production intensity, high population densities in periurban and urban areas, and the generally lower public health standards. As the recent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza epidemics in Asia suggest, the new era of globalization and the onset of a free world trade regime points to the urgent need for developing countries to install inspection and enforcement mechanisms that ensure product safety and quality, as well as minimize the adverse effects on the environment.

TI Can I stay a BIT longer? The effect of bilateral investment treaties on
   political survival
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
AB Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) have proliferated throughout the international system. While ostensibly commercial in purpose, do BITs have domestic political ramifications? I argue that BITs affect a leader's tenure through their effect on the property rights environment in developing countries. BITs, by segmenting a country's property rights environment for foreign and domestic firms, reduce the incentive for foreign firms to lobby for property rights protections in the host country thus leading to a stagnating domestic property rights environment. In autocracies, a stagnating domestic property rights regime benefits domestic business elites who can continue to stymie small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The political benefits of BITs, however, decrease as a country becomes more democratic. Using a dataset of developing country leaders over the period 1965-2011, I find support for my hypothesis that BITs are associated with a decreased hazard of losing office and that the effect diminishes with higher levels of democracy. My results highlight the consequences of the legalization of global investment on the domestic political economy.

TI Poverty impacts of foot-and-mouth disease and the poverty reduction
   implications of its control
SO VETERINARY RECORD
AB Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) remains one of the most important livestock diseases of the world, given its highly infectious nature, its broad economic impacts on animal wellbeing and productivity, and its implications for successful access to domestic and export markets for livestock and products. The impacts of the disease vary markedly between developed and developing countries, and also within many developing countries. These differences in impact shape some markedly heterogeneous incentives for FMD control and eradication, which become of particular importance when setting priorities for poverty reduction in developing countries. Some consider that the benefits from FMD control accrue only to the better off in such societies and, as such, may not be a priority for investments targeted at poverty reduction. But is that view justified? others see the control of FMD as a major development opportunity in a globalised environment. in this paper, Brian Perry and Karl Rich summarise the differential impacts of FMD and its control, and link these findings with the growing understanding of how the control of this globally important disease may contribute to the processes of pro-poor growth in certain countries of the developing world.

TI Circular economy model for developing countries: evidence from

SO HELIYON
AB From environmental and sustainable development perspective, circular economy model is rarely applied in developing countries compared to developed nations. The aim of this paper is to review the overall scenario of the circular economy (CE) model in Bangladesh toward sustainable development. The study relies on the descriptive analysis of both qualitative and quantitative data, collected mostly from secondary sources with some in-depth interviews of the experts in the relevant field. The overall environmental status of Bangladesh, prospects, practices, and challenges of the circular economy model were thoroughly discussed in this paper. Though there are prospects to switching towards CE, the study reveals that the CE model's applicability is very limited in Bangladesh, being exercised mostly through recycling processes in some industries. Most importantly, we attempted to explore what is holding the CE practice in Bangladesh back, and iterated some policy, technical, and public participation barriers existing in Bangladesh. This paper will benefit the policymakers in developing countries in general and Bangladesh in particular to look more into the matter and hope to present ideas for future researchers to work on the idea of CE in the context of particular sectors and subsectors of Bangladesh.

TI Long run agricultural land expansion, booms and busts
SO LAND USE POLICY
AB Agricultural land expansion is a prominent feature in today's developing countries. It is associated with a structural pattern of land use in many remote land-abundant regions where large-scale commercial primary product activities coexist with increased concentration of smallholders in more marginal areas. The result may be boom-bust cycles of development. If these phenomena are widespread across developing countries, then long-run expansion of agricultural land could be associated with lower levels of real income per capita, which may also fluctuate with prolonged expansion. A panel analysis conducted over 1961-2015 for 98 developing economies fails to reject this hypothesis. Policies should aim to decouple socio-economic gains through agricultural development from continued land expansion, and greater investments are needed to support smallholder agriculture, land distribution and livelihoods in these areas.

AB What is the impact of sustainability certification on food security in developing countries? This article explores the issue through a systematic review of the extant scholarship, complemented by a selective review of key studies examining the wider socio-economic effects of certification that may affect food security indirectly. To guide the analysis, we identify three main causal mechanisms - economic, land use and land rights, and gender effects - that link certification to local food security. Our review finds that food security remains a blind spot in the literature on certification impacts. Existing research points to a positive, albeit weak and highly contextdependent, relationship between certification, farmers' income, and food security. However, there is only indicative evidence about the relationships that link certification to food security via its influence on land use, land rights, and gender equality.

AB The rapid building infrastructure development consumes natural/non-renewable resources, generate waste, and releases potentially hazardous emissions into atmosphere affecting the environment, social, economic, and technological aspects (sustainable indicators) throughout their whole life-cycle. This necessitates assessment of the degree of sustainability of the building in developing countries like India considering local context, topography, climatic variations, and regional differences. The comparitive study on most widely used existing assessment tools like LEED, GRIHA, IGBC, and BREEAM reveals that there are some limitations when applied to Indian context. The objective of the study is to quantify and assess the performance of new and existing buildings towards sustainability by interrelating the sustainable indicators and their criteria. This evaluation approach provides a deep insight into developing a sustainable building assessment tool (SBAT), which can be referred and recommended in assessing the sustainable building performance compared to various available tools. The developed holistic framework will facilitate the decision makers/stakeholders to improve the sustainable performance of buildings in developing countries like India.

AB Malnutrition and lack of economic sustainability are major problems in developing countries. This study was conducted to evaluate and compare the nutrients' contents of three locally grown nuts in Nigeria (local groundnut, Kampala groundnut and breadnut) and highlight their health and economic potentials. Proximate analysis, chemical properties, minerals and fatty acids composition of the nuts were determined. The highest protein, crude fibre and carbohydrate contents were found in Kampala groundnut, local groundnut and breadnut respectively. Their sodium-potassium ratios were all less than 1.0 and their oils have mainly unsaturated fatty acids. Their acid values ranged between (2.41-6.34 mgKOH/g) while the iodine values were between 36.0 and 93.0 I-2 g/100 g. Analysis of the nuts and their oils indicated that they could help in solving malnutrition problem and also boost nations' economy. Encouraging their large scale production can enhance adequate nutrition and sustain industrial growth in developing countries.

Many organizations, like United Nations, and countries have been working to improve the level of living of people especially in the developing part of the world for many years. In this case the poverty chain which undeveloped and developing countries are facing very much is the huge barrier for these countries to develop their economies. To break the poverty chain, developing countries must have development objectives and an efficient development strategy; furthermore these strategies must be applied ambitiously to get success. Studies have shown that stray, not well planned and not intentioned and half-hearted initiatives have not been sufficient for sustainable development. International cooperation and trade is one of the important steps, may be the first, for sustainable development and full benefit of countries efforts can be realized only with an effective international action. We know that however great undeveloped and developing countries efforts, these will not be sufficient to enable these countries to achieve the desired development goals as expeditiously as they must unless they are assisted through expanded financial resources and more effective economic and commercial policies by the developed countries. In this context since last two decades participation in Global Value Chains has been seen a new and popular way of development together with former strategies like an industrial development strategy.

TI Does development assistance reduce climate vulnerability in developing
   countries? an empirical investigation
SO CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Increasing climate vulnerability in developing countries impedes inclusive and sustainable development. The paper examines the linkages between official development assistance (ODA) and climate vulnerability while analysing the mediating role of adaptation readiness in 119 developing countries using a panel correlated standard error estimator. The study also investigates the relationship between ODA's sectoral composition and climate vulnerability. The findings reveal that ODA is positively associated with climate vulnerability across all models and regions. However, ODA disbursement according to governance readiness criteria is associated with low vulnerability. The sectoral analysis reveals that the share of social infrastructure, humanitarian, and debt assistance is more in highly vulnerable countries. In contrast, these countries receive less aid specific to production, economic infrastructure, and multi-sector, and donors commit most climate-related ODA in these sectors. Overall, findings suggest a lack of adaptation mainstreaming into ODA disbursements. Furthermore, it calls for exploiting unexplored opportunities for vulnerability reduction through ODA in those sectors where the share of ODA is high in vulnerable countries.

AB This paper is an attempt to explore the barriers to integrating sustainability into construction project management in developing countries. To this end, a comprehensive review of the literature is conducted, as a result of which a list of 30 barriers is culled from existing studies. The list of barriers is subsequently assessed in terms of relative importance index (RII) through a survey questionnaire administered to Iranian construction industry experts, resulting in a dataset of 176 completed questionnaires. Findings bring to light the most influential barriers to incorporating sustainability in construction projects for a developing country. These were: (1) lack of understanding of the potential self-benefits of proactivity and high economic risks that unsustainable practices may carry, (2) inadequate assessment of risks and a silo-based approach, namely, insufficient cooperation among practitioners, research institutions and environmental organisations and (3) the lack of a systematic approach to planning and acting for the fulfilment of sustainability goals. As one of the first studies in its kind, the paper offers invaluable insight for researchers, practitioners, and policy makers, in supporting the transition of construction project management practices towards fulfilling sustainable development goals.

TI The poverty-environment nexus in developing countries: Evidence from
   heterogeneous panel causality methods, robust to cross-sectional
   dependence
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The impact of poverty on environmental quality, or the reverse impact, has already been addressed in many studies. In these earlier studies, CO2 emissions were frequently used to measure environmental quality, and inappropriate analysis methods were employed. Against this backdrop, the present study aimed to reinvestigate the relationship between poverty and the environment from a causality point of view, using a sample of 91 developing countries between 1990 and 2015. This study utilised the ecological footprint (EFP) to capture environmental quality instead of CO2 emissions. Second-generation tools were employed that addressed/mitigated heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence when analysing the panel data. The results showed evidence of dependency between the cross-sections and the sample was found to be heterogenous. The heterogeneous panel causality analysis results showed that while a bidirectional causality relationship between poverty and the ecological footprint was discovered for the global panel and the African region, no causality was detected for the developing countries in the Asian and Latin American & Caribbean regions.

AB This study develops a theoretical model of the linkages between the concepts of sustainable development, CSR, social capital and corporate sustainability. It investigates the process under which a strategic CSR program of a company actually builds the capacity of small enterprises, thereby improving the company's supply chain and sustainability. This research used an exploratory qualitative case study to understand the evolution of the linkages between sustainable development, CSR, social capital and corporate sustainability longitudinally, from 1980 to 2011. Primary and secondary data from company documents, archival records, interviews and observations were analysed to develop a theory. A single case study of micro, medium and small enterprise development (the MSME program) of Astra International (Astra) in the context of Indonesia was chosen as an exemplary case study for theoretical or purposive sampling. The study finds the importance for company to play both public and private roles in achieving its triple bottom line in developing countries. Astra's CSR program is driven by the company' intention to fulfil its needs of strong supply chain by solving the issue of low capacity of MSMEs in Indonesia. By conducting the MSME program, the company builds social capital that improves the capabilities of the owners and workers of small enterprises along the company's supply chain, so they become reliable partners in achieving the company's sustainability objectives. The theoretical model from the research can be replicated by other companies operating in emerging economies. This research adds to the growing number of developing country case studies, particularly from Indonesia, a very large developing country that has been under-researched.

TI Grid-Connected Systems for Sustainable Transport in Developing Countries
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION
AB Developing countries need effective transport systems for economic and other development. Available systems have almost complete reliance on internal combustion engines fueled by petroleum products whose cost may soon rise dramatically. Grid-connected vehicles (GCVs) have low at-vehicle energy use and can depend on a wide range of renewable energy sources. They have familiar application in public transport vehicles (e.g., trolley buses). Adaptations could be used for freight transport. Deployment of GCV-based systems could provide developing countries with adequate, sustainable transport and enable these countries to leapfrog over developed countries' transport strategies.

TI Direct payments for biodiversity conservation in developing countries:
   practical insights for design and implementation
SO ORYX
AB The idea of direct payments for biodiversity conservation in developing countries has generated much debate. Despite substantial experience with related economic instruments in high-income countries such approaches are rare in tropical developing countries, where conservation action is most urgently needed. We explore current experience with the application of direct payments in developing countries through an extensive review and subsequent analysis of the efforts of Conservation International. Our review identifies a broad spectrum of possible direct payment contracts. However, we focus on those involving international conservation interests. Firstly, we develop a framework for the design of direct payment applications, addressing four major aspects: contractual arrangements, definition of conservation services, performance payments, and monitoring and enforcement systems. Secondly, we discuss implementation issues, highlighting the need to consider social factors such as participatory processes, property rights, local institutions and contract legitimacy. Finally, we discuss important considerations for future payment schemes. These include the need for social responsibility, as well as rigorous assessments of effectiveness. We conclude that direct payments show potential as an innovative tool for engaging local communities or resource users in conservation and as a mechanism for channelling global investments in biodiversity conservation services to site-based initiatives.

TI Enhancing pharmacists' role in developing countries to overcome the
   challenge of antimicrobial resistance: a narrative review
SO ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE AND INFECTION CONTROL
AB Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health challenge and developing countries are more vulnerable to the adverse health impacts of AMR. Health care workers including pharmacists can play a key role to support the appropriate use of antimicrobials in developing countries and reduce AMR.
   Objective: The aim of this review is to investigate the role of pharmacists in the appropriate use of antibiotics and to identify how the pharmacists' role can be enhanced to combat AMR in developing countries.
   Method: The databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched for articles published between 2000 and the end of August 2017 that involved studies on the role of pharmacists in developing countries, the expanded services of pharmacists in patient care in developed countries and pharmacists' contributions in antimicrobial use in both developed and developing nations.
   Key findings: In developing countries pharmacists role in patient care are relatively limited. However, in developed nations, the pharmacists' role has expanded to provide multifaceted services in patient care resulting in improved health outcomes from clinical services and reduced health care costs. Success stories of pharmacist-led programs in combating AMR demonstrates that appropriately trained pharmacists can be part of the solution to overcome the global challenge of AMR. Pharmacists can provide education to patients enabling them to use antibiotics appropriately. They can also provide guidance to their healthcare colleagues on appropriate antibiotic prescribing.
   Conclusions: This review highlights that appropriately trained pharmacists integrated into the health care system can make a significant impact in minimising inappropriate antibiotic use in developing countries. Strengthening and enhancing the pharmacists' role in developing countries has the potential to positively impact the global issue of AMR.

TI The Future of Sustainable Tourism in Developing Countries
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB The term green tourism' is often used in conjunction with the desire for a balanced approach to tourism planning. Green tourism' is defined as tourism that enhances the local cultural elements, operating under the control of local communities, providing employment and maintaining the economic benefits within the local communities. In fact, the above definition is often poorly attested, since there are times when the economic benefits escape from local communities. For its part the tourist industry uses the term green tourism' as a message to tourists on energy saving, avoiding coastal pollution etc. Sometimes the same tourist businesses are accused of using the label green' primarily for marketing purposes. This paper shows that governments have a crucial role regarding encouragement to use cleaner technologies in the tourism sector and presenting different approaches for sustainability to be achieved in developing countries.

AB In the last 20 years, a number of solid waste management projects have been carried out in developing countries, in collaboration with external support agencies. Some projects were successful in producing lasting impacts on the improvement of solid waste management in developing countries. However, many projects could not support themselves or expand further when the external agencies discontinued their support. A number of technical, financial, institutional, economic and social factors contribute to the failure to sustain the projects, and they vary from project to project.
   Often the recipient countries and cities tend to accept whatever resources provided to them without due consideration to subsequent resource requirements. The external support agencies have limitations in the amount of resources they can provide and the mandates and modes under which they can operate projects. Sometimes, projects are initiated with specific aims and expected outputs, but their scopes are not comprehensive enough to consider external factors influencing them. The external support agencies often do not fully understand socio-economic, cultural and political factors influencing the selection of appropriate solid waste management systems. In other cases, very limited follow-up support, including human resource development activities necessary to sustain the project implementation, is provided by the external support agencies.
   These problems and constraints associated with external support agencies' collaboration with developing countries in solid waste management can be minimized, and the sustainability of such collaborative projects improved by packaging efforts of external support agencies; defining clear roles of relevant agencies and improving their coordination in developing countries; creating key human resources; supporting strategic planning and follow-up implementation; developing self-financing schemes; and raising awareness of the public and decision makers.

AB Apart from the goal of the digital world and other benefits of e-commerce, it becomes the need of time during this COVID-19 pandemic. Successful implementation and sustainable growth of e-commerce in developing countries is a challenge. The goal of the digital world without the implementation and sustainable growth of e-commerce in developing countries is incomplete. Based on UTAUT theory, we have developed an integrated model to study the developing countries' consumers' adoption intentions towards e-commerce. We collected a valid useable sample of 796 respondents from a developing country, applied the SEM-ANN two-step hybrid approach to testing the proposed hypothesis, and ranked the antecedents according to their importance. Results revealed that Trust in e-commerce, Perceived risk of using e-commerce, Ease of use in e-commerce, Curiosity about e-commerce, Facilitating Conditions, and Awareness of e-commerce benefits influence the adoption intentions of developing countries' consumers. Sensitivity analysis results revealed that Ease of use in e-commerce platforms and awareness of e-commerce benefits are the two most crucial factors behind the adoption intentions in developing countries. The study's findings help authorities adopt sustainable e-commerce, multinational companies effectively market their goods online, and academics better understand how inhabitants of developing nations perceive e-commerce.

TI Do bilateral trade relationships influence the distribution of CDM
   projects?
SO CLIMATE POLICY
AB The use of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is increasingly widespread in developing countries. However, CDM projects are still far from being an effective development activity due to the uneven distribution of these projects in a few relatively well-off economies. One potential cause of this imbalance is analysed in terms of the trade relationships between developed and developing countries. By applying a gravity model to a panel dataset, well-established export flows from developed economies towards developing countries are shown to explain why a large proportion of CDM projects are unevenly geographically distributed. This kind of lock-in effect regarding the CDM between developed and developing countries could be avoided by both enhancing the institutional framework in developing countries that host CDM projects and reinforcing compulsory rules for CDM destinations in the least-developed economies.

TI The Relationship between Democracy and Economic Growth in the Path of
   Sustainable Development
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Democracy has both a direct and an indirect relationship with sustainable development. Democracy is related to the movement toward long-term economic development directly, and indirectly, democracy can provide the means to create the institutional structures needed to create links between the political systems, the culture of participation, and the social values of a society. Since economic development is a multidimensional concept and one of its primary requirements is to achieve a high level of income and appropriate economic growth, knowing the relationship between democracy and economic growth is especially important for policymakers. Many important questions are raised about the relationship between democracy and economic performance. What is the relationship between democracy and economic growth? Is this relationship different in developed countries and developing countries? Considering the effects of democracy and economic growth on the welfare of communities, the main purpose of this study was to investigate the causal relationship between democracy and economic growth from 1990-2020 for the OECD and selected developing countries. The results showed that the conflict and skeptical hypotheses had been established in OECD and developing countries, respectively. It was concluded that the pattern of economic growth and development in OECD countries differed from that in developing countries. For OECD countries, real per capita GDP growth was mainly affected by previous per capita GDP growth, and the effect of democracy on per capita economic growth was negative. Moreover, the results indicated that in developing countries, democracy alone had not triggered economic growth and that real per capita GDP growth depended on other important structural variables such as social and physical infrastructure.

TI Construction debris becomes growing concern of growing cities
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB How can growing cities be expanded in a sustainable way? Huge waste generation has become a major challenge in many growing cities, particularly in developing countries. China's annual C&D waste generation was and estimated 2.4 billion tonnes in the past decade, which is 15 times more than municipal solid waste generation. India has less C&D waste generation than China, yet still is as high as 530 million tons in 2013. However, only around 5% of C&D waste was reused in these countries and the rest largely ends up in dumping sites for disposal. As China and other developing countries continue to urbanize in the next decades, C&D waste management will continue to be a significant challenge for urban sustain ability in terms of the environment, economics, and safety. We therefore critically reviewed the C&D waste generation, management, and challenges faced by the fast expanding cities in China and other developing countries. We also compared the current characteristics of key C&D waste systems in developing and developed countries. Recommendations for swift action are made for policy makers in growing cities.

AB Although there is an established regulatory programme for recycling of solid wastes in developed countries, improper disposal methods are still broadly adapted in developing countries. Turkey, as an economically developing country, has a number of open dumps in operation. This creates a great risk for the environment and also for human health. However, Turkey's accession to European Union requires compliance with the European Union legislation and therefore there is currently an increasing pressure on the government authorities to develop a sustainable approach to recycling (particularly focusing on plastics) and composting activities and integrate strategies aiming at pursuing sustainable society in Turkey. In this respect, the aim of this paper is to (1) provide a review of existing situation related to municipal waste management system in Turkey and (2) identify the gaps and weaknesses of the system particularly focusing on recycling of plastics. This will aid Turkish cities to form their waste management strategy by promoting recycling activities and also developing countries which are dealing with the similar problems in their waste management mechanism.

SO URBAN PLANNING
AB Is economy-led urbanization the only answer to urban planning? By 2050, about 70% of the world population will live in urban areas, intensified by rapid urbanization in developing countries. A new urban development framework is critically relevant to investigating urban living's emerging complexity for advancing human-social-economic-environmental sustainability. The multi-disciplinary study explores a roadmap for solving industrialization's adverse effects to inform future resilient development in developing countries. The classical Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (MHN) and some scholars have stated that human physiological needs would be prioritized and fulfilled by developing countries, and psychological needs would be satisfied and desired by developed countries after fulfilling physiological needs level. Our study argued that transitoriented-development (TOD) and ICT could simultaneously fulfill some essential physio-psychological needs with digitalruralism. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was adopted to test the indicator-based MHN theory developed by literature, urban quality of life (Uqol) evaluation between the developing and developed countries, and backed by digital-ruralism success in developing China. The Uqol evaluation identifies the developing countries' subjective well-being demand as the health, mobility, governance, environment, social, economy, human capital, technology-ICT, smart living, and lifestyle, which are used to transform the classical MHN model to the indicator-based MHN model. The SEM subsequently illustrates that the observed well-being indicators are positively correlated to the TOD and ICT, defined by the proposed urbanruralism development framework. The study contributes to an innovative approach to reconnect the classical MHN theory to contemporary sustainable urban planning while narrowing the socioeconomic-environmental gap between the developed (urban) and developing (rural) domains, which encourages a paradigm shift for future resilient urban development in the developing countries.

CL LONDON, ENGLAND
AB In 1998 the Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) launched the Convention Project on Chemical Safety in developing countries. The project aims to support developing countries in the implementation of the Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions, create human resources and institutional capacities and to demonstrate via pilot measures how chemical safety in the partner countries can be improved and sustainably implemented in line with international standards. With this objective the development of a Chemical Management Guide (CM Guide) for small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries has been initiated. The guide describes a step-by-step approach which is based on identifying 'hot-spots' as a first step, and making a chemical inventory as a second step. The third step is the continuous improvement of chemical management. In total, there are six tools that aim to support the chemical management process: basic concepts for risk assessment; description of control approaches; using material safety data sheets (MSDSs); risk phrases for hazardous substances; safety phrases for hazardous substances; symbols used for labelling hazardous substances. In the course of the test-implementation of the CM Guide in Indonesia, it was found that MSDSs were not available in most of the smaller companies. In contrast, medium-sized and larger companies do have more MSDSs available. It was also found that the way to engage the minds of company owners and managers is with economic arguments related to the loss, waste and expiry of materials, and quality standards expected from importing countries.

TI Barriers and Drivers to the Adoption of Sustainable Construction
   Practices in Developing Countries: A Case Study of Venezuela
SO JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING
AB Several efforts have decreased the environmental footprint from the construction field in developed countries. In contrast, sustainability is often overlooked in developing countries due to unstable economies, monopoly, and inadequate policies, among others. It is evident from recent studies that sustainable construction practices are urgently needed in developing countries to reinstate construction methods, which in their current state deplete resources, damage the environment, and threaten the stakeholders' health and well-being. Venezuela, a developing country in Latin America, is currently experiencing such issues within the construction industry due to political and economic cataclysms in addition to humanitarian, environmental, and health facets. This study seeks to identify key information that will facilitate the comprehensive understanding of major barriers and drivers to the adoption of proven sustainable construction practices, particularly in Venezuela. To achieve this objective, the study conducted a systematic literature review as well as multiple focus group discussions and questionnaire surveys to construction stakeholders in Venezuela. The analysis of the survey results confirmed that there are delays in the integration of sustainable construction practices due to factors such as inflation, lack of environmental awareness, and corruption, among others. The results also highlighted that professionals with higher academic backgrounds and trained for sustainable construction practices, particularly women professionals, are more likely to advocate for such practices within Venezuela. The findings of this study contribute to two bodies of knowledge: first, the construction management through embracing sustainable planning, design, and construction within the built environment; and second, sustainable construction through encouraging the adoption of integrative project delivery methods as well as sustainable training and practices specifically in developing countries. This paradigm shift toward embracing sustainable practices in developing countries promises the reduction of environmental impacts while nurturing a healthier built environment. Moreover, it also highlights the critical need to encourage solving such barriers and ensuring a sustainable future. (C) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Access to substantial quantity and quality energy infrastructures is essential to rapid and sustainable economic development. Access to modern energy services directly contributes to economic growth and poverty reduction through the creation of wealth. No country can develop and sustain beyond subsistence means without having at least minimum access to energy services for the larger portion of its population. The present study examines the households' access to modern energy (electricity) services and pattern of energy consumption in Nigeria. It was found that the access to modern form of energy in the country is very low despite the country's abundant energy endowment. Greater proportions (over 40%) of Nigerian households do not have access to electricity and still depend largely on traditional forms of energy (e.g., firewood and kerosene) as energy sources.

TI Environmental Upgrading of Developing Country Firms in Global Value
   Chains
SO BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB While the strategic management literature on corporate social responsibility (CSR) is abundant, it tends to consider the context of developed countries, with a focus on certain specific issues such as the strategic behaviour of firms with regard to sustainable development and the economic benefits of CSR practices. The present study examines the influence of western organizations on responsible corporate behaviour in developing countries, an issue that has been somewhat neglected in the existing academic literature. In particular, it explores the environmental upgrading of developing country firms in global value chains.
   This research, conducted with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method, involves 24 Tunisian olive oil companies. The findings indicate that exporting companies have indeed benefited from environmental upgrading, but, because of the cooperation strategy adopted by leading western firms (imposition of standards) and the absence of financial and technical assistance, the extent of environmental upgrading remains limited.

   evidence from panel data
SO ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB Universal energy access in developing countries is a key ingredient to achieve sustainable economic growth and social welfare. Therefore, it is of paramount importance for policymakers to identify potential new factors to mitigate energy poverty. In this study, we investigate the effects of workers' remittances on energy poverty in 109 developing countries from 2000 to 2019 using panel fixed and random effects as well as the system generalized method of moment and Lewbel (2012) estimators to address potential endogeneity problems. We demonstrate that remittances can be effectively used to alleviate energy poverty in low and middle-income countries. Moreover, we find that income poverty, human development, institutional quality, and income inequality are important mediating channels through which remittances affect energy poverty. Our results also indicate that improved financial development and increased urbanization tend to enhance energy access. Based on our findings, several recommendations are provided to governments and policymakers for achieving sustainable development goal target 7.1, which aims to guarantee affordable, reliable, and modern energy services for all.

TI The carbon footprint of capital formation: An empirical analysis on its
   relationship with a country's income growth
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY
AB Infrastructure development, often referred to as fixed capital formation, is imperative for developing countries not only to provide essential services but also to drive their economic activities. Capital investments, on the other hand, have been accused of expediting resource depletion and environmental degradation, including climate change, because infrastructure construction requires significant amounts of resource and energy inputs that inevitably accompany carbon dioxide emissions. Considering that the upscaling of Western-type infrastructure stocks to the global level may easily compromise the 2 degrees C target under the Paris Agreement, it is crucial to understand how capital formation by developing countries affects their carbon footprint (CF) and explore ways to avoid its excessive accumulation. This study aims to empirically find out how CF from capital formation evolves along various countries' development pathways by employing the multi-regional input-output model with a particular focus on the gross fixed capital formation as the final-demand category. It also aims to identify well-performing countries that make growth with fewer CFs from capital formation and assess the reasons behind it through structural decomposition analysis. It has been found that the developing countries that invested in more carbon-intensive capital formation achieved faster economic growth. In order to pursue carbon-neutral growth globally, these countries need to lower their CFs through the proactive improvement of their emission coefficient and energy efficiencies. Proper environmental space for CF accumulation needs to be left for the low-income developing countries to make investments for their future capital formation and income growth.

Several studies from the South have indicated that most Northern studies overestimale Southern emissions and responsibilities The central points of this article are that the North understates the potential costs of reducing energy consumption in the South, and the economic policy usually advocated in the North to curb carbon emissions-a carbon tax-is among the most costly alternatives for the South.

AB Access to modern energy services in developing countries (DC) is a double-faced challenge. About 1.3billion people do not have access to electricity; 2.6 billion rely on traditional use of biomass for cooking. Solutions to this energy challenge can neither be through isolated promotion of individual technologies nor fuel switching alone. A "system approach" towards a more comprehensive energy access strategy is required. Such access strategy would comprise of the supply of alternative energy carriers and planning of complete energy solutions via a more comprehensive and sustainable Rural Energy Planning (REP) i.e. Sustainable Energization (SE). Existing procedures to SE do not account for the existing energy balance and have not been demonstrated in the context of rural areas. The study aimed to propose and consolidate a more comprehensive REP procedure for SE of rural areas of DC. A seven-step procedure is proposed and its relevance and validity demonstrated through a field case study. The proposed procedure takes into account the existing energy balance and integrates energy drivers in the energy services supply network. Application of the procedure in a rural context showed a great improvement in the quantity, quality, and variety of accessible and affordable energy services for a more sustainable development of rural areas.

SO ENERGY POLICY
AB In developing countries, providing all citizens an access to modern forms of energy is among the central energy policy objectives, as the linkages between modern energy services and human development are widely recognized. This paper presents in a scenario analysis of rural energy consumption, how energy services in different sectors of a village economy contribute to the achievement of the UNDP Millennium Development Goals. In a rural village in Lao People's Democratic Republic, household energy demand and energy uses were surveyed immediately prior to the electrification of the village. Based on the situation preceding electrification of the village, the development of village electrification was studied by simulating the village energy system, accounting for all village energy uses but transportation. To study the potential development of electricity demand in the village, three scenarios were constructed using the LEAP model: "residential demand", "income generation" and "public services". Energy demand in each scenario was analyzed with reference to the Millennium Development Goals. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Short-term service-learning programs that focus on global health are expanding rapidly, spurred by students' desire to be of service in a world that has been made to seem small by new technology and universities' willingness to embrace the goal of educating global citizens. In this commentary, the author uses experiences from a recent trip she led to Ghana as a backdrop against which to explore some of the ethical and practical issues that arise when U.S. students work in health-related programs in developing countries. At minimum, the author argues, these programs should lead students to consider issues such as which basic services people are entitled to, regardless of where and in what circumstances they live, and how differences in access to social and economic resources contribute to health disparities on a global scale. She also suggests that sponsoring institutions should consider what is owed to the countries and communities in which their students learn. Finally, she underscores the circumstances under which service-learning programs can truly benefit the cause of global health.

TI IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS OF PRICE POLICY AND LAND DEGRADATION ON
   AGRICULTURAL GROWTH IN DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES
SO AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB In many developing countries, a high proportion of the population resides and works in rural areas. Agriculture is the dominant sector in rural areas and has the greatest concentration of poverty:  landless workers, small tenant farmers, and small farm owners. Thus, any development strategy that is directed towards increasing employment and alleviating a country's hunger must concentrate on sustainable agricultural growth.
   Historically, economic development in most countries has been based on exploitation of natural resources, particularly land resources. Soil erosion and land degradation have been serious worldwide. Due to reasons such as high population pressure on land and limited fossil energy supplies, land degradation is generally more serious in the developing world. Empirical studies show that soil erosion and degradation of agricultural land not only decrease the land productivity but they can also result in major downstream or off-site damage which may be several times that of on-site damage.
   In promoting industrialization, governments of many developing countries adopt a package of price and other policies that reduce agricultural production incentives and encourage a flow of resources out of agriculture. Increasing evidence shows that these policies cause a substantial efficiency or social welfare loss, and a great loss in foreign exchange earnings. In addition, a World Bank study on the effect of price distortions on economic growth rates concluded that neither rich resource endowments, nor a high stage of economic development, nor privatization are able to make up the adverse effects caused by high price distortions.
   This analysis is primarily concerned with identifying the factors that determine the agricultural production growth rate and in testing the effects these factors have on agricultural growth in developing countries. Specifically, this study involves statistical estimation of an aggregate agricultural growth function based on cross-country data for 28 developing countries. Special attention is devoted to land degradation and agricultural pricing policy, and to the policy implications resulting from the effects these variables have on agricultural and food production growth.
   The overall results of this study show that price distortions in the economy and land degradation had statistically significant negative impacts while the change in arable and permanent land was positively related to the growth of agricultural production and food production in 28 developing countries from 1971 to 1980. These results emphasize the importance of 'getting prices right' and implementation of sustainable land and water management practices if future growth in food and agricultural output is to be realized and sustained in developing countries.

TI Implementation Barriers for a System of Environmental-Economic
   Accounting in Developing Countries and Its Implications for Monitoring
   Sustainable Development Goals
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The desire to include environmental information in national accounts has resulted in the construction of a system of environmental-economic accounting (SEEA). As the international statistical standard for environmental-economic accounting, the SEEA can provide valuable support for monitoring Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study assesses the potential use of the SEEA for monitoring SDGs. This paper shows that, in theory, the potential for this system is significant. However, based on a literature review and survey of SEEA experts, practical problems in implementing the SEEA are significant, especially in developing countries. Such issues include data availability and quality, as well as the availability of funding and human resources. Capacity development is key to establishing successful implementation of the SEEA in developing countries. For example, the World Bank's WAVES program (Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services) has been instrumental in capacity building in developing countries, which, however, still show great variation in how they implement SEEA.

TI To pass (or not to pass) through international fuel price changes to
   domestic fuel prices in developing countries: What are the drivers?
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB This paper attempts to shed light on the drivers causing international fuel prices to be passed through to domestic retail fuel prices. While many developing countries limit the international fuel price pass through to domestic fuel prices, others do not. In the former, large fuel subsidies can emerge, thereby threatening fiscal sustainability, worsening income distribution and setting back efforts to fight climate change. Against this backdrop, we examine the factors that determine whether governments allow international fuel price changes to be passed through to domestic prices in developing countries using a dataset spanning 109 developing countries from 2000 to 2014. The paper finds that the pass-through is higher when changes in international prices are moderate and less volatile. In addition, the flexibility of the pricing mechanism allows for higher pass-through while exchange rate depreciation and lower retail fuel prices in neighboring countries inhibit it. The econometric results also underscore the fact that countries with inflation tend to experience lower pass-through, whereas those with high public debt exhibit larger pass-through. Finally, no evidence is found that political variables or environmental policies matter with regard to fuel price dynamics in the short-term. These findings, which are consistent across fuel products (gasoline, diesel and kerosene), allow us to draw important policy lessons for fuel subsidy reforms.

TI A Review of Literature on the Antecedents of Electric Vehicles
   Promotion: Lessons for Value Chains in Developing Countries
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT
AB Electric vehicles (EVs) are a part of the solution to the growing challenges of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. The adoption of EV is more pronounced in developed countries than in developing countries. Research on EV adoption is also primarily focused on developed countries. Many of the antecedents of EV promotion noted in the literature do not apply in developing countries because of weak market structures, infrastructure networks, and economies. Moreover, no one study provides a comprehensive understanding of these antecedents. This article identifies the antecedents of EV promotion and explores their utility in developing countries. The literature is searched using the Web of Science database; 198 relevant papers were reviewed using an inductive-deductive approach. The inductive approach is meant to explore the antecedents of EV adoption, while the deductive approach focuses on unraveling how these antecedents unspool in developed countries and can be employed in developing countries. The recursive use of the inductive-deductive approach leads to the development of a taxonomy that further categorizes the antecedents as micro-, macro-, and meso-level antecedents. The taxonomy of antecedents can be used to orchestrate structured and coherent efforts toward promoting EV in developing countries. The article also highlights the need for contextualizing antecedents to the unique infrastructural-, economic-, and market-needs of developing countries. The article provides a foundational understanding for future research focused on the empirical examination of the antecedents of EV.

TI Are Trade and Forests Survival Compatible?
SO FUTURE OF THE WORLDS FORESTS: IDEAS VS IDEOLOGIES
SE World Forests
AB This chapter examines the question of whether trade in forest products from developing countries adds or subtracts value from the standing forests in those countries, and what potential the trade instrument may have in promoting sustainable forest management in developing countries. It is important to bear in mind that only a few tropical countries export a significant proportion of their output, and that in general demand for forest products within developing and transitional economies has been growing rapidly. It is also the case that plantations are rapidly substituting for natural forest outputs in developing countries, not only for commodity grade material, but increasingly for higher quality raw material as well.
   Forest products trade issues have come before the World Trade Organization (WTO) and international consultations in the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF) and the International Tropical Timber Organization. Voluntary certification of timber for compliance with sustainable forest management guidelines has grown quickly in the recent two decades, but has to date not produced significant price incentives for certified product from developing countries, nor major impact on deforestation. Illegal logging remains a major impediment to sustainable forest management in general in developing countries: the trade instrument will have some role in addressing this, but much more will be required for success.

AB Access to energy is crucial in tackling many of the current global development challenges that impact on people's economic, health and social well-being as well as the ability to meet the commitments of reducing carbon emissions through clean energy use. Despite increased attention from multiple governments and agencies, energy poverty remains a serious sustainable development issue in many developing countries. To date, most research have focused on general access to electricity and the generation of clean energy to replace fossil fuels, failing to address the lack of basic access to clean energy for cooking and heating. More people in the world lack access to clean cooking fuels than to electricity. This issue is one aspect of a broader research which investigates the impacts of optimized energy policy and energy business models on sustainable development in developing countries.

AB For developing countries like Turkey which lack of sufficient amount of oil and energy resources, real exchange rate and real oil prices are important for sustainable economic growth rate. The academic accounts focusing on the fluctuation in both factors in the oil exporting and developed countries also show that real oil prices are influential in determining the real exchange rates. There are only a few works on the developing countries. In the non-oil exporting-developing countries, real oil price is affected by the fluctuations in the real exchange rate which require changes to the macro-economic policies. This paper investigates the long-run relationship between real oil prices and real exchange rates by using a monthly data from 02:2001 to 07:2011. In the work, cointegration with structural breaks tests by Perron veKejriwal (2009) are used.

AB The emergence of new and innovative mobile payment mechanisms marks a significant breakthrough in the pursuit of affordable and sustainable energy access for poor households. The integration of mobile telephony infrastructure in energy service payment mechanisms enables rural and urban households to access decentralised renewable energy products and services. These include mini-grids, solar home systems (SHSs) and, more recently, pico-solar systems including solar lanterns. In Africa, energy delivery business models that use Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) mobile payment systems have been developed by several businesses, including M-KOPA Solar in Kenya, Off Grid Electric in Tanzania and Econet Solar in Zimbabwe. Business model innovation enables greater affordability and choice for energy poor households through frequent, incremental and flexible payment options that mirror the income patterns of indigent households. Furthermore the unbanked urban and rural populations are reached and offered an alternative form of micro-financing for energy services and simple mobile money payment options through cellphones. Payment mechanisms that address affordability and payment flexibility could significantly contribute to the scaling up of modem energy access. This paper analyses the application of mobile payment mechanisms that could enable energy access in terms of billing, payment and usage monitoring. It furthermore explores critical success factors for the upscaling of effective mobile enabled payment mechanisms for energy services in other countries.

AB Most of our understanding of SLE and its negative impact originates from developed countries. This review aims to collate existing literature on Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in SLE patients living in developing countries to identify the gaps for the focus of future research. A narrative literature review was compiled using selected MeSH terms to search EBSCOHOST for articles published between January 1975 and February 2018 pertaining to HRQoL in SLE patients in developing countries. 31 studies from 11 countries were included for analysis. Only one longitudinal, one randomized controlled trial (RCT), one qualitative study, and two intervention studies were found. High disease activity and organ damage were associated with poor functional ability, mental health and low socio-economic status (SES). Poor SES is a recurring theme in developing countries, and worsens all SLE outcomes by reducing access to healthcare, mental, social and emotional support systems. In developing countries, SLE has a globally negative impact on patients' HRQoL, similar to that seen in developed countries. There is an urgent need for more HRQoL studies, and in particular, longitudinal, qualitative and interventional studies in these countries to investigate unmet needs, and to explore novel strategies to improve patient outcomes.

SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB The main aim of this paper is to examine the threshold impact of financial development and trade liberalization on income inequality as a measure of sustainable development in a sample of developed and developing countries using panel threshold analysis. Two major dimensions of financial development are considered: liquid liabilities and stock market capitalization. The empirical results revealed that financial development reduces income inequality only in countries where their GDP per capita is above ~US$11,000. It has no significant impact in reducing inequality in developing countries. This implies that institutional reforms in less developed and developing countries are necessary in order to reap the gains from financial development. Trade liberalization is found to have a positive impact on income inequality for both country groups-that is, trade benefits have worsened the income distribution.

TI Small-scale fisheries in developed countries: Looking beyond developing
   country narratives through Japan's perspective
SO MARINE POLICY
AB Dialogue on improving small-scale fisheries for food security tends to centre on developing countries due to the generally more acute socio-economic problems these countries face in meeting global Sustainable Development Goals. Current management approaches to improve small-scale fisheries thus tend to cater specifically to the context of developing country fishers. This inadvertently excludes the small-scale fisheries of developed countries from international dialogue, which is a missed opportunity given the insights that can be drawn from understanding progressive challenges that emerge as small-scale fisheries evolve through different stages of socio-economic development. Japan is a developed country whose small-scale fisheries cannot be ignoredyet, most international dialogue about Japanese fisheries centre on its industrial fisheries. Against this backdrop, we stress that it is essential to raise the profile of Japanese and other developed country small-scale fisheries in order to ensure that challenges and potential solutions to their future ecological and socio-economic sustainability are heard and included in the global small-scale fisheries dialogue.

AB It is argued that conditions for social justice in developing countries are deficient under both state capitalism ("democracy") and neopatrimonialism. Development assistance is similarly constrained, but it also has shortcomings in relation to "democracy" promotion. Political economy analyses can provide authentic insights into how poor people negotiate for public goods, but such interactions seem unlikely to yield sustainable social justice for most citizens. The assessment calls for a reconfiguration of power relations and a more egalitarian distribution of public goods within and between countries, which is what most people are predisposed to want and are entitled to expect and enjoy.

CL Dublin, IRELAND
AB Many software development organizations are classified as Very Small Entities (VSEs) with limited number of staff to implement full size of software development lifecycles standards (SDLC) such as ISO/IEC 12207 in their software projects. To make VSEs easier to implement lifecycles, ISO/IEC 29110 is a Standard specifically for VSEs; one of the parts defines a cut-down set of processes specifically tailored for VSEs. There are two frequently used processes (Software Development Process and Project Management Process) however; some VSEs seek for more support in SDLC selection. This paper investigates the differences of VSEs from different economic regions and argues that VSEs in developing countries usually can afford more staff due to much lower salary rates in those countries. Therefore they are capable of implementing more labor consuming processes compared to their counterparts in the developed countries. The paper then proposes an additional process (Process Improvement Process) as an extension for the current ISO/IEC 29110. Furthermore, through the aspects of economic feasibility and development sustainability, the paper justifies that the proposed process is valuable for VSEs in developing countries.

AB In the networked economy firms are recognizing the power of the Internet as a platform for creating different forms of relationships and collaborations aimed to enhance value and achieve a sustainable competitive advantage. Digital Marketplaces represent one of the most powerful solutions adopted by firms to support the networking practices among firms, especially among SMEs. However in developing countries the potentialities of digital marketplaces remains largely unexploited. Different human, organizational and technological factors, issues and problems pertain in these countries, requiring focused studies and appropriate approaches. This article argues that in order for firms in developing countries to benefit from digital marketplace platforms it is necessary to root them in an assessment study which permits to understand the firms preparedness to use the digital marketplace in terms of technological infrastructure, human resources' capabilities and skills, integration and innovation level among firms. Based on the outcomes of this assessment it is then possible to find out a viable digital marketplace model that fits with actual readiness status of firms and helps them to develop progressively the necessary resources and capabilities to enhance their competitiveness in the current digital economic landscape.

CL COLUMBUS, OH
AB In many developing countries, a large proportion of the population resides and works in rural areas. Agriculture is the dominant sector in rural areas and has the greatest concentration of poverty: landless workers, small tenant farmers, and small farm owners. Thus, any development strategy that is directed towards increasing employment and alleviating a country's hunger must concentrate on sustainable agricultural growth. Historically, economic development, in most countries, has been based on exploitation of natural resources, particularly land resources - in large part because these resources have been undervalued by private markets and political systems. Soil erosion and land degradation have been serious worldwide. Due to reasons such as high population pressure on land, and limited fossil energy supplies, land degradation is more serious in the developing world. Empirical studies show that soil erosion and degradation of agricultural land not only decrease land productivity but that they can also result in major downstream or off-site damage (e.g. reduction of hydroelectric production) which may be several times that of on-site damage. An earlier analysis identified the factors that determine the agricultural production growth rate in 28 developing countries. This study involved statistical estimation of an aggregate agricultural growth function based on cross-country data. The overall results showed that price distortions in the economy and land degradation had statistically significant negative impacts while the change in arable and permanent land was positively related to the growth of agricultural production and food production in 28 developing countries from 1971 to 1980. These results emphasize the importance of 'getting prices right' and implementation of sustainable land and water management practices if future growth in food and agricultural output is to be realized and sustained in developing countries.

TI Human aflatoxicosis in developing countries: a review of toxicology,
   exposure, potential health consequences, and interventions
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION
AB Aflatoxins are well recognized as a cause of liver cancer, but they have additional important toxic effects. In farm and laboratory animals, chronic exposure to aflatoxins compromises immunity and interferes with protein metabolism and multiple micronutrients that are critical to health. These effects have not been widely studied in humans, but the available information indicates that at least some of the effects observed in animals also occur in humans. The prevalence and level of human exposure to aflatoxins on a global scale have been reviewed, and the resulting conclusion was that approximate to4.5 billion persons living in developing countries are chronically exposed to largely uncontrolled amounts of the toxin. A limited amount of information shows that, at least in those locations where it has been studied, the existing aflatoxin exposure results in changes in nutrition and immunity. The aflatoxin exposure and the toxic affects of aflatoxins on immunity and nutrition combine to negatively affect health factors (including HIV infection) that account for >40% of the burden of disease in developing countries where a short lifespan is prevalent. Food systems and economics render developed-country approaches to the management of aflatoxins impractical in developing-country settings, but the strategy of using food additives to protect farm animals from the toxin may also provide effective and economical new approaches to protecting human populations.

AB Although the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the developing world host a great diversity of fruit and vegetables, there is a low availability of these products for domestic markets and local consumption. Thus there is a high risk of what is commonly known as the "hidden hunger", which includes nutrient deficiencies and non communicable diseases. Such a situation, coupled with the erosion of local cultures and indigenous knowledge, further contribute to the vicious circle which leads to poor health and environmental degradation.
   More diverse and resilient local food systems - including the sustainable management of local fruit and vegetable species - would make a significant contribution to improving diets and nutrition, and to local economic development. This is the case in the Pacific Islands. Many countries in the Pacific have a rich diversity of fruit, some unique to the Pacific, yet their poor utilization is a contributing factor to some of the highest rates of obesity and diabetes in the world.
   To benefit from the nutritional and economic values of fruits and vegetables in developing countries, public policies should be created to promote availability and consumption of fruit and vegetables. A strong public-private multi-sectoral partnership at a local level, which involves all stakeholders in the value chain, is essential. Policy support must promote best practices and apply indigenous knowledge. As increasing urbanization is a challenge in many developing countries, partnerships must undertake the issue of perishable products and promote the importance of traditional products. Innovation is key to promoting and ensuring sustainable utilization of fruit and vegetables, which should be backstopped by appropriate research actions and capacity development.

TI Importance of Land in SDG Policy Instruments: A Study of ASEAN
   Developing Countries
SO LAND
AB Allocating land-related social, economic, and legal benefits to people is crucial for meeting the commitments made by various countries for achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). Economic growth in developing countries in the Southeast Asian region is very rapid, requiring primary resources such as land, which poses challenges for implementing nationally determined commitments towards SDGs. This paper quantitatively compares the relevant policy instruments issued by the key ASEAN countries to analyze the importance of land provision in achieving the specific SDGs. Using content analysis to formulate a framework for comparing the various policy instruments and strategic plans, the article identifies the importance of land use in various policy instruments focused on achieving SDGs. Most countries use authoritative instruments to incorporate land-related aspects. The use of the symbolic, capacity-building, and incentive instruments is relatively lesser. Many countries give prominence to land for providing shelter or as an economic resource, while land use for managing gender equality is negligible. Policy makers could incorporate a more balanced mix of instruments and those addressing different dimensions of land use while redesigning their policy or strategy documents to implement SDGs.

We use expert surveys to explore the feasibility and relevance of integrated land-use planning and data acquisition in developing countries using Paraguay as an example. We identify the challenges of developing land-use plans and strategies to navigate these barriers to speed up its implementation. The results show that it might be difficult to develop an integrated land-use plan in the context of developing countries, mainly due to data availability, lack of political will, lack of stakeholder engagement, and insufficient financial and human resources. We also highlight examples of creative ways in which previous land-use planning projects and studies navigated these challenges, including stakeholder consultations, use of simpler models that required less data, prioritization of data collection, and engagement of decision makers throughout the process. We provide crucial information to improve land-use planning processes in Paraguay and across the Global South in areas with similar contexts and challenges that aim to develop in a more sustainable way.

SO REVISTA DE SALUD PUBLICA-CORDOBA
AB Productive forces and capitalist production relationships have expanded worldly. This is seen in the accumulation of capital and industrialization in Asia and Latin America, which involves a process of urbanization, a fall of rural population and proletarianization of the work force. This accumulation of capital has produced an accumulation of carbon dioxide exceeding the bearable minimum for life sustainability. It also has an influence on wealth distribution; inequality which has remained stable over the last decades. The effects of this environmental damage and inequality have an impact on the population's health. This work investigates about the dichotomy wealth - development which reflects the degree of inequality in contemporary societies and, on the other side, analyzes the effects of air and water pollution on human health. Descriptive and correlational study with cross sectional retrospective design. Results obtained show there is a strong association between growth and development. As wealth increases, the association rate decreases. Human development indicators show that, in developing countries, the most negative component is the inequality in wealth distribution. Growth and pollution are strongly associated by the use of fossil energy. The rate of change towards sustainable production systems in developed countries is very slow, whereas developing countries have become strong issuers of contaminating emissions. The business ethics ruling the system is still based on a rational and selfish being, dissociated from social aspects and the environment. There are exports of dirty industries from developed countries to developing ones. The group of underdeveloped countries makes evident some "apparently sustainable" conducts, since it uses biomass depredated from forests, doing away with sources of energy based on firewood and coal. Water polluting agents and the lack of sewerages systems are accountable for children mortality associated with diarrhea, malaria and others. The consequences on health are suffered by underdeveloped countries due to the lack of economic resources. Then we find developing countries, and in the last place developed countries which seem to minimally suffer the consequences of mortality in their population due to polluting agents.

TI Public health requirements for rapid progress in global health
SO GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Effective public health interventions can save hundreds of millions of lives in developing countries, as well as create broad social and economic benefits. Unfortunately, public health approaches and solutions applied in developed countries are often assumed to be inappropriate or unattainable in developing countries. This has sometimes forestalled effective interventions in parts of the world where they are most needed, despite conditions that now facilitate lasting solutions to both long-standing and emerging global public health problems. Core public health functions are similar regardless of a country's income level. Although some resource-intensive approaches from industrialised nations are inappropriate in less developed countries, many basic public health measures achieved decades ago in developed countries are urgently needed, highly appropriate, extremely cost-effective and eminently attainable in developing countries today. About half of the disease burden in low and middle-income countries is now from non-communicable diseases, but non-communicable disease epidemics that will otherwise increase rapidly in the developing world can be avoided or reversed. Progress of public health in developing countries is possible, but will require sufficient funding and human resources; improved physical plant and information systems; effective programme implementation and regulatory capacity; and, most importantly, political will at the highest levels of government.

TI Renewable energy technology and implementation mechanisms for Ethiopia
SO ENERGY SOURCES PART B-ECONOMICS PLANNING AND POLICY
AB The importance of providing modern energy services to rural areas cannot be overemphasized if the country is in a position to meet its Millennium Development Goals. This paper argues that the country has missed scores of opportunities in the past decades to grapple with its current energy predicament as it squandered resources on urban biased development program. The vision of linking highly dispersed rural communities to the grid has all but failed and the realization has now set in that the country needs to embark on new and imaginative policies that take seriously the centrality of energy to poverty reduction. This includes taking a closer look of what energy resources and technological options are available that would deliver increased access to modern energy services. Renewable energy technologies are central to this equation. This paper reviews the potential for expanding renewable energy use by exploring the country's resource base and the potential strategic options that are available to policy makers.

   Falsified Medicines in Cambodia, Indicated by Tablets of Sildenafil
   Citrate
SO PHARMACY
AB Medicine falsification is a global issue. Viagra, an erectile dysfunction therapeutic (EDT) medicine consisting primarily of sildenafil citrate, is the most commonly falsified medicine worldwide. Recently falsified EDTs have been reported multiple times in developing countries. The globalization of falsified EDTs has become a concern. In the present study, we selected sildenafil citrate tablets as an indicator and examined samples from a developing country, Cambodia, to investigate the availability of falsified sildenafil tablets in Cambodia and verify the current globalization status of falsified medicines from the standpoint of a developing country. Six samples of the originator Viagra, and 68 samples of generic sildenafil products were purchased from private drug outlets and wholesalers in Phnom Penh, Svay Rieng, and Battambang. The samples' manufacturers were contacted to authenticate the samples. The quantities and dissolution rates of active ingredients were measured by a high-performance liquid chromatography system with photodiode array. Five generic samples were strongly suspected to be falsified medicines because of their extremely low quality; however, there was little distribution and no falsified medicine alleged to be produced by the originator of Viagra, which charges high prices. That finding indicates that falsification reflects local economic circumstances.

TI Globalization, Policy Reforms and Productivity Growth in Developing
   Countries: Evidence from Sri Lanka
SO GLOBAL BUSINESS REVIEW
AB Sri Lanka's economic policy strategies radically moved away from inward-looking import-substituting industrialization to outward-looking export-oriented industrialization (EOI) in 1977. The EOI strategy was implemented through a broad agenda of reforms including trade liberalization, privatization of state owned enterprises and financial deregulation. These reforms had a profound impact on productivity in the export oriented production sector (primarily manufacturing) and laid the foundation for rapid growth and structural change. This study empirically analyzes the impact of policy reforms on the total factor productivity (TFP) of manufacturing industries in Sri Lanka. A balanced panel data set of all 27 manufacturing industries over 21 years is used. The industry heterogeneity effects are taken into account through the validation of a fixed effects model. The empirical results confirm, in general, that post 1977 pursuit of the EOI strategy has resulted in TFP growth. However, in an uncertain investment and economic climate due to the ethnic conflict that has engulfed Sri Lanka, TFP growth has reversed dramatically since 1994. The findings reinforce the view that in order to increase productivity and growth in developing countries in this era of Globalization the pursuit of open economy policies alone is insufficient. Fostering of a stable political environment is also necessary.

AB Several emerging economic trends will influence how developing countries choose to meet their growing demand for wheat in the coming decades. These trends include the greater integration of the global food economy, the shift away from self-sufficiency in food production and towards comparative advantage, and increasing urbanization. Under these circumstances, if developing countries are to meet even part of their rapidly growing demand for wheat, farmers will need alternative crop and natural resource management strategies to sustain the productivity and profitability of wheat cropping and also to sustain the natural resource base. This paper reviews new crop and resource management initiatives under development by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) to foster tile sustainable intensification of agriculture in appropriate ways in favored and marginal wheat production areas. These include: practices to reduce the use of inputs, especially nitrogen and water, in favorable production environments; various new tillage options to reduce input use and resource degradation in South Asia's rice-wheat cropping systems; rotations, tillage recommendations, and other practices to improve soil fertility in more marginal production environments in Africa and Latin America; and crop management options for increasing the competitiveness of wheat production in Central Asia.

TI Technology transfer in human vaccinology: A retrospective review on
   public sector contributions in a privatizing science field
SO VACCINE
AB As health intervention, vaccination has had a tremendous impact on reducing mortality and morbidity caused by infectious diseases. Traditionally vaccines were developed and made in the western, industrialised world and from there on gradually and with considerable delay became available for developing countries. Today that is beginning to change. Most vaccine doses are now produced in emerging economies, although industrialised countries still have a lead in vaccine development and in manufacturing innovative vaccines. Technology transfer has been an important mechanism for this increase in production capacity in emerging economies. This review looks back on various technology transfer initiatives and outlines the role of WHO and other public and private partners. It goes into a more detailed description of the role of the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) in Bilthoven, the Netherlands. For many decades RIVM has been providing access to vaccine technology by capacity building and technology transfer initiatives not only through multilateral frameworks, but also on a bilateral basis including a major project in China in the 90s of the previous century.
   Looking forward it is expected that, in a globalizing world, the ambition of BRICS countries to play a role in global health will lead to an increase of south-south technology transfers. Further, it is argued that push approaches including technology transfer from the public domain, connecting innovative enabling platforms with competent developing country vaccine manufacturers (DCVM), will be critical to ensure a sustainable supply of affordable and quality vaccines to national immunization programmes in developing countries.

This article studies the largest financial corporations from developed and emerging countries identifying the SDGs on which they focus in developing countries, the evolution of their contributions and differences in the SDGs, and where their focus is in the developing world. The largest multinational financial corporations were selected, their sustainability reports assessed, and mixed methods conducted finding that the foci of those from developed countries vary across SDGs, countries of origin, impacted developing countries, and since the launch of the SDGs. Findings highlight the SDGs on which financial corporations focus, with those from developed countries implementing more practices than those from emerging economies, and that the contributions of multinational financial corporations have not affected the progress of the SDGs.

TI International Technology Transfer, Climate Change, and the Clean
   Development Mechanism
SO REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND POLICY
AB As the developed world begins efforts to limit its emissions of greenhouse gases, economic growth in developing countries is causing increased emissions from the developing world. Reducing these emissions while still enabling developing countries to grow requires the use of climate-friendly technologies in these countries. In most cases, these technologies are first created in high-income countries. Thus, the challenge for climate policy is to encourage the transfer of these climate-friendly technologies to the developing world. This article reviews the economic literature on environmental technology transfer and discusses the implications of this literature for climate policy, focusing on the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). A key point is that technology diffusion is gradual. Early adoption of policy by developed countries leads to the development of new technologies that make it easier for developing countries to reduce pollution as well. Since clean technologies are first developed in the world's leading economies, international trade and foreign investments provide access to these technologies. Moreover, evidence suggests that some technologies, such as those enhancing energy efficiency, will diffuse to developing countries even without the aid of policy prescriptions, such as the CDM. This is important for assessing the potential emissions reductions of proposed CDM projects.

TI Energy use in buildings in a long-term perspective
SO CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB Energy services in and related to buildings are responsible for approximately one-third of total global final energy demand and energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. They also contribute to the other key energy-related global sustainability challenges including lack of access to modern energy services, climate change, indoor and outdoor air pollution, related and additional health risks and energy dependence. The aim of this paper is to summarize the main sustainability challenges related to building thermal energy use and to identify the key strategies for how to address these challenges. The paper's basic premises and results are provided by and updated from the analysis conducted for the Global Energy Assessment: identification of strategies and key solutions; scenario assessment; and the comparison of the results with other models in the literature. The research has demonstrated that buildings can play a key role in solving sustainability challenges: close to one-third of 2005 building energy use can be eliminated by the proliferation of state-of-the-art construction and retrofit know-how in each world region, while maintaining wealth and amenity increases. In contrast, approximately 80% of this 2005 energy use will be locked in by the middle of the century if policies are not sufficiently ambitious in targeting regionally specific state-of-the-art performance levels.

TI Operational indicators for measuring agricultural sustainability in
   developing countries
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB This paper reviews relevant literature on the sustainability indicators theoretically proposed and practically applied by scholars over the past 15 years. Although progress is being made in the development and critical analysis of sustainability indicators, in many cases existing or proposed indicators are not the most sensitive or useful measures in developing countries. Indicator selection needs to meet the following criteria: relative availability of data representing the indicators, sensitivity to stresses on the system, existence of threshold values and guidelines, predictivity, integratability and known response to disturbances, anthropogenic stresses, and changes over time. Based on these criteria, this paper proposes a set of operational indicators for measuring agricultural sustainability in developing countries. These indicators include ecological indicators involving amounts of fertilizers and pesticides used, irrigation water used, soil nutrient content, depth to the groundwater table, water use efficiency, quality of groundwater for irrigation, and nitrate content of both groundwater and crops. Economic indicators include crop productivity, net farm income, benefit-cost ratio of production, and per capita food grain production. Social indicators encompass food self-sufficiency, equality in food and income distribution among farmers, access to resources and support services, and farmers' knowledge and awareness of resource conservation. This article suggests that the selection of indicators representing each aspect of sustainability should be prioritized according to spatial and temporal characteristics under consideration.

TI Voluntary environmental agreements in developing countries: the
   Colombian experience
SO POLICY SCIENCES
AB Voluntary agreements (VAs) negotiated between environmental regulators and polluters are increasingly popular in developing countries. According to proponents, they can sidestep weak institutions and other pervasive barriers to conventional mandatory regulation in such countries. Yet little is known about the drivers of their use and their effectiveness in poor countries. The considerable literature on voluntary initiatives in industrialized countries, where both VAs and socioeconomic conditions differ, may not apply. Using a conceptual framework drawn from the economics literature, we examine four prominent VAs in Colombia, a global leader in the use of this policy. We find that the main motive for using VAs has been to build capacity needed for broader environmental regulatory reform and that partly as a result, VAs' additional effect on environmental performance has been limited. These findings contrast with those from industrialized country studies, which typically conclude VAs are used as a low-cost substitute for impending mandatory regulation and have few benefits because of weak regulatory pressure. Our findings suggest that in developing countries, VAs may be best suited to capacity building, not environmental management per se.

AB Global legislative and market pressures are increasingly enforcing the concept of product life cycle management (LCM), or product stewardship, particularly in the electronics sector. Thereby, from an environmental perspective, end-of-life regulations and obligations require the technology managers of Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) in developed countries to consider remanufacturing and reuse as an attractive economic alternative to expensive recycling and the final disposal of electronic products. Furthermore, developing countries offer an expanding market for affordable quality spare parts, especially for the repair of cellular phones and household appliances. These dissimilar markets could be complementary from the perspective of the remanufacturing sector. Additional requirements of this relatively informal sector in developing countries must be considered, specifically product cleaning processes and test routines that may necessitate the transfer of technologies. Also, training and formalisation are needed to deliver quality services in the repair sector of developing countries. Potential market niches may also exist for inexpensive products from a formalised remanufacturing industry. Therefore, by moving from international isolation to global integration, remanufacturing and repair will profit from networking and synergy efforts in four arenas of the electronic product life cycle chain: market participants, products and applications, neighbouring technologies, and international regions.

SO ETHICAL PERSPECTIVES
AB Multinational enterprises (MNEs) often locate facilities in developing countries to benefit from lax environmental and social regulations and to reduce their operating costs. MNEs can also contribute positively to those countries by improving their economic environment, facilitating relationships with governments and other social agents, and enhancing social welfare. We argue that MNEs that operate in developing countries may enhance economic and sustainable development in those countries and simultaneously improve their financial performance. We analyzed a sample of 113 US MNEs from the chemical, energy, and industrial machinery industries. Our findings suggest that their presence in developing countries moderates the relationship between corporate social performance (CSP) and financial performance (CFP). We found that MNEs with a strong presence in developing countries can take advantage of the implementation of philanthropic initiatives to significantly improve their CFP.

However, implementation challenges including data integrity, accessibility, and reluctance to change restrict the potential of these digital technologies in developing countries. Thus, to extend the existing literature, the study has relevance. Based on a systematic literature review, Best Worst Method (BWM) is used for determining the most critical BCT implementation barriers affecting WEEE. This study identifies the IoT-enabled BCT implementation issues in closed-loop WEEE management. This study examines the appropriate issues in the context of developing a legislative support system, ineffective database management, low understanding of cognitive technologies, and information security and privacy are the key concerns for BCT implementation in closed-loop supply chains. The model is an effort in the waste management domain for the transition of developing economies towards circularity.

AB The rapid urbanization of the last century caused more slum formations resulting in numerous adverse effects and is considered a major problem facing developing countries. This paper touches on the complexities of sustainable slum development specially dealing with slum dwellers in a trial to enhance their capacities and potential. Teaching them new skills through a "Learn to Earn Program", will help them generate income and turn the slum into a catalyst for the economy rather than a burden on it. Another major problem in developing countries nowadays is waste accumulation. Zero waste strategy dictates that waste has to move from a linear system to being more cyclical according to cradle to cradle approach so that materials are used efficiently. Construction waste, representing a huge part of the solid waste stream, is emphasized in this case study. The objective of this paper is providing an integrated solution for developing countries that combines efforts in slum development and zero waste management to achieve a higher impact on the local community and on the national level. This presents a sustainable solution for the problem of slums while at the same time solving the problem of construction waste accumulation using zero waste strategy (C) 2016 The Authors.

TI The Disabled, Refugees, Displaced Persons and Prisoners
SO OPEN AND DISTANCE NON-FORMAL EDUCATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
SE SpringerBriefs in Education
AB UN Sustainable Development Goal 10 is to reduce inequalities based upon age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or income within countries. It also concerns inequalities among countries, including those related to representation, migration and development assistance. Social exclusion or social marginalization in the developing countries results in many people being denied access to education and relegated to a life of poverty at the fringes of society. This is clearly a moral issue and in breach of human rights. However, what is often overlooked is the economic impact of denying the marginalized opportunities to achieve their potential and participate actively in the economy. This chapter examines the role of open and distance non-formal education in ensuring the right to education of the disabled, refugees, displaced persons and prisoners in the developing countries.

TI Water quality programs in developing countries - Design, capacity
   building, financing, and sustainability
SO WATER INTERNATIONAL
AB In many developing countries water qualify has become the principal limiting factor to water availability. Estimates of future levels of water pollution in many parts of the world under "business as usual" scenarios will be catastrophic for public health, the environment, and national economies in many countries that have limited resources to deal with a contaminated resource. The reality in many developing countries is that political and institutional instability; combined with financial restraint, and poor domestic scientific capacity, means that "western " approaches to water quality management are often inappropriate and unsustainable. Traditional models of technical assistance and technology transfer, including foreign aid and international loans for water quality management, often leave little real change in domestic capacity while generating substantial cash flow for the foreign company. Without a major change in how water quality is managed including adoption of new paradigms of policy effectiveness, institutional and technical modernization, new methods of knowledge and technology transfer, and innovative investment, the situation can only become more and more serious until the final collapse of major freshwater and coastal ecosystems, and associated economic and public health implications. This paper addresses these various technical, policy, institutional, and financing issues and proposes actions which can lead to sustainability and self-reliance.

TI The Degrowth Movement: Alternative Economic Practices and Relevance to
   Developing Countries
SO ALTERNATIVES
AB This article explores the degrowth movement's main ideas, policy proposals, and examples of noncapitalist organizations and socially embedded economic networks compatible with degrowth ideas, namely, the Catalan Integral Cooperatives in Spain and Solidarity Economy Networks in Italy. It also explores degrowth's relevance to developing countries that have lower levels of material living standards compared to the European countries where it originated. The main argument of this article is that degrowth has significant potential to advance progressive socioecological transformation. Its advocates have also implemented some interesting alternative economic practices, such as nonmonetary exchanges and recreations of the commons, which prioritize socioecological sustainability over profit maximization. However, the degrowth movement has so far paid little attention to the structural hierarchy of the global political economy and hence has not made sufficient suggestions about how to address uneven development within and between countries, which will likely hinder progressive and ecologically sustainable transitions across the globe. Unfair global trade practices and concentrated control over advanced technologies are contentious points that might prevent widespread support for degrowth ideas in developing countries. Some developing countries and subnational local groups also face more constraints than others if they want to scale-up noncapitalist initiatives that are compatible with the degrowth vision, not to mention that some might lack financial means to drive transformative change. These issues cut across the spheres of production, consumption, trade, and finance, which suggests that structural reforms of the global political economy are called for to address unequal relations between developed and developing countries and also inequality within countries.

TI Options for sustainable solid waste management in a tourist city in a
   developing country
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-WASTE AND RESOURCE
   MANAGEMENT
AB A study was undertaken to develop options for sustainable integrated solid waste management for a tourist city in Vietnam. The generation and characterisation of tourism waste were based on a sampling survey of Hoi An city (HAC). Problems and challenges of a tourism waste management system were indicated using material flow analysis. Five scenarios were developed for the tourism sector of the city based on current solid waste management practice (SWMP), a consensus of stakeholders, the suitability of waste management systems and the contribution of the government. In two of the scenarios, waste reduction was 6.5 times higher and recyclables recovered was 3.3-4.2 times greater than that in two of the minimalist scenarios. Furthermore, the former scenarios showed more efficiency in treatment, optimal economy and minimum greenhouse gas emissions. The study indicated the advantages and challenges of each scenario and identified an optimal model for SWMP for the tourism industry of HAC. A framework for gradually developing a sustainable tourism waste management system was proposed, potentially applicable to any tourist city in a developing country.

TI Institutional quality and catch performance of fishing nations
SO MARINE POLICY
AB The relationship between annual growth in the catches of fishing nations and the quality of the institutions of those nations is analysed. Catch volumes are used as a proxy for development, since economic performance indicators based on a common set of definitions do not exist. 49 major fishing nations were selected for this study, including 22 OECD countries and several developing countries. Three general good governance indices, for government-efficiency (World Bank), corruption (Transparency International) and competitiveness (World Economic Forum) and one fishery specific FAO Code of Conduct compliance index were used. The correlation between fisheries' performance and the indices proved to be spurious, but OECD members achieved a statistically significant negative growth in catches between 1987 and 2007. The countries are divided into five groups, including 'Winners' and 'Losers', with reference to catch growth rates over two decades. Most of the OECD countries fell into the category 'Losers', whereas "Winners" includes many developing countries with lower quality institutions. Some countries had experienced an amazing growth in catches, while others had experienced a decline. The future prospects for both categories are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Development and Application of a Sustainable Management System for
   Unpaved Rural Road Networks
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
AB For the sustainable management of rural roads, social, institutional, technical, economic and environmental aspects should be considered under a long-term perspective. The current practice in developing countries is that only some of these key sustainable aspects are considered in the management process. In addition, rural roads maintenance management is commonly performed under a short-term basis, not considering the life-cycle costs and benefits in the economic analysis and project prioritization. This paper presents the development of a sustainable management system for rural road networks and its application in developing countries. The approach considers the development of a sustainable framework, application of a network-level condition evaluation methodology, condition performance models for gravel and earth roads, cost-effective maintenance standards, a long-term prioritization procedure that accounts for sustainable aspects, and a computer tool that integrates the system components. The management system has been applied and validated in two unpaved rural road networks in developing countries, located in Chile and Paraguay. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the impacts of input parameters in the performance of developed system. As a result of the research an adaptable and adoptable sustainable management system for rural networks has been developed to assist local road agencies in developing countries.

TI Failing Services on Urban Waste Management in Developing Countries: A
   Review on Symptoms, Diagnoses, and Interventions
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The potential and scale of cities enable economic growth and the improvement of citizens' access to jobs, education, healthcare, culture, public utilities and services. Solid waste management (SWM) is one of the key services provided by cities. Its operations are complex, very visible to the general public, and impacted by strong financial, societal, and political constraints. Performances in developing countries, however, are not positive. United Nations research shows urban collection services covering no more than 39% of the population in low-income countries. Why are many cities in developing countries not able to use their increasing wealth and scale for basic SWM services such as city cleaning, collection, and sustainable landfilling? This paper provides a review of literature on this question over the last decade. It shows that research is mostly on symptoms and has not led to a deeper diagnosis of causes. Lack of resources, infrastructure, awareness, and institutional strength are often pinpointed as causes but, in fact, they should be addressed as symptoms. These symptoms should be designated as dependent variables in a complex causal network with systemic feedbacks, hindering or neutralizing attempts to improve performances if not properly dealt with. Research should concentrate more on assessing the relations between urbanization, urban processes, and urban governance that shape the performance of urban solid waste management. System dynamics modeling may provide new approaches for this diagnosis.

TI Assessing the social performance of municipal solid waste management
   systems in developing countries: Proposal of indicators and a case study
SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB This article analyses the social performance of municipal solid waste (MSW) management systems in developing countries. For this purpose, a set of social impact categories, indicators and metrics capable of assessing the socio-economic and labour conditions of the different stakeholders involved in the life cycle of a MSW management system is proposed. Specifically, 12 social impact categories and 22 indicators with their corresponding metrics have been suggested. The application of the proposed indicators is illustrated by a case study in the districts of Joao Pessoa (Brazil), where selective MSW collection has been implemented with the collaboration of previous informal waste pickers, who have been reorganised into associations or cooperatives of collectors of recyclable materials (formal sector). The results suggest that despite the improvements made in the last decade in the current MSW management system of Joao Pessoa, there is still plenty of room for improvement. The social impact category with better performance is related to a "value chain actors relationship", while "equal opportunities/discrimination" and "working benefits" show a high improvement potential.

TI Floods and health in Gambella region, Ethiopia: a qualitative assessment
   of the strengths and weaknesses of coping mechanisms
SO GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION
AB Background: Floods are the most frequent and devastating type of natural disaster worldwide, causing unprecedented deaths, diseases, and destruction of property and crops. Flooding has a greater impact in developing countries due to lack of sufficient disaster management structures and a lack of economic resources.
   Objective: This study was conducted with the aim of contributing to the knowledge base of development strategies that reduce flood-related health risks in developing countries. The study focused particularly on assessing the flood risks and health-related issues in the Gambella region of Ethiopia; with the intent of producing relevant information to assist with the improvements in the efficacy of the current flood coping strategies in the region.
   Methods: Data were gathered through interviews with 14 officers from different government and non-governmental organizations and a questionnaire survey given to 35 flood victims in Itang woreda. A qualitative approach was applied and the data were analyzed using content analysis.
   Results: It was found that flooding is a common problem in Gambella region. The findings also indicate that the flood frequency and magnitude has increased rapidly during the last decade. The increase in floods was driven mainly by climate change and changes in land use, specifically deforestation. The reported main impacts of flooding on human health in Gambella region were deaths, injuries, and diseases such as malaria and diarrhea. Another notable consequence of flooding was crop destruction and subsequent malnutrition.
   Conclusions: Three weaknesses that were identified in the current coping strategies for flood-related health impacts in Gambella region were a lack of flood-specific policy, absence of risk assessment, and weak institutional capacity. This study recommends new policy approaches that will increase the effectiveness of the current flood coping strategies to sustainably address the impact of flooding on human health.

TI Property Rights Theory and the Reform of Artisanal and Small-Scale
   Mining in Developing Countries
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICS AND LAW
AB Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (ASM) is a global economic phenomenon that is widespread especially in developing countries. It provides livelihoods for millions of people, yet is often primarily associated with environmental and social problems. A key obstacle to reforming this sector is the fact that most ASM takes place in the informal sector, outside legal regimes. This paper discusses creation and reform of legal regimes governing ASM from the perspective of property rights theory. The particularly relevant law and economics-justification of property rights is revisited in detail and the strengths and weaknesses of this theory are highlighted in the context of development. The application of other theoretical justifications of property law provides further valuable insights into how the formalization of the sector could be approached.

AB Disasters cause substantial damage around the world. This causes serious environmental and economic burden on normal living conditions, reconstruction and general waste collection processes. Within this context, waste management has emerged as a critical issue in responding to a disaster. Thus, this paper addresses post disaster waste management strategies adopted in developing countries and applicability of best global practices in respect of challenges encountered. Comprehensive literature review and field survey among national level institutes in Sri Lanka were conducted to gather information and semi-structured interviews were used as a method of data collection. The findings revealed that strategies, issues and challenges are varying according to type of disaster, magnitude, location, country etc. Further, poor implementation of prevailing rules and regulations; poor standards of local expertise and capacities, inadequate funds, lack of communication and coordination are identified as key issues encountered.

SO FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB Sustainable green economy is the need of time, and eco-friendly products can play a decisive role in this goal. Low consumption of eco-friendly products is a serious concern of researchers and policymakers. To address this issue, we have studied the phenomenon in a developing country and provided insights to researchers and policymakers about the factors that influence the consumers' behaviour in developing behaviour. We have designed an integrated model based on UTAUT to study the developing countries' behavioural intentions towards eco-friendly products. 805 useable sample is obtained to analyze by implying SEM-ANN dual-stage hybrid model. Results revealed that environmental knowledge is a significant predictor and a moderator, but consumers are less educated about ecological issues in developing countries. Results also revealed that male and female consumers' preferences are differently influenced by factors studied to measure adoption intentions of eco-friendly products. Sensitivity analysis results revealed that social influence followed by effort expectance and perceived expectancy of eco-friendly products are more important for developing countries' customers. The study also provides empirical evidence of methodological advancement using SEM-ANN and suggests a dual-stage hybrid model in studies involving human behaviour.

TI Heterogeneous effects of energy efficiency and renewable energy on
   carbon emissions: Evidence from developing countries
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The adoption of energy-efficient and clean energy resources is crucial in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The study analyzes the heterogeneous effects of energy efficiency (EE), renewable energy (RE), and other variables on carbon emissions within the context of the environment Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis in 66 developing countries from 1990 to 2014. This study incorporates the role of EE in the construction of the EKC hypothesis, which has been neglected in the previous literature. By using panel ordinary least squares and fixed-effect panel quantile regression (PQR), we find that the impact of the decisive factors of CO2 emissions are heterogeneous across different quantiles. Specifically, EE reduces CO2 emissions across all quantiles, but the mitigation effect is strongest at the 90th quantile. RE reduces CO2 emissions and shows a substantial effect at the 10th quantile. Nuclear energy consumption reduces CO2 emissions but significantly influences carbon emissions only at the 50th quantile. GDP (Y) increases CO2 emissions, but the escalating effect of Y increases at the upper quantiles. The squared of GDP (Y-2 ) reduces CO2 emissions and shows the strongest mitigation effect at the upper quantiles. The quantile coefficients of Y and Y-2 are significantly positive and negative, respectively, thereby verifying the existence of the EKC hypothesis in developing countries. In sum, EE and RE contribute to reducing carbon emissions in developing countries. These results also verify EE as an essential factor in the formation of the EKC hypothesis in developing countries and offer some important recommendations for designing and implementing appropriate economic and energy policies to achieve environment sustainability in these countries.

TI China's pattern of trade and growth after WTO accession Lessons for
   other developing countries
SO JOURNAL OF CHINESE ECONOMIC AND FOREIGN TRADE STUDIES
AB Purpose - World Trade Organization (WTO) accession marked a new beginning for China's economic, legal and institutional reforms and rapid integration with the rest of the world. The purpose of this paper is to review China's post-WTO transition experience, synthesize and update studies on China's pattern of trade and structural transformation, and provide both positive and negative lessons for other developing countries.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper has broadly reviewed the latest policy changes after China's WTO accession, and literatures on China's trade and economic development issues in order to understand the Chinese success and its speciality, and draw some useful lessons for both China's decision-makers and other developing countries.
   Findings- There are two main findings: first, market liberalization alone is not sufficient, and economic system reform and the liberalization are closely related and complement and promote each other. Second, experimentations via special economic zones (SEZs) and opening to foreign direct investment (FDI), which facilitated and supported cluster development and learning-by-doing, are needed for industrial upgrading and export competitiveness.
   Originality/value - The paper demonstrates the wisdom of China's simultaneous pursuit of domestic economic system reform, and opening to the international market. However, China has also paid a high social and environmental cost for its rapid growth. It is important for developing countries to have an exclusive, balanced and sustainable strategy in the future development.

The USA, Japan, and the European Union (EU) have been frustrated with China's measures, even threatening to bring the case to the WTO. These rare earth trade disputes are but the tip of the iceberg. Forms of export restraints on minerals have been increasingly practiced by developing countries, reflecting developing countries' determination to upgrade their own economic condition against a broader backdrop of international economic transition in a mineral-hungry world. Such issues of mineral export restraints are deeply rooted in the traditional international trade structure, and in turn serve as a historic move to break it. The WTO's consensus-based approach, with developing countries comprising more than two-thirds of WTO membership, has to accommodate this changing situation in both its judicial and negotiation scenarios. Accused of being trade-distorting and inconsistent with the WTO Agreement on the part of mineral export restraints, developing countries expect to defend themselves by reasons of environmental protection and conservation of exhaustible natural resources. This article anticipates that, in the next round of multilateral negotiation, the developed world will attempt to bring the issue of export restraints under multilateral mandates.

TI The Nepali response How to energize women
SO BULLETIN OF THE ATOMIC SCIENTISTS
AB Lack of access to modern energy services represents a pressing problem in the developing world, not least for women. Many poor women spend much of their time on menial work that could be performed much more easily if energy were available, and safety concerns often prevent women from going out at night where there are no streetlights. Children suffer too-more than 50 percent of the developing world's children attend primary schools that lack electricity, and this can lead to markedly worse educational outcomes. Access to modern energy services might be improved through, among other approaches, establishing small-scale hydroelectric projects, facilitating the use of home solar systems, or providing grid electricity (which itself might be produced either with conventional fuels or through renewable means). Three authors-Kalpana Sharma of India (2014), Dipak Gyawali of Nepal, and Corinne Hart of the United States (2014)-discuss which methods of expanding energy access show most promise for improving the lives of the developing world's poor women and children.

TI Optimizing the use of breed types in developing country livestock
   production systems: a neglected research area
SO JOURNAL OF ANIMAL BREEDING AND GENETICS
AB Developing country livestock production systems are diverse and dynamic, and include those where existing indigenous breeds are currently optimal and likely to remain so, those where non-indigenous breed types are already in common use, and systems that are changing, such as by intensification, where the introduction of new breed types represents significant opportunities. These include opportunities to improve the livelihood of the world's poor, increase food and nutrition security and enhance environmental sustainability. At present, very little research has focused on this issue, such that significant knowledge gaps in relation to breed-change interventions remain. The purpose of this study is to raise awareness of this issue and suggests strategic research areas to begin filling these knowledge gaps. Such strategic research would include (i) assessing the impact of differing breed types in developing country livestock productions systems, from a range of viewpoints including intrahousehold livelihood benefit, food and nutrition security at different scales, and environmental sustainability; (ii) identification of specific livestock production systems within developing countries, and the type of livestock keepers within these system, that are most likely to benefit from new breed types; and (iii) identification of new breed types as candidates for in-situ testing within these systems, such as through the use of spatial analysis to identify similar production environments combined with community acceptance studies. Results of these studies would primarily assist stakeholders in agriculture, including both policy makers and livestock keepers, to make informed decisions on the potential use of new breed types.

TI Financing Sustainable Development, Which Factors Can Interfere?:
   Empirical Evidence from Developing Countries
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The role of sustainable development financing resources in achieving sustainable development goals is one of the most important topics talked about in the recent sustainable development conflict, especially in the developing countries. Using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model over the period 2002-2018, this study attempts to better identify sustainable development financing resources and examine their role in simultaneously ensuring economic growth and achieving social and environmental objectives in 24 developing countries. We found that increases in official development assistance, public debt, and remittances impede economic growth and human development and increase environmental pollution. Thus, they inhibit sustainable development. However, our findings demonstrated that foreign direct investment and international trade, which enhance economic growth, do not have any effect on CO2 emissions, while foreign direct investment inflows boost human development and international trade seems detrimental to it. Our study also show the effectiveness of CREDIT in achieving sustainability goals by reducing environmental degradation and improving economic growth and human development. Moreover, these empirical results may draw the attention of policymakers as they help them build rigorous economic policies to sustain economic development.

The availability of energy is also eessential for social development and to ensure an acceptable quality of life. There is now awareness that this energy must be supplied and utilized in forms that respect the principles of sustainability.
   Sustainable energy technologies exist both on the supply and on the demand side; developing countries whish do not have heavy infrastructure and previous investment, as well as rapidly expanding markets, often have the oppurtunity to introduce advanced technologies that have difficulties of penetration in the industrialized countries.

TI An evolutionary modeling approach for designing a contractual REDD plus
   payment scheme
SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB Economic development and sustainable ecological and environmental development generally target different goals, and there are trade-offs and game-like behaviors between implementers and donors in reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD +) program. This paper analyzed the effects of evolutionary behaviors of REDD+ implementers and donors with respect to environmental service payments. Within a theoretical analysis framework, the evolutionary stable strategies of the implementers and donors under different contractual payments for ecosystem services (PES) scenarios are analyzed to explore contractual REDD + payments through evolutionary game models. On this basis, anon-parametric local regression approach is used to analyze arrange of market-based contractual PES schemes in five REDD+ countries (Congo, Brazil, Ecuador, Nepal and Uganda). The results show the following: First, when the opportunity costs are less than the environmental benefits, some middle and high income developing countries are sufficiently incentivized to conserve forests, even without formal contractual PES scheme. This conservation occurs regardless of whether the industrialized countries will pay for the ecosystem services. Second, when the opportunity costs are greater than the environmental benefits, developing countries will generally not take the initiative to conserve forests when industrialized countries do not pay for the associated ecosystem services. Third, when there are enough contractual PES fines, developing countries will conserve forests, and the industrialised countries will pay for the ecosystem services. Finally, contractual PES fines are related to the costs of reducing emissions. Nepal has the largest marginal effect, and Uganda has the smallest. These results have implications for REDD+ program design and implementation: market-based contractual PES scheme should be given priority to regulate behavior of industrialized countries and developing countries in the PES scheme. Developing a targeted and differentiated contractual PES scheme requires an accounting of emission reduction costs in different countries.

TI Does structural economic vulnerability matter for public indebtedness in
   developing countries?
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of structural economic vulnerability of developing countries on their public indebtedness.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors perform the analysis by the use of fixed effects technique where the standard errors are corrected by the Driscoll-Kraay (1998) method. The panel covers 96 developing countries over the period 1980-2008.
   Findings - The results suggest evidence of a "U-shaped" relationship between the structural vulnerability and the total public debt in developing countries. More particularly in low-income countries (LICs), the structural vulnerability appears to be a strong determinant of the build-up of the total public debt.
   Research limitations/implications - It would be interesting to extend the research to small Island developing states. Indeed, the authors do not include this group of countries because of lack of data, especially on the variable "quality of governance" for almost all countries of this group. Accordingly, the research should be extended to such countries as well as these data are available.
   Practical implications - The implications of the study is that international institutions, including those of the Bretton Woods should take into account the structural vulnerability of developing countries when designing development policies, especially the ones related to debt sustainability in developing countries and particularly LICs.
   Social implications - The fact of the international institutions to take into account the structural vulnerability in the design of international development policy, especially those related to debt issues will have major implications on the macroeconomic policy design by these developing countries as well as on poverty reduction.
   Originality/value - The added value of this paper is to use recent data on structural vulnerability to analyse the effect of the latter on public indebtdeness of developing countries.

TI Global governance of technology: meeting the needs of developing
   countries [1]
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT
AB In 2000, world leaders adopted the United Nations Millennium Declaration in which they pledged to halve, by 2015, the proportion of the world's people earning less than a dollar a day, suffering from hunger and unable to obtain safe drinking water. This paper argues that meeting these targets will entail concerted efforts to raise economic productivity in the developing world and to redirect research and development (R&D) in the industrialized countries to address problems that affect the developing countries. Doing this will require approaches that place science and technology at the centre of development policy in a world that is marked by extreme disparities in the creation of scientific and technical knowledge. Mobilizing this knowledge to meet the agricultural, health, communication and environmental needs of developing countries will continue to be one of the most important issues in international relations in the years to come. The paper identifies ways of using the world's scientific and technological knowledge to meet the needs of developing countries. More specifically, it examines linkages among science, technology and development; emerging trends in innovation systems; incentive measures for technological innovation; and how to make technology work for developing countries. The paper examines two categories of measures needed to promote the application of science and technology to development. The first includes measures adopted by developing countries themselves to promote scientific research and technological innovation as a key element in economic development policy. The second includes measures that can be adopted in the industrialized countries to contribute to solving problems in developing countries.

Many countries have therefore made IT development a high priority and universities have been charged with and pressured into rapidly developing suitable academic programs in Computer Science. In the Third World where human resources in high-tech fields like Computer Science are scarce, a successful Computer Science program can be developed through an Electrical Engineering Department. The resulting failures and challenges in developing such a program in a developing country context are described. Such successful programs can be sustainable, particularly if they are located physically close to the metropolis.

This paper presents a meta-analysis of those project case study results and analyses whether the design of existing policies or other factors contribute to failures. It concludes that the observed failures are due to well-known reasons and recommends how the implementation of the Dublin-Rio Principles can be improved.

SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Providing access to modern energy services for development is a daunting task which requires rigorous planning based on robust information. Energy access indicators enable measurement and monitoring of the progress of energy access expansion efforts, thus informing corrective efforts and efforts worth replicating. This paper reviews what has been proposed to constitute energy access and energy access indicators. The paper further reviews briefly the different types of energy access indicators and analyses access to modern energy in Ghana as measured using the energy access indicators employed in Ghana. The paper concludes that Ghana has achieved commendable access to modern energy services compared to her sub-Saharan peers but recommends further efforts to achieve the set targets of universal access to electricity by 2020 and 50% access to LPG by 2020. The paper finally recommends further work on the different types of indicators which are relevant for tracking energy access progress but are not currently employed in the country.

   modern waste management system: A review
SO PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Objectives: To explore the activities of the informal waste management sector in Nigeria, and barriers to integrating them in an inclusive waste management system.
   Study design: Literature review.
   Methods: A literature review was undertaken to evaluate the informal waste management system and formal waste management system in Nigeria and other developing countries with similar settings. Nine databases were searched and 34 studies met the following inclusion criteria: evaluation of the role of informal waste collectors, recycling and solid waste management in developing countries.
   Results: Most of the evaluated studies (97%, n = 33) acknowledged the significant environmental and socio-economic roles played by the informal waste collectors and scavengers in developing countries. The studies identified the following as barriers to inclusive waste management in Nigeria: repressive policy, unhygienic waste collection methods, lack of evidence to support activity, and low quality and quantity of secondary materials.
   Conclusions: Scavengers and other groups of informal recyclers see waste as a source of income and livelihood, whilst the general public see it as an aesthetic problem and see the people engaged in resource recovery as a social nuisance. Integrating their informal services with the formal waste management system is a potential tool to empower these people to increase their skills in resource recovery and improve their working and living conditions. Inclusive waste management is a process, and observable changes are taking place in some developing countries where waste pickers and informal waste collectors have become environmental agents. A major limitation to the integration of informal waste collectors and scavengers is the social acceptance of their activity as a viable source of income, and of themselves as environmental agents in the sustainability of virgin resources.

TI Quantifying socio-economic indicators in developing countries from
   mobile phone communication data: applications to Cote d'Ivoire
SO EPJ DATA SCIENCE
AB The widespread adoption of mobile devices that record the communications, social relations, and movements of billions of individuals in great detail presents unique opportunities for the study of social structures and human dynamics at very large scales. This is particularly the case for developing countries where social and economic data can be hard to obtain and is often too sparse for real-time analytics. Here we leverage mobile call log data from Cote d'Ivoire to analyze the relations between its nation-wide communications network and the socio-economic dynamics of its regional economies. We introduce the CallRank indicator to quantify the relative importance of an area on the basis of call records, and show that a region's ratio of in- and out-going calls can predict its income level. We detect a communication divide between rich and poor regions of Cote d'Ivoire, which corresponds to existing socio-economic data. Our results demonstrate the potential of mobile communication data to monitor the economic development and social dynamics of low-income developing countries in the absence of extensive econometric and social data. Our work may support efforts to stimulate sustainable economic development and to reduce poverty and inequality.

TI Decoupling Economic Development from the Consumption of Finite Resources
   Using Circular Economy. A Model for Developing Countries
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Sustainable development is a major concern for developing and developed economies as economic growth has to led to scarcer and more expensive resources. Although countries have established public policies focusing on resource and energy efficiency, there is an increasing need for a coordinated industrial strategy able to create sustainable wealth through a holistic management of natural resources, capable of "decoupling" economic growth from resource extraction and natural deterioration. Consequently, the objective of the present research is to develop a decoupling model able to create increasing economic returns, reducing the social gap and regenerating the natural capital for regions in developing countries. Departing from a literature review on peer reviewed articles on successful industrial cases of decoupling around the world, we contrasted the linear production model with the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP)'s current four decoupling indicators in order to propose a more robust model. The result was an eight-factor decoupling model that used a well-supported framework for sustainable wealth creation named "circular value ecosystem" (CVES). By using system dynamics, we deployed the proposed framework using system dynamics modeling in order to improve the understanding of our proposal. We found that this model, with the proper regional conditions in developing countries, can: (1) reduce, through substitution, the consumption of natural resources; (2) produce alternative economic increasing returns; (3) reduce the negative environmental impacts; and (4) create self-sustainable wealth for the economy, the environment, and the social development of most stakeholders of these regions. Decoupling economic growth represents a complex and challenging task whose successful implementation can only be achieved if managed at a regional level with a systemic approach.

AB The energy sector in developing countries plays a key role in their socio-economic development. The sector is facing many challenges, including the escalating demand on energy, the high cost of fuel, importing energy or fuel from external markets, and the unreliable energy supplies. Moving towards renewable energy is also meeting difficulties, especially in terms of delivering the energy needed with reasonable costs. Strategic planning approach is utilized to guide moving towards renewable energy in the developing countries. The aim of this research is to explore the proper measures to deal with the identified key factors that affect progress towards renewable energy, and formulate a strategic framework to support shifting towards renewable energy in the developing countries. Palestine is taken as the case study that could be considered as an example of a lower-middle income developing country. Proper analysis is conducted for the energy sector in Palestine considering the SWOT approach, considering the internal status and the external environment. Based on such analysis, the proposed framework for strategic planning for renewable energy is formulated. The framework has identified the goals and objectives, as well as the strategies and actions. The output of this study would lay the foundation to debate and adopt the framework in partnership with other stakeholders. Key strategies are defined including those in the economic, technical, organizational, regulatory, and behavioural areas.

TI Enabling financial development: linking innovation and CO2 emissions
   through equity and credit financing
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Over the past decade, financial development has been a prominent debate for stakeholders and policymakers alike. Financial development are prerequisites for innovation and CO2 emissions, followed by the Paris Climate Summit (COP21). In the wake of the global economic recession, financial development continues to address CO2 emissions efforts. However, scant attention is paid to the role of financial development in innovation and CO2 emissions relationship, especially in the context of developing countries. The current study explores the relationship between innovation and CO2 emissions through moderating role of financial development, especially in the context of developing countries. Utilizing a dynamic panel threshold approach, the current study utilizes data from 26 countries between 1990 and 2014. Our findings reveal that innovation positively impacts the reduction of carbon emissions when the stock market value-to-private credit ratio is below 1.71, while an opposite effect is observed when the ratio exceeds this threshold. We believe that the findings broaden the debate on financial development in developing countries. The results revealed that developing countries should allocate their domestic resources to financial development and poverty reduction, rather than solely addressing environmental concerns. In addition, a more sustainable balance between innovation and CO2 emissions could benefit through financial development and the impact may be the result in terms of achieving sustainable development.

TI A Model of Effective Factors for Sustainable Growth of New
   Technology-Based Firms in Developing Countries
SO JOURNAL OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY
AB The research examines the factors affecting the growth of new technology-based firms (NTBFs) in Iran as a developing country. The regional, economic, and social characteristics of developing countries are different from developed ones. In the research, 87 NTBFs that were able to pass the initial growth stage within 3 years are analyzed by structural equation modeling (SEM) method. The findings show that among the four dimensions of growth construct, corporate governance and environmental factors have the most effective role in the growth of NTBFs. In addition, business knowledge with path coefficient of 0.241 has the greatest impact on NTBFs growth. This explain that although environmental factors are very important for NTBFs, there are other factors which could be better managed by NTBFs to gain sustainable growth. Furthermore, findings reveal that if governance and managers make efforts to improve business knowledge among NTBFs, they are more likely to experience growth.

TI Impacts of Electricity Outages in Urban Households in Developing
   Countries: A Case of Accra, Ghana
SO ENERGIES
AB Many developing countries in Africa face a "double tragedy" when it comes to electrification. Electricity access rates are low, while those who have access to electricity face frequent outages. There are ongoing efforts aimed at increasing access to electricity on the continent. However, the need to improve the reliability of electricity supply receives limited attention. Unreliable electricity impacts users by limiting electricity utilization and the benefits that should accrue from having an electricity connection. Using data from 496 household survey questionnaires, this study examines the impacts of electricity outages in urban households in Accra, Ghana. The study applies correlation and regression analyses to identify which household characteristics are associated with or predict households reporting outage impacts. Outages were found to impact household safety/security, access to food, and access to social services and were found to cause appliance damage as well. Factors that are significantly correlated with reporting certain outage impacts include respondent's annual income and employment status, frequency of electricity outages, and household size. Significant predictors of reporting outage impacts are socioeconomic disadvantage, high exposure to outages, and living in a large family setting. The study's findings underscore the need for interventions to eliminate, or at least minimize, electricity supply interruptions in developing countries if sustainable social and economic development is to be achieved.

TI "PAY FOR QUALITY" (P4Q) AS A NEW FORM OF PAYMENT FOR WORK: ADVANTAGES
   FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND THE SCIENTIFIC-METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR QUALITY RESEARCH
AB The article seeks the goal of substantiating the advantages for developing countries and developing a scientific and methodological approach "Pay for Quality" (P4Q) as a new form of stimulation and payment for work. Originality and novelty of this research consists, firstly, in determining and substantiating the advantages and the logic of selecting the approach to motivation and stimulation of work in entrepreneurship, as well as the preconditions to using the P4Q approach. Secondly, in developing the scientific and methodological recommendations for measuring quality and the scale of advantages of its increase for a company, which will allow implementing the P4Q approach by a large range of companies. Thirdly, in studying the experience of developing countries as socio-economic systems with the specific conditions of application of the P4Q approach. This is a new form of payment for work, which is very interesting for developing countries, as it allows creating well-paid jobs and using unique, intellectual, and skilled human resources in entrepreneurship. This will allow implementing human potential and giving a powerful impulse to development of hi-tech private entrepreneurship, which is oriented at innovations and quality, as well as forming sustainable global competitive advantages based on high quality of products. Due to application of the P4Q approach to stimulation of work in developing countries, the rate of economic growth and market capitalization of business increase. For this, a perspective scientific and methodological approach to stimulation of work - "P4Q" - is offered, perspectives are outlined, and applied recommendations for its implementation in developing countries are given.

TI ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS OF DANISH FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT IN DEVELOPING
   COUNTRIES: THE ROLE OF HOME COUNTRY FACTORS IN SHAPING THE GLOBAL
   ENVIRONMENTAL PRACTICES OF DANISH MULTINATIONALS
SO MULTINATIONALS, ENVIRONMENT AND GLOBAL COMPETITION
SE Research in Global Strategic Management
AB The literature on foreign direct investment (FDI) and the environment has paid little attention to the role of home country factors in shaping the global practices of multinational enterprises (MNEs). By analyzing the interface between FDI and the environment from a Danish perspective, this chapter seeks to cast light on this issue. Denmark is a small, highly open economy dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises servicing specialized niche markets for consumer products or large industrial customers. What makes the case of Danish FDI in developing countries interesting from an environmental perspective is that environmental issues for the past three decades have had an exceptionally strong position on the Danish political agenda and have earned Danish environmental regulation a reputation as among the toughest in the world. The question is whether and how this strong environmental home base has spilled over into the environmental practices of Danish MNEs in developing countries. The chapter describes how the issue of corporate environmental responsibility in developing countries reached the Danish agenda with great force in the late 1990s, embroiling a number of Danish MNEs in damaging public battles. The chapter then moves on to review the - embryonic - literature on environmental practices of Danish MNEs. The chapter concludes by discussing whether and how the environmental practices of Danish MNEs may be traced back to distinct aspects of the Danish home country context.

TI The more things change, the more they stay the same: Developing
   countries' unity at the nexus of trade and environmental policy
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS
AB The term "global South" refers to developing countries as a whole, but recently, numerous developing countries - Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Thailand, South Africa, and others - simultaneously grew wealthier while many other countries remain poor. This prompts a fundamental question: does the global South demonstrate unity in international politics, with developing countries at various wealth levels behaving like one another, and in ways unlike the industrialized "North"? Or is the global South fractured, too economically and politically diverse to operate in tandem? Theoretical expectations are mixed, and the empirical record is inconclusive. To adjudicate, we pinpoint a stringent set of observable implications that should hold if the developing world is to be considered at all unified vis-a-vis the industrialized world. Then we probe those implications with statistical analyses of over 3,600 paragraphs of text from governments' negotiations concerning trade and environmental policy, a policy space that facilitates generalizability by representing fundamental sovereignty and wealth issues underlying traditional North-South frictions. Our finding - that overall, developing countries exhibit surprising unity - weighs in on central theoretical and policy debates in international relations, comparative politics, and political economy.

AB Agro-food chains and networks play an increasingly important role in providing access to markets for producers in developing countries. Globalization of trade and integration of supply chains lead to new demands regarding food quality and safety. Analytical approaches for addressing the role of trade for development involve a mixture of disciplines that focus on issues of efficiency, organization and innovation as key dimensions of competitiveness. Smallholder participation in global supply chains is critically determined by three processes: market access, network governance and chain upgrading. Public and voluntary agencies may provide important contributions for reinforcing the supply-chain environment.

TI Does environmental sustainability attract foreign investment? Evidence
   from developing countries
SO BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB This study contributes to the literature by investigating the effect of environmental degradation on foreign direct investment (FDI) using comprehensive panel data from 103 developing countries between 1970 and 2019. In this study, nine variables, namely, CO2 emissions, total greenhouse gas emissions, methane emissions, PM2.5, nitrous oxide emissions, ecological footprint of consumption, ecological footprint of production, total area (ecological footprint), and total biocapacity, were used to measure environmental degradation/sustainability. Using Lewbel's two-stage least squares to control endogeneity issues, the result from the aggregated sample indicates that while CO2 emissions significantly reduce FDI, the remaining environmental degradation variables stimulate FDI. Further analysis reveals that, generally, environmental degradation boosts FDI flows to low and lower-middle income countries while reducing FDI flows to upper-middle income countries. The regional analysis also shows that environmental degradation generally reduces FDI flows to Europe and Central Asia, and the Middle East and North Africa regions while stimulating FDI flows to South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Environmental degradation was found to have a neutral effect on FDI flows to East Asia and the Pacific. These results are robust to alternative econometric techniques. The policy implications are discussed.

TI Understanding India's Representation of North-South Climate Politics
SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS
AB This paper examines India's role in perpetuating North-South imaginaries in global climate politics. A Global South perspective on climate politics is premised on the differential contribution of developed and developing countries towards climate change, differential adaptive capacities, and the overriding need of developing countries to focus on poverty alleviation and sustainable development. Meanwhile, the North-South binary has been extensively critiqued in the literature for the heterogeneity of each category, narrowing gaps between North and South, and the state-centrism implicit in such a categorization. Based on the understanding that the reproduction of the North-South frame in climate discourses is inherently political, I examine the politics behind their reproduction, rather than focus on the validity of these categories. Based on fieldwork in Delhi and Copenhagen, my paper provides insight into the spatial politics of climate policy negotiations. The categories North and South, developed and developing, or First World and Third World constitute powerful spatial imaginaries that strongly influence the negotiating positions of Indian officials in global climate politics, even as India's image as a developing country is increasingly questioned in light of its status as an emerging economy and major emitter. The self-identification of Indian officials with the imaginary of the Global South is a crucial feature of global climate politics.

It reviews concepts and techniques for valuation of environmental impacts for use in conventional cost-benefit analysis, as well as key related aspects including environmental impacts of economy wide policies, multicriteria analysis, risk and uncertainty, and discount rate issues. Several developing country case studies are summarized which cover a range of practical valuation methods. The evidence presented suggests that the valuation techniques for determining ''use values'' may be applied successfully in appropriate cases, but examples involving ''nonuse values'' are rare. The use of multiobjective decision methods also needs to be explored, where economic valuation is not feasible.

TI Adaptive capacity in urban areas of developing countries
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
AB Urban areas of developing countries face increasing risks due to climate change. This paper systematically identifies and examines research published between 2000 and 2017 that assesses urban adaptive capacity to climate change in developing countries. To critically examine this literature, we developed a conceptual framework of urban adaptive capacity. The framework focuses on key components of urban adaptive capacity in three dimensions: the characterization of adaptive capacity, the external factors mediating adaptive capacity, and the dynamics of adaptive capacity. The study sheds light on the spatial and scalar interactions of individuals, communities, and authorities' adaptive capacities within urban areas and highlights the importance of governance and social institutions in shaping urban adaptive capacity. The work also finds shortcomings in the current assessment of urban adaptive capacity, with key gaps including a narrow focus on the range and types of adaptive capacity; limited assessment of the multilevel determinants, place-based processes, and urban determinants that shape adaptive capacity; and a lack of consideration of adaptive capacity interactions between social entities and with regard to climate sensitivity and exposure of a given area, including the potential for maladaptation. Addressing these research gaps would contribute to generate knowledge that can adequately support adaptation planning of urban areas in developing countries.

TI Towards sustainable energy system options for improving energy access in
   Southern Africa
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY IN SOUTHERN AFRICA
AB Access to modern energy services is one of the pre-requisites to improved livelihood, yet the poor, particularly in developing countries, remain tied to unhealthy and inefficient traditional fuels. Renewable energy technologies are increasingly popular energy supply alternatives to fossil-based fuels in many countries. This study presents sustainable energy system implementation options for increasing energy access in developing countries, with special emphasis on Sub-Saharan Africa. A feasibility case study and various implementation options are presented for possible deployment of these systems. Hybrid optimization of multiple energy resources software was used to simulate and validate the proposed hybrid system design and performance. The simulation results indicate that hybrid systems would be feasible options for distributed generation of electric power for remote locations and areas not connected to the electricity grid. Such a hybrid energy system, through providing modern energy services, gives promise to free-up rural communities to engage in productive activities. The opportunity to power or facilitate productive activities such as agro-processing, fabrication and services can potentially reduce poverty.

TI Antimicrobial resistance in developing countries. Part I: recent trends
   and current status
SO LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB The global problem of antimicrobial resistance is particularly pressing in developing countries, where the infectious disease burden is high and cost constraints prevent the widespread application of newer, more expensive agents. Gastrointestinal, respiratory, sexually transmitted, and nosocomial infections are leading causes of disease and death in the developing world, and management of all these conditions has been critically compromised by the appearance and rapid spread of resistance. in this first part of the review, we have summarised the present state of resistance in these infections from the available data. Even though surveillance of resistance in many developing countries is suboptimal, the general picture is one of accelerating rates of resistance spurred by antimicrobial misuse and shortfalls in infection control and public health. Reservoirs for resistance may be present in healthy human and animal populations. Considerable economic and health burdens emanate from bacterial resistance, and research is needed to accurately quantify the problem and propose and evaluate practicable solutions. In part 11, to be published next month, we will review potential containment strategies that could address this burgeoning problem.

AB Parallel to a noteworthy increase in negative environmental impacts caused by human activities, the sector which provides remedies to all of these inconveniences is also growing drastically. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports that Americans spend more than $200 billion, nearly 3% of the gross national product, a year to control and clean up pollution. Environmental technologies and services producing sector of the world turned to be one of the fastest growing and labor creating industry which controlled almost entirely by the developed and industrialized countries. Current ecological or environmental science is largely a political and/or economic construct, reflecting mostly the values and interests of the developed countries rather than those of developing countries.
   The developing countries that generally have very limited financial resources, on the other hand, are forced or convinced by these producers to consume their environmental products and services mainly for marketing purposes rather than environmental quality amendments. The export of these environmental technologies and services are further encouraged by some international bodies such as World Bank, European Union, etc. by providing loans. Consequently, setting the economic aspect which is also the most important for developing countries, aside, technologies are sold, resources are depleted but the environmental problems remained almost the same or were not adequately solved. This pure commercial approach to the environmental issues is contradictory to the paradigm of sustainability.
   During the last two decades, quite a few environmental investments, an incinerator for the disposal of hospital wastes, sanitary sewer, waste water treatment plants, storm sewer, municipal solid waste landfill, etc. which required quite a large budged were realized in Antalya/Turkey. Some of these investments did not function at all, some became inactive after a short while and some were not profitable.
   This paper will study the effectiveness of all these environmental investments from politic, economic and environmental perspectives and try to draw some conclusions which may be helpful for the future environmental investments of not only Antalya/Turkey but for all developing countries. A special attention will also be paid to the impact of the non-governmental organizations on the planning and realization processes of these investments.

SO QUEEN MARY JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
AB The global significance of intellectual property laws is familiar to most of those interested in this area of law. What might be less familiar is the impact of intellectual property on the issue of food security in developing countries. This paper considers the consequences of factors such as TRIPS-plus compliance imposed on recent entrants to the World Trade Organization and the role and impact of patents and sui generis means of protecting plant breeders' rights on food security in developing countries. In particular the paper focuses on examples drawn from the Pacific where island countries are not only considering WTO membership or have recently signed up to this and incurred consequent IP obligations, but where food security is increasingly under pressure due to climate change, environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity, shifts in agricultural practice and knowledge transfer, changing socioeconomic patterns and the consequences of the global economic crisis. This is also a region where Western models of IP, although prevalent as introduced and imposed concepts, being a legacy of a colonial past, fit uneasily with forms and practices of indigenous traditional knowledge, and where local initiatives may be better suited to ensuring sustainability of food crops than the present thrust of neo-colonial IP laws.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS
AB Purpose The main purpose of this research is to examine the impact of institutional quality and sectoral employment on environmental degradation in developing countries. This paper also re-examined the validity of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis and estimated the long run impact of explanatory variables on CO2 emissions. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, the balanced panel data for the period 2002-2016 was used based on data availability and applied two-step SYS-GMM estimators. Findings The results showed that institutional quality such as government effectiveness (GE) and the rule of law (RL) reduce CO2 emissions and promote environmental quality in developing countries. Interestingly, the authors found new evidence that employment in agriculture and industry has a positive impact on pollution, while employment in the service sector was negatively associated with CO2 emissions, and the validity of the EKC hypothesis was confirmed. In addition, the research suggests that strong institutional frameworks and their effective implementation are the most important panacea and should be treated as a top priority to counteract environmental degradation and achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Originality/value This is the first study to examine the short run and long run effects of institutional quality and sectoral employment on environmental degradation using the balanced panel data for a large sample of developing countries. This paper also used a special technique of Driscoll and Kraay standard error approach to confirm the robustness results and showed the different roles of sectoral employment on environmental quality.

TI Effects of economic globalization and trade on forest transitions:
   Evidence from 76 developing countries
SO FORESTRY CHRONICLE
AB Current forest recovery efforts in developing countries are different from previous efforts in developed countries, especially since the rise of economic globalization in the 1980s. Therefore, forest transition theory should now consider factors relating to industrialization, urbanization, and globalization. While previous studies have mainly focused on the variable trade of primary sector products, this study applies a more holistic research perspective and discusses, more widely, the links between trade, adjustment of trade structure, FDI, and forest transition. The results suggest that the total export value has a significant negative effect on forest area and volume, while the percentage of non-primary products has a significant positive impact on forest volume and density in the 76 developing countries studied. These results indicate that a country or region may improve the forest resource conditions by upgrading the export structure through the development of export-oriented manufacturing and service industries during the process of global industrial restructuring. This demonstrates the need to consider the overall global economic situation of a country when exploring the effects of economic globalization on forest transitions. In addition, this study attempts to address extant concerns regarding the quality of forest transitions by moving beyond the analysis of forest coverage to explore changes in both forest area and forest volume.

TI A SURVEY OF THE ECONOMICS OF FAIR TRADE
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC SURVEYS
AB Fair Trade has spread in developing countries as an initiative aimed at lifting poor smallholder farmers out of poverty by providing them with premium prices, availability of credit, and improved community development and social goods. Fair Trade is also viewed as a niche market for high value products in a context of globalization and trade liberalization policies that affect smallholder farmers in developing countries. This paper provides an overview of the potential effects of Fair Trade, both theoretical and empirical, on small-scale producers in developing countries. Our review discusses the empirical evidence on prices and income, as well as the importance of limited market access and productivity. We discuss evidence on labor markets and human capital investments as well.

TI Globalization and international trade in the twenty-first century:
   Opportunities for and threats to the health sector in the South
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES
AB Globalization and international trade are important forces at the turn of the century. This article explores how freer international trade will affect developing countries that are net importers of health care goods and services. Four commodities are used as special cases for discussion: pharmaceuticals, health care technologies, pesticides, and tobacco and its related products. The authors discuss the role of international specialized agencies, such as the World Trade Organization, World Health Organization, and World Bank, that are concerned with international trade and its health and health care consequences, and argue that closer collaboration is required among these agencies if the negative effects of trade liberalization on developing countries are to be mitigated. The authors pose a number of research questions that could help in developing proactive policies for the South on the trade of goods and services with harmful effects on health as well as those with potential health and economic benefits.

AB Access to affordable energy services is a prerequisite to improvement in quality of life of the poor by 2015. Meeting energy needs of the poorest is the central issue in global development perspective. At the local level, energy services help to improve the quality of life and facilitate sustainable livelihoods. Commercial markets for renewable energy are expanding, shifting investment patterns, away from traditional and government sources to greater reliance on private firms. The older technology-oriented paradigm focused on technology assessment, economic viability and technology demonstrations. The new paradigm focuses a market assessment, policy and institutional issues and demonstrations of sustainable business and social models. Identified policy priorities focus on (i) establishing policies for renewable energy markets; (ii) expanding financing option; and developing the required capacities. The opportunity is to orient a large and increasing share of new proposed energy supply infrastructure funding to renewable energy and thereby ensuing sustainable development and quality of life of the poor.

TI Sustainability of Off-Grid Photovoltaic Systems for Rural
   Electrification in Developing Countries: A Review
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB A review on rural electrification programs and projects based on off-grid Photovoltaic (PV) systems, including Solar Pico Systems (SPS) and Solar Home Systems (SHS) in Developing Countries (DCs) was conducted. The goal was to highlight the main multidimensional drawbacks that may constrain the sustainability of these systems. Four dimensions of sustainability (institutional, economic, environmental and socio-cultural) were considered in this review. It was found that institutional flaws (such as the scarcity of durability/stability and enforcement of formal institutions, weak regulations or standards, incomplete decentralization/participation and the lack of institutional adaptability) seriously compromise the sustainability of rural electrification efforts in DCs. While the lack of an effective focalized subsidy scheme (e.g., cross-tariff scheme) for the electricity tariffs of the poor population often made projects economically unsustainable, the scarcity of environmental awareness, regulations or incentives has often turned presumably clean energy technologies into environmentally unsustainable projects. Progress regarding social acceptance, accuracy and cultural justice is urgently needed for ensuring the socio-cultural sustainability of rural electrification efforts in DCs. This review may help stakeholders to identify and (based on prior experiences) address the most severe drawbacks affecting the sustainability of rural electrification efforts in DCs.

TI Financial sustainability of urban water cycle services in developing
   countries: a case study in Mozambique
SO WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY
AB A management strategy to achieve financial sustainability of urban water cycle services in developing countries is presented, based on the development of the Long Term Water Supply and Sanitation Services Investment Plan for the Water and Sanitation Infrastructure Administration (Administracao de Infra-estruturas de Agua e Saneamento (AIAS)) of Mozambique. AIAS is responsible for water supply and sanitation systems of 151 cities and towns (9.38 million inhabitants in 2015, 17.55 million expected in 2040). The needs in this sector are considerable, financial resources are scarce and, as a result, the Millennium Development Goals are still off track to be achieved. An integrated approach was applied to estimate the investments needs, considering differentiated levels of service depending on the urban area characteristics and taking into consideration the household income limitations, in order to achieve an economically sustainable increase in coverage and service level. The work developed resulted in an action plan aligned with the national strategy vision and adaptable to every city and town of Mozambique, including two decision support tools to enable stakeholders' decision making on potential investments: the Water and Wastewater Database (Base de Informacao de Agua e Saneamento) and the Dynamic Economic tool to support investments in water supply and sanitation services.

It highlights an important shift in policy-thinking in the international aid architecture that has dominated the global education aid agenda since the early 1990s. It argues that Rawlsian principles of social justice, human rights perspectives, and advancements in economic theory that emphasize the role of human capital in development have been central in that process. The studies of this Special Issue aim to address the general question of how aid can better support the collective actions that seek to improve education systems in developing countries. Overall, they provide an analysis of key policy strategies that can improve the functioning of education systems and the quality of services, and discuss major challenges for the future global education agenda.

Far from neglecting the environmental, financial and economic matters, this research focuses upon the sustainable management of human resources in developing countries, selecting Lebanon as an example. Furthermore, instead of going deep into utopian theories, this research assumes pragmatism in highlighting the deficiencies of management in the developing countries and in recommending policies to be reviewed and possibly adopted. Managing human capital is heavily based on the leader's ability to effectively communicate and transform his/her team members into creative doers. Sustainable public management is based on healthy policies and objectives that must be diligently pursued by managers irrespective of what, in certain cases, the internal and external environment may otherwise dictate. The aim is to maximize the value produced by the available resources. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Such is the case with avian influenza, more commonly known as avain flu (H5N1). Since the potential threat of global pandemic of avain flu (H5N1) is growing and the developing countries' economy is affected to a small extent, now it is the high time to formulate effective and essential measures which include heightened influenza surveillance, early detection and appropriate pandemic preparedness plans. The appropriate use of vaccines, antiviral drugs and public health interventions will greatly reduce their economic impact in the developing countries.

TI The Effects of Agricultural Product Exports on Environmental Quality
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Concerns about the environmental degradation of agricultural activities have increased with trade openness and globalization. In this study, the effects of agricultural product exports on environmental quality are investigated using panel data and instrumental variable regression models for 23 developed and 43 developing countries during 2002-2020. The results indicate that the expansion of agricultural product exports from developing countries has a detrimental effect on the environmental quality of these countries. Total agricultural exports increase pollution due to greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries, while they decrease the N2O emissions in developed countries. Moreover, raw agricultural exports have a positive and significant effect on agricultural pollution emissions in developing countries, while they have a negative and significant effect on N2O emissions in developed countries. In many developing countries, export development is an important policy objective, and agricultural exports are among the most important export sectors. Hence, policymakers need to consider the effects of agricultural product exports on the environment and increase farmers' awareness about the environmental consequences of agricultural activities. A better understanding of the environmental impacts of agricultural exports from developing countries is highly recommended.

TI Input Digitization of the Manufacturing Industry and Carbon Emission
   Intensity Based on Testing the World and Developing Countries
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Facing the increasingly deteriorating climate, carbon emission reduction has become a global consensus. In particular, as an industry with very serious pollution emissions, the manufacturing industry is under enormous pressure to reduce environmental consumption. At the same time, against the background of rapid digitization development, the production and organization of the manufacturing industry have greatly changed, which also provides new research ideas for global carbon emission reduction. Based on the panel data of 40 major economies in the world, this paper calculates the degree of input digitization of the manufacturing industry using the input-output method and constructs a triple fixed effect model to analyze the impact of manufacturing's input digitization on its carbon emission intensity from the perspective of the world and developing countries. The research finds that, first, on the global level, input digitization significantly reduces the carbon emission intensity of manufacturing, and the effect of carbon reduction increases gradually over time, with a noticeable industry spillover effect. Second, the test results from developing countries show that the relationship between digital input from developed countries and manufacturing's carbon intensity in developing countries presents an inverted U shape. Third, heterogeneity analysis shows that digital input has the most obvious effect on carbon reduction in the pollution-intensive manufacturing sector. Tracking the sources of digital input, it is found that digital input from high-tech economies has the most obvious effect on carbon reduction. The paper takes the lead in clarifying the impact of digitization on carbon emissions from the manufacturing sector, expands the existing research on the digital economy and the environment, and also makes a theoretical contribution to global carbon emission reduction.

   Epilepsy Care in Developing Countries
SO ANNALS OF INDIAN ACADEMY OF NEUROLOGY
AB Nearly 80% of the 50 million people with epilepsy worldwide reside in developing countries that are least equipped to tackle the enormous medical, social and economic challenges posed by epilepsy. These include widespread poverty, illiteracy, inefficient and unevenly distributed health care systems, and social stigma and misconceptions associated with epilepsy. Several studies have reported that a large proportion of patients with epilepsy in developing countries never receive appropriate treatment for their condition, and many, though diagnosed and initiated on treatment, soon discontinue treatment. Unaffordable cost of treatment, unavailability of antiepileptic drugs, and superstitious and cultural beliefs contribute to high epilepsy treatment gap in resource-poor countries. A significant proportion of the current burden of epilepsy in developing countries can be minimized by educating the public about the positive aspects of life with epilepsy and the primary and secondary physicians about current trends in the management of epilepsies, scaling up routine availability of low-cost antiepileptic drugs, and developing cost-effective epilepsy surgery programs.

TI Debt sustainability, public investment, and natural resources in
   developing countries: The DIGNAR model
SO ECONOMIC MODELLING
AB Policymakers in resource-rich developing countries often face complicated fiscal choices to manage natural resource revenues. While investing resource revenues in public capital may promote economic growth, spending without saving or borrowing against future revenues can expose the economy to debt sustainability risks. This paper presents the Debt, Investment, Growth, and Natural Resources (DIGNAR) model for analyzing the macroeconomic and debt sustainability effects of scaling up public investment in resource-rich developing countries. It captures pervasive problems of these countries that may be aggravated during scaling-ups, including investment inefficiency and limited absorptive capacity. It also allows for flexible fiscal specifications: investment can be jointly financed by resource revenues and debt; a resource fund may be used as a buffer; and distorting fiscal adjustments are subject to feasibility constraints. The application to an average low-income country shows that, when fiscal adjustment is implementable, a delinked public investment approach combined with the resource fund - such that government spending is a-cyclical with respect to resource revenues - can reduce macroeconomic instability relative to a spend-as-you-go approach. However, even with the fund, ambitious frontloading public investment plans combined with more borrowing can induce debt sustainability risks, especially with declining investment efficiency or when future resource revenues turn out to be lower than expected.

TI Economic determinants of deforestation in developing countries
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Forests are an important natural resource that provides to society several valuable goods and services that include timber, fuel, food, chemicals, medicines, climate regulation, and soil protection. Forests in several developing countries are however being destroyed at a rapid rate with adverse impacts such as increased soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and increased emissions of greenhouse gases that cause climate change. The causes of deforestation are complex and diverse and depend on the socio-economic, political, cultural, legal and institutional contexts of the countries in which the affected forests are located. This paper examines the deforestation trends in developing countries and discusses the key drivers of deforestation in these countries. The paper also identifies and discusses some approaches that can be used to reduce deforestation. The insights provided by the paper can be practically applied to formulate policies, strategies and action plans for improving forest management and enhancing both their economic contribution and role in sustainable development.

TI Are complementary reforms a "luxury" for developing countries?
SO JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS
AB This paper investigates the impact of complementarity reforms on growth and how it depends on GDP per capita. Based on reform data for six policy areas compiled from various sources during the period 1994-2006 for over 100 countries, we compute composite indicators of reform level and complementarity. We provide qualitative justification for the existence of pair-wise complementarities among policy areas. We then use cross-section and panel data estimates to test the effect of reform level and complementarity on GDP per capita growth. We found reforms to be positively related and their dispersion (or the inverse of complementarity) negatively related to growth, controlling for initial conditions, monetary stability and other structural and institutional variables, as well as endogeneity of reform level and complementarity. We show that the effect of policy complementarity is a stronger condition for sustainable growth in developing than in advanced countries, to conclude that complementary reforms are not a 'luxury' for developing countries.

In order to achieve economy sustainable development, the electricity industry must adjust existing energy structure and adopt new efficiency clean generation technology. However, in exiting electricity planning, nuclear energy develops slowly due to lack of funds and technology The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) provided an opportunity and challenge for developing country parties in achieving sustainable development.
   The "Clean Development Mechanism" (CDM) was proposed by the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change. It aims at assisting developing country parties to achieve sustainable development, and assisting developed country parties to achieve their obligation of emission reduction promised in the Kyoto Protocol in lower cost. It means it is a mutual beneficial mechanism that could be implemented between developed and developing countries. Therefore there is much interest in CDM by international bodies.

SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) was established by Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol and is intended to attract private sector involvement, either through investment aimed at generating saleable certified emission reductions (CERs), or through the purchase of these CERs by companies who have their own emissions obligations. It is also intended to provide specific benefits for developing countries, including transfer of clean technology, foreign direct investment, localised environmental improvement and an income stream from the sale of CERs. Examination of how inter-firm coordination will take place within the global (carbon) economy and how this goes beyond traditional dichotomies, needs to be assessed. Because the benefits will depend not only on the overall level of investment, but also on the nature of the projects and the extent to which they generate spillovers and learning in developing countries, those developing countries may wish to examine evolution of CDM market structures in more strategic terms.

TI Revisiting the Inequality-Well-being Nexus: The Case of Developing

SO GLOBAL SOCIAL WELFARE
AB This study examines the inequality-well-being nexus in 66 developing countries spanning from 2006 to 2017. Well-being is approached through the subjective well-being perspective, while inequality is considered in terms of differences in income distribution. The findings obtained using the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) and the IV-Tobit strategies reveal that inequality proxied by the Gini index, the Palma ratio and the Atkinson ratio, hurts subjective well-being proxied by the Life Ladder index. The findings of the study suggest policymakers should formulate policies that will help reduce income inequality to improve the well-being of the citizens. This is in line with the setting of international policy objectives toward the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aimed at reducing extreme poverty and inequality. One way of achieving this is through the creation of decent employment for all.

AB Developing countries' resource choices are constrained by their role in the international economy. Growing awareness of the environment as a global commons is likely to further constrain their development options. The impact of the internationalization of the economy on their resource choices is demonstrated by examining three uses of near-shore marine resources: dumping, fishing, and tourism and recreation. In each case, resource choices are driven by the developing countries' place in the international economy. As the international community attempts to steer development along an environmentally responsible path, developing countries need to present their own vision of an acceptable future.

TI AN OPEN-ECONOMY MODEL OF THE EFFECTS OF UNILATERAL ENVIRONMENTAL-POLICY
   BY A LARGE DEVELOPING-COUNTRY
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB In this paper, we pose the following question. Why is it that despite the universal recognition of the need for global environmental protection, developing countries have been lax in instituting stringent environmental regulations? Addressing this question from an economic standpoint, we show that there are plausible theoretical circumstances in which a large developing country can be worse off if it chooses to implement environmental policy in an uncoordinated fashion. The empirical dimension of this question is stressed and the key parameters - such as elasticities and marginal propensities to consume - which are germane to any policy discussion regarding this issue are identified. Second, we study - once again from the perspective of a large developing country - the possibility of using the domestic tax structure optimally to attain environmental policy objectives in a second-best environment. This scenario involves taxing pollution indirectly, by using product taxes. Finally, keeping the empirical dimension of the question in mind, we show how to compute optimal externality correcting taxes. These taxes are primarily a function of different kinds of elasticities.

TI Economic burden of physical inactivity: healthcare costs associated with
   cardiovascular disease
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR PREVENTION & REHABILITATION
AB Increasingly important objectives for developed and especially for developing countries include increasing the numbers of individuals who do not smoke, who eat healthy diets and who are physically active at levels that are health enhancing. In developing countries, deaths from chronic disease are projected to increase from 56% of all deaths in 2005 to 65% by 2030 (driven largely driven by deaths due to cardiovascular and coronary heart disease); in developed countries, however, the increase is only from 87.5 to 88.5%. The data on physical inactivity presented in this review were derived primarily from World Health Organization (WHO) publications and data warehouses. The prevalence of physical inactivity at less than the levels recommended for enhancing health is high; from 17 to 91% in developing countries and from 4 to 84% in developed countries. In developed countries, physical inactivity is associated with considerable economic burden, with 1.5-3.0% of total direct healthcare costs being accounted for by physical inactivity. Other than on some exciting work in Brazil, there is little information on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of physical activity-enhancement strategies in developing countries. The WHO has signaled a shift from the treatment of illness to promotion of health, with an emphasis on changing modifiable health-risk factors, including smoking, unhealthy diets and physical inactivity: the real question, especially for developing countries, is 'what is the future healthcare cost of not encouraging healthier lifestyles today?'.

TI Impact of Environmental Quality on Healthcare Expenditures in Developing
   Countries: A Panel Data Approach
SO HEALTHCARE
AB Objective: The deterioration in environmental quality has an economic and social cost. The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of environmental factors on health expenditures in developing countries. Method: To analyze the relationship between environmental quality (air pollution and temperature) and health expenditure in thirty-three developing countries, the study uses system generalized method of moments (GMM) using data from 2000 to 2017. Results: The results suggest a positive effect of both air pollution and temperature on health expenditure. However, the effect is highest for government health expenditure, followed by private and total health expenditure in the studied countries. The results further suggest that the impact of environmental factors is greater in higher-income countries when we divide the studied countries into two groups, i.e., higher- and lower-income countries. Conclusion: Our results are interesting and informative for the policy makers to design such policies to attain better environmental quality and social well-being. The increased healthcare expenditures due to increased air pollution and climate change necessitate for an efficient, reliable, affordable and modern energy policy by emphasizing the use of clean and renewable energy in these countries that ensure better health for the masses. Furthermore, a smart and sustainable environmentally friendly economic growth policy is necessary to ensure better health for the masses.

TI Techno-economic assessment of bioenergy options using crop and forest
   residues for non-electrified rural growth centres in Zambia
SO BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
AB Improving access to modern energy in rural areas through the electrification of rural growth centres (RGCs) mainly by grid extension remains a challenge in Zambia. During the last 15 years, electrification rates have marginally increased from 3 to 11% for rural areas. This does not only represent the status quo of access to modern energy in these areas but also shows the unlikelihood of attaining the 2030 rural electrification target of 51%. Biomass-based systems offer viable alternatives/complements of supplying modern energy. Sustainable development of these technologies begins with identifying viable bioenergy systems from a wide range of options. Accordingly, this paper focused on a first-level techno-economic assessment of different bioenergy options that employed lignocellulosic residues as feedstock to provide heating/cooking and electricity-enabled energy services in non-electrified RGCs of Zambia. The results indicate that fuels to provide cooking/heating energy services could be supplied by pellets and briquettes in an economically viable manner. Gasification and combustion technologies were more financially attractive compared to diesel generators for electricity production. Therefore, they are viable alternatives for providing electricity, an important enabler for the much-needed rural development in the country. However, at the moment they cannot provide electricity at costs competitive with grid-electricity, partly due to subsidized electricity tariffs in Zambia. It is recommended that a decision support system framework for biomass exploitation using such technologies should be established. Such a framework should guide policy makers to identify optimal means of using biomass to provide modern energy services in the RGCs of the country.

TI Health expenditure, human capital, and economic growth: an empirical
   study of developing countries
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
AB Social security systems were successively established in most developing countries in the 1980s and 1990s. To ensure the long-term sustainability of these newly established systems it is essential to carefully monitor the economic impact. Based on the panel data of 21 developing countries from 2000 to 2016, this paper is the first to apply the panel threshold model to empirically analyze the relationship between national health expenditures and economic growth under different levels of human capital. The results show that health expenditure and economic growth have significant interval effects because of the different levels of human capital. Specifically, when human capital levels are low, health expenditure is significantly negatively correlated with economic growth. When human capital is at a medium level, health expenditure has a positive but not significant impact on economic growth. When the level of human capital is high, the positive economic impact of the health expenditure is significantly enhanced. In addition, subgroup analyses indicate that population aging and low fertility aggravate the negative impact of health expenditures on economic growth. This study provides reliable analysis and can be used by developing countries to maintain a long-term sustainable social security system.

AB In bulk of the developing countries, the consumption of commercial energy has increased rather rapidly, though a few of them still continue to derive their main energy needs for subsistence from the traditional fuels. This paper presents the patterns of energy consumption in developing countries (a group of about 130 countries) and the developed countries (about 27) illustrating the regional differences. A quantitative study of demographic and economic parameters show. increasing income levels in terms of People's Purchasing Power (PPP) and also an increasing energy intensity causing serious environmental disorders in many developing countries. China, India, Korea and Mexico are amongst the world's top twelve carbon emitters along with the top economies of the world. These countries at the same time show very different urban and rural energy consumption patterns. Estimates in any case show a definite decline in traditional energy use and increasing dependence on fossil fuels. Case of India has been taken as an illustration. Any global effort therefore for sustainable energy development has to consider the developments in the developing countries. Various options for decreasing energy consumption and reducing environmental pollution have been discussed with cost estimates. The paper generates arguments about increasing international cooperation for energy supply in the developing countries.

TI Determinants of green growth in developed and developing countries
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Considering the need for environmental sustainability while ensuring economic growth and development by 2030, this study uses data on 123 developed and developing countries to examine factors that influence green growth. The empirical results show that economic development positively influences green growth. However, trade openness is detrimental to green growth. Regarding energy-related factors, we find energy consumption negatively affecting green growth, but renewable energy consumption significantly improves green growth. In further analysis, we find that the influence of these factors differs between developed and developing countries. The result implies that countries at a different development level will require different strategies in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in 2030. The results are robust to alternative identification strategies such as the System Generalised Method of Movement, which accounts for potential endogeneity.

TI Role of informal sector recycling in waste management in developing
   countries
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB Many thousands of people in developing country cities depend on recycling materials from waste for their livelihoods. With the focus of the Millennium Development Goals on poverty reduction, and of waste strategies on improving recycling rates, one of the major challenges in solid waste management in developing countries is how best to work with this informal sector to improve their livelihoods, working conditions and efficiency in recycling.
   The general characteristics of informal recycling are reviewed, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. Despite the health and social problems associated with informal recycling, it provides significant economic benefits that need to be retained. Experience shows that it can be highly counterproductive to establish new formal waste recycling systems without taking into account informal systems that already exist. The preferred option is to integrate the informal sector into waste management planning, building on their practices and experience, while working to improve efficiency and the living and working conditions of those involved. Issues associated with integrating informal recycling into the formal waste management sector are discussed. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB Despite years of effort primarily by governments and donors the ability of large portions of the world's population to access modern and efficient energy services remains out of reach. Roughly 1.5 billion people live without access to electricity and 2.5 billion rely on biomass for their primary cooking fuel, often using highly inefficient and polluting cookstoves. Scaling up the effort to solve this energy-poverty problem requires innovation in service delivery which includes possible changes in both ownership of energy service delivery organizations and the ways in which energy is financed. This paper reviews options for innovative business models to scale up energy access and, in particular, focuses on both producer and consumer-side financing options that can ensure sustainability of energy access efforts.

TI Energy access in Africa: Challenges ahead
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB This paper presents a review of the current situation and projections for energy access in Africa. The paper also presents several sets of ambitious energy access targets as agreed by the regional groupings within the region. The paper argues that achieving between 50% and 100% access to modern energy services by 2030 in Africa will require more effective mobilization and use of both domestic and external funding, and the development and implementation of innovative policy frameworks. The paper suggests that greater emphasis will need to be placed on productive uses of energy and energy for income generation in order to break the vicious circle of low incomes leading to poor access to modern energy services, which in turn puts severe limitations on the ability to generate higher incomes. The paper further suggests that if anything near the ambitious targets set by African organisations are to be achieved then it will be advisable to tap into the full menu of energy resource and technology options, and there will be the need for significant increases in the numbers of various actors involved together with more effective institutions in the energy sector.

SO ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB Non-motorized transport (NMT) is the use of a bicycle or walking to travel from one place to another. It is gaining popularity especially in the developed countries due to low transport externalities such as emissions and traffic congestion alongside its benefits to physical and mental health. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the existing literature related to NMT is presented focusing on the factors including built environment, geography, and weather, the health, and environmental benefits of NMT, and the motivational approach for increasing the use of NMT. The built environment, geography and weather, and socioeconomic factors significantly affect the use of NMT as a travel mode. This study reviewed some unique characteristics of NMT especially in developing countries to provide a clear understanding of the dynamics of NMT. Despite existence of vast research on NMT, a comprehensive literature review to evaluate different aspects of NMT seems essential to address the future challenges with significant automobile ownership increase in the developing nations and the associated externalities. The developing nations have to understand the factors of NMT with reference to their socio-economic conditions and perform quantitative analyses to estimate and project benefits of NMT including health benefits. The policy makers in the developing countries should consider the NMT as one element of the solution matrix to address the challenges of road transport.

TI The Global Financial Crisis Has Led To A Slowdown In Growth Of Funding
   To Improve Health In Many Developing Countries
SO HEALTH AFFAIRS
AB How has funding to developing countries for health improvement changed in the wake of the global financial crisis? The question is vital for policy making, planning, and advocacy purposes in donor and recipient countries alike. We measured the total amount of financial and in-kind assistance that flowed from both public and private channels to improve health in developing countries during the period 1990-2011. The data for the years 1990-2009 reflect disbursements, while the numbers for 2010 and 2011 are preliminary estimates. Development assistance for health continued to grow in 2011, but the rate of growth was low. We estimate that assistance for health grew by 4 percent each year from 2009 to 2011, reaching a total of $27.73 billion. This growth was largely driven by the World Bank's International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and appeared to be a deliberate strategy in response to the global economic crisis. Assistance for health from bilateral agencies grew by only 4 percent, or $444.08 million, largely because the United States slowed its development assistance for health. Health funding through UN agencies stagnated, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria announced that it would make no new grants for the next two years because of declines in funding. Given the international community's focus on meeting the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 and persistent economic hardship in donor countries, continued measurement of development assistance for health is essential for policy making.

TI Toward improving impact of sustainable ventures in developing countries:
   A structuration view
SO BUSINESS STRATEGY AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Evidence shows that low-income and developing countries disproportionately bear the negative impacts of unsustainable business practice and are the least able to withstand these impacts. There is an urgent need to address these problems as prospects for economic development are inexorably linked to the consequences of environmental degradation and negative social impact. As global awareness of this phenomenon has risen, the attractiveness of firms that take a balanced approach between pecuniary outcomes and sustainable practices has increased. Firms are under pressure to reduce the negative externalities they generate and increase positive externalities. An approach that increases the attractiveness and effectiveness of sustainable ventures can help firms get closer to this goal. We use structuration theory to develop strategy recommendations toward this goal. Structuration theory recognizes the duality of agency and structure, and provides a framework for understanding social phenomena at a meso-level of analysis. The theory describes three structural configurations that have varying levels of influence in social settings. We build upon this theory to argue that the success of sustainable ventures is affected by the degree to which their actions cohere with the strongest social structures operating in their regions. We illustrate our theoretical argument by describing how three sustainable tourism ventures in Central America and three organic foods ventures in Southeast Asia are co-creating social structures that result in positive externalities.

TI An Empirical Analysis of the Relationship Between Private Investment and

SO MALIYE DERGISI
AB Private investment plays a vital role to promote sustainable economic growth and to reduce poverty in developing countries. The idea of using private sector investments intensively to boost growth in Turkey has started to emerge after 1980s. Despite a sizeable empirical literature, the impact of public investment in the developing countries gives inconsistent results on whether it complements or crowds out private investment. This paper makes use of Blejer and Khan Model (1984) for Turkey over the 1980-2009 periods estimating the effect of public investment on private sector. We employed time series analysis in this study. Our findings support the hypothesis that GDP growth stimulates private investment while public investment and private investment are complementary. The other finding of the study is that credit constraint is an important determinant of private investments in Turkey.

TI The international diffusion of new technologies: A multitechnology
   analysis of latecomer advantage and global economic integration
SO ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS
AB The diffusion of modern, efficient technology has far-reaching consequences for the geography of economic activity, inequality, and environmental quality. This article examines two popular yet highly controversial claims about the conditions most favorable to the rapid spread of new technology. The first states that latecomer advantage allows developing countries to diffuse new technology faster than developed countries. The second claim, widely articulated by advocates of neoliberal policy reform, is that new technologies diffuse more rapidly where countries are "open" to international trade and investment. To investigate these claims we use event-history analysis to estimate the determinants of diffusion speed across a large panel of developed and developing countries for three very different technologies. These are: continuous steel casting, shuttleless textile weaving looms, and digital telephone mainlines. Our results broadly support both propositions. Countries that adopt new technology later or have a smaller existing capital stock-characteristic features of developing countries-diffuse new technology more rapidly than countries that adopt earlier or have more installed capacity-two characteristics of developed countries. Trade openness is also found to influence the rate of diffusion positively for all three technologies. Yet, consistent with recent empirical studies, we fail to find support for the idea that foreign direct investment (FDI) accelerates the diffusion of new technology in host economies.

TI The Role of Agriculture in Ensuring Food Security in Developing
   Countries: Considerations in the Context of the Problem of Sustainable
   Food Production
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Ensuring food security has become an issue of key importance to countries with different degrees of economic development, while the agricultural sector plays a strategic role in improving food availability. The aim of this paper is to identify relationships between the undernourishment scale and selected characteristics describing the agricultural sector within identified clusters of developing countries. Typological groups of countries were separated using Ward's method. It results from the analyses that the greatest problems with maintaining food security are observed in the developing countries with a high share of agriculture in their Gross Domestic Product (GDP), adverse conditions hindering agricultural production and deficient infrastructure. Based on research results desirable and tailored strategies for food security improvement in individual clusters were developed. Promoting investments in agricultural infrastructure and extension services along with adopting measures aimed at increasing the households' purchasing power, especially those in rural areas, appear to be key drivers for improving both food availability and food access. The paper focuses not only on identifying the reasons of undernourishment, but also contributes to recognition of the most effective ways to solve the hunger problem under a country's unique conditions. It offers a comprehensive perspective for the policy formulation in various areas world-wide, which may be of interest to scholars and policy makers.

TI Knowledge-based urban development potential of Turkish provinces
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE-BASED DEVELOPMENT
AB Knowledge economy (KE) has started to effect cities towards becoming knowledge cities (KC) to increase competitiveness in KE. Knowledge- based urban development (KBUD) strategies that draw the path to become KCs have already been adopted by several cities around the world. Turkey as one of the developing countries that has developed strategies for increasing competitiveness in KE, is missing a comprehensive planning approach towards becoming building a KC. The purpose of this paper is to determine which province(s) are strategically more appropriate to adopt KBUD strategies in Turkey. The study will, first, evaluate existing assessment models and, second, will introduce the model used specifically for Turkish provinces. After presenting the results of KBUD potential index of Turkish provinces, the study aims to end with a note on which provinces have higher potential to adopt KBUD strategies for a balanced and sustainable economic development.

TI Determinants for investing in oil exploration: the case of Argentina
SO CUADERNOS DE ECONOMIA-SPAIN
AB This article examines the cyclic behavior of investing in upstream oil and natural gas exploration in Argentina and some of the main economic variables in agreement with Kydland and Prescott's methodology (1990). The objective is to clarify the determinants involved in deciding to make said investment in a developing country. Some of the main qualitative results are related to the fact that the economic variables may not be explained individually, to the relevance of uncertainty and its impact on the agents' rationality when making decisions especially in developing countries as is the case that is analyzed. These aspects must particularly be taken into consideration when analyzing the sustainability of the energy system and the energy policy's design, mainly given the role of energy supply in socio-economic development.

TI Climate change, agriculture, and developing countries: Does adaptation
   matter?
SO WORLD BANK RESEARCH OBSERVER
AB Because most developing countries depend heavily on agriculture, the effects of global warming on productive croplands are likely to threaten both the welfare of the population and the economic development of the countries. Tropical regions in the developing world are particularly vulnerable to potential damage from environmental changes because the poor soils that cover large areas of these regions already have made much of the land unusable for agriculture.
   Although agronomic simulation models predict that higher temperatures will reduce grain yields as the cool wheat-growing areas get warmer they have not examined the possibility that farmers will adapt by making production decisions that are in their own best interests. A recent set of models examines cross-sectional evidence from India and Brazil and finds that even though the agricultural sector is sensitive to climate, individual farmers no take local climates into account, and their ability to do so will help mitigate the impacts of global warming.

TI Review A systematic review of green finance in the banking industry:
   perspectives from a developing country
SO GREEN FINANCE
AB Globally, scholars and practitioners are becoming increasingly interested in determining the interaction between finance and environmental sustainability. However, a few studies have investigated and organized existing information in the context of the green finance of banks in developing countries. The purpose of our study is to find major dimensions of green finance and research gaps from a thorough evaluation of the literature. As a result, existing research on green finance in the banking industry has been evaluated in this paper with a focus on green finance and sustainable development. This study employs the content analysis method and it analyzed and summarized a total of 53 relevant previous studies in the field of green finance. The findings of this research reveal 21 crucial dimensions of green finance in Bangladesh. The primary green finance products of Bangladeshi banks include green securities, green investments, climate finance, green insurance, green credit, green bonds and green infrastructure. The other factors include environmental performance and green economic growth, energy efficiency, green finance policy and environmental protection and the risk impact of bank policy formulation. The findings of this study will help policymakers to understand the green finance concept and its associated variables, which need to be considered when adopting and implementing green finance.

TI Micro-entrepreneurship, sustainable development goal one and cultural
   expectations of Ghanaian women
SO JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB Purpose
   Using functional contextualism, this study aims to explore how Ghanaian micro-entrepreneurship of women (MEW) impacts on the achievement of four targets of sustainable development goal 1 (SDG) (income, social protection, economic resources and resilience) with the cultural factors of women as a mediator.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Using a mixed methods approach, semi-structured questionnaires were used to collect data from 171 micro women entrepreneurs in Tema. The data collected was analyzed using thematic and multiple regression techniques.
   Findings
   The study reveals that micro women entrepreneurship relates significantly to earning incomes and procuring economic resources. These targets cannot be achieved without the significant effects of cultural factors.
   Originality/value
   This paper contributes to the literature on micro women entrepreneurship and sustainable development goals by indicating that a better appreciation of the relationship of micro women entrepreneurship and achievement of SDG 1 targets will have to be examined within the cultural setting of women. The theoretical contribution is in showing that MEW to be an enabler for achieving the earning of income and procuring economic resource targets of SDG 1. Micro women entrepreneurship is both a process (earning income) and outcome (procuring economic resources) for achieving SDG 1 targets.

TI The G8 and global health - What now? What next?
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SANTE PUBLIQUE
AB The policies of the G8 countries (the G7 industrialized countries Plus Russia) matter for population health and the determinants of health worldwide. In the years before the 2005 Summit, relevant G7 commitments were more often broken than kept, representing an inadequate response to the scale of health crises in countries Outside the industrialized world. The commitments made in 2005 by some G7 countries to increase development assistance to the longstanding target of 0.70% of Gross National Income, and by the G7 as a whole to additional debt cancellation for some developing countries, were welcome and overdue. However, Canada and the United States did not state timetables for reaching the development assistance target, and new conditionalities attached to debt relief may undermine the benefits for population health. Lack of adequate funding for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, even after the September 2005 replenishment meeting, is unconscionable; yet even if those funds were provided, additional resources for developing country health systems would be needed. Similarly, widespread agreement on the need for improving market access for developing country exports was not met with any concrete policy response to the "asymmetrical" nature of recent trade liberalization; neither was the need to control the deadly trade in small arms. To respond adequately to global health needs, the G8 will need to adopt an agenda that more fundamentally alters the distribution of economic and political power, within and among nations.

TI Influence of Governance Indicators on Illicit Financial Outflow from
   Developing Countries
SO CONTEMPORARY ECONOMICS
AB Economic growth has traditionally been attributed to the accumulation of human and physical capital and the increased productivity arising from technological innovation. The quest to attract physical capital led to the design and implementation of policies and the building of institutions by governments of developing countries to create a congenial investment environment to attract foreign investors. The multinational corporations operating in these developing countries take advantage of these policies to profit from these countries in terms of capital through both legal and fraudulent activities. For governments and stakeholders to be able to fight this menace of illicit financial outflow, there is a need for a comprehensive scrutiny of the quality of governance indicators that enhance the activities of these multinational companies. Therefore, this study seeks to explore the influence of cross-country indicators of governance on the illicit financial flow from developing countries. This study is based on secondary data (panel) derived from the Global Financial Integrity, World Development Indicators and Worldwide Governance Indicators. The total number of developing countries included in the analysis is 139, and 1562 observations are included. Using the multilevel estimation approach, the study finds that regulatory quality has a negative and significant influence on the illicit financial flow, while government effectiveness, corruption and FDI net inflows have a significant positive effect. This finding calls for developing countries to design and implement sound policies, build effective and accountable institutions, control corruption and enhance regulatory quality to control this issue.

TI Global contributors to antibiotic resistance
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Introduction: Antibiotic-resistant infections have become increasingly prevalent nowadays. As a result, it is essential to examine the key socioeconomic and political factors which contribute to the rise in the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in developing and developed nations. This study aims to identify the various contributors to the development of antibiotic resistance in each type of nation. Methods: PUBMED was used to identify primary research, systematic reviews, and narrative reviews published before Jan 2017. Search terms included antibiotic resistance, antimicrobial resistance, superbugs, multidrug-resistant organisms, developing countries, developed countries. Publications from different countries were included to ensure generalizability. Publications were excluded if they didn't mention factors causing resistance, focused on the molecular basis of resistance, or if they were case reports. Publicly available reports from national and international health agencies were used. Results: In developing countries, key contributors identified included: (1) Lack of surveillance of resistance development, (2) poor quality of available antibiotics, (3) clinical misuse, and (4) ease of availability of antibiotics. In developed countries, poor hospital-level regulation and excessive antibiotic use in food-producing animals play a major role in leading to antibiotic resistance. Finally, research on novel antibiotics is slow ing down due to the lack of economic incentives for antibiotic research. Conclusion: Overall, multiple factors, which are distinct for developing and developed countries, contribute to the increase in the prevalence of antibiotic resistance globally. The results highlight the need to improve the regulatory framework for antibiotic use and research globally.

TI A roadmap for BIM adoption and implementation in developing countries:
   the Pakistan case
SO ARCHNET-IJAR INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL RESEARCH
AB Purpose - Digital media is reshaping architectural design by introducing new tools, methods and workflows. Among various AEC tools, Building Information Modeling (BIM) has gained popularity due to its collaboration platform enabling cross-disciplinary teamwork during whole life cycle of buildings. BIM has further transformed culture and processes associated with design, construction and operation of buildings, hence triggering new building regulations in developed countries. However, in developing countries, BIM implementation is facing several barriers, such as lack of investment in technology and training, hesitation in quitting traditional tools and practices, etc. The purpose of this paper is to highlight potentials of BIM for developing countries, which are in need of more sustainable policies for enhancing their economic and environmental performances.
   Design/methodology/approach - Throughout the text, a literature review on BIM including its dimensions and benefits, impacts on architectural design and adoption in global and local contexts is provided. In case study, surveys and structured interviews are conducted with BIM user and non-BIM user architects throughout Pakistan. Beyond 2D/3D modeling, the use of BIM applications for sustainable design process such as scheduling (4D), cost estimation (5D), performance analysis and facilities management (6D) is investigated.
   Findings - Using analytical tools of an online surveying tool and SPSS statistical software, barriers and motivations for BIM implementation in Pakistan are determined. Strategies for further BIM adoption and implementation via "education and training institutions" and "supporting organizations and institutions" are defined.
   Originality/value - As a developing country, Pakistan shall be moving the barriers for the spread of BIM technology. Recent research covered the entire AEC sector (Masood et al., 2014; Sohu et al., 2017; Ali et al., 2018), yet this paper focuses specifically on architectural design and practice field. In order to find out experiences and expectations about BIM technology in the architecture sector, professionals are surveyed and four chief architects are interviewed. How far have Pakistani architects adopted BIM? For which project types and scales is BIM more serviceable for them? Which BIM applications are they implementing to overcome the limitations in their professional practice? In Pakistan, where sustainability, in terms of scheduling, cost estimation, performance analysis and facilities management, is an indispensible measure for local practices, has implementation of BIM technology achieved sustainability in architectural design process? What are the motivations of Pakistani architects for becoming BIM users in future?

AB Cities of the future will he increasingly populated but still arc not smart or energetically ready and cities must be planned and built only on the basis of algorithms, but should be a dynamic entity, resilient and sustainable. Africa's urban population is growing much faster than in Europe and is expected to surpass the rural_population by 2050, when city will increase to 62% [1] and even today about 30% of citizens have no access to electricity or heating fuels. [2]
   The new global sustainable development goals has set as a target [3] universal access to affordable, reliable energy, and sustainable for 2030 [4]. In the implementation of Smart Cities, Africa must not be left behind: promote fair, resilient and sustainable energy systems, responsible energy industries and access for the poor to clean energy, efficient and affordable services, must be a priority also for the European Community. Access to green energy and electricity, is crucial for reducing poverty and driving sustainable economic development, it is necessary an innovative and long-term sustainable approach to design energy services to meet the needs of people living in energy poverty and not only. Africa will be "the next big market" due to the rapid growth of emerging economics. Smart cities in Africa will he a challenge for the energy supply, use of renewable sources, a better quality of life, reduced energy consumption, less environmental impact. The key elements to achieve sustainability in developing countries will be the introduction of smart grids, smart metering, the Internet of Things (IoT), dissemination of information and communication technology (ICT): a new vision in which the citizen becomes a hub, being both consumer and producer of green energy, renewable energy spread widely in the area (solar, hydro, wind), through integration in smart grid. This paper aims to be a starting point for decision makers and for future research, highlighting how the Smart City, pose greater opportunity for developing countries like Africa, through new technologies already widely spread on the territory, jointly with the redistribution and efficient use of alternative energy sources.

CT 3rd Eurasian Conference on Educational Innovation (ECEI)
CY FEB 05-07, 2020
CL VIETNAM
AB According to the United Nations Development Program, sustainable development goals are fundamental for attaining a better and more sustainable future for all of us, and are a primary concern today. New indicators, such as the Economic Complexity Index (i.e., ECI), can be used to predict human development index (i.e., HDI). To be defined as a complex economy, a country, through a vast network of individuals, should be able to interlink extensive quantities of relevant knowledge to create diversified products. Political, cultural, and environmental factors should also be included in this model to improve the measurement of human development. This paper aimed to study the relationship between the ECI and HDI and the mediating effects of income inequality among developing countries. Hierarchical linear modeling was used as a statistical tool to analyze 87 developing countries from 1990 to 2017, which also studied the country-level effects of gender inequality and energy consumption. Different year lags were used for more robustness. The results show that human development increased with higher economic complexity. This relationship was, however, partially mediated by income inequality. Country-level predictors, gender inequality, and energy consumption also impacted sustainable development. Finally, it is essential to note that this model cannot be applied to developed economies.

TI Flood risk mitigation in developing countries: deriving accurate
   topographic data for remote areas under severe time and economic
   constraints
SO JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT
AB Isla Hispaniola, the island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic, has repeatedly witnessed catastrophic disasters that caused dramatic economic losses and killed thousands of people over the last decades. One striking example is the disastrous flood event that hit the transnational basin of River Soliette on 24 May 2004. The event resulted from a severe tropical storm and killed over 1000 Haitian and 400 Dominican people. In the context of an International Cooperation Initiative, the University of Bologna led several activities in the fields of flood risk assessment, management and mitigation, and sustainable development planning for the Soliette river basin. This paper presents new techniques for a timely assessment of flood risk in data-scarce and remote areas in developing countries showing in particular: (1) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based topographic survey of the Soliette riverbed, carried out under urgent temporal, logistical and technical constraints, and (2) some possible utilisations of the collected topographic data for the identification of structural and non-structural flood risk mitigation measures. The analysis enabled us to set and test a GNSS-based technique for fast, reliable and detailed topographic surveys in remote regions, which represents a valid option for similar areas with limited accessibility in emerging and developing countries.

TI The impact of mining on sustainable practices and the traditional
   culture of developing countries
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES AND SCIENCES
AB Mining has played a part in the economic development of developed countries such as the USA, Canada and Australia. However, the mining economic growth connection varies considerably from that claimed in the historical analogy reasoning. It is not evident that these countries' historical experience applies to modern developing nations due to modifications in the nature of the world economy. Some studies indicated that mineral resources in a developing country present a unique opportunity for its citizens to attain levels of socio-economic development equivalent to the first world. Ideally, through good governance practices, this could be realised without having to compromise their traditional and cultural integrity. In reality, though, the very opposite is normally true. There are varying definitions of sustainable development available. In the context of this paper, it defines sustainable development as 'a means of development that does not compromise the traditional and cultural integrity of a people but works towards a better standard of living'. From a neutral perspective, this paper aims to critically evaluate issues relating to the impact mining has had on sustainable practices and the traditional culture of people in the developing world. This is achieved through an in-depth analysis of practical examples taken from Kenya, Zambia and Nigeria. This paper aims at providing a balanced, non-biased perspective of the common pros and cons of mining that can relate to developing countries in a generic sense. The issues elaborated in greater detail in this study relate to good/bad governance practices, corruption, child labour and spread of diseases.

TI Women's Age at First Marriage and Long-Term Economic Empowerment in
   Egypt
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5 calls on nations to promote gender equality and to empower women and girls. SDG5 also recognizes the value of women's economic empowerment, entailing equal rights to economic resources and full participation at all levels in economic decisions. Also according to SDG5, eliminating harmful practices such as child marriage before age 18 is a prerequisite for women's economic empowerment. Using national data for 4,129 married women 15-43 years who took part in the Egypt Labor Market Panel Survey (ELMPS 1998-2012), we performed autoregressive, cross lagged panel analyses to assess whether women's first marriage in adulthood (at 18 years or older, as reported in 2006), was positively associated with their long-term post-marital economic empowerment, measured as their engagement in market work and latent family economic agency in 2012. Women's first marriage in adulthood had positive unadjusted associations with their market work and family economic agency in 2012. These associations persisted after accounting for market work and family economic agency in 2006, pre-marital resources for empowerment, and cumulative fertility. Policies to discourage child marriage may show promise to enhance women's long-term post-marital economic empowerment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Hepatitis B: Epidemiology and prevention in developing countries
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF HEPATOLOGY
AB Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a serious global public health problem. The infection may be transmitted through sexual intercourse, parenteral contact or from an infected mother to the baby at birth and, if contracted early in life, may lead to chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. On the basis of the HBV carrier rate, the world can be divided in 3 regions of high, medium and low endemicity. The major concern is about high endemicity countries, where the most common route of infection remains vertical transmission from mother to child. Screening of all pregnant women and passive immunization with human hepatitis B immunoglobulin are not affordable for many developing countries. The infection rate can be reduced by modifying behavior, improving individual education, testing all blood donations, assuring asepsis in clinical practice and screening all pregnant women. However, availability of a safe and efficacious vaccine and adoption of appropriate immunization strategies are the most effective means to prevent HBV infection and its consequences. The unsolved problem for poorest countries, where the number of people currently infected is high, is the cost of the vaccine. A future challenge is to overcome the social and economic hurdles of maintaining and improving a prevention policy worldwide to reduce the global burden of the disease. (C) 2012 Baishideng.

TI Vulnerability and policy responses in the face of natural resource
   discoveries and climate change: introduction
SO ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB This special issue contributes to the natural resource economics literature by shining a light on the specific challenges and opportunities faced by developing countries that have recently become dependent on natural resources or are particularly exposed to climate change. It is composed of five studies on countries from all regions of the developing world, involving a variety of natural resources and policy issues. Four of the five studies illustrate how computable general equilibrium models are particularly well-suited, despite their relatively limited past use, to the analysis of natural resources. All five studies are led by researchers based in these countries, providing unique insights into the specific local context. The studies underscore the extreme vulnerability that the introduction of significant natural resource revenues and climate change can create in developing countries. They also show how the choice of appropriate policies to avoid the resource curse varies according to country-specific economic conditions.

TI Global value chains participation and environmental pollution in
   developing countries: Does digitalization matter?
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB The study analyses the effect of global value chains participation (GVCP) on CO2 emissions and assesses whether digitalization technologies can enhance environmental quality. We use panel data estimation techniques for 112 developing countries over the period 1990-2018. Findings show that the GVCP contributes to environmental degradation. Other factors that increase environmental damage include FDI inflows, industrial value-added and electricity consumption. However, renewable energy consumption significantly reduces CO2 emissions. Findings show that digitalization is an effective channel in reducing CO2 emissions in the GVCP in developing countries. These findings have important policy implications in exploring the GVCP's development dynamics in upgrading opportunities from digital technologies to reduce environmental pollution and promote sustainable growth in developing economies.

TI Identification of objectives for national energy planning in developing
   countries
SO ENERGY STRATEGY REVIEWS
AB Defining objectives is an essential part of planning processes, useful to induce creative alternatives and to derive the attributes (criteria) on which the alternatives will be assessed. This article identifies a set of energy planning (EP) objectives and measurable attributes specifically tailored for promoting sustainability in developing countries. A literature review was conducted as part of a problem structuring activity to identify applicable EP objectives. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), with an emphasis on Ghana, was used as a representative area of study. Two EP objectives specific to the context of the ECOWAS were identified, namely, ensuring maintainability of the final energy supply system and access to final energy services. These were included within a set of EP objectives which consisted of the additional of increasing primary energy security and reliability of the final energy system, and decreasing costs (investment, operation & maintenance), influence of the energy system on the global climate, impact of the energy system on the local environment. These EP objectives were made operational through the identification of a set of corresponding measurable attributes. This EP objective set, used within a structured EP methodology, may support the implementation and sustainability of national EP activities in the countries of the region.

TI Analysing appropriateness in appropriate technology for achieving
   sustainability: A multi-sectorial examination in a developing economy
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Appropriate technology has emerged as a critical driver for sustainable development in developing countries where a massive population depends on small and medium-sized businesses. Appropriate technologies are energy-efficient, which corresponds to environmental sustainability. The benefits of appropriate technology may range from providing economic sustainability for availing affordable solutions in a resource-constrained environment to promoting social sustainability by fostering inclusivity of marginalized sections of the society. However, the appropriateness, which is the perceived quality of appropriate technology, largely remains unaddressed in prior research. Therefore, the current study proposes a framework to explore determinants of appropriateness and examine the interplay among them anchored on resource mobilization theory. Four case organizations of a developing country are empirically analyzed to obtain appropriateness factors from the perspectives of multiple stakeholders, namely, enterprises, developers, and users. Next, a decision-making technique is applied to derive the cause-effect relationship between the identified factors. The results contribute five factors of appropriateness: technological, socio-economic, organizational, market, and environment to the literature on appropriate technology. The former three factors induce the latter two factors of appropriateness. Understanding the interplay among the indicators from a multi-stakeholder perspective assists the policymakers in facilitating the adoption of appropriate technologies at the grassroots level to achieve sustainable development goals in developing economies.

TI Increasing the sustainability of household cooking in developing
   countries: Policy implications
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Although 40% of the global population relies on traditional biomass use, mainly firewood and charcoal, for cooking, traditional biomass has received very little attention in the current biomass debate, because of its considered primitive and unsustainable nature. In this review, we discuss how the sustainability of household cooking in developing countries can be improved.
   Indoor air pollution due to incomplete combustion of traditional biomass causes the death of 1.45 million people every year. mainly of women and children, who also carry the heavy burden of fuelwood collection. In addition, charcoal production and combustion is responsible for very high greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy. On the other hand. fuelwood production and trade is of vital importance for local economies and serves as safety net for the poorest people. Moreover, fuelwood collection is not a driver of deforestation and global fuelwood shortage will not occur, despite local problems of fuelwood provision.
   There are two distinct policy alternatives to increase the sustainability of cooking in developing countries. The first option is to climb the energy ladder and to switch from solid fuels to fossil fuels (LPG or kerosene), biogas or electricity. As this largely avoids the severe health damages of traditional biomass use, this option is considered the most desirable by numerous countries and by international organizations. However, as most developing countries are far away from meeting the necessary requirements, related to infrastructure, economics and local culture, expecting a large-scale switch to liquid fuels or electricity is unrealistic.
   In that case, the second policy option, increasing the sustainability of the current traditional biomass system, must be considered. This can be realized by an integrated approach, in which national and regional fuelwood policies are adapted, improved systems for charcoal production are implied and improved stoves, in combination with chimneys, are distributed.

TI Re-conceptualizing urban agriculture: an exploration of farming along
   the banks of the Yamuna River in Delhi, India
SO AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB The proportion of the world's population living in urban areas is increasing rapidly, with the vast majority of this growth in developing countries. As growing populations in urban areas demand greater food supplies, coupled with a rise in rural to urban migration and the need to create livelihood options, there has been an increase in urban agriculture worldwide. Urban agriculture is commonly discussed as a sustainable solution for dealing with gaps in the local food system, and proponents often highlight the many social, environmental, and economic benefits. We argue that the sustainability of urban agriculture should not be assumed. There is a need for research to take a bottom-up approach, exploring the influence that city-level conditions have on livelihood decisions by farmers and how this shapes the practice of urban agriculture. This paper uses a case study for an in-depth look at urban agriculture in Delhi, India to understand from the farmers' perspective how urban agriculture is practiced and what factors influence farmers' livelihood decisions. Using a team-based, multi-method Rapid Assessment Process, data were collected through preliminary key informant interviews, field observations, semi-structured interviews with urban farmers, and geographic information systems mapping. This research provides an in-depth description of market-oriented urban agriculture in a developing country, explores how farmers' livelihood decisions are embedded in the urban context, and discusses the potential of urban agriculture as a sustainable city-system.

TI Assessing the role of green economy on sustainable development in
   developing countries
SO HELIYON
AB Purpose: Over the last few years, the green economy (GE) notion has been realized as a key tool for achieving sustainable development (SD) in both developing and developed nations. Therefore, the current study tries to investigate the role of GE in achieving SD in developing countries. Through empirically examining the relationship between the GE and three different dependent variables which are GDP per capita, total unemployment rate, and poverty level, using cross-sectional data for 60 developing countries in 2018. Design/methodology/approach: Applying generalized least square (GLS) approach. The four dimensions of the Global Green Economy Index (GGEI) are the key independent variables that measure the accomplishment of nations in aspects of the global green economy. Findings: The empirical results showed the existence of a positive statistically significant relationship between the GE and GDP per capita and the level of total unemployment, while there is a negative statistically significant relationship between the GE and the poverty rate in developing countries.Implication policy: This study recommends that both the private and public sectors continue to endorse and adopt GE in the future for SD, job creation, and poverty alleviation. The original value of the study: It is the first research for developing countries that explores the relationship between GE and SD using three indicators of SD using a GLS approach according to our information. Also, this study categorized the dataset of the developing countries based on their income level for addressing the heteroskedasticity problem.

TI Does Critical Mass Matter? Women's Political Representation and Child
   Health in Developing Countries(*)
SO SOCIAL FORCES
AB Studies on developed countries demonstrate that an increase in women legislators leads to a prioritization in health, an increase in social policy spending, and a decrease in poverty. Women representatives could therefore improve development trajectories in developing countries; yet, currently, no cross-national and longitudinal studies explore this possibility. Using random effects panel regression, we examine the influence of women's representation on child health (one development indicator) across 102 developing countries from 1980 to 2005. Compared to countries with no women in parliament, countries meeting a 20-percent threshold experience increased rates of measles immunizations (10 percentage points), DPT immunizations (12 percentage points), infant survival (0.7 percentage points) and child survival (1 percentage point). Incremental increases in women's representation show that child health improves most in socially and economically disadvantaged countries, and in countries less integrated in the world polity. Our findings reveal the importance of increased women's representation, particularly in less developed and less globally embedded countries.

SP NATO, Sci & Environm Affairs Div
AB Proper management of solid wastes continues to be a serious problem world wide and especially in the economically developing countries. Growing population, rising standards of living and life-style, industrialization, and production and consumption of new products are acting in concert to generate increasingly greater quantities of solid wastes, and this in turn is creating serious problems of their management and proper disposal. Being aware of the implications of the problems of improper management and disposal, the developed countries have established their regulatory programmes. But the economically developing countries continue to manage solid wastes in what may be described as primitive ways such as throwing into open and unregulated dumps.
   In this paper it is argued that as a matter of priority, the economically developing countries should establish appropriate solid waste management programmes, publish related regulations and by-laws and strictly enforce their compliance. Turkey, which is an economically developing country, currently has a total of 2020 open and unregulated dumps that have serious implications for both health and safety. Typically in istanbul - a densely populated Metropolitan City - there have been serious disasters in recent years such as the 'Hekimbasi Open Dump accident' due to the improper management of solid wastes. However, following the publication in 1991 of the Solid Waste Control Regulation in Turkey, the municipalities have now started to abandon or rehabilitate the existing open dumps and construct sanitary landfills according to the standards stipulated in the regulation mentioned above. Since 1995 the Municipality of the Metropolitan City of istanbul has built six transfer stations and two sanitary landfill sites.
   It is argued, furthermore, that in the interests of environmental protection and quality of life, and for promoting sustainable development, it is essential for the economically developing countries to develop their national policies for solid waste management as a matter of priority, including recycling and/or recovery programmes and inventory studies on the quality and quantity of solid wastes.

AB This study conducts a comparative global quantitative analysis about solar thermal technological systems for developed and developing countries. Flat-plate solar collectors (FPSCs) supply hot water to a storage tank for use. It also supplies hot fluid at much higher temperatures for industrial processes. So, they are introduced and used in our analysis for getting realistic practical life results. The market structure and the government policies are taken as a reference for the comparison. The G-7 and the G-20 countries; along with the European Union (EU) are chosen for observing the differences in markets and policy trends of the solar energy systems in the period between 2005 and 2015. A significant convergence is obtained for the developing countries about catching up to the developed ones on a chosen reference. However, there are critical precautions and strategies that the G-20 countries should consider for sustainable improvements on these technological, environmentally friendly, and energy saving systems. Our study aims to figure out and displays these critical and crucial marketing and policy decisions as a guideline for the demand, the supply, and government sector sides of the developing countries. In the application, we measure the effectiveness of those economic policies for each country by creating a policy development index level, which attains the index values numerically referring the induced renewable energy policy.

TI The true cost of solving the plastic waste challenge in developing
   countries: The case of Ghana
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Mismanaged plastic waste is a major environmental concern, especially in countries of the Global South. Municipal solid waste management can not only alleviate environmental problems but also create jobs and promote local economic growth. However, providing appropriate waste management services is costly. The question is to what extent waste management policies that have proven to be successful in other geographies can help solve the challenge in developing countries. Specifically, the economics and financial flows along the value chain need to be known. In this paper, we shed light on these questions by presenting a novel, model-based method to elicit and assess the cost structure of the recycling sector in developing countries. We exemplify our method with plastics waste management in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana-an area particularly challenged by plastic waste. For this purpose, we surveyed over 80 participants of the waste management value chain and combined the data with insights from expert interviews and workshops. Based on this data, we built a bottom-up model with 67 parameters, reflecting all cost positions in the waste management value chain. We found that street waste pickers are the poorest and most vulnerable, earning only a fraction of the already low minimum wage. Middlemen and aggregators, while often being criticized for their earnings, also provide socialsecurity-like services to waste pickers. In addition, formal and informal recyclers differ not only in earnings and size but also in recyclate quality where the informal sector provides higher quality.

Methods I use fixed effects panel regression models that account for first-order autocorrelation with a sample of 109 developing countries from 1980-2014. Results I find that foreign capital dependence is positively associated with carbon dioxide emissions. I also find economic development, total population, urbanization, and export intensity are positively associated with carbon dioxide emissions, while domestic investment is inversely associated with carbon dioxide emissions. Conclusion This analysis provides even stronger empirical support for the ecostructural theory of foreign capital dependence than previous research on the same topic.

SO JOURNAL OF PUBLIC BUDGETING ACCOUNTING & FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose Over the years, public sector reforms in emerging economies have focused on improving national budget systems and financial management practices to promote sustainable development. In the context of the COVID-19 crisis, this article examines whether the strength or effectiveness of national budget systems and related financial management practices moderates the impact of fiscal policy measures on economic recovery and resilience. Design/methodology/approach The article uses bivariate correlations and difference-in-difference analyses to examine the relationship between budget system effectiveness, government stimulus measures and forecasts of economic recovery and resilience. The analysis uses data from the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) program, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. Findings The article finds that estimates of economic recovery and resilience are higher in countries with more reliable budget processes and more transparent public finances. Also, the strength or effectiveness of the budget system before the pandemic appears to moderate the impact of government stimulus measures on economic recovery and resilience over a medium-term forecast horizon. Research limitations/implications This is a prospective analysis based on economic forecasts from the IMF, which are subject to change in the coming years. In addition, the analysis uses subjective budget system indicators, which present measurement challenges that often influence this area of research. Better comparative data in the future, for example, large administrative datasets, will enable researchers to explore these issues with less estimation bias. Practical implications The findings are relevant for policymakers and budget officials in developing countries in Africa who are engaged in plans to improve national budget systems and enhance resilience to crises, such as the COVID-19-induced economic crisis. The findings also have implications for developing countries beyond Africa with similar economic and fiscal conditions. Social implications The findings have implications for economic and budgetary planning for the social sector as well as the efficient delivery of public services in developing countries. Public managers have a critical role to play in adapting national budget systems and financial management reforms within complex and evolving economic circumstances even after the coronavirus pandemic. Originality/value The authors use novel and latest data on country responses to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as medium-term economic forecasts to examine the relationship between national budget systems and post-pandemic economic recovery and resilience in the African context. Previous research has only addressed these issues in the context of industrialized countries, and a limited number of empirical studies examine these relationships. The findings also have significant value for policymakers outside Africa who are facing similar challenges related to the coronavirus pandemic.

TI A value tree for identification of evaluation criteria for solar thermal
   power technologies in developing countries
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS
AB The diversification of electricity generation is necessary for the sustainable development of developing countries and to reduce greenhouse emissions. Solar thermal power technologies are advancing and expected to play a significant role in energy portfolios in the future. Accordingly, it is essential to identify comprehensive combination of criteria for assessing these technologies. Various researchers used different parameter combinations for multiple criteria evaluation in renewable energy portfolio planning. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the structured deliberation and the following analysis to formulate a combination of assessment parameters for solar thermal power technologies based on data providers' judgment. A generic value tree of evaluation parameters is therefore obtained for solar thermal power technologies in developing countries. Expert elicitation was conducted through the Delphi method, with a total of 140 data providers from multidisciplinary solar thermal power fields affiliated in educational institutes, research centers, governmental organizations, and industrial companies from 32 countries participating in the survey. Five impact categories and nineteen performance measures were combined following a comprehensive literature review to derive a preliminary value tree. Based on participants' judgments, as expressed during two rounds of Delphi questionnaires, parameters with importance and consensus degrees > 50% were incorporated into the final value tree. Each parameter had a variation coefficient of < 29%. The output of the process is an aggregated value tree, consisting of 31 performance measures categorized under four main impact categories (technical, economic, environmental, and social). Technical and economic impact categories were rated as most important and achieved the highest degrees of consensus. At performance measures level, economic feasibility obtained the highest level of importance and consensus degrees, followed by reliability, capital cost, storage hours, and water consumption. The recommendations of this work can be utilized as a foundation for stakeholder assessment of regional solar thermal power utilities planning in developing countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Global Burden of Cardiovascular Disease
SO CARDIOVASCULAR INNOVATIONS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one cause of mortality world-wide and places a high medical and socioeconomic burden on developing countries. Our understanding of CVD and its evolution over the last 100 years has altered considerably. Reasons for the increased rate of CVD in the developing world include rapid urbanization and the demographic shift known as the modern epidemiologic transition. The case for intervention is based on both major human and economic impacts of CVD. It has been estimated that cost-effective interventions in developing countries with a high burden of CVD could result in a projected 24 million lives saved. This reduction in CVD mortality could reduce economic costs by $8 billion. Approaches to intervention include: 1) cardiovascular health promotion and CVD prevention and 2) action plans advocated by the World Health Organization.

TI Research on the Environmental Effects of China's Outward Foreign Direct
   Investment (OFDI): Empirical Evidence Based on the Implementation of the
   "Belt and Road" Initiative (BRI)
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Based on the environmental responsibility of the home country against the background of high-quality development and the "double carbon" goal, with the aid of Difference-in-Differences (DIDs), this study discusses the impact of China's outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) on the environment of the host country. The sample data of China's OFDI from 2003 to 2020 is used to analyze its impact on the 162 countries before and after the implementation of the "Belt and Road" Initiative (BRI). The results show that the implementation of the BRI can effectively enhance the positive environmental impact of Chinese OFDI in host countries. Further research shows that with the implementation of the BRI, the environmental effects of Chinese OFDI in developing countries have become more significant. Among developing countries in Asia, the BRI has played a significant and positive role in promoting the environmental outcomes of China's OFDI.

AB Many developing countries face challenges of rapid population growth and urbanization increase. This problem leads to slums formation and informal settlements, where houses are built without basic infrastructure facilities and social amenities. Sustainable housing which incorporates environmental, social, cultural and economic fabric of communities will alleviate poverty and improve quality of life of the people. The aim of this study is to identify critical success factors for sustainable mass housing projects in Nigeria. A questionnaire survey was carried out to elicit the perceptions of construction professionals on essential factors influencing development of sustainable mass housing in Nigeria, The data obtained were analyzed with the help of descriptive statistics and factor analysis. Six factors grouping emerged from factor analysis which incorporate the four dimensions of sustainability, namely, environmental dimension, economic dimension, social dimension and cultural dimension. The presence of these factors in the implementation of sustainable mass housing projects is essential.

TI Private Sector and Waste Management in Delhi: A Political Economy
   Perspective
SO IDS BULLETIN-INSTITUTE OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB Due to their size and rapid growth, large cities in developing countries are increasingly challenged by burgeoning waste generation. Waste management, however, has traditionally provided employment opportunities to the many urban poor in the informal sector. These traditional models, working largely in parallel with state-led interventions, are under pressure because they fail to address the waste management crisis. This failure, coupled with the lack of capacities of local governments, has paved the way for formal private sector participation. We examine the case of Delhi where a complex interplay of competing approaches have accompanied efforts of urban local bodies, civil society and the private sector (informal and formal) at finding a sustainable working solution. Our analysis of the complex relationship within the private sector players, and between private and public actors, provides novel insights into potential contribution of public-private partnerships for effective waste management in developing countries.

TI Economic Perspectives On The Advance Market Commitment For Pneumococcal
   Vaccines
SO HEALTH AFFAIRS
AB Pharmaceutical companies have long been reluctant to invest in producing new vaccines for the developing world because they have little prospect of earning an attractive return. One way to stimulate such investment is the use of an advance market commitment, an innovative financing program that guarantees manufacturers a long-term market. Under this arrangement, international donors pay a premium for initial doses sold to developing countries. In exchange, companies agree to continue supplying the vaccine over the longer term at more sustainable prices. This article provides a preliminary economic analysis of a pilot advance market commitment program for pneumococcal vaccines, explaining the principles behind the program's design and assessing its early performance. Spurred by the advance market commitment-and other contemporaneous initiatives that also increased resources to vaccine suppliers-new, second-generation pneumococcal vaccines have experienced a much more rapid rollout in developing countries than older first-generation vaccines.

TI Assessing smallholders' heterogeneity towards sustainable agrifood value
   chain in developing countries
SO BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL
AB PurposeAgrifood value chains in developing countries are transforming into higher value markets which require sustainable practices, with smallholders playing a critical role. However, smallholders are a heterogeneous group which may have discrepancies in outcomes to meet sustainability standards. This paper aims to empirically investigate smallholders' heterogeneity towards sustainable value chain practice in developing countries.Design/methodology/approachEight key enabling factors of sustainable value chain transformation were used to explore smallholders' typology, then profiled, based on their socio-economic status and current practices. A quantitative method was applied in Indonesia's cashew sector with 159 respondents from the primary producer area on Madura Island. A combination of descriptive analysis, cluster analysis, cross-tab analysis and one-way ANOVA analysis was used in this study.FindingsFour types of groups were identified, each with distinct characteristics and arranged in priority order as follows: accelerator, progressor, inattentive and conservative groups. Interventions can be implemented on per clusters basis or based on potential similarities among clusters, depending on priority. It is noted that the pursuit of sustainable value chain practices by smallholders is not necessarily associated with high socio-economic status, as those with low socio-economic status may have a stronger inclination towards them.Practical implicationsThe paper enhances awareness of practitioners and policymakers regarding smallholders' heterogeneity in sustainable value chain practice. It enables more effective and focused interventions to support smallholders who require assistance in sustainable production and value-adding activities. Different smallholders' characteristics call for different assistance/intervention. Practitioners can recognise smallholders' characteristics that are more compatible with higher value markets and sustainability requirements to better integrate their practices. Policymakers must carefully develop short-term and long-term interventions based on the activities prioritised by particular traits to "hit the right button" for smallholders' practice development.Originality/valueThis study investigates the typology of smallholders towards sustainable value chain practices by using eight enabling factors and profiling them based on their socio-economic condition and current practices. Additionally, this study shifts the focus of typology exploration away from the traditional lens of farm sustainability to a larger perspective which encompasses sustainable value chain activities.

The review indicates a rapid expansion of research in recent years, and a growing number of primary research studies that have developed rigorous methodologies for data collection and analysis, with welcome contribution from developing country institutions and researchers. Gaps in the literature suggest areas where future research priorities may lie. These include the provision of agricultural data sources that can provide the basis for effective planning and policymaking, and the assessment of information and service needs that take into account gender differences and the potential for user involvement in the design of service provision. Research is also needed to assess the potential for financial market integration, sustainable business models, consideration of indicators of sector performance and productivity, and assessment of broader impacts at the community and societal level.

TI Access to modern energy services: An economic and policy framework
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Affordable and accessible modern energy services are a pre-requisite for development-economic, environmental or social-and are crucial to reduce poverty and sustain growth. Hence, there is a need to promote the uptake of modern energy. The present study investigates the issue of accessibility of modern energy services in relation to three indicators-availability, affordability and reliability-and suggest practical ways of evaluating them, and identifies various strategies to provide them to the needy households in a cost-effective manner. Promoting the development of small rural enterprises is a key contributor to achieve this goal and a central aspect in this promotion is the large-scale diffusion of Sustainable Energy Technologies, which provide affordable and reliable services. The suggested framework helps the policymakers to identify technologies that are better than others under the present conditions. Implementing and scaling up the energy demand requires collaboration among various actors like households, local bodies, energy utilities, governments, entrepreneurs, research organisations, non-governmental organisations, community groups, financial institutions, and international agencies.

TI Neurocritical Care in Developing Countries
SO NEUROCRITICAL CARE
AB Neurocritical illness heavily burdens the developing world. In spite of a lack of resources for population-based health in most developing countries, there is an increasing demand for resource-intense strategies for acute neurological care. Factors including rising individual incomes in emerging economies, need for neurointensive care in humanitarian emergencies, growth of private hospitals, the rising burden of noncommunicable disease, and the practice of neurocritical care by specialists outside of neurology are discussed. Possible steps to improve the global practice of neurocritical care include: (1) emphasis on prevention of neurocritical illness through traffic safety and adequate outpatient treatment; (2) standardization of training requirements and skill sets; (3) guidelines on cost-effective measures including medications, equipment, and devices; (4) strengthening of surveillance systems and registries for both noncommunicable and communicable neurological diseases; (5) expanded use of teleneurology; (6) educational exchanges of neurointensive health care workers; and (7) monitoring of neurological intensive care unit death rates due to nosocomial infections, neurological disease, and other causes. A summary of reported mortality rates among neurocritically ill patients in African countries in recent years is provided as an illustrative example.

AB A decade ago the 'Dublin Principles' shifted global thinking towards treating water as an economic good. The concern was that overly supply-driven approaches had been financially unsustainable, and therefore failed to reduce the service gap. Accompanying this conceptual shift has been a wider move towards focusing on the customer's needs and preferences and their willingness to pay, and applying marketing techniques to meet those needs in a financially sustainable manner. Although regarded as a positive move, its success is heavily dependent on how well water utilities understand their customers. This paper examines existing literature on the determinants of customer willingness to use and pay for improved water services in developing countries. The contribution of past research to our understanding of the behaviour of customers, with regard to service level choice and payment for services, is critically analysed. Basing on this analysis, we develop and discuss a generic model of a water consumer's decision-making process. The model serves two purposes. First, it consolidates past research into a coherent framework to facilitate implementation of the marketing approach. Secondly, we use the model to identify critical customer information that water utility managers need to know in order to be customer-focused.

AB Power industry is undergoing restructuring throughout the world. The traditional vertically monopolistic structure has been deregulated and replaced by gencos, transcos and discos with competition introduced to gencos and discos in order to reach higher efficiency in electricity production and utilization. A lot of power markets have been established for the purpose. However for different countries, the principal objectives and considerations of power system deregulation are different. In this paper special considerations on power system deregulation of developing countries in Asia are discussed. Two regional power markets in China are used as examples. It is shown that I or developing countries, the main objectives of power system deregulation are to attract various investments to. power industry in order to meet the fast growth of electric demand caused by blooming economy and in the meantime to reduce government commitment and functions in power industry. Only this way, the power industry, as a significant infrastructure, can realize sustainable development at high efficiency. It is also shown that in the market environment, how to realize optimal system planning and reliable operation at acceptable electricity prices with qualifies service and how to transit to the market environment smoothly at lowest costs and lowest risks should be considered thoroughly.

TI Obesity and cardiovascular disease in developing countries: a growing
   problem and an economic threat
SO CURRENT OPINION IN CLINICAL NUTRITION AND METABOLIC CARE
AB Purpose of review This review examines the rise of risk factors for cardiovascular disease, especially obesity, in developing countries and the implications for both health and economics.
   Recent findings In the majority of developing countries fertility and infant and child mortality have fallen markedly, and life expectancies have increased. Rapid urbanization, falling food prices, and globalization of economies have contributed to an increase in risk factors for chronic disease. Recent work indicates that the prevalence of these risk factors, including obesity, is rising faster than the historical experience of the West. The transition is affecting women in particular, and increases in risk factors are more marked among lower incomes in growing economies than among the wealthy. Rather than the stereotypical problem of the rich, chronic disease is now a problem for the poor.
   Summary Significant research in this area of global health has only been undertaken in the last decade. Additional field research is needed in every dimension of the transition, both to document the problem itself and to determine its economic and societal impact and cost effective responses. Two critical factors are virtually absent from existing work and should be emphasized. First, the impact of rising risk factors for, and mortality from, cardiovascular disease in the work force may imply a growing threat to continued economic progress. Second, because risk factor reduction requires society-wide strategies, broad public-private coalitions will be needed to mobilize sectors beyond healthcare.

TI Economic resilience in developing countries: The role of democracy in
   the face of external shocks
SO ENTREPRENEURIAL BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS REVIEW
AB Objective: The objective of this article is to examine the role of democracy in strengthening the resilience of developing economies in the face of exogenous negative external shocks.
   Research Design & Methods: To achieve our research objectives, we used the duration model to estimate how democracy can determine the probable duration of an economic growth spell.
   Findings: By examining a panel of 96 developing countries observed in 1965-2015, we found that democracy is a resilience factor, insofar as it helps to support growth spells in the event of negative external shocks. The results show that an improvement in democracy score is associated with an increase in the expected duration of a growth spell. The second finding is that some dimensions of democratic institutions like political participation and egalitarian inclusion can lead to a sustainable economic growth.
   Implications & Recommendations: The benefits of democracy for improving living standards in developing coutries. The study should be subject to further research as more variables that account for major shocks could be considered, such as political and civil unrest, internal conflicts, or natural disasters. These shocks may occur during a growth period and cause very serious disruptive effects.
   Contribution & Value Added: The originality of this work lies in studying the role of democracy in the face of exogenous negative external shocks through the duration model which represents an original empirical study.

TI Socio-ecological aspects of sustaining Ramsar wetlands in three
   biodiverse developing countries
SO MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
AB Integrating conservation and ecologically sustainable development of wetlands is a major challenge, especially in developing countries. While many developing countries harbour significant biodiversity and socio-cultural resources, they have substantial development pressures. We explore the similarities in issues around wetland conservation and sustainability in three developing countries using case studies of internationally significant wetlands in Tanzania, Colombia and Papua New Guinea. We examine key aspects of their socio-ecological values, stakeholder and governance issues, conservation and management issues, and management responses. Key challenges across these regions include inadequate knowledge and data, population and development impacts, poor regulatory and planning processes, socio-economic inequities and conflict. All three areas lack adequate inventory, survey and monitoring, and there are significant risks to some wetland values. Mechanisms such as the Ramsar Convention provide a framework to assist in addressing global wetland loss, but implementation at these sites needs to be supported by effective, integrative approaches involving natural resource regulation, conservation and the development needs of local communities. Increased commitment and resourcing, along with comprehensive stakeholder engagement, are needed to develop and implement locally tailored plans to effectively manage these sites and their values, while also addressing the range of stakeholder needs and perspectives.

TI Assessing rural energy sustainability in developing countries
SO ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Providing sustainable energy access is one of the most critical global challenges. This paper introduces a method for evaluating the status and progress of rural household energy sustainability in developing countries using a new composite indicator, the energy sustainability index (ESI). The ESI combines 13 techno-economic, environmental and social indicators of sustainability using principal component analysis (PCA). We apply the ES! to China, India, South Africa, Sri-Lanka, Bangladesh and Ghana between 1990 and 2010. The analysis suggests that South Africa's rural energy sustainability index is highest followed by China, Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh and Ghana respectively. All the countries' rural energy sustainability has improved relatively over time except Ghana's. Improvements result mainly from increasing rural electricity use and increasing access to clean and efficient cooking fuels. (C) 2014 International Energy Initiative. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Low-carbon transition: Private sector investment in renewable energy
   projects in developing countries
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB Given the rapid population growth and subsequent increase in energy demand in developing countries, private sector investment in renewable energy projects is key for sustainable economic development. However, the current energy mix is still dependent on conventional fossil fuels. The paper examines the time duration to private sector investment in renewable energy projects and how the hazard rate is affected by dependence on fossil fuels. Using data on private sector participation in renewable energy projects in 134 developing and middle-income countries for the (1990-2012) period, this paper applies multiple failure time model. The results show significant negative effects of fossil fuel consumption and fuel rent on investment likelihood. Consistent with literature, a set of socio-economic variables, such as renewable energy policy and energy security concerns, play an important role in increasing the likelihood of private sector investment in renewable energy technologies. The findings of the paper resonate with concerns of the international community regarding the effect of fossil fuel dependence on the rate of adoption of renewable energy sources in developing countries.

TI Corporate social responsibility, economic globalization and developing
   countries A case study of the ready made garments industry in Bangladesh
SO SUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING MANAGEMENT AND POLICY JOURNAL
AB Purpose - This paper aims to examine the state of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in labour-intensive industries in developing countries in the context of economic globalization. Using the ready-made garments' (RMG) industry in Bangladesh as a case study, challenges and key issues relating to CSR are highlighted.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws from the review of existing literature, and the content analysis of two leading newspapers in Bangladesh for a period of one year (July 2012-June 2013) to identify the key and contemporary issues related to CSR in the RMG industry.
   Findings - Findings identify the contemporary issues of concerns associated with CSR in the RMG industry, relating them to the debate on the applicability of Carroll's CSR pyramid to developing countries. The findings suggest that non-compliance of CSR in labour-intensive industries is a function of the nature of economic globalization. The need for a stakeholder approach towards CSR for the profitability and sustainability of this industry is also highlighted.
   Practical implications - This paper makes contributions to two different but important interrelated discourses on CSR and economic globalization. It also provides insights into the complexity involved in CSR in labour-based export industries in developing countries and acts as a springboard for further research.
   Originality/value - The paper is the first to look at all major issues of concern regarding CSR in the RMG industry in Bangladesh. As Bangladesh is an exemplar of developing countries and RMG is a typical starter industry, the findings are generalizable to similar industries in other developing countries.

TI Multi-Country Analysis of Palm Oil Consumption and Cardiovascular
   Disease Mortality for Countries at Different Stages of Economic
   Development: 1980-1997
SO GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH
AB Background: Cardiovascular diseases represent an increasing share of the global disease burden. There is concern that increased consumption of palm oil could exacerbate mortality from ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke, particularly in developing countries where it represents a major nutritional source of saturated fat.
   Methods: The study analyzed country-level data from 1980-1997 derived from the World Health Organization's Mortality Database, U. S. Department of Agriculture international estimates, and the World Bank (234 annual observations; 23 countries). Outcomes included mortality from IHD and stroke for adults aged 50 and older. Predictors included per-capita consumption of palm oil and cigarettes and per-capita Gross Domestic Product as well as time trends and an interaction between palm oil consumption and country economic development level. Analyses examined changes in country-level outcomes over time employing linear panel regressions with country-level fixed effects, population weighting, and robust standard errors clustered by country. Sensitivity analyses included further adjustment for other major dietary sources of saturated fat.
   Results: In developing countries, for every additional kilogram of palm oil consumed per-capita annually, IHD mortality rates increased by 68 deaths per 100,000 (95% CI [21-115]), whereas, in similar settings, stroke mortality rates increased by 19 deaths per 100,000 (95% CI [-12-49]) but were not significant. For historically high-income countries, changes in IHD and stroke mortality rates from palm oil consumption were smaller (IHD: 17 deaths per 100,000 (95% CI [5.3-29]); stroke: 5.1 deaths per 100,000 (95% CI [-1.2-11.0])). Inclusion of other major saturated fat sources including beef, pork, chicken, coconut oil, milk cheese, and butter did not substantially change the differentially higher relationship between palm oil and IHD mortality in developing countries.
   Conclusions: Increased palm oil consumption is related to higher IHD mortality rates in developing countries. Palm oil consumption represents a saturated fat source relevant for policies aimed at reducing cardiovascular disease burdens.

   framework
SO COGENT ENGINEERING
AB In this study, a review of Ghana's energy sector national energy statistics and policy framework is done to create awareness of the strategic planning and energy policies of Ghana's energy sector that will serve as an informative tool for both local and foreign investors, help in national decision-making for the efficient development and utilization of energy resources. The review of Ghana's energy sector policy is to answer the question, what has been done so far? And what is the way forward? The future research in Ghana cannot progress without consulting the past. In order to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all, Ghana has begun expanding her economy with the growing Ghanaian population as a way to meet the SDG (1), which seeks to end poverty and improve wellbeing. There are a number of intervention strategies by Ghana's Energy sector which provides new, high-quality, and cost-competitive energy services to poor people and communities, thus alleviating poverty. Ghana's Energy sector has initiated the National Electrification Scheme, a Self-Help Electrification Program, a National Offgrid Rural Electrification Program, and a Renewable Energy Development Program (REDP). The REDP aims to: assess the availability of renewable energy resources, examine the technical feasibility and cost-effectiveness of promising renewable energy technologies, ensure the efficient production and use of the Ghana's renewable energy resources, and develop an information base that facilitates the establishment of a planning framework for the rational development and the use of the Ghana's renewable energy resources.

AB Economists prefer economic instruments to command and control mechanisms of environmental protection and sustainable development. Energy taxes and subsidies have emerged as a standard prescription for internalising externalities. Yet existing energy tax polices, both in developed and developing countries, show considerable contradictions in terms of environmental considerations. It needs to be asked why is it so? Moreover, the suitability of fiscal measures for internalising negative externalities in developing countries needs to be questioned.
   The objective of the paper is to reveal the inherent contradictions and ambiguities arising from the application of an instrument (tax or subsidy) for satisfying multiple objectives. It is argued that economic theory does not provide any ready-made solution to the problem and often socio-political considerations determine the outcome. Similarly, specificities of developing countries, such as existence of the informal sector and use of traditional energies, violate certain basic assumptions of the underlying theory and require special attention in the application of pricing mechanism for internalising externalities.

AB A profuse body of literature has explored the impact of information and communication technologies (ICTs) on the level of economic growth and the characterization of ICT as a crucial element of advanced economic systems. However many developing countries, in particular the small island developing states (SIDs), face several challenges to entering the global economic market including the high costs of the basic infrastructure (including telecommunications); limited human and technological resources; dependence on a limited export market; low productivity; acute vulnerability to natural and environmental hazards; considerable dependence on foreign investment and aid; and their location on the periphery of the international system. These major factors have virtually limited the level of innovative capacity within these countries. This paper examines how a subsystem of developing countries can be more effective in building the level of regional innovative capacity through the strategic exploitation of advanced wireless technologies.

AB Frugal innovation can be considered as a cost-effective, simplified solution for developing countries' specific problems. This concept can potentially assist with alleviating poverty and waste and has been linked to sustainability in various publications. This literature review aimed to investigate the drivers of frugal innovation and its link with sustainability. The study shows similarities between frugal innovation and sustainability; however, the two are not the same. This review considered case studies and literature reviews to determine links between sustainability (economic, environmental, and social) and frugal innovation. The results show that frugal innovation is not always sustainable at its core, and in many cases, sustainability is an afterthought in its design. Different diffusion paths and the adoption of frugal innovation in developed countries were evaluated. The review illustrates how firms in developed countries can capitalise on frugal innovation. The review also considers definitions of frugal innovation, factors that affect the success of frugal innovation and the requirements for sustainable, frugal innovation. Most published research is related to India, and thus future research may focus more on other developing countries.

TI Roots of unsustainable tourism development at the local level: the case
   of Urgup in Turkey
SO TOURISM MANAGEMENT
AB The main aim of this article is to investigate and explain the roots of unsustainable tourism development at the local level in a developing country, with special reference to Urgup in the region of Cappadocia, Turkey. It was found that the factors that ushered in unsustainable tourism development are beyond the control of local people and authorities. They are largely related to issues at the national level such as the policy of political economy, prevailing national planning approaches applied to tourism, patron-client relationships between decision-makers and related business class alongside the role of international tour operators in the international tourism system. It concludes that achieving sustainable tourism development at the local level in a developing country requires hard political choices, a confident decision-making process and the collaboration of international tour operators and donor agencies.

AB This paper extends prior studies on sustainable entrepreneurship by proving how the impact of entrepreneurial activity on achieving sustainable development depends on the behaviors and motivations of entrepreneurs. More precisely, we examine the influence of opportunity and necessity driven entrepreneurs on the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, which are constructed based on the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs). Using data for twenty developing countries, we find from the long-run estimates that opportunity entrepreneurship has a positive impact on the three dimensions of sustainable development, whereas necessity entrepreneurship has a negative effect on the environmental sustainability dimension. We also find from the short and long-run causality analyses that opportunity-driven entrepreneurs granger cause the three dimensions in the short and long-run, whereas necessity-driven entrepreneurs do not have any effect on these dimensions. Finally, the authors make some suggestions for further research in this area.

TI RENEWABLE ENERGY IN RURAL-AREAS OF DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES - SOME
   RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A SUSTAINABLE STRATEGY
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB As analysis of the energy situation in rural areas in developing countries has shown that the major cause of the prevailing energy crisis is the shortage of organic fuel (biomass).  To cope with this crisis, therefore, technologies must be sought either to enhance biomass resources or to substitute for them.  As the majority of the population in rural areas are poor, the technologies applied should not only meet energy needs; they must also be geared to particular economic and sociocultural conditions.  Technically efficient, decentralized systems for the utilization of renewable energy can help in this by raising the availability of organic fuel resources (biomass) and meeting the demand for higher quality energy. Despite their advantages, however, there has as yet been no widespread dissemination of these technologies.  The main reasons for this are discussed, and some precepts are presented upon which, it is argued, a strategy for overcoming these obstacles should be based.

TI Factors Related to Retention of Postgraduate Trainees in
   Obstetrics-Gynecology at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in Ghana
SO ACADEMIC MEDICINE
AB Purpose The retention of health care workers in developing countries is a key component to reducing the current health care workforce crisis. The availability of postgraduate medical training in developing countries could be an appropriate adjunctive solution. The authors investigated factors that led obstetrics-gynecology (ob/gyn) residents at a university-based academic training program at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital (Accra, Ghana) to stay in Ghana for training and explored why the residents expect to stay in (or leave) Ghana after training.
   Method In July 2006, the authors surveyed 20 residents and conducted semistructured interviews with a subset of 9 residents.
   Results Nineteen respondents (95%) reported they would have left Ghana if postgraduate training had not been available, 16 (80%) reported that becoming an ob/gyn specialist was important to them, 15 (75%) indicated that the program trained them to practice in Ghana, and 17 (85%) were certain they would stay in Ghana after completing the program. Both quantitative and qualitative data supported the idea that three factors contribute to the retention of ob/gyn physicians in Ghana: (1) the presence of a postgraduate training program in Ghana, (2) residents' commitment to serve the people of Ghana, and (3) residents' feelings that physicians can "make it" economically in Ghana.
   Conclusions Postgraduate training is an important contributor to the retention of physicians in country. Partnerships between academic health centers in developed and developing countries provide opportunities to address the global health care crisis in a significant and sustainable way.

TI Impact pathways of small-scale energy projects in the global south -
   Findings from a systematic evaluation
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Access to clean and affordable modern energy services has been widely recognised as a significant factor for enabling social and economic development. Stand-alone systems and mini-grids are presumed to play an important role in the provision of sustainable energy to those people who currently lack access. Accordingly, an increasing number of small-scale energy projects are being implemented in developing countries and emerging economies. However, despite the large number of energy development projects, only limited evidence exists about the actual contribution they make to sustainable development. This paper addresses this research gap by providing a systematic assessment of three selected impact pathways based on the evaluation of over 30 small-scale sustainable energy projects. Applying a theory-based evaluation approach in the form of a contribution analysis, the aim of this research is to better understand if and how these types of technical interventions can create development outcomes and impacts. The results show that technological issues are often not the most decisive factor in achieving development effects, but that embedding the technology in a set of actions that address social, cultural, economic and environmental aspects is essential.

TI Analyzing the mechanism among rural financing constraint mitigation,
   agricultural development, and carbon emissions in China: A sustainable
   development paradigm
SO ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT
AB Agricultural development in developing countries generally faces increasingly severe financing constraints, and China's practice provides a model for other countries. This article investigates the impact of the policy to alleviate rural financing constraints on agricultural carbon emissions in developing countries by using a quasi-natural experiment, the "Incremental Incentives for Agricultural Loans from County Financial Institutions," implemented in China, with data from 2005 to 2018, and with a DID approach. It is found that under the influence of this policy, the alleviation of agricultural financing constraints will significantly generate an increase in the intensity of agricultural carbon emissions, which is triggered by the fact that the alleviation of financing constraints increases the production factors invested per unit area in the agricultural production process, while the increase in the mechanization and scale of agriculture will assist to reduce the contribution of the alleviation of financing constraints to carbon emissions. The impact of financing constraint alleviation on agricultural carbon emissions may differ among places with different economic and social development and agricultural bases. Additionally, the alleviation of rural financing constraints can promote agricultural development and increase farmers' income, enabling other developing countries to adjust their policy orientation when adopting such policies, thus promoting agricultural development while controlling agricultural carbon emissions and contributing to the global emission reduction cause.

TI Long-term electricity supply modelling in the context of developing
   countries: The OSeMOSYS-LEAP soft-linking approach for Ethiopia
SO ENERGY STRATEGY REVIEWS
AB Long-term power supply modelling is particularly important for developing countries in providing sustainable solutions to electricity problems. This study presents the first detailed and complete model of the Ethiopian electricity system while considering the unique features (dominance of traditional energy, informal economy, urban-rural divide, low electrification, supply shortage, etc.) and context of developing countries that is devel-oped by soft-linking the OSeMOSYS (Open-Source energy Modelling System) and LEAP (Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System) modelling frameworks. Better system representation and design of plausible scenarios that explore the potential pathways of the future power supply and demand evolution until 2050 is done by performing sensitivity analysis. Sector wise and technological representation of supply and end-uses at a disaggregated level, assessment of centralized grid-based means and decentralized off-grid methods for improving electricity access are the main methodological contributions. Five policy scenarios are employed to explore different possible futures and balance the long-term electricity needs and resources. The improved ef-ficiency scenario reduces the installed capacity by 9 GW which translates into approximately 11% total dis-counted cost saving (USD $ 4 billion). This economic benefit has made the efficiency scenario the most desirable compared to the other scenarios. Attributed to lower investment costs and abundant resource availability, the results show that renewable technologies are more competitive and favourable.

It is well established that pharmaceutical product patents provide little incentive for pharmaceutical companies to develop new medicines designed to treat diseases prevalent in developing countries or to market in developing countries those patented medicines developed to treat diseases prevalent in developed countries. Economists have developed theoretical models showing that these incentives could be changed if (1) developing countries provided intellectual property protection for new pharmaceutical innovations and (2) an international regulatory framework were established to facilitate pharmaceutical companies setting lower prices in developing countries and higher prices in developed countries for patented medicines. We develop an index of property rights in pharmaceutical innovations covering 129 countries from 1960 to 2005. It shows that in 1960 only a handful of countries provided significant protection for pharmaceutical innovations, but by 2005 over 95 percent of countries in our sample provided significant statutory protections. However, an international framework to allow pharmaceutical companies to price discriminate has not been put in place. We conclude that international price discrimination mechanisms, compulsory patent licenses, and regional patent buyouts are not viable mechanisms for providing access to essential medicines to patients in developing countries. Global patent buyouts are more likely to achieve this goal, as they are not founded on an impractical separation of pharmaceutical markets in developing and developed countries and they provide critical incentives to develop new essential medicines.

TI Financial Market Governance in Developing Countries Getting Political
   Underpinnings Right
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPING SOCIETIES
AB This article presents a critique of the prevailing IMF/World Bank paradigm for financial market governance in developing countries that converges on the restrained role for the state, the neoliberal emphasis on self-governance, and the pursuit of market efficiency. It argues that the largely positive terms in which the governance discourse is couched have obfuscated the political dimensions that underlie the limitations of current efforts to improve the functioning of national financial systems in developing countries. It seeks to explore the political underpinnings of market governance that manifest themselves in the primary role of the state in market destruction and creation, the politically sustainable balance of power between private interests and public authorities, and the distributive justice of institutional reforms. Drawing upon recent national experiences with financial reforms and crises in developing countries, the article highlights these three dimensions as the essential normative constructs of effective financial policy management and market governance in developing countries.

TI Evolution Characters and Influencing Factors of Regional Eco-Efficiency
   in a Developing Country: Evidence from Mongolia
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB The sandstorm in 2021 in East Asia demonstrated the ecological issues that culminated for decades in Mongolia. Mongolia is facing challenges to realize green and sustainable development. This article aims to increase the understanding of eco-efficiency and its influencing factors in Mongolia and to provide a reference for similar developing countries and regions to achieve green and sustainable development. This article used the Slacks-Based Measure of Efficiency (SBM) model with advantages of dimension freedom and unit variable to estimate the economic efficiency and eco-efficiency of 22 provinces in Mongolia from 2007 to 2016; energy consumption and undesirable environmental outputs were taken as ecological/environmental indicators in the input and output system of regional eco-efficiency in Mongolia, combining traditional indicators of economic efficiency to build Mongolia's eco-efficiency input-output framework. This article applied hot spot analysis and gravity center analysis to reveal the temporal and spatial evolution characters of eco-efficiency in Mongolia. Finally, the article applied panel Tobit regression to analyze the influencing factors of eco-efficiency. We were found that Mongolia's eco-efficiency slightly improved from 0.7379 in 2007 to 0.7673 in 2016, lower than the economic efficiency. The high eco-efficiency provinces appeared in the capital Ulaanbaatar and its surrounding areas, showing an obvious spatial spillover effect. The low eco-efficiency provinces were mainly in the undeveloped western region. The relationship between per capita GDP and eco-efficiency was U-shaped and consistent with environmental Kuznets theory. Accelerating economic growth, optimizing population distribution, and improving energy structure and green technology can improve Mongolia's eco-efficiency.

TI Iodine adsorption isotherms on Matamba fruit shell stemmed biochar for
   wastewater re-use strategy in rural areas owing to climate change
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Remote communities in developing countries are facing ever-increasing water scarcities, due to cumulative demand induced by the climate change and global warming impacts. For the socio-economic and health well-being of the local communities, sufficient, efficient, and affordable water supply is fundamental from local-based adsorbents. Matamba Fruit shell was obtained and pyrolyzed to obtain well-transformed biochar, which exhibited enough capacity to remove Iodine from aqueous solution. The maximum capacity of adsorption of the Matamba Fruit shell was 2.122 mmol L-1 and 2.12 mmol L-1 from conventional and Bayesian statistics correspondingly. The difference was insignificant. The surface morphology was evaluated by the Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (FESEM-EDX) which revealed porous structures with irregular openings enough to purge wastewater pollutants. The material surface area was 267.0 m(2) g(-1), as estimated by both approaches, making the Matamba Fruit shell an emerging potential candidate for environmental pollution control and use in bioremediation practices. The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed that surface functional groups of Matamba Fruit shell biochar have enough peak variations in intensity and position due to vibration variations of the surface. The Fruit shell has different functional groups including the hydroxyl (-OH) and the carbonyl groups (C=O), C=C stretches of aromatic rings, and the carboxylate (C-O-O-) groups. The biochar understudy unveiled its capability for wastewater-treatment reuse in local and urban communities of developing countries to safeguard their health and access to water-supply as the climate change reverberations are affecting the developing countries more pronounced than before.

TI Multilateral environmental agreements and the growth of total factor
   productivity in developing countries: evidence from the foreign direct
   investment channel
SO ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB Reducing the level of climate change and its effects on social, economic and environmental spheres is a key condition to achieve sustainable development goals in developing countries. This paper aims to analyse the effect of stringent environmental policy on the sustainable creation of wealth in developing countries. It focuses on the effect of multilateral environmental agreements on total factor productivity growth. An empirical analysis is conducted on panel data using a sample of 74 countries between 1995 and 2017. A quadratic regression is performed on a fixed-effects panel model, as well as on a Durbin spatial panel model using ordinary least squares, two-stage least squares and maximum likelihood. The results obtained show that MEA has a positive nonlinear short-term effect and a negative long-term effect on the growth of TFP in DCs. However, the long-term marginal effect increases with the foreign directs investments net inflows. Moreover, the results indicate that the spatial interdependencies between DCs are such that the participation of one DC in MEA favours the growth of TFP of its neighbouring countries. The paper also finds that the effect of MEA on the growth of TFP decreases with the country level of development, while this effect is greater in African and Latin America countries than in Asian and European developing countries. It is therefore recommended that developing countries join MEAs while improving their attractiveness to FDI through the improvement of the institutional framework and the promotion of good governance.

During the integration process, besides the hardware integration (in physical form, such as transportation system, medical service, housing and economical development etc), the software integration (cultural, education, knowledge and spiritual visage etc) is also an important issue. For the developing countries, the software integration is even an essential issue. To successfully realise the integration of rural and urban of sustainable development, we believe that the software integration should be simultaneously developed with hardware integration for developing countries, especially for China.

TI A framework for sustainable and integrated municipal solid waste
   management: Barriers and critical factors to developing countries
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Developing countries adopt policies to reduce the negative impacts of large amount of waste generated by accelerated industrialization and rapid urbanization, but these actions are far from establishing procedures that meet society's needs, especially regarding the management of municipal solid waste (MSW), which requires the cooperation of numerous stakeholders, and a broad plan of action, in terms of sustainability cities' targets and policies. In this sense, sustainable and integrated solid waste management (S-ISWM) emerges as a solution to address the growing challenges of disposing of MSW in developing countries municipalities. However, to guide SISWM implementation there still a need of a framework with a multi-stakeholder and holistic perspective of the MSW management, considering the barriers and critical success factors (CSFs) to achieve it. To this end, a systematic literature review using the PRISMA diagram on the Scopus and Web of Science databases, and then, a content analysis of 75 articles, which met the eligibility criteria, were carried out. As a result, were identified eight barriers, 11 CSFs, which were grouped according to five pillars - public policies, disposal techniques, legal aspects, public-private partnership (PPP) and energy recovery - that affect the municipal S-ISWM and were pointed out ways of implementing these factors in practice. Finally, it was proposed a management artifact - a framework towards S-ISWM - based on state-of-the-art CSFs and barriers, mainly oriented to waste to energy, to the developing countries municipalities. This study offers theoretical, practical, and political implications, serving as a stimulus for the development of public policies with a multidisciplinary approach, providing environmental, economic, and societal contributions, and, thus, encouraging the achievement of the eleventh and the twelfth sustainable development goals.

TI The Best-of-2-Worlds philosophy: Developing local dismantling and global
   infrastructure network for sustainable e-waste treatment in emerging
   economies
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB E-waste is a complex waste category containing both hazardous and valuable substances. It demands for a cost-efficient treatment system which simultaneously liberates and refines target fractions in an environmentally sound way. In most developing countries there is a lack of systems covering all steps from disposal until final processing due to limited infrastructure and access to technologies and investment. This paper introduces the 'Best-of-2-Worlds' philosophy (Bo2W), which provides a network and pragmatic solution for e-waste treatment in emerging economies. It seeks technical and logistic integration of 'best' pre-processing in developing countries to manually dismantle e-waste and 'best' end-processing to treat hazardous and complex fractions in international state-of-the-art end-processing facilities. A series of dismantling trials was conducted on waste desktop computers, IT equipment, large and small household appliances, in order to compare the environmental and economic performances of the Bo2W philosophy with other conventional recycling scenarios. The assessment showed that the performance of the Bo2W scenario is more eco-efficient than mechanical separation scenarios and other local treatment solutions. For equipment containing substantial hazardous substances, it demands the assistance from domestic legislation for mandatory removal and safe handling of such fractions together with proper financing to cover the costs. Experience from Bo2W pilot projects in China and India highlighted key societal factors influencing successful implementation. These include market size, informal competitors, availability of national e-waste legislation, formal take-back systems, financing and trust between industrial players. The Bo2W philosophy can serve as a pragmatic and environmentally responsible transition before establishment of end-processing facilities in developing countries is made feasible. The executive models of Bo2W should be flexibly differentiated for various countries by adjusting to local conditions related to operational scale, level of centralized operations, dismantling depth, combination with mechanical processing and optimized logistics to international end-processors.

TI Is globalization good for your health?
SO BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
AB Four points are made about globalization and health. First, economic integration is a powerful force for raising the incomes of poor countries. In the past 20 years several large developing countries have opened up to trade and investment, and they are growing well - faster than the rich countries. Second, there is no tendency for income inequality to increase in countries that open up, The higher growth that accompanies globalization in developing countries generally benefits poor people, Since there is a large literature linking income of the poor to health status, we can be reasonably confident that globalization has indirect positive effects on nutrition, infant mortality and other health issues related to Income. Third, economic integration can obviously have adverse health effects as well: the transmission of AIDS through migration and travel is a dramatic recent example. However, both relatively closed and relatively open developing countries have severe AIDS problems. The practical solution lies in health policies, not in policies on economic integration. Likewise, free trade in tobacco will lead to increased smoking unless health-motivated disincentives are put in place, Global integration requires supporting institutions and policies. Fourth, the international architecture can be improved so that It Is more beneficial to poor countries. For example, with regard to intellectual property rights, it may be practical for pharmaceutical innovators to choose to have intellectual property rights in either rich country markets or poor country ones, but not both. In this way incentives could be strong for research on diseases in both rich and poor countries.

TI Does agriculture-induced environmental Kuznets curve exist in developing

SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Even though the economic growth and the increased agricultural production bring welfare increment, they could also load significant environmental costs to society. This study aims to investigate the existence of agriculture-induced EKC hypothesis in 47 developing countries during 1976-2017 by using dynamic panel data estimators. According to the long-run findings of the DOLS and the FMOLS estimators, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship that exists between income and the CO2 emissions, while agricultural production has a negative impact on environmental quality. In addition, the PMG estimator is also employed for robustness check. Likewise the DOLS and the FMOLS findings, the long-run results of the PMG estimator also support the existence of agriculture-induced EKC for developing countries. The empirical findings of this study provide stimulus results of policy makers to re-consider their current production infrastructure of agricultural sector to achieve sustainable development.

AB Arguments about the "positive" influence of growing transnational linkages have typically focused on their role in diffusing environmentally superior innovations which help to raise countries' environment-efficiency. The present article empirically tests these claims by examining whether developing countries' linkages with more CO2- and SO2-efficient economies contribute to domestic improvements in CO2- and SO2-efficiency. Our large-N, statistical findings caution against some of the efficiency-oriented optimism voiced by supporters of globalization. Although imports ties with more pollution-efficient countries are found to spillover into improved domestic CO2- and SO2-efficiency, neither transnational linkages via exports, inward foreign direct investment (FDI) nor telephone calls appear to have any influence on domestic pollution-efficiency.

Namely, sustainability initiatives that encourage best practice management on farms for environmental, social and economic gains, and also product carbon footprints (PCFs) that estimate the climate impact of products across entire supply chains. Concern is sometimes voiced about the potential negative impacts of both on exports from developing countries, especially related to outcome-based PCF initiatives which involve complex calculations and could present particular burdens for small producers. It is argued here that both approaches have a role to play in the conservation of our environment, though both have advantages and disadvantages.

TI Perceived Green Human Resource Management Practices and Corporate
   Sustainability: Multigroup Analysis and Major Industries Perspectives
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The substantial focus on achieving corporate sustainability has necessitated the implementation of green human resource management (GHRM) practices. The purpose of this paper is to reveal the industries' perspective of the impact of GHRM practices (i.e., green recruitment and selection, green pay and rewards, and green employee involvement and green training) on corporate sustainability practices. Data were collected from 200 human resource professionals in major industrial sectors of a developing country. Partial least squares structural equation modelling was used to test the study hypotheses and multigroup analysis (MGA) between industrial sectors. The findings show a positive impact of three GHRM practices, i.e., green recruitment and selection, green pay and rewards, and green employee involvement on corporate sustainability. However, green training has no significant association with corporate sustainability, which is interesting. Furthermore, the multigroup analysis (MGA) revealed partial and significant differences among different sectors. The results provide more contextualized social, environmental, and economic implications to academics and practitioners interested in green initiatives. To date, limited research has been conducted to investigate whether GHRM practices can be an effective strategy in increasing corporate sustainability in a developing country context. Particularly, the industry's perspective on the subject matter was rather absent in the existing literature. The present study fills this gap and contributes to the existing literature by providing the industry's perspective on GHRM and corporate sustainability.

AB Cleaner production (CP) has been widely recognized as a useful approach to mitigate pollutions during industrial production. Small- to Medium-Scale Enterprises (SMEs) contribute immensely to most developing economies and provide a vital source of employment and incomes for many millions of people in developing countries, but there is often disregard for the negative implications on the environment. The aim of the study was to assess barriers to cleaner production implementation in the small scale industries and recommend ways of addressing these. The research focuses upon some of the key environmental issues in the Zimbabwean small-to medium scale industry. An application of CP to two industries, namely the foundry and cement manufacturing industry is highlighted and the challenges faced during the implementation are discussed. A review of literature is also carried out to relate the challenges to other countries in order to have a global view and ascertain common inter-phases and the possibility of common solutions in the developing world. It was discovered that in the absence of external motivators, such as government regulation and community pressure, SMEs are less likely to adopt rapid advances in environmental performance. Lack of information also impacts negatively on efforts to inculcate a culture of environmental conscious manufacturing. There is a great need to actively inform the SMEs enterprises on the merits and demerits of not employing environmentally friendly methods of production. The other big barrier is the lack of expertise to champion the implementation of a companywide CP programme. Changes in systems and technology may also make certain employees obsolete, and therefore induce organisational structural protection of the existing system

TI Environmental sustainability in developing countries: Understanding the
   criticality of financial inclusion and globalization
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Environmental challenges are mounting in the developing world, and mitigation activities, such as improved technology, green energy production, and research and development depend on significant funding from financial institutions. In this context, financial inclusivity can channelize investments towards green energy adoption and technological upgrading. On the flip side, the absence of environmental preferences may lead financial institutions to strengthen pollution-intensive projects and inefficient production patterns. Thus, this study used the panel quantile regression method to unfold the impacts of financial inclusion (FI) and globalization on CO2 controlling foreign direct investment (FDI), energy prices, and economic growth. The results established that FI boosts pollutant emissions in developing countries, and globalization also mounts environmental deterioration. However, energy prices and FDI contribute to mitigating CO2 in developing nations. Moreover, the Environmental Kuznets Curve is evidenced in the panel of developing nations. As an alternative technique, Driscoll-Kraay regression method validated the consistency of the results. Considering the findings of this study, several policy suggestions are discussed to enhance environmental quality.

TI Fuzzy optimization of carbon management networks based on direct and
   indirect biomass co-firing
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB A drastic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation will be needed to mitigate climate change to a safe level. Residual biomass from agriculture is an underutilized energy source that can contribute to the needed emissions cut, but its geographic dispersion presents logistical problems. Direct and indirect co-firing of biomass in existing power plants presents a flexible means of utilizing this resource. Indirect co-firing of biomass with biochar co-production can even give greater reduction in greenhouse gas emissions if the biochar is applied to soil as a form of carbon sequestration. In this paper, a fuzzy linear programming model is developed for optimizing a carbon management network based on direct and indirect biomass co-firing, coupled with biochar application to soil for the latter case. The model can match biomass sources to power plants; the power plants that use indirect co-firing are also matched to biochar application sites. The model is illustrated using a case study representative of a developing country with an agriculture-intensive economy. Results show that not all powerplants need to implement co-firing to reach a balance between reducing GHG emissions and the risk of introducing contaminants in soil. The model provides effective decision support for decarbonizing power generation, particularly in developing countries that still make use of coal-fired power plants and which have abundant biomass resources in the form of agricultural waste.

TI Smart City Governance in Developing Countries: A Systematic Literature
   Review
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Smart cities that make broad use of digital technologies have been touted as possible solutions for the population pressures faced by many cities in developing countries and may help meet the rising demand for services and infrastructure. Nevertheless, the high financial cost involved in infrastructure maintenance, the substantial size of the informal economies, and various governance challenges are curtailing government idealism regarding smart cities. This review examines the state of smart city development in developing countries, which includes understanding the conceptualisations, motivations, and unique drivers behind (and barriers to) smarty city development. A total of 56 studies were identified from a systematic literature review from an initial pool of 3928 social sciences literature identified from two academic databases. Data were analysed using thematic synthesis and thematic analysis. The review found that technology-enabled smart cities in developing countries can only be realised when concurrent socioeconomic, human, legal, and regulatory reforms are instituted. Governments need to step up their efforts to fulfil the basic infrastructure needs of citizens, raise more revenue, construct clear regulatory frameworks to mitigate the technological risks involved, develop human capital, ensure digital inclusivity, and promote environmental sustainability. A supportive ecosystem that encourages citizen participation, nurtures start-ups, and promotes public-private partnerships needs to be created to realise their smart city vision.

AB The economic issues, related to environment misuses are very significant in the concept of globalization/liberalization especially for developing and underdeveloped countries. "Masses continue to live far below the minimum levels of human existence on Earth. They are deprived of adequate shelter and education, water and lighting, food and clothing, health and sanitation. In nut shell, the developing countries must concentrate their efforts to development beating in mind their priorities and the need to safeguard and improve the environment".
   Due to non-availability of the above facilities, the environment is at stake and under a lot of stress and strain as mankind misuse the various natural resources available in the surrounding areas. Due to the shortage of resources and availability of the latest CDM, the gap between developing and developed countries is increasing day by day. Indirectly, the environment is getting spoiled/misused/damaged beyond recoverable limits. i.e. increase in the release of CO2 by the burning of wood/cowdung/cutting of forest cover/spoiling of water resources, without any knowledge of the havoc caused by them. The paper deals with the challenges for Control of Climate Change Sustainable Energy and Greenhouse Gas Emissions. For the same purpose, the industries of developed countries should make efforts between themselves and the developing countries to save the mankind. Who is going to lose or what is their loss? Developed and developing countries alike are heading towards the same destination.

TI Fairtrade credentialism: towards understanding certified producer
   organizations' perceptions of Fairtrade as a credential
SO GLOBALIZATIONS
AB Fairtrade is a transnational voluntary labelling initiative that aims to upgrade the social, economic, and environmental conditions of producers in developing countries. In this paper, we systematically translated, coded, and analysed open-ended responses from a global survey of Fairtrade producers to explore how Fairtrade operates as a credential. The credentialism literature sheds light on Fairtrade's ability to create social and economic mobility, the operation of positive and negative selection processes and the hidden curriculum. We conclude with research and policy recommendations, including the need for the research community and Fairtrade International to track and monitor initial conditions of Fairtrade producers and measure progress over time to improve understanding of how Fairtrade operates as a credential and structures the social and economic mobility of developing country producers.

TI The International Consortium on Mental Health Policy and Services:
   Objectives, design and project implementation
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF PSYCHIATRY
AB The concept of the burden of disease, introduced and estimated for a broad range of diseases in the World Bank report of 1993 illustrated that mental and neurological disorders not only entail a higher burden than cancer, but are responsible, in developed and developing countries, for more than 15% of the total burden of all diseases. As a consequence, over the past decade, mental disorders have ranked increasingly highly on the international agenda for health. However, the fact that mental health and nervous system disorders are now high on the international health agenda is by no means a guarantee that the fate of patients suffering from these disorders in developing countries will improve. In most developing countries the treatment gap for mental and neurological disorders is still unacceptably high. To address this problem, an international network of collaborating institutions in low-income countries has been set up. The establishment and the achievements of this network-the International Consortium on Mental Health Policy and Services-are reported. Sixteen institutions in developing countries collaborate (supported by a small number of scientific resource centres in industrialized nations) in projects on applied mental health systems research. Over a two-year period, the network produced the key elements of a national mental health policy; provided tools and methods for assessing a country's current mental health status (context, needs and demands, programmes, services and care and outcomes); established a global network of expertise, i.e., institutions and experts, for use by countries wishing to reform their mental health policy, services and care; and generated guidelines and examples for upgrading mental health policy with due regard to the existing mental health delivery system and demographic, cultural and economic factors.

AB A rapid growth of urbanization has been acknowledged by many researchers and has turned into a challenge for most countries, especially developing countries like Afghanistan. Although the theme of urbanization is new in Afghanistan, this sector has lately attracted the attention of national and international entities in Afghanistan. This is considered to be one of the biggest obstacles that hinder achieving a sustainable future development, and also prevents the implementation of the city's future master plan. At the same time, it is an obvious fact that social conflicts disturb the social life and physical form of cities, and its examples are seen throughout the world. Thus, many social, physical and economic problems are found, of which the creation of informal settlements is the prime example. Informality of urban fabric is a common subject in all developing countries. It is argued broadly throughout academic and research articles that informal settlements are created by the poor or established due to inappropriate planning systems and policies. With a fast pace, informal urban areas have now become home for a large number of people in developing countries throughout the world. In the case of Kabul, the capital city of Afghanistan, informal settlements represent up to 80% of the total city population. The study focuses on finding the factors behind the growth of informal settlements in Kabul. The purpose is to provide the notion and understanding of the way these settlements are created and their existing conditions. The paper does not suggest a model of change for the informal settlements.

TI The green economy in Tanzania: From global discourses to
   institutionalization
SO GEOFORUM
AB The purpose of this paper is to examine the transfer of the green economy from a global discursive level to institutionalization at the national level in Tanzania. While there is a growing amount of research discussing technological aspects of the green economy, less attention has been paid to policy implications and governance aspects, especially in developing countries. There is an increasing emphasis on technological and market-based solutions to environmental challenges globally and in the developed part of the world. However, in developing countries, 'green growth' often implies transformed control over natural resources under schemes that are often driven from abroad. Over the last five to ten years, investments aimed at increasing productivity in the rural agricultural sector in developing countries have become a foctis area of the green economy, but various concepts of green have become confused. Such (mis-) interpretation of the green economy has consequences for implementation and outcomes of various 'green' projects. Drawing on governmentality as well as the concept of institutional bricolage, I examine how the green economy discourse and policy at the global level have been reshaped and re-interpreted to fit the existing agri-business initiative of the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT), which has been championed as a model for green economy implementation in Africa. I discuss how the green discourse has been 'grabbed' as an opportunity to 'greenwash' SAGCOT in its establishment and institutionalization.

TI Addressing Uncertainty of Environmental Governance in Environmentally
   Sensitive Areas in Developing Countries: A Precise-Strike and
   Spatial-Targeting Adaptive Governance Framework
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Endowed with distinctive natural ecosystems and abundant biodiversity, regional environmental governance in developing countries, especially the environmentally sensitive areas (ESAs), is facing the daunting task to ultimately divert their regional development mode towards sustainable fashion through governance transition. However, given their less-developed status in particular expressed by under-developed economies, unsound political regimes, low governance capacity, such task seemingly insurmountable. In order to approach the incompatibility between economic development and maintenance of the ecosystem services value, and understand the complex and interlocked nature of the regional institution system of ESAs in developing countries, an ecosystem services value-based adaptive governance model was introduced to identify the deficiencies and failures of existing regional environmental governance and establish innovative arenas and transition agendas for innovating and reframing regional institutions and modifying role of regional actor groups and governance mode in the process of decision making on environmental issues. Such approaches were conducted in a circular diverting process in order to facilitate the mode of regional development transforming towards sustainable development. For demonstration the process of application and effectiveness of this methodology, a case study was conducted in a typical ESAs-the Water Source Area of the Middle Route Project of the South-North Water Diversion Project in China. Through integrating the ecosystem services value (ESV) assessment into a wider framework of institutional change, the regional institution system innovation and reformation was directed by taking the ESV changes and pattern of its geo-distribution in the research area as indicators or clues. Compared with traditional proposals for administrative change, the methodology proposed in this study was not prescriptive or directive: Rather, an approach for influencing the direction and speed of transition through a series of steering and coordination mechanism. Therefore, this model is with the potential to be implemented by local communities in regions, especially ESAs in developing countries, to encounter with similar regional development challenges and complex, interlocking, and over-dated regional institutional system associated with environmental issues.

TI Identifying drivers affecting air quality in metropolitan areas of
   developing countries: evidence from Tehran metropolitan area
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Environmental issues and the significant reduction of air quality in the metropolitan areas of developing countries have become chronic challenges. While the impacts of many reasons such as the rapid trend of urbanization, lacking sustainable thinking in urban planning approaches, and urban sprawl have been explored in previous literature, the role of political economy, especially the structure based on the rentier economy, in the change of air quality as an environmental challenge in the metropolitan areas of developing countries has received little attention. To fill this gap, this study focuses on the role of the rentier economy and identifies the drivers based on it that have a tremendous impact on the air quality in Tehran metropolitan area, Iran. To this end, using the Grounded Theory (GT) foundation database and two-round Delphi survey, the opinions of 19 experts were used to identify and explain major drivers that impact air quality in Tehran. Our findings revealed that nine major drivers have an increasing impact on the air quality in the metropolitan area of Tehran. These drivers considering the dominance of the rentier economy are interpreted as the lack of powerful local governance, the rental economy, centralized structure of government, unsustainable economic development, institutional conflicts, a faulty planning system, financial unsustainability of municipalities, unfair distribution of power, and inefficient urban development policies. Among the drivers, the impacts of institutional conflicts and lack of powerful local governance on air quality are more considerable. This study highlights the role of the rentier economy as a major obstacle to resilient responses and constructive actions against chronic environmental challenges such as drastic changes in air quality in metropolitan areas of developing countries.

TI Study on the Coupling Effect of Agricultural Production, Road
   Construction, and Ecology: The Case for Cambodia
SO AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB Agricultural development is a necessary component of national development efforts to fight food crises and promote poverty reduction in many developing countries. However, many developing countries have fallen into a stalemate between modernization and development-modernized areas are less capable of driving regional development despite their abundant land and rich population. Striking a balance between agricultural technology and environmental protection is a key feature of sustainable land development. Based on the social-ecological resilience theory, this study takes Cambodia as an example and aims to establish a comprehensive evaluation index system to measure the agricultural production, regional road construction, and agricultural eco-environment in Cambodia. The coupled coordination model and gray relation analysis model are utilized to explore the interaction between agriculture, roads, and the agricultural eco-environment. The results show that (1) Cambodia has road environmental risks, and there is a need for rural labor migration in areas with higher levels of economic development. (2) The main agricultural production areas are faced with the dilemma of lagging infrastructure development, such as roads, and a huge potential for agricultural development. (3) In the plains areas, the growing population has caused tension between food security, fertilizer abuse, and deforestation, which intensified the disturbance of the agricultural ecological environment. In summary, based on their own developmental needs, developing countries at different stages of development can explore the interaction between agricultural production, infrastructure development, and the agricultural eco-environment in the process of agricultural development. This study attempts to provide a set of practical development policy implications for developing countries that are seeking to enhance the coupling relationship between agricultural production, infrastructure, and the agricultural eco-environment.

TI Socioeconomic status and obesity in adult populations of developing
   countries: a review
SO BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
AB A landmark review of studies published prior to 1989 on socioeconomic status (SES) and obesity supported the view that obesity in the developing world would be essentially a disease of the socioeconomic elite. The present review, on studies conducted in adult populations from developing countries, published between 1989 and 2003, shows a different scenario for the relationship between SES and obesity. Although more studies are necessary to clarify the exact nature of this relationship, particularly among men, three main conclusions emerge from the studies reviewed:
   1. Obesity in the developing world can no longer be considered solely a disease of groups with higher SES.
   2. The burden of obesity in each developing country tends to shift towards the groups with lower SES as the country's gross national product (GNP) increases.
   3. The shift of obesity towards women with low SES apparently occurs at an earlier stage of economic development than it does for men. The crossover to higher rates of obesity among women of low SES is found at a GNP per capita of about US$ 2500, the mid-point value for lower-middle-income economies. The results of this review reinforce the urgent need to: include obesity prevention as a relevant topic on the public health agenda in developing countries; improve the access of all social classes in these countries to reliable information on the determinants and consequences of obesity; and design and implement consistent public actions on the physical, economic, and sociocultural environment that make healthier choices concerning diet and physical activity feasible for all, A significant step in this direction was taken with the approval of the Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health by the World Health Assembly in May 2004.

TI The impact of information and communication technologies, CO2 emissions,
   and energy consumption on inclusive development in developing countries
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB This study investigates the impact of information and communication technologies, carbon dioxide emissions, and energy consumption on inclusive development of 81 developing countries for the period 2010-2014. Two-step system generalized method of moments has been employed to estimate these dynamic relationships among the variables in conditional and unconditional models. Our findings support the theory that ICTs can be used as policy instrument to dampen the negative effect of environmental degradation on inclusive development. The results suggest that ICTs in association with CO2 emissions per capita positively affect inclusive development in an unconditional regression. When ICT complements CO2 intensity, it positively affects inclusive development in mobile- and internet-oriented regressions. However, we also found net negative effects of association between ICTs and CO2 emissions from liquid and fuel and CO2 emissions from heat and electricity which reflects a decrease in inclusive human development. We suggest that policy makers should consider the nature and dimensions of CO2 emissions while using ICTs as policy instrument tomitigate emissions and should invite and plan such investments in ICTs which help in attaining environmental sustainability and inclusive development.

AB In many developing countries, the production and trade in agricultural products plays a crucial role for economic growth and development. It enables countries to cam foreign exchange, to create employment and to invest in sustainable utilization of resources. However, developing countries are often faced with a number of constraints that limit local farmers to develop. First of all, the agricultural sector often remains underdeveloped as a result of inadequate and unbalanced investments compared to the industrial sector. At the same time, farmers have insufficient access to market information and (as a result) have poor bargaining power. Most farmers own small plots of land, and as a result are unable to invest in meeting the stringent international standards to which they need comply. Finally, it is felt that, also at WTO level, trade rules favour multinationals and the developed countries, and not small farmers in developing countries. For these farmers to participate in international trade, KENFAP identified three strategies. The first is to build institutional capacity and self-organization; these will enable farmers to be better informed, improve bargaining power and learn from international best practices. The development of partnerships and networks will further contribute to preparing for market access. Finally it recommends the active support through enabling incentives (policies and regulations) from national and international policymakers.

TI International Direct Investment and Transboundary Pollution: An
   Empirical Analysis of Complex Networks
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Using complex networks and spatial econometric methods, we empirically test the extent to which a country's influence and its position in an international investment network affect environmental quality as well as the country's role in transboundary pollution transfer. The estimated results show that the ties connecting nodes together in an international investment network have significant impacts on global environmental pollution. Additionally, node linkages between developing countries have stronger negative effects on environmental quality than node linkages between developed countries. Moreover, greater node importance and node centrality accelerate the speed and scale of the growth of polluting industries, which allows developed countries to more easily transfer their pollution-intensive industries to developing countries that possess higher node dependency. We also find that the factor endowment effect coexists with the pollution haven effect, the effects of environmental regulation advantage in the international investment network are greater than the impact of factor endowment advantage.

TI The Indian response How to energize women
SO BULLETIN OF THE ATOMIC SCIENTISTS
AB Lack of access to modern energy services represents a pressing problem in the developing world, not least for women. Many poor women spend much of their time on menial work that could be performed much more easily if energy were available, and safety concerns often prevent women from going out at night where there are no streetlights. Children suffer too-more than 50 percent of the developing world's children attend primary schools that lack electricity, and this can lead to markedly worse educational outcomes. Access to modern energy services might be improved through, among other approaches, establishing small-scale hydroelectric projects, facilitating the use of home solar systems, or providing grid electricity (which itself might be produced either with conventional fuels or through renewable means). Three authors-Kalpana Sharma of India, Dipak Gyawali of Nepal (2014), and Corinne Hart of the United States (2014)-discuss which methods of expanding energy access show most promise for improving the lives of the developing world's poor women and children.

TI Bioenergy research under climate change: a bibliometric analysis from a
   country perspective
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Development of bioenergy will be a key component for meeting increasing energy demands while mitigating global warming. With the intent of identifying current topics of major interest and development of research directions in the field of bioenergy under climate change, we conducted a bibliometric analysis and network analysis from a country perspective based on 3050 articles published since 1999 derived from the Scopus database. The results indicated that USA, UK, and Germany led other countries in terms of number of publications (1006, 366, and 280 articles, respectively) and h-index (greater than 50) in this research area. The USA has also produced a large number of articles in highly respected journals. Compared with developed countries, some developing countries (e.g., China, India, and Brazil) have a larger proportion of publications which are cited less than 10 times and researchers who have academic age of 1 year. The number of publications dealing with some of these research topics coming from developing countries has lagged behind the number of similar publications coming from developed countries. In spite of this, research on sustainable energy systems is still needed for developing countries to further establish feasible systems that can effectively promote global economic development and strengthen climate change mitigation efforts.

TI Economics of household technology adoption in developing countries:
   Evidence from solar technology adoption in rural India
SO ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB Innovation is one of the most important drivers of economic development. Even in developing countries, households have access to a wide array of new technologies. However, factors affecting households' technology adoption decisions remain poorly understood. Using data on solar microgrid adoption from rural India, we investigate the determinants of household technology adoption. We offer all households identical solar products to avoid bias from product differentiation. Households pay a monthly fee for technology use, allowing us to abstract away from credit constraints as a barrier to adoption. The results show that household expenditures and savings as well as the household head's entrepreneurial attitude are strong predictors of adoption. In contrast, past fuel expenditures, risk acceptance, and community trust are not associated with technology adoption decisions. These findings suggest new directions for research on the microeconomics of household technology adoption, which is critical for sustainable development among the poor in developing countries.

TI Sustainable production of ammonia fertilizers from biomass
SO BIOFUELS BIOPRODUCTS & BIOREFINING-BIOFPR
AB Nitrogen is the most limiting plant nutrient. Inexpensive natural gas has substantially reduced costs of ammonia fertilizer for intensive agriculture in the developed world, but its excessive use negatively impacts downstream ecosystems. By contrast, the availability of ammonia fertilizer is a major economic bottleneck for agriculture in developing countries. A dedicated lignocellulosic biomass crop could supply sufficient substrate to generate optimal nitrogen fertilizer on less than 5% of a grower's food crop acreage. Reimagining ammonia generation using biomass could significantly enhance sustainable agricultural productivity in developing countries when combined with emerging catalytic technologies.

TI Evaluating the Sustainability of Ceramic Filters for Point-of-Use
   Drinking Water Treatment
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB This study evaluates the social, economic, and environmental sustainability of ceramic filters impregnated with silver nanoparticles for point-of-use (POU) drinking water treatment in developing countries. The functional unit for this analysis was the amount of water consumed by a typical household over ten years (37,960 L), as delivered by either the POU technology or a centralized water treatment and distribution system. Results indicate that the ceramic filters are 3-6 times more cost-effective than the centralized water system for reduction of waterborne diarrheal illness among the general population and children under five. The ceramic filters also exhibit better environmental performance for four of five evaluated life cycle impacts: energy use, water use, global warming potential, and particulate matter emissions (PM10). For smog formation potential, the centralized system is preferable to the ceramic filter POU technology. This convergence of social, economic, and environmental criteria offers clear indication that the ceramic filter POU technology is a more sustainable choice for drinking water treatment in developing countries than the centralized treatment systems that have been widely adopted in industrialized countries.

TI An information company in Mexico: Extending the resource-based view of
   the firm to a developing country context
SO INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH
AB The information industry assumes that information is seen as a valued resource that enables organizations and individuals to improve their effectiveness, efficiency, and overall competitiveness. For the information industry to bridge rather than divide further the global economy to information rich and information poor, we need to understand how firms, particularly local firms, can pioneer or participate in the information industry in emerging economies that do not inherently embrace information as a valued business resource. This research examines how one local firm shaped the external environment to pioneer a local information industry in Mexico and how it competes in a newly opened local market against foreign competitors. In doing so, the paper extends the resource-based view of the firm to a developing country context. The dynamic capabilities of strategic foresight and flexibility, coupled with a core competency of trustworthiness, are found to be critical in effecting internal and external change in an unstable environment.

Overall analysis suggests that the developing countries are different than developed economies. The corporate governance infrastructure in countries like Bangladesh has elements of both shareholder and stakeholder perspective, but none of them alone could solve the unique governance issues prevailing in developing countries. Also, low audit fees appear to be major hindrance of quality audit.

TI Brazilian design for sustainability: in search of a local approach
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Small and medium enterprises are fundamental to economic growth and job generation, especially in developing countries. These companies are crucial for the improvement of social conditions and technological development in poorer regions of the Americas, Asia and Africa. However, local conditions are usually very specific and demand a singular approach for sustainability. This paper presents some results of a research aimed at investigating methodologies and tools to support the application of Design for Sustainability principles adapted to the real conditions of Brazilian small and medium enterprises. These enterprises are mainly based on traditional products and technologies. The results of this research were achieved through identifying elements for development of a sustainable approach, with a focus on design of products in Brazil and other developing countries. The methodology considered variables specifically linked to the local situation. The primary focus was on small companies working in traditional production processes (or craftsmanship) in Minas Gerais State, in southeast Brazil. Four main sustainability aspects were considered: environmental, economic, social and cultural. As a conclusion, three cases of intervention focused on sustainable improvement are presented and discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Success of Small and Medium Enterprises in Myanmar: Role of
   Technological, Organizational, and Environmental Factors
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT
AB Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are key to economic growth and prosperity in developing countries. In this study we build on the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework, a widely used theoretical perspective in organizational research, to understand factors that contribute to the success of SMEs in Myanmar, a socio-politically important yet volatile developing country that recently opened its economy to the world. We identify a set of TOE factors that explain the success and reveal the challenges of SMEs in Myanmar. Based on surveys conducted over four years (2013 to 2016), we found that information and communication technologies (i.e., internet use and web presence for business purposes) were positively associated with SME success, suggesting that SMEs in Myanmar, which has been globally isolated for many decades, could indeed benefit from modern ICTs. We also found that larger SMEs experienced greater success in terms of sales and profitability than smaller SMEs, and manufacturing SMEs overall performed better than SMEs in other industries. This study adds to the literature on SME success, early stages of ICT usage, the TOE framework, and have practical implications for SMEs in Myanmar and other developing countries. The unique characteristics of Myanmar will likely shed light on our understanding of SME success in other ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries.

TI Organic Waste Buyback as a Viable Method to Enhance Sustainable
   Municipal Solid Waste Management in Developing Countries
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Many developing countries have inadequate Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) management systems due to lack of not only the awareness, technologies, finances, but also a proper governance that is able to enforce and monitor the regulations. Not all the solutions practiced by and in developed countries fit to the developing country contexts. The local conditions and limitations must always be taken into account when proposing waste management options for developing countries. The excessively high organic waste fraction in MSW and relatively inexpensive labor markets available in developing countries are two of the strengths that have not yet been utilized fully. This manuscript is an attempt to point out the benefits we receive from the above two strengths if we establish organic waste buyback programs. This can only become successful if we find solutions to: (1) collect source-separated organic waste, and then (2) find stable markets for the products made from organic waste. Compost or biogas could be the best bet developing countries can consider as products. However, there must be some policy interventions to support buyback programs at the waste collection stage as well as at the product marketing stage. Implementation of such organic waste buyback centers that can offer some incentives can indirectly motivate residents to do source separation. This will in turn also help promote more recycling, as any waste bin that has no organics in it is much easier for anyone (e.g., waste pickers) to look for other recyclables. Developing country settings such as the Green Container composting program in Cajica, Colombia, and buyback centers in South Africa that are presented later in the manuscript are thought to be the places where the concept can be implemented with little effort. The environment, economy, and society are considered to be the three dimensions (or pillars) of sustainability. Interestingly, the organic waste buyback centers solution has positive implications on all three aspects of sustainability. Thus, it also supports the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations (UN), by making specific contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as zero hunger (SDG 2), affordable and clean energy (SDG 7), climate action (SDG 13), clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), and sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11).

TI Global trends in breast cancer incidence and mortality
SO SALUD PUBLICA DE MEXICO
AB This review highlights the increasing incidence of breast cancer world-wide and the increasing burden of breast cancer deaths experienced by lower-income countries. The causes of increasing incidence have been attributed to changes in the prevalence of reproductive risk factors, lifestyle changes, and genetic and biological differences between ethnic and racial groups. All these factors may contribute, but data linking etiological factors to increased risk in developing countries is lacking. The challenge for lower-income countries is developing effective strategies to reverse the trend of increasing mortality. Down-staging of breast cancer by early detection is a promising long-term strategy for preventing disease-related deaths but it is difficult to make the economic investment required to carry out broad screening programs. Successful strategies for addressing the growing breast cancer burden will therefore take political will, reliable data, public and medical community awareness, and partnerships between community advocates, governments, non-governmental organizations and biotechnology.

TI The impact of money laundering on economic and financial stability and
   on political development in developing countries The case of Nigeria
SO JOURNAL OF MONEY LAUNDERING CONTROL
AB Purpose - Money laundering is indeed a global phenomenon which undermines the economic and political stabilities of States. However, as much as money laundering is a global phenomenon, over the last decade, it has been apparent that development countries have been more exposed and vulnerable to its exploits. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to evaluate, specifically, the impact of money laundering on economic development, financial stability and also political development of "developing countries". Hence, the aim and purpose of the paper is to deeply analyse the immense scale, concise effect and impact of the phenomenon of money laundering that hinders economic and political growth in developing countries in contrast to the developed countries. The paper also intends to examine the above issues in the context of Nigeria as a developing country.
   Design/methodology/approach - In developing this paper, emphasis was placed on primary sources of information and references to secondary sources of information where relevant. Therefore, the methodology employed in this paper is analytical and based on the facts reflected in the secondary sources and also legal and socio-economic analyses of money laundering phenomenon.
   Findings - The phenomenon of money laundering, amongst other economic and financial crimes have had better success in infiltrating into the economic and political structures of most developing countries therefore resulting to economic digression and political instability. Although, developing countries have responded and continue to respond, through legislative measures, to the menace of money laundering, at national level, however, money launderers, have exploited the lax regulatory environment, vulnerable financial systems along with persistence civil and political unrest of most the developing countries. The findings of the paper also highlight the relationship between corruption and money laundering in developing countries.
   Originality/value - The paper is very unique in its approach as it combines legal analyses with social philosophy or combating money laundering and from a perspective of law of development both at the national and international levels, it focuses on the negative impacts of money laundering on the development of developing countries such as Nigeria.

TI Comparison of various approaches to design wind-PV rural electrification
   projects in remote areas of developing countries
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Nowadays, around 1.1 billion people in rural and remote areas of developing countries remain without electricity. Stand-alone projects that combine the wind and photovoltaic generation technologies as well as microgrids and individual supplies for the distribution network are an adequate strategy to reach such isolated regions. However, the design of electrification projects is complex, having to define the best combination of generation and distribution technologies, under a challenging social context and tight technoeconomic resources. In order to ease decision-making, several tools have been developed in the literature and are here reviewed, grouped into three main categories: optimization processes, aiming to minimize project costs subject to technical constraints, through exact or heuristic algorithms; multicriteria processes, using different methods to select the best among a set of predefined scenarios according to economic, technical, social, and environmental criteria; and systematized tools, that have been developed to provide user-friendly interface for their larger dissemination in different regions and contexts. Hence, this paper aims to provide researchers and practitioners an analysis of the advantages and limitations of approaches used over the last decade when addressing the designing of wind and/or photovoltaic electrification projects for extremely poor and isolated areas in developing countries, as well as some areas for further research. This article is categorized under: Concentrating Solar Power > Systems and Infrastructure Photovoltaics > Systems and Infrastructure Wind Power > Systems and Infrastructure Energy Infrastructure > Economics and Policy

TI Comparing Virtue, Consequentialist, and Deontological Ethics-Based
   Corporate Social Responsibility: Mitigating Microfinance Risk in
   Institutional Voids
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB Due to the nature of lending practices and support services offered to the poor in developing countries, portfolio risk is a growing concern for the microfinance industry. Though previous research highlights the importance of risk for microfinance organizations, not much is known about how microfinance organizations can mitigate risks incurred from providing loans to the poor in developing countries. Further, though many microfinance organizations practice corporate social responsibility (CSR) to help create economic and social wealth in developing countries, the impact of such CSR practices remains an underdeveloped area of inquiry. We use a normative ethics lens to develop an ethics-based CSR theory that differentiates between three forms of ethics-based CSR-virtue, consequentialist, and deontological. We argue that while all three forms can help mitigate risk, virtue ethics-based CSR is potentially the most useful form of CSR toward mitigating microfinance portfolio risk. We test our hypotheses using a sample of microfinance organizations from across the world. Our findings suggest that virtue ethics-based CSR is not just an important philosophical paradigm; it can actually help mitigate microfinance portfolio risk when implemented in practice.

AB Recent years, many developing countries are undertaking rapid industrialization. Unavoidable, the pollution becomes more serious with the increased volume of industrial waste. In some developing countries, the storage amounts of solid waste in many cities are too much which form the serious situation of cities surrounded by solid waste. By presenting the status quo of China, one of the big developing countries and developed countries, this paper is to analyze their characteristics and problems existed: in developing countries, the release volume of solid waste high, technical and managerial capacity backward and short in capitals; in developed countries although high in release volume of the waste, advanced technologies, managerial forces and strong legislation helped a great deal so that it would be much easier to treat the solid waste in more proper ways.
   Industrialization and urbanization are the main symbol of nation's economic development and social advancement among the developing countries. It is not realistic for developing countries to stop developing economy for reducing waste. But developing countries have tried their best to control, reuse and dispose solid waste recent years. The experiences and measures China adopted will also be introduced in the paper.
   This paper will point out that: developing countries would play very important role with the potential in minimizing the solid waste by taking advantage of clean production, adjusting the industrial structure gradually, conducting rational planning and advancement. And raise the production under the technical advancement. And raise the public awareness of environmental protection; developed countries would actively play the role in supporting developing countries to change the current situation with financial and technological assistance so as to assist them to conduct clean production and strengthen the control at beginning, set up necessary facilities like incinerators and landfills, which would accelerate the global waste minimization positively. So the future collaboration between developing and developed countries and common efforts would be made in this field will be expressed in this paper.

TI Energy access scenarios to 2030 for the power sector in sub-Saharan
   Africa
SO UTILITIES POLICY
AB In order to reach a goal of universal access to modern energy services in Africa by 2030, consideration of various electricity sector pathways is required to help inform policy-makers and investors, and help guide power system design. To that end, and building on existing tools and analysis, we present several 'high-level', transparent, and economy-wide scenarios for the sub-Saharan African power sector to 2030. We construct these simple scenarios against the backdrop of historical trends and various interpretations of universal access. They are designed to provide the international community with an indication of the overall scale of the effort required - one aspect of the many inputs required. We find that most existing projections, using typical long-term forecasting methods for power planning, show roughly a threefold increase in installed generation capacity occurring by 2030, but more than a tenfold increase would likely be required to provide for full access - even at relatively modest levels of electricity consumption. This equates to approximately a 13% average annual growth rate, compared to a historical one (in the last two decades) of 1.7%. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Estimating the location of individual livestock holdings and their
   populations in two developing countries for use in spatial disease
   spread models
SO NJAS-WAGENINGEN JOURNAL OF LIFE SCIENCES
AB Infectious diseases of food animals, such as Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD), pose severe impacts on animal trade, animal products and subsequently endanger global food security. FMD is endemic in many parts of the world and is associated with substantial economic losses, which require risk assessments, preparedness planning, and evaluation of the effectiveness of mitigation strategies that fit within a country's sociopolitical and socioeconomic constraints. Spatially-explicit stochastic simulation models (SESS) have become a common tool for estimating the spread and impact of FMD. SESS models incorporate uncertainty in the input and output parameters, heterogeneity in disease processes, and integrate geographic locations and spatial proximity of holdings that affect their relative exposure and transmission risk. An essential input to these models is locational data for holdings of animals and associated animal populations in each holding.
   Several efforts have been made to predict the location and population of livestock holdings or population density at different spatial resolutions. These methods or data cannot be used in developing countries because either the data is too coarse, or the inputs required for the methods are not available in resource-limited countries. As such, there is a need to adapt the practical and reliable existing methods to generate simulated datasets depicting the location and population of individual livestock holdings in developing countries for use in SESS models.
   We generated spatially-resolved simulated datasets for the location and population density of individual livestock holdings in Pakistan and Thailand. Firstly, we microsimulated and downscaled the census data to individual holdings based on statistical distributions. Second, geospatial probability surfaces were created based on a survey of expert veterinarians and empirical holding locations. Third, holdings were randomly placed on the probability surface based on a set of rules. These holdings were assigned population of livestock by joining downscaled data and random holdings. The combined dataset on the location and population of individual livestock holdings was, finally, used to generate the density of holdings.
   To our knowledge, this was the first attempt to estimate the locations and populations of individual livestock holdings in developing countries. These data pave the way for the application of SESS models in developing countries to understand the spread of FMD and evaluate mitigation strategies. The control of such an important animal disease would improve livestock health, improve economic gains for producers, and help alleviate poverty and hunger, which will complement efforts to attain the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.

TI Establishing the limitations of sustainable construction in developing
   countries: a systematic literature review using PRISMA
SO SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB Purpose - Establishing a more sustainable built environment is an increasing global concern for the construction industry. Despite the intrinsic and extrinsic obstacles the stakeholders face, huge efforts are required to transition to a smooth, sustainable construction (SC) practice. This study identifies and discusses cogent obstacles to SC in developing nations.
   Design/methodology/approach - The Preferred Reporting Item for systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) approach was employed to establish research work in SC for developing countries. The databases used were Scopus and Web of Science. Meta-analysis of keywords was analysed thematically. The initial broad search returned 8,420 publications which were filtered and reviewed in-depth to fit the aim of the study, produced only 21 relevant publications from the years 2000-2021.
   Findings - The four identified themes of obstacles to SC in developing countries are as follows: construction professional training and education, clients' attitudes and awareness, construction industries' culture and capacity and governments' regulation, policies and economy. The key barriers identified from the metaanalysis include inadequate training and education amongst construction professionals, poor execution of sustainability ethics, poor populace attitude towards sustainability, poor awareness and understanding, dearth of precise data and integrated study and inappropriate priorities about sustainability.
   Originality/value - The originality in this study are themes drawn from millennium development goals (MDGs) and sustainable development goals (SDGs) publications related to SC. Consequently, the final framework presented a holistic approach to surmounting the established limitations and aided recommendations for future studies. Thus, setting a background for developing strategies to overcome the limitations and further attain sustainable development (SD).

TI Solar energy: Trends and enabling technologies
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB The global demand for energy is currently growing beyond the limits of installable generation capacity. To meet future energy demands efficiently, energy security and reliability must be improved and alternative energy sources must be investigated aggressively. An effective energy solution should be able to address long-term issues by utilizing alternative and renewable energy sources. Of the many available renewable sources of energy, solar energy is clearly a promising option as it is extensively available. Solar power, especially as it reaches more competitive levels with other energy sources in terms of cost, may serve to sustain the lives of millions of underprivileged people in developing countries. Furthermore, solar energy devices can benefit the environment and economy of developing countries. This paper illustrates the need for the utilization of alternative energy sources, evaluates the global scenario of installed generation systems, reviews technologies underlying various solar powered devices, and discusses several applications and challenges in this area. In addition, this paper addresses the costs of deployment, maintenance, and operation, as well as economic policies that promote installation of solar energy systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Demand-side water management using alternatives water sources based on
   residential end-use
SO WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Demand-side water management in developing countries should ideally involve controlling the use of piped water supply and securing water sources that complement it to ensure sustainable use. To investigate the feasibility of incorporating these factors, we conducted a survey in Galle, Sri Lanka. First, an end-use survey was conducted to understand current and near future water use. The results indicated that the toilet, kitchen, clothes washing, and bathing related per capita water consumption in Galle was significantly lower than that in Colombo. The results also suggested that increases in indoor water needs cannot be supplemented via piped water supply only; it is necessary to consider alternative water sources, such as rainwater. Second, the residents' acceptance of rainwater usage for each indoor use was surveyed and it was found that acceptance depended on knowledge levels regarding rainwater harvesting.

TI Seismic risk assessment and hotspots prioritization: a developing
   country perspective
SO NATURAL HAZARDS
AB Natural disasters pose a negative impact not only on human lives but also on infrastructures such as healthcare systems, supply chains, logistics, manufacturing, and service industries. The frequency of such calamities has grown over time, which not only poses a threat to human survival and the living environment but is also detrimental to the economic growth and sustainable development of society. Earthquakes cause the most destruction compared to other natural disasters, especially in developing countries where the conventional reactive approach to dealing with disasters gives less chance for the appropriate utilization of already limited resources. Additionally, mismanagement of the resources and the lack of a unified action plan hinder the purpose of helping the grieving population. Considering the foregoing, this study presents a methodology for identifying hotspots and helping prioritize pre- and post-disaster management action by conducting a thorough seismic risk assessment while taking into consideration the case of a developing country as its focus. This methodology allows for rapid risk assessment against any given scenario by providing quantitative estimates of the repercussions such as physical damage to the buildings, casualties including injuries, economic losses, displaced households, debris, shelter requirements, and hospital functionality. In short, it could help prioritize actions with greater impacts and serve as a foundation for the formulation of policies and plans intended to increase the resilience of a resource-constrained community. Thus, the findings can be utilized by government agencies, emergency management organizations, non-government organizations, and aiding countries as a decision support tool.

AB This study focuses on bureau management technologies and information systems in developing countries. Developing countries use such systems which facilitate executive and organizational functions through the utilization of bureau management technologies and provide the executive staff with necessary information.
   The concepts of data and information differ from each other in developing countries, and thus the concepts of data processing and information processing are different. Symbols represent ideas, objects, figures, letters and numbers. Data processing system is an integrated system which deals with the processing of the data related to the internal and external environment of the organization in order to make decisions, create plans and develop strategies; it goes without saying that this system is composed of both human beings and machines. Information is obtained through the acquisition and the processing of data. On the other hand, data are raw communicative messages. Within this framework, data processing equals to producing plausible information out of raw data.
   Organizations in developing countries need to obtain information relevant to them because rapid changes in the organizational arena require rapid access to accurate information. The most significant role of the directors and managers who work in the organizational arena is to make decisions. Making a correct decision is possible only when the directors and managers are equipped with sound ideas and appropriate information. Therefore, acquisition, organization and distribution of information gain significance. Today's organizations make use of computer-assisted "Management Information Systems" in order to obtain and distribute information.
   Decision Support System which is closely related to practice is an information system that facilitates the director's task of making decisions. Decision Support System integrates human intelligence, information technology and software in order to solve the complex problems. With the support of the computer technology and software systems, Decision Support System produces information relevant to the decision to be made by the director and provides the executive staff with supportive ideas about the decision. Artificial Intelligence programs which transfer the studies and experiences of the people to the computer are called expert systems. An expert system stores expert information in a limited area and can solve problems by deriving rational consequences.
   Bureau management technologies and information systems in developing countries create a kind of information society and information economy which make those countries have their places in the global socio-economic structure and which enable them to play a reasonable and fruitful role; therefore it is of crucial importance to make use of information and management technologies in order to work together with innovative and enterprising individuals and it is also significant to create "scientific policies" based on information and technology in the fields of economy, politics, law and culture.

SO WORLD JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) based on assessment of sustainability indicators for public transportation system including pedestrians and feeder services in developing country.
   Design/methodology/approach - A hybrid approach based on the AHP is considered for assessment of the sustainability of public transportation system including pedestrians and feeder services. Sustainability related indicators for public transportation system (namely for metro, bus and feeder bus) and pedestrians based on past data were reviewed and subsequently, more important indicators catering needs of developing country have been added to achieve significant sustainability score and a total of 17 indicators were selected for assessment of comprehensive sustainability (seven indicators under economic, six under social and four under environmental categories).
   Findings - For quantifying the assessment, specific user interview surveys are performed in south Delhi region and accordingly perception of user and transportation-related operational characteristics of the public transport system were also collected. Preliminary result shows air pollution in environmental category, public health in social category and productivity in economic category is most influential parameters in developing country.
   Originality/value - AHP method is applied for rating the criteria and setting out the priority of designed sustainable indicators. Subsequently sustainable mitigation measures and scenarios for the study area can be evaluated utilizing developed comprehensive sustainability indicator for public transportation system including pedestrian and feeder services available in developing country.

TI Do the IMF's structural adjustment programs help reduce energy
   consumption and carbon intensity? Evidence from developing countries
SO STRUCTURAL CHANGE AND ECONOMIC DYNAMICS
AB Although the number of countries under the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) programs have increased considerably since the 1980s, a research gap exists in regard to the impacts of these programs on both energy consumption and carbon emissions in countries where the programs have been implemented. Hence, the purpose of this study is to understand and explain what is reasonable to expect of the IMF on energy and the environment. Given that the global roadmap for the energy transition calls for structural changes in favor of reducing carbon emissions, this study suggests that the IMF may have a special role to play, that is, working in tandem with national governments and environmental-related organizations to support resilient economic development models to implement this global roadmap towards the energy transition. The results based on panel econometrics models presented in this paper indicate that the IMF has not, to some extent, played such a role so far. More precisely, the results show that although IMF programs help reduce energy consumption, they do not change the energy mix or technological structures in a way that would reduce carbon emissions per unit of energy use. The findings of this study have important implications for energy and climate policymaking in developing countries. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS REVIEW
AB The covid-19 pandemic has unleashed the requirements of immediate changes in various types of investment and financing. The developed and developing countries require compatible infrastructure to live and survive in the new scenario. Majority of developing countries have to depend on foreign direct investment and short-term financing from external sources to build new infrastructure and start the new types of businesses. This situation requires reallocation of foreign direct investment and fiscal resources. The bridge financing through external short-term borrowing may help the institutions in developing countries to maintain their liquidity position for their perpetuity and survival. The study recommends that bridge financing is required to support the economic and business activities during the economic depression and lock down period during the covid-19 and such other crisis. A mathematical model to assess the sustainability of external financing has also been established in the study.

   Philippines
SO AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
AB We investigate how user-managed small-scale irrigation can influence inclusive rural transformation. Cultivating inclusive rural transformation is key to sustainable growth and poverty reduction in developing countries, but existing research rarely analyses the holistic impacts of rural development projects on this process. We use a combination of quantitative and qualitative data to rigorously measure impacts and uncover the causal pathways of a canal irrigation project for rice farmers in the Philippines, finding that positive impacts were heavily determined by market access and the strength of the local economy. We also find limited impacts for poorer farmers located further downstream on the irrigation canals. Based on these findings, we draw several lessons about the complementary conditions and support that are required in order for irrigation to be an effective tool in promoting inclusive rural transformation in developing countries.

TI Assessment of the waste electrical and electronic equipment management
   systems profile and sustainability in developed and developing European
   Union countries
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The assessment of waste management systems for electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) from developed economies (Germany, Sweden and Italy) and developing countries (Romania and Bulgaria), is discussed covering the period 2007-2014. The WEEE management systems profiles are depicted by indicators correlated to WEEE life cycle stages: collection, transportation and treatment. The sustainability of national WEEE management systems in terms of greenhouse gas emissions is presented, together with the greenhouse gas efficiency indicator that underlines the efficiency of WEEE treatment options. In the countries comparisons, the key elements are: robust versus fragile economies, the overall waste management performance and the existence/development of suitable management practices on WEEE.
   Over the life cycle perspective, developed economies (Germany, Sweden and Italy) manage one order of magnitude higher quantities of WEEE compared to developing countries (Romania and Bulgaria). Although prevention and reduction measures are encouraged, all WEEE quantities were larger in 2013, than in 2007. In 2007-2014, developed economies exceed the annual European collection target of 4 kg WEEE/capita, while collection is still difficult in developing countries. If collection rates are estimated in relationship with products placed on market, than similar values are registered in Sweden and Bulgaria, followed by Germany and Italy and lastly Romania. WEEE transportation shows different patterns among countries, with Italy as the greatest exporter (in 2014), while Sweden treats the WEEE nationally. WEEE reuse is a common practice in Germany, Sweden (from 2009) and Bulgaria (from 2011). By 2014, recycling was the most preferred WEEE treatment option, with the same kind of rates performance, over 80%, irrespective of the country, with efforts in each of the countries in developing special collection points, recycling facilities and support instruments. The national total and the recycling carbon footprints of WEEE are lower in 2013 than in 2007 for each country, the order in reducing the environmental impacts being: Germany, Italy, Sweden, Bulgaria and Romania. The negative values indicate savings in greenhouse gas emissions. In 2013, the GHG efficiency shows no differences of the WEEE management in the developed and developing countries.

AB End-of-life scrap steel such as vehicles bulks and bodies, steel wheel and shells are easily land filled at the end-of-life when treated in a developing country with non-industrial infrastructure. Research idea is about composite shape steel remanufacturing to be sheet steel for construction application through nested recovered pieces of scrap steel within new sheet steel base to meet innovation value creation of remanufactured steel and innovation eco-design of steel products to close supply chain through linkage developed and developing countries of non-industrial infrastructure economy. That can be satisfied through comprehensive business-education-training model conduction firstly at the developing countries to reduce costs and change the intensive labour remanufacturing paradigm collaboratively. Sustainable remanufacturing business model can be applied based on infrastructure of educational institutions such as institutes of technology to adopt environmental, economic, and social developments as triple bottom line sustainability. Such innovation value creation is driven by eco-design and eco-innovation enabling where the meet to deliver human development, employment, and education conscious environment and bench mark recommendations of development directions for upgrading to apply business that allows eco-societies to emerge, through cooperative steel scrap processing.

TI Why do Christians care? Values and objectives of church-related health
   services in developing countries
SO JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH-HEIDELBERG
AB Church-related hospitals, health centres and dispensaries are of high importance for the provision of health-care services in many developing countries. In East Africa particularly, the heritage of missionaries as well as the newly established church-related hospitals form the backbone of the hospital system. They are still strongly supported by church-related development agencies from Europe and the United States. The reasons why Christians engage in health care are analysed in this paper and a goal system for church-related health services is formulated. The intention is to bridge the gap between theologically correct but rather impractical values and functional objectives suitable for real-life decision-making. In particular we demonstrate that the most prominent Christian values (equity, love) are achieved by a health-care system that follows the objectives of affordability, quality, sustainability, participation and efficiency. It is realized that the transformation of values into concrete objectives must be accomplished jointly by health economists and theologians in order to support practical work of church-related health services as well as remain loyal to the biblical basis.

TI Impact of novel coronavirus pandemic on aquaculture and fisheries in
   developing countries and sustainable recovery plans: Case of Bangladesh
SO MARINE POLICY
AB Like most sectors, the aquaculture and fisheries sector especially in developing countries like Bangladesh is believed to have been severely affected by this unique coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. To overcome the adverse impacts of COVID-19, the aquaculture and fisheries economy needs urgent recovery plans which this study focusses on using a mixed-method including online questionnaire surveys, face-to-face and telephonic interviews and focus group discussions during June - November 2020. This study reveals some positive impacts on ecosystem and fish stock (e.g., increase in fish stock) due to less disturbance of fishing activities, but that are not able to bring societal benefits as all the fisheries sub-sectors are affected differently by the pandemic. There are disrupted transportation systems and increased transportation costs (around 20 - 60% higher than normal), more input and maintenance costs and less demand for/and decreased market price of fish. There are also shortages of labourers and reduced patrolling to implement fishery regulations. Cancellation of orders by foreign buyers has seriously affected the shrimp and crab sub-sectors. The fisheries-dependent people's capital assets and activities have been mostly negatively affected resulting in a worsened livelihood. This study has suggested a set of immediate and long-term changes to policy and action plans to recover this sector and sub-sectors from the pandemic considering economic, social and environmental sustainability. The findings of this study may have important implications not only for Bangladesh but also for other fisheries dependent developing countries with similar impacts by the virus like in South Asia.

TI Energy Demand Forecasting and Optimizing Electric Systems for Developing
   Countries
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Currently, developing countries are experiencing a massive shift toward industrialization. Developing countries lack the technical sophistication and infrastructure to encourage low-carbon and sustainable economic growth because of weak public awareness, regulations, and technology. Developing countries must plan the industrialization process for maximum energy efficiency of production, thereby reducing their CO textsubscript 2 emissions significantly by increasing energy efficiency. This paper presents a systematic survey on the current pragmatic methods for forecasting the future load demands from minutes to years ahead in developing countries, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). The primary focus of this systematic survey paper is to provide an optimal forecasting model selection strategy for potential researchers and forecasters. Based on the strengths and weaknesses of the different models, we will discuss the most suitable methods to tailor them to multiple applications and scenarios of load forecasting. The comparison elements are Forecast horizons, Spatio-temporal resolutions, factors affecting the load, different dimensional reduction techniques, model complexity analysis, and the MAPE for error analysis. From the results, We have found ANN hybridized with meta-heuristic techniques to be superior in most of the analysis cases. ANN's ability to handle non-linear data, flexibility, and robustness is why. Consumption data aggregated at the national level can capture trends efficiently. Meteorological and calendar features influence short-term forecasting extensively, whereas economic factors influence long-term load patterns. Finally, we have identified the trends and research gaps from the existing literature, presenting relevant technical recommendations for improvement.

TI Taxing the People, Not Trade: the International Monetary Fund and the
   Structure of Taxation in Developing Countries
SO STUDIES IN COMPARATIVE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB Strengthening fiscal capacity in low- and middle-income countries is essential for achieving sustainable development. The International Monetary Fund-the world's premier agent of fiscal policy reform-has taken a front-stage role in this process, promoting a model of tax policy that favors broad-based consumption taxes and discourages trade taxes. This article investigates the links between IMF-mandated tax reforms and the evolution of tax revenues. Using novel measures of tax-related conditionality and disaggregated data on revenues, our analysis shows that IMF interventions are significantly related to changes in tax structure. In particular, IMF programs increase revenues derived from goods and services taxes, but decrease revenues collected from trade taxes. Results for personal and corporate income taxes are inconclusive. These findings have important implications for debates on the role of the IMF in developing countries.

AB Durability of building materials, economy, functionality, aesthetics, health, ecology and social-cultural aspect can be considered as key factors in the design of sustainable housing. However, while these factors are being considered with vital importance during the design process in the industrialized countries, it has not always been the case in developing countries. There has been a tendency to over-look or underestimate these basic factors related to design of sustainable housing including the durability aspect of the building materials. The results have been associated with some undesired effects which do not meet the requirements for sustainability and service life of the building. In general, when it relates to housing provision issues in developing countries, it is the delivery aspect that is regarded as important and not, for instance, durability or quality. It is possible to change this mentality and adopt an effective approach whereby all the factors of sustainability are systematically analyzed and applied on design. One can also point out that a decent and a durable shelter in a wholesome environment is essential to human health and to human development. Additionally. it is worth mentioning that a durable and properly designed house contributes to the well-being of a society, from both economical and affordability points of view. Conclusively, there is great need for the developing countries as we enter the 21st century, to identify the problems and challenges to designing sustainable buildings. Priorities such as regulations, standards and codes of practice stressing all those design factors are needed to contribute to a design of sustainable buildings in the developing countries.

TI Current solid waste management strategies and energy recovery in

SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Solid waste generation has rapidly increased due to the worldwide population, urbanization, and industrialization. Solid waste management (SWM) is a significant challenge for a society that arises local issues with global consequences. Thus, solid waste management strategies to recycle waste products are promising practices that positively impact sustainable goals. Several developed countries possess excellent solid waste management strategies to recycle waste products. Developing countries face many challenges, such as municipal solid waste (MSW) sorting and handling due to high population density and economic instability. This mismanagement could further expedite harmful environmental and socioeconomic concerns. This review discusses the current solid waste management and energy recovery production in developing countries; with statistics, this review provides a comprehensive revision on energy recovery technologies such as the thermochemical and biochemical conversion of waste with economic considerations. Furthermore, the paper discusses the challenges of SWM in developing countries, including several immediate actions and future policy recommendations for improving the current status of SWM via harnessing technology. This review has the potential of helping municipalities, government authorities, researchers, and stakeholders working on MSW management to make effective decisions for improved SWM for achieving sustainable development.

TI INVESTING IN PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE: ROADS OR SCHOOLS?
SO MACROECONOMIC DYNAMICS
AB Why do governments in developing economies favor roads rather than schools in public investment scale-ups? We study this question using a dynamic general equilibrium model and argue that the different pace at which roads and schools contribute to economic growth, public debt intolerance, and political myopia are central to this decision. In a thought experiment with a large return differential in favor of schools, a benevolent government would intuitively devote the majority of an investment scale-up to them. However, the fraction of schools chosen by the government falls with increasing levels of debt intolerance and political myopia. In particular, political myopia is a meaningful explanation for the observed result to the extent that an extremely myopic government would not invest in schools at all.

AB This study reviews Easterlin Paradox by replacing sustainable development with economic growth for 27 developed and 25 developing countries during 2006-2018 with a dynamic panel model. The results indicate GDP per capita has a positive weak effect on life satisfaction in both developed and developing countries. Moreover, although the positive strong impact of sustainable development on life satisfaction is confirmed in developed countries, this hypothesis is rejected in developing countries. Finally, the hypothesis indicating an inverse U relationship between economic growth and sustainable development with life satisfaction is confirmed in developed countries; however, it is rejected in developing countries. Hence, in developing countries social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development along with improvement in democracy and corruption control should not be ignored to promote happiness. Moreover, in developed countries for avoiding a decrease in happiness, social, economic, political and environmental empowering-encouraging policies should be simultaneously pursued by policy makers.

TI Urban Water Management Challenges in Developing Countries: The Middle
   East and North Africa (MENA)
SO SUSTAINABLE WATER MANAGEMENT IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS
SE Handbook of Environmental Chemistry Series
AB Accelerated growing population and migration to urban areas in developing countries have resulted in a vital need for the establishment of protected source water and modern, well-maintained drinking-water treatment plants to disseminate potable water to residents. While the challenge in the developed world is mainly to prevent existing infrastructure from decay and to initiate a transition from the disposal-oriented regimes toward more sustainable approaches with a focus on reuse options, the situation is more complex in developing countries. Developing countries suffer from economic problems and are often struggling with insufficient infrastructure and low water supply and sanitation coverage, particularly in rapidly growing urban slum settlements, with significant consequences, especially regarding public health. In this chapter, we discuss the urban water cycle and water consumption, the challenges facing urban water management in developing countries including climate change, the concept of integrated water resources management, and the framework for integrated urban water management in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, including the salient socioeconomic and environmental stresses and trends that will drive and condition water supply and demands over the coming decades. It is concluded that approaches for advanced international and intersectoral cooperation and for identifying and strengthening intellectual and technical resources, tools, lessons, and best practices should be shared, applied, or adapted across the region. Finally, recommendations are made for improved management of water resources in MENA countries.

TI The Effect of Exchange Rate Volatility on International Trade and
   Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Developing Countries along "One Belt
   and One Road"
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB The "One Belt and One Road" (OBOR) project was started by the Chinese government with the aim of achieving sustainable economic development and increasing cooperation with other countries. This project has five major objectives, which include (i) increasing trade flow, (ii) encouraging policy coordination, (iii) improving connectivity, (iv) obtaining financial integration, and (v) fortifying closeness between people. This paper aims to analyze the effect of exchange rate volatility on international trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) in developing countries along "One Belt and One Road". We selected seven developing countries which are part of this project, namely Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. We collected panel data for the period 1995 to 2016 from the U.S. Heritage Foundation, International Financial Statistics (IFS) (a database developed by the International Monetary Fund), and World Development Indicators (WDI) (a database developed by the World Bank). We applied Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) (1,1) and threshold-Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (TGARCH) (1,1) models to measure the exchange rate volatility. Furthermore, we employed a fixed effect model to analyze the relationship of exchange rate volatility with international trade and FDI. The results of this paper revealed that exchange rate volatility affects both international trade and FDI significantly but negatively in OBOR-related countries, which correlates with the economic theory arguing that exchange rate volatility may hurt international trade and FDI. It can be concluded that exchange rate volatility can adversely affect international trade and FDI inflows in OBOR-related countries.

TI Direct risk factors and cost performance of road projects in developing
   countries Contractors' perspective
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Purpose
   Globally, road projects are notorious for riskiness, which often results in cost overruns. In developing countries, these risks are amplified by economic instabilities and institutional failures. Majority of road projects in these countries are awarded to notedly inept indigenous contractors. Currently, research on the relationship between risks and cost performance of road projects has predominantly focussed on the client's perspective. Effects of risks on contractors' cost performance (profit) are inadequately investigated in literature. The purpose of this paper is to determine the relationship between direct risks and cost performance of road projects by indigenous contractors of developing countries from the contractors' perspective.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The multivariate structural equation modelling technique was used to analyse purposively obtained data from indigenous contractors that recently completed road projects in Nigeria.
   Findings
   It was observed that a significant positive relationship exists between the aggregate project risk, i.e. project risk index of cost (PRIC) and cost performance of the projects. Significant positive relationships were also found to exist between identified cost risk centres and PRIC and between risk factors and cost risk centres. The risk centre site environment and location contributes the most to PRIC.
   Research limitations/implications - Indigenous contractors of developing countries are to analyse the identified risk factors and centres prior to bidding for road projects and carefully manage them during project execution.
   Originality/value
   Future studies of risks in road project should aim to obtain project risk indices of costs for the projects.

TI Valuing cultural heritage in developing countries: comparing and pooling
   contingent valuation and choice modelling estimates
SO ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB A substantial part of the United Nation's World Heritage Sites (WHSs) can be found in developing countries, but many of them are in a bad state. Thus, there is a need to document the social benefits of these global goods in order to justify the costs of restoration and preservation programmes (RPPs). This study adds to the scarce literature on economic benefits of WHSs in developing countries, and reduces the need to perform very uncertain benefit transfers from European or US valuation studies. We apply Contingent Valuation (CV) and Choice Modelling (CM) to estimate the social benefits of RPPs for the My Son world cultural heritage site in Vietnam; both to foreign visitors and the local residents. We then compare the estimates from the CV and CM methods, and pool the results from the two methods. The results show that both CV and CM are suited to estimating the economic benefits of preserving cultural heritage of My Son. The two methods produce very similar results, which can be interpreted as a test of convergence validity. The pooling results give evidence to show that the CV and CM models have the same underlying preference structures. Thus, these valuation models can be successfully used in cost-benefit analyses to assess the benefits to cultural heritage of measures to reduce air pollution, soil erosion, climate change and other causes to deterioration of cultural heritage sites.

TI The influence and impact of livelihood capitals on livelihood
   diversification strategies in developing countries: a systematic
   literature review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Livelihood diversification is an essential strategy for managing economic and environmental shocks and reducing rural poverty in developing countries. This article presents a comprehensive two-part literature review on livelihood capital and livelihood diversification strategies. Firstly, it identifies the role of livelihood capital in determining livelihood diversification strategies, and secondly, it assesses the role of livelihood diversification strategies in reducing rural poverty in developing countries. Evidence suggests that human, natural, and financial capitals are the primary determining assets of livelihood diversification strategies. However, the role of social and physical capital with livelihood diversification has not widely been studied. Education, farming experience, family size, land holding size, access to formal credit, access to market, and membership in village organizations were the major influencing factors in the adoption process of livelihood diversification strategies. The contribution of livelihood diversification in poverty reduction (SDG-1) was realized through improved food security and nutrition, increased income level, sustainability of crop production, and mitigating climatic vulnerabilities. This study suggests enhanced livelihood diversification through improved access to and availability of livelihood assets is vital in reducing rural poverty in developing countries.

TI Knowledge transfer for sustainable development: East-West collaboration?
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss the potential impact that collaboration between East and West could have on sustainable development. Greater emphasis in this paper will be placed on the benefit that developing countries gain from building collaborative relations with the West. Obtaining access to knowledge and technology will enable developing countries to speed up the process of socio-economic transformation and sustain development. Developing countries can leapfrog by making use of the existing knowledge in the West.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper provides descriptive assessment of the relationship between East and West to foster growth and sustain development. The paper uses newly developed ideas to build capacity for knowledge transfer to create linkages and accelerate the process of economic growth. The approach to knowledge-based development requires the creation of an enabling environment driven by skills, innovation, institutions and ICT.
   Findings - The paper suggests that knowledge transfer enables developing countries to sustain development. Access to global/western knowledge allows developing countries to diversify their economic structure and increase productivity. Technological learning and knowledge absorption permit these countries to leapfrog by surpassing several stages in their development.
   Practical implications - Information in this paper provides insight into the merits of the new economy and the potential benefits that developing countries can obtain from participating in the global economy. Indigenous knowledge and local innovation are important for local development, which can be enhanced through technology transfer and knowledge dissemination.
   Originality/value - Unlike traditional economic theories in which capital and labor provide the main inputs in production, this paper discusses a new approach to development where knowledge, skills and innovation represent the main forces behind growth. The paper explores new ideas to generate linkage and sustain development.

TI THE KYOTO PROTOCOL: PROPERTY RIGHTS AND EFFICIENCY OF MARKETS
SO INSTITUTIONS, SUSTAINABILITY, AND NATURAL RESOURCES: INSTITUTIONS FOR
   SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT
SE Sustainability Economics and Natural Resources
AB The origin of today's global environmental problems is the historic difference in property rights regimes between industrial and developing countries, the North and the South. In industrial countries resources such as forests and oil deposits are often under well defined and enforceable property rights, mostly private property regimes. In developing countries they are generally under ill-defined and weakly enforced property rights, mostly community or state property regimes but de-facto open-access regimes. Ill-defined and weakly enforced property rights lead to the over-extraction of natural resources in the South. They are exported at low prices to the North that over-consumes them. The international market amplifies the tragedy of the commons, leading to inferior solutions for the world economy. In developing countries, the conversion of natural resources regimes from community or state property regimes or common access to private property regimes faces formidable opposition due to international economic interests, or to heavy dependence of local and poor people on these resources. The weakness of property rights in inputs to production, such as timber and oil, could be compensated by assigning well defined and enforceable property rights to products or outputs. The 1997 Kyoto Protocol provides an example as it limits countries' rights to emit carbon, a by - product of burning fossil fuels, but the atmosphere's carbon concentration is a public good, which makes trading tricky. Similarly, trading rights to forests' carbon sequestration services involve public goods. Markets that trade public goods require a measure of equity to ensure efficiency, a requirement different than the markets for private goods

TI Impacts of urbanization on urban structures and energy demand: What can
   we learn for urban energy planning and urbanization management?
SO SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB Since 2007, for the first time in human history, more than half of the world's population has been living in cities. The urbanization process is a key phenomenon of economic development, and leads to a significant concentration of human resources, economic activities, and resource consumption in cities. Although covering only about 2% of the earth's surface, cities are responsible for about 75% of the world's consumption of resources. This trend will intensify over the next decades as a consequence of high urbanization rates in Africa and, even more importantly, in Asia. In order to estimate the impact of urbanization on energy demand, we have to identify the different processes and mechanisms of urbanization that substantially affect urban structures as well as human behavior. Taking a closer look at city-related production, mobility and transport, infrastructure and urban density, as well as private households, we find that various mechanisms of urbanization within the different sectors of the economy lead to a substantial increase in urban energy demand and to a change in the fuel mix. The relevance of these mechanisms differs considerably between developed and developing countries as well as within the group of developing countries. Over the next decades, cities and especially newly emerging megacities in developing countries will play a key role concerning the development and distribution of global energy demand. Hence, urban energy planning and urbanization management will be pivotal for creating the right framework conditions for a sustainable energy future. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Research priorities for tobacco control in developing countries: a
   regional approach to a global consultative process
SO TOBACCO CONTROL
AB Objective-To develop regional tobacco control research agendas for developing countries through a consultative process.
   Methods-Research for International Tobacco Control, located at the International Development Research Centre in Ottawa, Canada, convened three regional meetings for Latin America and the Caribbean, South and Southeast Asia, and Eastern, Central and Southern Africa. Participation by researchers, policymakers, and advocates from a wide range of disciplines ensured an accurate representation of regional issues.
   Results-The four main recurring themes within each regional agenda were: (1) the lack of standardised and comparable data; (2) the absence of a network for communication of information, data, and best practices; (3) a lack of adequate capacity for tobacco control research, especially in non-health related areas such as economics and policy analysis; and (4) a need for concerted mobilisation of human and financial resources in order to implement a comprehensive research agenda, build partnerships, and stimulate comparative research and analysis. Specific research issues included the need for descriptive data with respect to the supply side of the tobacco equation, and analytical data related to tobacco use, production and marketing, and taxation.
   Conclusions-There was a uniform perception of tobacco as a multidisciplinary issue. All regional agendas included a balance of health, economic, agricultural, environmental, sociocultural, and international trade concerns. Research data are urgently required to provide a sound basis for the development of tobacco control policies and programmes. As tobacco control takes its rightful place on the global health agenda, it is vital that funding for tobacco control research be increased.

SO GEOMATIC SOLUTIONS FOR COASTAL ENVIRONMENTS
SE Environmental Science Engineering and Technology
AB Despite leadership of developed country in Geographical Information System field and Integrated Zone Coastal Management field, ICZM and GIS together have been compared to a puzzle. This involves questioning on capacity to put together such ICZM and GIS in developing country. We focus on four of such developing countries (Mauritania, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau and Morocco) to highlight difficulties to understand and to manage coastal area with the use of geographical information system. Sustainable management of coastal areas is critical to the long-term health, safety and welfare of many african communities of these (and other) countries. Despite their importance, coastal zones are being modified or reclaimed, often driven by economic and financial motives. Coastal management offers the opportunity to illustrate the use of GIS and related spatial information technologies not only on coastal issues, but in the broader arena of land use planning. Initiative of coastal area management in the African countries has been reviewed in a number of relatively recent papers. The aim of this contribution is to review, synthesize and analyse experiences on coastal management along coasts of Mauritania, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau and Morocco. This allows us to rank these countries from country with a huge lack of geographical information and too broad view of coastal management to country with a lead in GIS technology coupled with a good approach of ICZM. The place of developed countries in this rank is also taken into account.

TI R&D AND INNOVATION: COMPETITION IS GROWING
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
AB The article is devoted to the study of changes in the trends of global economic development and growth associated with the increasing role of developing countries in research and development (R&D). Currently, developing countries and whole industries, especially in China, India and other developing nations, are moving from catching-up phase to the advanced development, as they have already developed own extensive R&D landscape, created patent reserves, successfully implemented state policies stimulating national high-tech sectors, attracted international capital. There is an ongoing competition between various technologies and countries, industries and companies, universities and startups. All this represents an expanding basis for further global innovation growth. It is shown that the development of knowledge-intensive sectors in the world economy is largely determined by the activities of private companies, consistently increasing its R&D expenditures. The current phase of global innovative development is characterized as of intensified global competition for technology, highly qualified personnel and growing investment in knowledge-intensive sectors. As a result, the path of catching-up development, which was followed by developing countries at the beginning of the XXI century, is replaced by a stage of direct competition and attempts to enter the path of advanced development. The leading role in this struggle is played by private companies. The article emphasizes the importance of R&D in the private sector and the role of the stock market in ensuring sustainable scientific, technological and innovative development on the global scale.

TI Promoting sustainability through corporate social responsibility
   implementation in the manufacturing industry: An empirical analysis of
   barriers using the ISM-MICMAC approach
SO CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a useful instrument to promote sustainability in organizations by focusing on their social, economic, and environmental aspects. Despite the growing adoption of CSR in the developed countries, it is at an initial stage of adoption in developing countries owing to the challenges faced by organizations. This study empirically identified the barriers to CSR adoption in a developing country context by taking the Pakistani manufacturing industry as a case. A novel framework was developed to analyze the obstacles by integrating the Delphi method (DM), interpretive structural modeling (ISM), and MICMAC. Initially, CSR obstacles were identified from previous literature; these were later filtered by using the DM. Furthermore, the data collected from experts and the results obtained through the application of ISM and MICMAC indicate that the "lack of resources, " "lack of regulations and standards, " and "lack of policy incentives" are the most critical barriers impeding CSR implementation in the Pakistani manufacturing industry. "Lack of concern for reputation" and "customers do not care about CSR" emerged as the least essential barriers to CSR adoption. The government, as the primary stakeholder and implementing agency, can act as the moderator to overcome these barriers and take initiatives for the effective adoption of CSR. This study would support manufacturing industry managers' effort to understand the main obstacles to CSR adoption and develop an effective implementation policy for CSR adoption.

TI Strategic issues in preventing cataract blindness in developing
   countries
SO BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
AB Cataract blindness is a public health problem of major proportions in developing countries. intracapsular cataract extraction with aphakic spectacles has been the standard surgical technique for restoring sight. Because of image magnification in the operated eye, however, the result in unilaterally blind patients is less than satisfactory. Fortunately, with the availability of low-cost intraocular lenses (IOL) and ophthalmologists trained in extracapsular surgery, it is now practical to intervene successfully in the unilateral case.
   The need for increased attention on the quality of the visual outcome is only one of three important strategic issues in cataract blindness control. The existing high prevalence of cataract blindness in developing countries and an increasing cataract incidence due to an aging population require substantial increases in surgical volume. The third issue relates to cost. If significant increases in surgical volume and quality of outcomes are to be realized without an increased need for external funding, service delivery must be made more efficient. The expansion of IOL surgery for unilateral blindness is a favourable trend in ensuring financial sustainability of delivery systems; patients can be operated on while still economically productive and able to pay rather than waiting for bilateral blindness and a less favourable economic and social impact. If the quality, volume, and cost issues are to be successfully addressed, operational and structural changes to eye care delivery systems are necessary. These changes can be effected through training technology introduction, management of facilities, social marketing, organizational partnerships, and evaluation. With improved understanding of the critical factors in successful models their widespread replication will be facilitated.

TI Perspectives on climate change and adaptation funding in developing
   countries
SO TD-THE JOURNAL FOR TRANSDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH IN SOUTHERN AFRICA
AB Most studies concur that climate change could seriously affect the sustainability and well-being of developing countries as they depend directly on climate-sensitive natural resources for their livelihood endeavours. This could primarily occur through reduced agricultural productivity, a higher incidence of diseases, the displacement of people, loss of livelihood and food price increases, all of which could contribute to food insecurity, malnourishment and escalating poverty. Although developing countries have contributed the least to Green house Gas (GHG) emissions, they stand to lose the most and it is likely that many of the development gains that have been made thus far will be reversed. To ensure that poverty reduction and economic growth do not become elusive goals for developing countries, it will be necessary to provide funds for potential adaptation measures to prevent these countries slipping further down the Human Development Index (HDI) ranking. In this paper, we will use Africa as a reference and look at the funds required for adaptation, the possible sources of funds and the conflict that may occur in prioritizing development objectives.

In these most recent years projects of contemporary architecture, particularly in developing countries, have destroyed the urban scenario of sites which are on the list of the World's Cultural Heritage. The Kathmandu Valley World Heritage Site, which represents an unparalleled example of artistic flowering in the Himalayan region, has been threatened by a continual economic development and by a great increase in population and hence a progressive loss of its "cultural heritage" and hence of its value. From this case arises the need for new methods of integration of contemporary architecture within the historical context and effective and sustainable strategies for safeguarding the oldest areas of the developing countries.

TI What are the most common conditions in primary care?
SO CANADIAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN
AB Objective To identify the most commonly presenting conditions in primary care globally, and to compare common reasons for visits (RFVs) as reported by clinicians and patients, as well as among countries of different economic classifications.
   Data sources Twelve scientific databases were searched up to January 2016, and a dual independent review was performed to select primary care studies.
   Study selection Studies were included if they contained 20 000 visits or more (or equivalent volume by patient-clinician interactions) and listed 10 or more RFVs. Dual independent data extraction of study characteristics and RFV rankings was performed. Data analysis was descriptive, with pooled rankings of RFVs across studies.
   Synthesis Eighteen studies met inclusion criteria (median 250 000 patients or 83 161 visits). Data were from 12 countries across 5 continents. The 10 most common clinician-reported RFVs were upper respiratory tract infection, hypertension, routine health maintenance, arthritis, diabetes, depression or anxiety, pneumonia, acute otitis media, back pain, and dermatitis. The 10 most common patient-reported RFVs were symptomatic conditions including cough, back pain, abdominal symptoms, pharyngitis, dermatitis, fever, headache, leg symptoms, unspecified respiratory concerns, and fatigue. Globally, upper respiratory tract infection and hypertension were the most common clinician-reported RFVs. In developed countries the next most common RFVs were depression or anxiety and back pain, and in developing countries they were pneumonia and tuberculosis. There was a paucity of available data, particularly from developing countries.
   Conclusion There are differences between clinician-reported and patientreported RFVs to primary care, as well as between developed and developing countries. The results of our review are useful for the development of primary care guidelines, the allocation of resources, and the design of training programs and curricula.

TI A systematic mapping protocol: what are the impacts of different
   upstream business models in the agriculture and forestry sector on
   sustainable development in tropical developing countries?
SO ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE
AB Background: As a result of rising global food and energy insecurity, investors are increasingly seeking new opportunities in tropical developing countries endowed with comparatively cheap and abundant land resources. Predominantly targeting the agriculture and forestry sectors, these investments could make valuable contributions to the economies of developing countries. However, with most investors opting for plantation-oriented business models, in the context of weak governance regimes within many host countries, many fear that these investments may instead exacerbate socio-economic vulnerabilities and processes of environmental degradation. Therefore, there is a need to explore alternative upstream business models that are more inclusive of the poor and are more aligned with emergent green growth objectives. This systematic map aims to contribute to this debate by cataloging empirical studies conducted on the sustainability of different upstream business models in the agriculture and forestry sector (e.g. involving the cultivation of raw materials). The mapping will offer an overview of the type and quantity of research conducted to date, remaining knowledge gaps, and areas warranting a systematic review.
   Methods: Searches will be conducted of both academic and grey literature by employing search strings that have been iteratively tested for comprehensiveness. Studies retrieved in the searches will be screened using pre-defined inclusion criteria and coded across a broad range of study characteristics. Inclusion criteria include, for example, type of business model employed, social, economic, and environmental impacts, and study design (e.g. generation of new empirical evidence). The outputs will be a database of included search results and a systematic map offering descriptive statistics and narrative assessment of the state of the evidence base in this topic.

In order to determine possibilities, problems, perspectives, and threats to overcoming the gap by developing countries, the authors use the SWOT-analysis method. For studying the global economy's economic development disproportions, this research uses specially developed proprietary analysis of gap depth in economic development.
   As a result of the analysis, the authors determined that the level of economic development of the most developed countries exceeds the level of developing countries by more than four times. This reflects a huge gap depth and a high level of differentiation for countries in the global economy.
   The authors conclude that barriers of unification of economic systems in the global economy are primarily related to socio-political factors. Preconditions to reducing the difference in level of economic development for countries in the global economy are predetermined by the influence of globalization and international integration of economic systems.

TI Pathways of Technological Change in Developing Countries: Review and New
   Agenda
SO DEVELOPMENT POLICY REVIEW
AB This article argues the need for strategic reorientation with regard to the technological advancement of developing countries. The continued relevance of incremental capability- building strategies in manufacturing is questioned by: (i) the emergence of new knowledge areas, some of which require closer links with science; (ii) recognition that past strategies have not solved the poverty problem; and (iii) unprecedented environmental problems that cannot be solved by existing Western technologies alone. A more pluralist approach is recommended, with increased attention to creative innovation capabilities. Cases of innovations in information communication technology, health and energy show potentially large economic and social impacts, but also highlight systemic obstacles to their realisation.

TI Anti-Corruption Disclosure, Corporate Social Expenditure and Political
   Corporate Social Responsibility: Empirical Evidence from Bangladesh
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Corruption is a major concern globally, particularly in developing countries, such as Bangladesh, where it is the main obstacle to economic development. Corruption is also mentioned as the major impediment to accomplishing sustainable development. There is a dearth of studies on anti-corruption disclosure (ACD), political corporate social responsibility (PCSR), and cash holding in Bangladesh magnitude of this research. This study investigates different drivers and motivations of ACD practice of a less control of corruption country's firm-level observations. This study incorporates an institutional and legitimacy theoretical lens to explain anti-corruption disclosure practice. In order to draw the best picture of corruption disclosure, the study uses all financial sector companies listed on the Dhaka Stock Exchange. Therefore, the total firm-year observations are 245 from 2012-2016. The authors developed a diverse set of 97 keywords as content for ACD. The regression results show that CSR expenditures, political corporate social responsibility (PCSR), financial constraint, internationalization of reporting, and media visibility positively and significantly affect firm-level ACD. Furthermore, cash holdings show negative and significant relationships. The study provides new evidence on CSR expenditure, PCSR, cash holdings, and media visibility from a developing country's perspective. Therefore, the results suggest that policymakers and regulatory authorities can deal with ACD as a legitimization tool for society and stakeholders.

TI China's Network Strategy for Seeking Great Power Status
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICS
AB Existing scholarship on the rise of China and Chinese foreign policy has largely neglected to explain one puzzling phenomenon-although China's network position in the global economic system has become more similar to that of developed countries, China continues to set its foreign policy from the perspective of a developing country. By analysing the relationship between the environmental possibilities and China's intentional strategy, this article argues that the sharp contrast between China's positions in the international political and economic systems reflects China's 'network strategy of embedded rise'. There are two mechanisms that go in opposite directions and jointly determine China's foreign policy location in the international political spectrum. The first, called the 'structural alienation effect', is that wherein divergence in the centre-periphery positions in the global economic network increases the heterogeneity of two countries' preferences, attitudes, and incentives, and in turn weakens alignment of their foreign policies. However, this structural effect is moderated by the second mechanism, namely, the 'strategic affinity effect'. China's strategy of assuming the role of a 'broker' to connect developing countries at the periphery of the international political and economic networks with developed countries at the centre achieves high 'betweenness' centrality, and so increases its social capital and influence in international politics. This article tests the proposed theory of China's network strategy of embedded rise through hierarchical models that use global trade network centrality data and the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) votes of 161 developing countries from 1994 to 2012. Our findings show that the globalized world both constrains and enables China's great power status.

TI Mitigation of CO2 emissions from the road passenger transport sector in
   Bahrain
SO MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB There is much optimism that the 2015 Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention will yield an agreement on mitigation of climate change, to become effective in 2020. In this context, Bahrain represents a developing country with insufficient data to assess mitigation opportunities: its per capita carbon emissions rank among the world's highest, yet there has been no research on the reduction potential of its rapidly growing transport sector. We examine this reduction potential and the costs of various mitigation measures and, further, explore barriers and the view of policymakers and experts. Potential benefits of combined mitigation scenarios are also identified based on their acceptability. We adopt a modified participatory method to develop the scenarios, using the long-range energy alternative planning (LEAP) modelling system, and find that an integrated policy approach can deliver a 23 % reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, costing 108 United States dollars per avoided metric tonne, with politically acceptable scenarios. Better performance, however, would require less acceptable approaches. These findings are significant for decision-making in Bahrain and other Gulf Cooperation Council countries; national target preparation and the setting of fuel economy standards should be begun promptly. We offer lessons to other developing countries on the timely regulation of technical specifications and numbers of passenger vehicles. Participatory approaches to the assessment of mitigation measures can advance environmentally effective, economically feasible and politically acceptable scenarios. The global community can use these results to provide necessary technical and financial assistance to developing countries.

   Development Challenges in the Urban Context
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Building on prior research, this study investigates the effects of urban slum prevalence or proportion of the total population living in urban slum conditions on multiple macro-level health outcomes in developing nations. Results of two-way fixed effects panel analyses of 43 countries for the 1990-2007 period indicate that infant and under-five mortality rates are positively associated with urban slum prevalence, while average life expectancy for both women and men exhibits a negative association. These findings are statistically significant, net of various other factors including overall urbanization, economic development, fertility rates and HIV prevalence. Overall, the results highlight the importance of examining the upstream' effects of the built urban environment on human health in the developing countries and the challenges confronting the sustainable development of human societies.

TI Biofortification of Staple Crops to Alleviate Human Malnutrition:
   Contributions and Potential in Developing Countries
SO AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB Micronutrient malnutrition is a global health challenge affecting almost half of the global population, causing poor physical and mental development of children and a wide range of illnesses. It is most prevalent in young girls, women, and pre-school children who are suffering particularly from the low consumption of vitamins and micronutrients. Given this global challenge, biofortification has proven to be a promising and economical approach to increase the concentration of essential micronutrients in edible portions of staple crops. Produce quality and micronutrient content can be further enhanced with the use of micronutrient fertilizers. Especially developing countries with a high percentage of malnourished populations are attracted to this integrated biofortification, combining modern agronomic interventions and genetic improvement of food crops. Consequently, maize, rice, wheat, beans, pearl millet, sweet potato, and cassava have all been biofortified with increased concentrations of Fe, Zn, or provitamin A in various developing countries. Today, there are several large-scale success stories in Africa and Asia that support the research and development of biofortified crops. In this review, we summarized what has been achieved to date and how edible crops can be further improved by integrating agronomic and genetic strategies to upgrade the nutritional status of children and adults around the world.

TI Improving urban household solid waste management in developing countries
   based on the German experience
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Countries worldwide strive to improve their urban household solid waste management (UHSWM) practices. While developed countries like Germany have achieved good results with different UHSWM initiatives, developing countries still struggle to be effective with their waste management (WM) policies. With an interest in learning from the German experience, this paper provides a cross-case analysis between a German and a Brazilian city that can be of practical relevance to improving UHSWM in developing countries. The paper uses "process flow diagram" (PFD) and "wasteaware benchmark indicators" for integrated sustainable waste management (ISWM). Both methods confirmed the German city as a benchmark and attested the inefficiency of the Brazilian UHSWM. The total maximum score weightage percentage of the matrix quantification difference was significant, 98% against 50%. Findings highlight viable solutions based on the three pillars of the German solid WM system: clear laws, regular public campaigns, and fee methodology. The formalization and improvement of Brazilian UHSWM require better governance to obtain additional investments. Herein, the application of the Green Dot methodology, sponsored by industry and consumers in Germany, would enable an increase of up to 318% of the values received by a typical Brazilian cooperative. This additional investment can empower a sustainable solution where the population could opt to work with recycling, either as a formal employee or as a formal entrepreneur, shedding more light on the social pillar of the triple bottom line. Moreover, it can enable improvements in technologies, and on regular public campaigns to increase education in important sustainable matters. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Re-thinking breast and cervical cancer preventive campaigns in
   developing countries: the case for interventions at high schools
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB BackgroundThe negative impact of cervical and breast cancers in low and lower-middle income countries are worsening, and, along with other non-communicable diseases, occur disproportionately in these resource-limited economies. Most preventive approaches to these cancers require government funding, but few countries with the most at-risk population can afford government-sponsored universal vaccination, screening, diagnostic and treatment programmes, which, along with socioeconomic issues, contribute to the poor outcomes in these mostly developing countries. An urgent need exists, therefore, to find an effective, affordable, cost-effective, culturally-acceptable and sustainable way of reducing these cancers. This paper advocates a re-thinking in the current preventive campaigns.Main bodyUsing evidence provided by recently-published papers, a case is made for enlightenment campaigns to primarily target teenagers (boys and girls) in high schools of developing countries. Inclusions into the schools' academic curricula are the recommended approach, given that both cancers take hold on populations within that age bracket.This approach, if adopted, may be the only accessible, affordable and realistic approach that gives millions of women in low and lower-middle income countries the chance at survival. Empowering them early instils the self-awareness and confidence necessary for young adults to take charge of their own health. The acquired knowledge, in turn, helps them adopt positive attitudes and preventive behaviours that will, ultimately, prolong their lives.ConclusionThe recommended approach offers governments and concerned stakeholders an evidence-based option that allows them to deliver cost-effective and sustainable life-saving interventions, while hoping to get around the bottlenecks that limit the large scale implementation of other effective but capital-intensive strategies.

TI What, if anything at all, do African societies themselves owe to their
   own citizens in terms of health?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH
AB The debate about global justice and health has focused so far on what developed countries owe to developing countries to advance global public health. Less attention has however been paid to the health obligations of developing countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, towards their own people and how this may affect considerations about justice and health in a globalized world. This paper challenges the implicit presumption in global justice theories that African societies, because they are poor, have weaker health obligations toward their own peoples. It makes two main claims. First, despite their economic shortcomings, African governments should have the primary responsibility to protect the domestic side of the human right to health of their own citizens and dumping their own health obligations on rich countries is a disservice to the overall goal of global justice in health. Second, the health obligations of African societies towards their own people should be assessed and grounded also on their potential abilities, and not exclusively on their current abilities. Global justice in health cannot be reduced to what rich countries should do. It must include also what developing countries from Sub-Saharan Africa should do beyond accepting or managing any health assistance.

TI Political economy of bioenergy transitions in developing countries: A
   case study of Punjab, India
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB Occupying an important place in the sustainable development discourse, bioenergy was widely touted as the 'fuel of the future' at the beginning of the 21st century. However, in recent years, many adverse impacts of commercial bioenergy projects have come to the forefront. These include limited ecological benefits, heightened food insecurity across many developing countries as well as exploitation of local residents by bioenergy producers. There remains a dearth of empirical evidence devoted to investigating bioenergy's potential as a sustainable energy alternative in developing countries.
   It is against this background that our paper is aimed at making two contributions: one, to' provide a ground level empirical data on bioenergy initiatives in the Indian Punjab region and, two, to examine the theoretical contribution of eco-socialist perspective to assess the sustainability potentials of bioenergy in developing economies. The eco-socialist perspective treats environmental degradation as a 'systemic issue' and considers the power and class structures in capitalism as the central explanatory parameters in explaining the process of environmental degradation. As a part of the transition from capitalism to eco-socialism, the eco-socialists advocate for a participatory approach to environmental decision making to ensure that ecological justice emerges as the central parameter of sustainable development.
   The theoretical framing of the case study research on bioenergy projects in the region of Punjab, India was informed by the eco-socialist vision. The case study employed a 'multiple stakeholder' approach to explore the opportunities and contestations surrounding bioenergy projects in Punjab. Identifying key flaws as well as the promises of bioenergy in Punjab that were investigated, our research revealed that in order to be a sustainable energy alternative that meets the objective of ecological and social justice, bioenergy policies need to address the needs of local communities and be cognizant of the inherent socio-economic embeddedness of these initiatives.

TI The relationship between entrepreneurial cognitions and sustainability
   orientation: the case of an emerging market
SO JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the cognitive drivers that push entrepreneurs toward sustainable venture creation using entrepreneurial cognitive scripts. In particular, this study tests the relationship between entrepreneurial cognitive scripts and sustainability orientation among entrepreneurs in an emerging economy to understand whether entrepreneurial cognitive scripts act as a driver toward sustainability.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A primary research study was conducted using a structured questionnaire among 351 sample respondents, of which 54% labeled themselves as entrepreneurs and 46% labeled themselves as traditional business people, business students or non-entrepreneurs. The entrepreneurs represented more than ten different industries such as agriculture, food and beverage, education, technology and entertainment.
   Findings
   The findings of this study highlighted a negative relationship between entrepreneurial cognitions and sustainability orientation as hypothesized. Additionally, non-entrepreneurs were found to be more sustainability-oriented, whereas entrepreneurs with high levels of cognitive scripts were found less concerned about sustainability issues.
   Research limitations/implications
   This study has a geographic limitation as it has been conducted in a developing country, which is Egypt. Accordingly, the results should be generalized with caution to other developing nations.
   Practical implications
   This study shows the importance of sustainable entrepreneurship education as an important part of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. The study sheds the light on the different stakeholders that are responsible for raising awareness about the importance of sustainability in developing countries.
   Originality/value
   This study empirically validates the relationship between entrepreneurial cognitive scripts and sustainability orientation among several industries in a developing country. The study has also a novel contribution in validating that non-entrepreneurs can enjoy entrepreneurial cognitive scripts without the necessity of starting their ventures.

TI The impact of economic, political and social globalization on overweight
   and obesity in the 56 low and middle income countries
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB Anecdotal and descriptive evidence has led to the claim that globalization plays a major role in inducing overweight and obesity in developing countries, but robust quantitative evidence is scarce. We undertook extensive econometric analyses of several datasets, using a series of new proxies for different dimensions of globalization potentially affecting overweight in up to 887,000 women aged 15-49 living in 56 countries between 1991 and 2009. After controlling for relevant individual and country level factors, globalization as a whole is substantially and significantly associated with an increase in the individual propensity to be overweight among women. Surprisingly, political and social globalization dominate the influence of the economic dimension. Hence, more consideration needs to be given to the forms of governance required to shape a more health-oriented globalization process. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Nexus between green financing, renewable energy generation, and energy
   efficiency: empirical insights through DEA technique
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB The study aims to test the nexus of green financing with renewable electricity generation and energy efficiency. The study used data envelopment analysis (DEA) technique during the year of 2016 to 2020 in developed and developing countries. The findings show that there is a 24% possibility of worldwide rise in expenditures in renewable energy through energy efficiency projects and probably could fall around 17% much further in 2017 and 2018. This may jeopardize the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris climate change agreement. Lack of access to private financing slows the development of green initiatives. Now that sustainable energy is not about science and technology, it is all about getting financing in developed and developing countries. As policy measure, the study suggested to value environmental initiatives, like other infrastructure initiatives, for greater electricity generation and energy efficiency in developed and developing countries. Such infrastructural projects need long-term financing and capital intensiveness. It is further suggested to sustain growth, development, and energy poverty reduction, and around $26 trillion would be required, in terms of green financing, in the developed and developing countries alone by the year 2030 to enhance energy efficiency. To achieve energy sustainability goals in developed and developing countries, recent research suggested some policy implication considering the post COVID-19 time. If such policy implications are implemented successfully, there are chances that green financing would make energy generation and energy efficiency effective.

AB Purpose: To raise the awareness of policy makers, economic development practitioners, and service providers about the importance of making information and communication technology (ICT) based international economic development in low-and middle-income countries inclusive of people with disabilities and to discuss the role and importance of addressing the complete ICT and assistive technology (AT) ecosystem to ensure sustainable, scalable, and affordable access to ICTs and ICT-based programs. Method: This commentary piece draws upon recent literature and practice cases to examine the role of accessible ICTs in international development. Results: Accessible ICTs can enhance economic participation and prevent exclusion from participation in international development programs. Access to and use of accessible technologies are largely determined by the ecosystem in which they exist and can be enhanced or hindered by government policy and legislation and the quality of the service delivery systems and financing mechanisms. Conclusions: People with disabilities in developing countries face daunting barriers to socioeconomic participation. Accessible ICTs can eliminate or mitigate some of these barriers. However, technology advancements do not solely promote penetration, affordability, or scalability of ICT-based development for persons with disabilities. A comprehensive ecosystem approach can help in developing sustainable mechanisms for access, affordability, and availability.

TI A Preliminary Analysis of the Perception Gap between Employers and
   Vocational Students for Career Sustainability
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB (1) Background: Nowadays, technological advancement plays a key role in the economic uplift of developing countries, and it is paramount that the youth of these countries are well-equipped with both vocational and technical skills to bring about sustainability in their careers. (2) Methods: The present study aims to investigate the perception gap between vocational students and industrial employers with regard to employability skills. In this regard, data were collected from 683 vocational students from urban/rural areas studying in the public/private vocational institutions of a developing country. Similarly, 82 vocational employers were contacted about their perception of employability skills. A questionnaire comprising 20 questions was administered online to both students and employers for registering their responses. Data were analyzed with the help of descriptive statistics, interval plots, and an Ishikawa diagram. (3) Results: The findings reveal that vocational employers give maximum importance to interpersonal, technical, and entrepreneurial skills, while students perceive that their technical and computing skills are vital for sustainable careers. Similarly, the rural/public students showed minimum levels of competency in these skills as compared with their counterparts living in rural areas and studying in the private institutions. Furthermore, structured interviews were conducted with the concerned stakeholders to develop a remedial framework for the sustainable careers of these vocational students. (4) Conclusions: The results of the study not only bring sustainability to the vocational sector of developing countries, but to all those countries enjoying similar socioeconomic backgrounds.

TI The challenges and opportunities of conducting a clinical trial in a low
   resource setting: The case of the Cameroon mobile phone SMS (CAMPS)
   trial, an investigator initiated trial
SO TRIALS
AB Conducting clinical trials in developing countries often presents significant ethical, organisational, cultural and infrastructural challenges to researchers, pharmaceutical companies, sponsors and regulatory bodies. Globally, these regions are under-represented in research, yet this population stands to gain more from research in these settings as the burdens on health are greater than those in developed resourceful countries. However, developing countries also offer an attractive setting for clinical trials because they often have larger treatment naive populations with higher incidence rates of disease and more advanced stages. These factors can present a reduction in costs and time required to recruit patients. So, balance needs to be found where research can be encouraged and supported in order to bring maximum public health benefits to these communities. The difficulties with such trials arise from problems with obtaining valid informed consent, ethical compensation mechanisms for extremely poor populations, poor health infrastructure and considerable socio-economic and cultural divides. Ethical concerns with trials in developing countries have received attention, even though many other non-ethical issues may arise. Local investigator initiated trials also face a variety of difficulties that have not been adequately reported in literature. This paper uses the example of the Cameroon Mobile Phone SMS trial to describe in detail, the specific difficulties encountered in an investigator-initiated trial in a developing country. It highlights administrative, ethical, financial and staff related issues, proposes solutions and gives a list of additional documentation to ease the organisational process.

TI Does trade matter for environmental degradation in developing countries?
   New evidence in the context of export product diversification
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Global warming is a serious problem facing the world today. To minimize it, scholars are trying to find the reasons behind increasing CO2 emissions. This study examines the effects of overall export product diversification, extensive margin, and intensive margin on CO2 emissions as indicators of environmental degradation in 84 developing countries for the period of 1971-2014 in the context of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis using three estimators, namely, autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test, dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS), and fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS). The empirical findings reveal that EKC hypothesis is valid. The overall empirical findings from various approaches show that overall diversification, extensive margin, and intensive margin have a positive and significant effect on CO2 emissions.

TI Indigenous Peoples and Climate Change
SO INTERNATIONAL INDIGENOUS POLICY JOURNAL
AB There has been a growing attention on the need to take into account the effects of global climate change. This is particularly so with respect to the increasing amount of green house gas emissions from the Untied States and Europe affecting poor peoples, especially those in developing countries. In 2003, for example, the experts of several international development agencies, including the World Bank, prepared a special report titled "Poverty and Climate Change: Reducing the Vulnerability of the Poor through Adaptation" (OECD 2003). This report followed the Eighth Session of the Conference of Parties (COP8) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in New Delhi, India in October 2002. It showed that poverty reduction is not only one of the major challenges of the 21st century, but also that climate change is taking place in many developing countries and is increasingly affecting, in a negative fashion, both the economic conditions and the health of poor people and their communities.

TI Combating tropical infectious diseases: Report of the disease control
   priorities in developing countries project
SO CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Infectious diseases are responsible for >25% of the global disease toll. The new Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries Project (DCPP) aims to decrease the burden of these diseases by producing science-based analyses from demographic, epidemiologic, disease intervention, and economic evidence for the purpose of defining disease priorities and implementing control measures. The DCPP recently reviewed selected tropical infectious diseases, examined successful control experiences, and defined unsettled patient treatment, prevention, and research issues. Disease elimination programs against American trypanosomiasis ( Chagas disease), onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, leprosy, trachoma, and measles are succeeding. Dengue, leishmaniasis, African trypanosomiasis, malaria, diarrheal diseases, helminthic infections, and tuberculosis have reemerged because of inadequate interventions and control strategies and the breakdown of health delivery systems. Application of technologies must be cost-effective and intensified research is essential if these and other scourges are to be controlled or eliminated in the 21st century.

TI Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): The Role of Government in
   promoting CSR
SO JOURNAL OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY
AB This paper examines corporate social responsibility (CSR) and the role government can play in promoting CSR. Corporations are an integral part of the large economy of any given society or country whereby these corporations operate. The government's role is critical in promoting CSR activities or agendas because CSR is voluntary without mandatory legislation. The method used in this paper is a normative literature review and secondary data procedures. The research results show the need for developed and developing countries to share CSR's best practices and build human institutions capable of enhancing CSR agendas by creating awareness, soft laws, partnering, and mandating business enterprises to be transparent in solving society's problems wherever they operate. Governments in some developed nations have taken a far-reaching agenda in promoting CSR, especially the UK, European Union, the USA, and other developing countries in East Asia. However, developing countries are lagging behind in developing CSR agendas but should not simply copy from developed countries but adopt CSR's agenda susceptive to their multiple nations' sustainable and equitable developments. The result also shows that the lack of good governance and transparency in abundant natural resources in developing countries in the south has led to corrupt elites diverting CSR activities funds for their self-interest and not their local communities. Some developing countries still see CSR as an act of philanthropy, not as means for sustainable and equitable development for economic growth, hence the lack of transparency surrounding CSR by the various government and their elites.

TI Enabling optimal energy options under the clean development mechanism
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB This paper addresses the cost effectiveness of renewable energy technologies in achieving low abatement costs and promoting sustainable developments under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). According to the results of our optimal energy option's analysis, at project scale, compared with a diesel-only energy option, photovoltaic (PV) - diesel (PVDB), wind-diesel (WDB) and PV - wind-diesel (PVWDB) hybrids are very cost-effective energy options. Moreover, energy options with high levels of renewable energy, including 100% renewables, have the lowest net present cost and they are already cost effective without CDM. On the other hand, while the removal of about 87% carbon dioxide emissions could be achieved at negative cost, initial investment could increase by a factor of 40, which is one of the primary barriers hindering wider renewable energy applications in developing countries, among others. Thus, in order to increase developing countries' participation in the carbon market, CDM policy should shift from a purely market-oriented approach to investigating how to facilitate renewable energy projects through barrier removal. Thus, we recommend that further research should focus on how to efficiently remove renewable energy implementation barriers as a means to improve developing countries' participation in meaningful emission reduction while at the same time meeting the needs of sustainable economic development.

TI The impact of natural resources on renewable energy consumption
SO RESOURCES POLICY
AB In this paper, we examine the relationship between natural resources and renewable energy consumption. We employ robust econometric modelling on a large sample of 162 developed and developing countries between 1990 and 2021. Consistent with expectation, we find a positive and significant association between natural resources and renewable energy consumption, suggesting that the extraction of natural resources promotes renewable energy consumption. Contrary to prior studies, we find that oil-producing countries have high renewable energy consumption. In cross-sectional analyses we found that relationship between natural resources and renewable energy consumption is stronger in developed countries than developing countries. Our results are robust to advanced econometric identification such as autoregressive fixed effect modelling and two-step system generalized method of movement. These findings extend the debate on the role of natural resources in the greening of economic recovery.

AB The global energy crisis coupled with the threats of climate change bring into sharp focus both opportunities and challenges for developing countries. Developed and developing countries have to better address the increasing energy demands of growing economies, as well as address energy poverty issues often highlighted by extreme disparities in income. They also need to deal with the real and potential impacts of climate change and energy efficiency improvement. In addition to these challenges is the global imperative to reduce carbon emissions in order to prevent climate change. While developing nations have thus far been sheltered from obligations to reduce carbon emissions, one cannot anticipate that this situation will continue for long. Holistic approach to energy performance in built environment had been a key tool to improve the overall energy performance. Within this context nations need to follow a very different development path from that established by first world countries. This development path is a low energy, low carbon and generally a resource efficient one.

TI Closing the energy divide in a climate-constrained world: A focus on the
   buildings sector
SO ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB Access to modern energy services in households is central to achieving decent living standards and wellbeing. Almost 3 billion people in Sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia still lack access to modern energy services and endure energy consumption rates equivalent to a fraction of that in developed countries. While critical for the successful achievement of several internationally agreed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), closing this energy divide may pose an additional pressure on the already daunting challenge of securing climate stabilization. The ways in which this divide is closed will significantly affect the development of buildings-related emissions. This paper revisits previous work on the potential conflict between efforts towards closing the energy divide and enabling the achievement of higher levels of human well-being, and those associated with climate stabilization. It estimates the additional energy needed to achieve the former in terms of final energy consumption levels in key regions, and the associated emission pathways under different climate action scenarios. It then analyses the impact that such pathways could have on estimated carbon budgets associated with fulfilling the Paris Agreement, and provides some suggestions on how this impact could be minimized in the buildings sector.

AB In information age, it is generally believed that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) plays an important role in socioeconomic development. ICT is capable of enhancing national competitiveness of industrialized countries, whereas, its impact on developing countries is far more controversial. This paper reviews China e-government initiatives and its development, and then carries out an interpretive study of Nanhai e-government case from sociological perspective. While applying theories such as social aspect of ICT, e-government, public administration, ICT and development, etc to practical research, the author finds out that in China context e-government has the potential to improve public performance, promote democracy, and lead the progress of ICT industry therefore the national economic growth, meanwhile, the author also reveals some serious problems of Nanhai e-government. Finally a conclusion is reached that developing countries, including China, should introduce and improve ICT application, and governments can be a key actor on the stage, not only apply ICT in public sector but also intervene ICT industry effectively, and noticeably the e-government implementation should always be in line with national and local agenda of comprehensive socioeconomic development, furthermore it is not necessary for developing countries to emulate western institutions, but find out the indigenous way for substantial and sustainable socioeconomic development.

TI Can Developing Countries Maintain Financial Stability after the Global
   Crisis? The Role of External Financial Shocks
SO PANOECONOMICUS
AB The recent global turmoil severely affected some developing economies. However, in general, these nations survived the crisis with less damage compared with advanced countries. The majority of developing countries did not experience a financial system collapse. What were the main factors behind their relatively better performance? We argue that the main reason was the relatively moderate financial account shocks, in terms of both magnitude and duration, experienced by developing economies during the global crisis. This was due to the fact that advanced countries could not fully serve their roles as safe havens during the recent global turmoil. Furthermore, developing countries enjoyed greater autonomy and legitimacy in implementing expansionary monetary and fiscal policies in an environment in which international cooperation partially met the need for an international lender of last resort. If the returns in advanced countries become more attractive, developing countries may face larger external financial shocks in future crises.

TI Emerging Economies of Southeast Asia: Achieving and increasing radical
   innovations through collaborating with buyers and suppliers by fostering
   trust: the Case of Viet Nam
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS MARKETING
AB Radical innovation in product and services have become more important for firms to gain competitive advantages and stay ahead in the competition. In the supply chain, more and more suppliers endeavour to collaborate with buyers in order to develop new products and services. Trust is believed as a determinant of successful collaboration for innovation. Therefore, the purpose of this research note is to investigate the relationship between suppliers' trust in buyers and supplier-buyer collaboration and how this relationship relates to radical innovation in the context of a developing country. This research note is based on a quantitative approach to analyse the data of 225 firms in Vietnam- as a developing country. The proposed model is tested with exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings show that suppliers' trust in buyers can facilitate information sharing, joint decision making, and benefit/risks sharing among them. Furthermore, our results indicate that collaboration between supplier and buyers in sharing information, joint decision-making process can result in radical innovation. The results also confirmed that supplier's trust in buyers can lead to radical innovation through information sharing and joint decision making. The findings of this study have an implications for developing the long-term relationship between suppliers and buyers and help firms to achieve radical innovation in emerging economies. By having trust in buyers, suppliers can save time and efforts in communicating with buyers. Also, managers can encourage buyers to take part in the creative process to develop new products and services and help firm to gain the sustainable competitive advantages. This study also contributes to the literature by providing a theoretical model of successful supply chain collaboration and radical innovation, which can be applied in the context of developing countries. This study investigates the role of supplier's trust in the supplier-buyer collaboration in the context of a developing country to achieve radical innovation. Our study emphasizes the role of trust in the implementation process of collaboration in which suppliers and buyers share information, risk, and benefit and jointly make decisions on developing new products and services.

AB Developing countries are becoming the factory of the world where sustainable production is still far from developed countries. However, the acceleration of the 4.0 revolution with a close connection with the Internet of Things (IoT) achievements has forced developing countries to integrate with the trend of a circular and sustainable economy. In this paper, the emerging digital technologies of Industry 4.0 which concentration on the contribution of IoT, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Big Data in remanufacturing are reviewed. Based on IoT, remanufacturing, circular economy, and smart manufacturing, this paper has made the assessment and discussed the challenges and barriers of the 4th industrial revolution to remanufacturing, as well as the amazing opportunities that IoT technologies can contribute to the growth of the remanufacturing industry in developing countries. A value-creation perspective consists of the product which is remanufactured, the equipment and processes of remanufacturing which are adopted and associated with troubles of organization, are used to identify trends and gaps. Suggestions from findings show that it is necessary to detect the combination between cyber-physical systems and the IoT architecture to assistant smart remanufacture, parallel with developing data and infrastructures of communication and circular economy management models. It is clear that, in order to successfully develop the remanufacturing industry, emerging economies need to fully utilize the achievements of IoT technology through economic development strategies and policies in line with Industry 4.0 to create breakthroughs in sustainable circular economy development.

TI Emerging Powers, Leadership, and South-South Solidarity: The Battle Over
   Special and Differential Treatment at the WTO
SO GLOBAL POLICY
AB Emerging powers, such as China and India, have used claims of developing world leadership and South-South solidarity to strengthen their bargaining position in WTO negotiations. Yet analysis of the growing battle over special and differential treatment (SDT) suggests that such claims are increasingly tenuous. The question of how emerging economic powers should be classified and treated under global trade rules has become an acute source of conflict in the trade regime. The emerging powers insist on access to SDT as an unconditional right of developing countries. But in a debate dominated by the emerging and established powers, the interests of most developing countries have been largely overlooked. Drawing on the cases of agriculture and fisheries - two areas of international trade of particular importance to the developing world - I show that extending SDT to the emerging powers is increasingly problematic for global development. In these areas, many emerging economies are now among the world's largest subsidizers, and the harmful effects of their policies are felt most keenly by other developing countries. Granting SDT to exempt emerging subsidizers from WTO disciplines would therefore undermine efforts to use global trade rules to promote global development, as well as to protect the environment.

TI Corporate social responsibility in the mining industry: an exploration
   of host-communities' perceptions and expectations in a
   developing-country
SO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS IN SOCIETY
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore how and what drives corporate social responsibility (CSR) in host communities of mining companies in developing countries.
   Design/methodology/approach To address this knowledge gap, this paper used Ghana as a test case and conducted 24 in-depth interviews with participants drawn from mining host communities.
   Findings The paper discovered that while CSR is broadly understood and encompasses six thematic categories in the mining host communities, there are emphases on philanthropic and environmental responsibilities. Contrary to the evidence found in other studies, this paper discovered that CSR rhetoric plays a more positive/significant role than so far explored in CSR research, as it incentivizes the host communities to push for the fulfilment of their CSR expectations and/or CSR initiatives proposed by mining companies.
   Research limitations/implications Quantitative studies are needed to strengthen the findings from the present paper.
   Practical implications Because developing countries share similar socio-economic and geo-political realities, the findings of this paper may be applicable not only for CSR advocates, but also for policy-makers in developing countries.
   Originality/value The paper provides new inputs from a developing country perspective to the current debate about the CSR performance of the extractive industry.

TI Realising the value of plant molecular pharming to benefit the poor in
   developing countries and emerging economies
SO PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Molecular Pharming, the production of recombinant pharmaceuticals through plant biotechnology, has the potential to transform the biologics sector of the pharmaceutical industry. More fascinating however, is how it might be used to improve access to modern medicines, and improve health of the poor in developing countries and emerging economies. Although improving global health through molecular pharming has been discussed for at least two decades, little progress has actually been made. In this manuscript, a four point plan is described to maximise the opportunity for molecular pharming to provide solutions. These are (i) to identify and prioritise important drug targets that are relevant to the poor; (ii) to support research and development partners in low to middle income countries to develop local expertise, transfer technology and build capacity; (iii) to increase collaboration between regulatory bodies to enable national regulatory frameworks to be developed in low to middle income countries; and (iv) to promote intellectual property management approaches that include socially responsible licensing. An existing case study is described to illustrate how this might be achieved.

TI Environmental consciousness and choice of bulb for lighting in a
   developing country
SO ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY
AB Background: Most countries in the world especially those in Asia and Africa have been undertaking policies meant to help promote science, technology and innovation towards meeting some provisions of the Sustainable Development Goals. However, there is still a sizable number of households who have not yet fully embraced energy-saving technologies. This study provides highlights on the economic and environmental benefits for investing in energy-saving light bulbs.
   Methods: Using a survey and a multistage random sampling approach, we administered questionnaires to 1650 households in Ghana. The relevant diagnostic tests associated with cross-sectional data were undertaken. We estimated a maximum-likelihood probit model with its associated marginal effects to find out how the choice of energy-saving light bulb (behaviour) is influenced by environmental consciousness (both local knowledge and global knowledge) and other demographic factors.
   Results: Our results are consistent with economic theory as well as what earlier empirical evidence found in literature. That is, environmental consciousness, education, income, etc. are very important in explaining the choice of buying energy-saving light bulbs in Ghana.
   Conclusions: Besides advocating for information that will make society more environmentally conscious, we further recommend the use of fiscal policies (i.e. subsidies) to support lower income brackets who are predominant in developing countries.

TI The effect of the informal sector on sustainable development: Evidence
   from developing countries
SO BUSINESS STRATEGY AND DEVELOPMENT
AB This study aims to explore the impact of the informal sector on the sustainability of development. A large panel data set of 50 developing countries that spans over 2010-2019 has been utilized to this end while the informal sector is evaluated in terms of working poverty. Selecting indicators from three dimensions of sustainability, that is, economy, society, and environment, this study has constructed three indices and combines those to construct a symptomatic composite index of sustainability. Both the short run and long run panel data models have been applied to empirically investigate the impact of informal economic activities on the sustainability of development. Economic growth, national expenditure, and economic freedom of countries are used as control variables in the models and the estimated outcomes are found to be robust in empirical investigations. The outcomes of the study imply that the informal sector plays a detrimental role in the sustainable development of developing countries while economic growth and economic freedom contribute positively. Therefore, the prescribed strategy is to reduce informality from business and other economic activities that limit the scope of the economies and to understand the domain through which interventions can be made to move to a more formal economy. Integration of informal business and SMEs into the formal sector and firm-level awareness building in Corporate Social Responsibility can also be suggested to find a path towards sustainable development in addition to increased economic growth and enhanced economic opportunities of the developing countries.

TI DEVELOPED COUNTRY POLICIES AND BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY IN
   DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB A vigorous effort will be required to negotiate and implement international commodity agreements which would stabilize and maximize the earnings of developing countries from the export of primary products. Success will enable them to evolve and develop from a more balanced base and to manage their natural resources in a sustainable manner. This article examines ways developing countries are interlocked with wealthy nations in terms of agriculture practices, how that affects biodiversity and habitat conditions in developing countries, and how developing countries could develop agricultural policies and strategies that would address and correct the loss of biological diversity. Agricultural trade policies, agricultural assistance policies, and potentials within these for changes are examined in terms of achieving sustainable approaches to agriculture. Some general principles are apparent, and the combined effects from certain policies are clear. Protectionism depletes the resources of the developing world; it accelerates the loss of biological diversity and reduces the ability of poorer nations to create a context in which future development could occur. Developing countries become forced to respond to foreign rather than local conditions. The success of agricultural development will depend on linkages with natural areas important for biological diversity. Therefore, agricultural development projects supported by agencies of developed nations must consider the larger ecosystem, the parts in context with the whole. Since current models of economic and ecological systems are disconnected, a monitoring and research program should be established to determine the effectiveness of alternative policies and organizational structures. Nonetheless, economic restructuring offers opportunities to direct efforts towards conservation of biological resources, sustainable agriculture, and training in principles of conservation. Opportunities for innovative initiatives exist through debt reduction or exchanging debt for biological conservation. This could lead to sound agricultural systems, reduce government deficits, and protect biological diversity. The global climate debt, incurred by wealthy nations, could be managed to the benefit of developing countries. It is suggested that nations develop a "Foreign Policy on Agriculture and the Environment" stating national objectives in both trade and aid, in relation to agriculture.

AB With COVID-19 now spreading in developing countries, massive consequences on health and livelihoods are feared. Food security is the most important and crucial aspect of sustainable development. The agricultural sector forms the backbone of the economy and provides livelihood to a large section in developing countries. Therefore, the disruption in food security and the agricultural sector will have far-reaching impacts on these countries. Owing to the importance of these sectors, this paper performs a comprehensive assessment of the effect of COVID-19 on food security and agriculture. The research suggests coping and mitigation mechanisms that can be adopted to sustain livelihoods.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore building information modeling (BIM) implementation and practices in developed economies by developing a benchmarking model that will enhance BIM adoption and implementation in developing countries. Design/methodology/approach The research design adopted a qualitative approach which includes the desktop review of the extant literature as well as case study reviews of ten BIM projects using an explanatory case study technique to form the foundation upon which the study proposed the model. The moving basis heuristics technique was adopted to develop the scoring system. Findings The BIM benchmarking model and assessment template were developed which consisted of three-level concepts modeled to aid project organizations and project team in developing countries to assess and score the level of improvement and implementation of BIM in a project. A desktop review of BIM projects in developed countries demonstrated the significant improvements and benefits possible through the implementation of the established BIM benchmarking model. Originality/value The findings have provided policymakers, construction stakeholders and professional bodies in the construction industry in developing countries with valuable insights and counter-intuitive perspective that could facilitate the uptake of BIM in construction projects.

TI Improving households' access to electricity and energy consumption
   pattern in Nigeria: Renewable energy alternative
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Access to substantial quantity and quality energy infrastructures is essential to rapid and sustainable economic development. Access to modern energy services directly contributes to economic growth and poverty reduction through the creation of wealth. No country can develop and sustain beyond subsistence means without having at least minimum access to energy services for the larger portion of its population. The present study examines the households' access to modern energy (electricity) services and pattern of energy consumption in Nigeria. It was found that the access to modern form of energy in the country is very low despite the country's abundant energy endowment. Greater proportions (over 40%) of Nigerian households do not have access to electricity and still depend largely on traditional forms of energy (e.g., firewood, kerosene, etc.) as energy sources. However, Nigeria is abundantly endowed with renewable energy resources. This can be significantly developed to generate modern and clean electricity to meet the yearning demand of its citizens without imposing serious hazard on the environment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim is to build a framework for understanding the links between industrial policy, the ICT sector, the labour market for high level ICT skills, and the education system in these countries. This work is intended to serve as preparation for undertaking international comparative analysis of the economic growth and employment generation potential of developing country ICT sectors. The paper attempts to identify the core factors and conditions that must be considered in assessing the possibility of developing country economic growth through advancing ICT-related economic activity. Alongside core governance, policy, economic and technology factors that will determine growth potential in the ICT sector, particular attention is given to considering the capacity of the national education and training system to produce and reproduce the skilled labour that is essential for ICT sector sustainability and growth. The paper then explores some options for comparative analysis between countries in the Pacific Asia and Southern Africa regions.

TI Sustainable construction through energy management practices in
   developing economies: an analysis of barriers in the construction sector
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB In the recent era, energy management practices (EMPs) have gained significant importance in developed countries, due to their cost efficiency and the potential to protect the environment. However, developing countries are not particularly serious about adopting and implementing sustainable construction practices, due to the different barriers that hinder them from doing so. Therefore, the complete adoption of effective EMPs is still at the initial stage. The objective of this study is to identify the barriers to EMPs adoption, in the construction sector of Pakistan. Initially, the barriers were identified from the earlier studies and screened by the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM). These screened barriers were then evaluated through the ISM. The results of the ISM show that there happens to be a "lack of communication and collaboration among project stakeholders," "attitudinal, cultural and behavioral resistance to adopt EMPs", "lack of top management support and interest in energy management issues," "no condition for implementing EMPs on construction site," and "lack of financing schemes to implement energy management technology," as the top barriers to EMPs adoption in the construction projects pertaining to Pakistan. Thus in this regard, this study empirically contributes to EMPs literature that is based on the developing countries and supports the policymakers in developing appropriate strategies to reduce energy consumption in construction projects-especially in developing countries.

TI Development of an economic and practical alternative to traditional
   bituminous surface treatments
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
AB In many developing countries, a substantial portion of the road network, typically more than 75%, consists of earth and gravel roads that carry relatively low volumes of traffic. Traditionally, natural gravel materials ate used for providing, maintaining, and upgrading such roads. However, most natural gravels have practical limitations on their use-for example, steep gradients and high rainfall, dust generation in dry weather, and slippery surfaces in wet weather. In addition, there is an increasing scarcity of suitable materials, and, moreover, maintenance is seldom carried out effectively in most developing countries. The inherent problems of maintaining unpaved roads can be overcome by paving them. However, even when this solution is economically justifiable, often it is not adopted widely in developing countries because of limited funds. However, a type of surfacing that can provide an economic and practical alternative to traditional surfacings and, by so doing, make better use of limited funds is the graded aggregate (Otta) seal. Otta seal surfacing is presented as an economic and practical alternative to the more traditional bituminous surface treatments, such as chip seals and slurry seals. The origin, properties, design, and construction of the Otta seal are outlined. The effects of its implementation and the various factors that contribute to its sustainability are discussed, and information is provided on global use of the Otta seal, including a case history relating to its introduction in southern Africa.

We also implement these empirical models for three regions sub-panels: Asia, Africa and Latin America. Global panel results showed that there is a bi-directional causal relationship between FDI and poverty as well as CO2 emission and poverty. However, there is unidirectional causal relationship that runs from FDI to CO2 emission. Findings showed also a significant negative relationship between FDI and poverty for all groups of countries with the exception of the African panel. Other important results showed a negative impact of FDI on CO2 emission in African countries, an inverted U-shaped relationship between the two variables for Asian economies and a positive effect of FDI on environmental quality in Latin America.

SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF ENERGY WATER AND ENVIRONMENT
   SYSTEMS-JSDEWES
AB Country specificities and national cultures influence Environmental Management Systems (EMS) implementation and pro-environmental behaviour in organisations. Previous studies have focused on organisations in developed or emerging economies, creating a need to establish the extent to which findings are applicable to developing counterparts. This paper presents EMS implementation from a developing country perspective, reporting on EMS implementation factors (drivers, benefits, barriers) affecting Nigerian organisations' pro-environmental behaviour, by analysing questionnaire responses from 136 Nigerian organisational respondents. Most commonly cited drivers were 'environmental concern' and 'desire for improved organisational efficiency'. Key barriers were 'cost of implementation/budget barriers' and 'regulatory agency bureaucracy'. Key benefits were 'reduced environmental accidents and improved site safety', 'enhanced corporate image' and 'more efficient resource use'. To situate findings within a global construct, results were compared with previous studies in more developed economies. EMS implementation factors differed from those in more developed economies. Plausible explanations for differences are discussed.

TI Resource extraction industries in developing countries
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB Over the last one hundred and fifty years, the extraction and processing of non-renewable resources has provided the basis for the three industrial revolutions that have led to the modern economies of the developed world. In the process, the nature of resource extraction firms has also changed dramatically, from small-scale operations exploiting easily accessible deposits to large, vertically integrated, capital intensive transnational corporations characterized by oligopolistic competition. In the last ten to fifteen years, coinciding with processes of economic globalization, another major change has been occurring as resource extraction industries have been shifting their operations from developed to developing countries. This shift has greatly impacted the populations of these countries and raises a variety of ethical issues. This article investigates the nature of these changes and the ethical issues that arise, focusing in particular on the development impact of the activities of these industries and the potential adequacy of different policy approaches to regulating them.

AB As developed countries have grappled with rising rates of obesity, policymakers' efforts have been frustrated. Traditional approaches have treated food consumers as if they were making deliberate and calculated food decisions, leading to policies that provide more detailed health information, pricing incentives and direct prohibitions. The results have fallen far short of expectations, and have often generated significant backlash in the process. Alternative approaches recognizing the passive nature of food decisions has recently gained some traction. These approaches, based on behavioral economics, rely on subtle changes in the food choice environment. The hallmark of these "nudges" are relatively large impacts on choice within the altered environment, relatively low costs, and little in the way of consumer resistance. In this paper we review the relevant literature within the developed world, and document the systematic policy applications. One key theme has been the importance of such interventions in food environments affecting the poor and food insecure. This is the case for two distinct reasons: First, it is the food insecure that are at greatest risk for obesity; second, the food insecure are most likely to be susceptible to food choice nudges. For these reasons, nudges may be of import in developing country settings. As obesity is on the rise in many developing countries, lessons learned in developed countries may be directly applicable. Alternatively, similar principles may be of use in ensuring proper nutrition among the food insecure as a means to prevent malnutrition or other acute diet related diseases. We provide some discussion of what these applications may look like, as well as the research needed to make effective use of behavioral choice in this new frontier. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB Access to clean, modern energy services is an essential requirement for sustainable development. The UN Sustainable Development Goals and SE4ALL program call for universal access to modern energy services by 2030. However, the latest available figures estimate that 1.1 billion people are living without access to electricity with over 55% living in Sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, 90% live in rural areas, often with challenging terrain, low income and population density, or in countries with severe underinvestment in electricity infrastructure making grid extension impractical. Recently, technological and cost improvements with new business models have made mini-grids combining multiple energy technologies one of the most promising alternatives for off-grid electrification. The International Energy Agency has estimated that between 100,000 to 350,000 new mini-grids will be required to reach universal access goals. Given the intermittent and location dependent nature of renewable energy sources and the various cost dynamics of included technologies, detailed system operations and demand modelling are required to determine the cost optimal combinations of technologies for each particular local context. The model presented in this paper simulates hourly mini-grid operation using meteorological data, demand profiles, technology capabilities, and costing data to determine the optimal component sizing of a hybrid mini-grid appropriate for rural electrification. The model is designed to be fully transparent, reproducible, scalable, customizable and uses freely available software and data.

SO ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND POLICY
AB This paper investigates the impact of corruption on sustainable development using the Seo and Shin (2016) threshold model for a panel data set of 96 to 103 developed and developing countries from 1996 to 2019. The paper contributes to the ongoing de-bate about whether corruption greases or sands the wheels of sustainable development. All results support the hypothesis of the existence of thresholds. Examining the full sample, the impact of corruption on sustainable development is regime-specific and dependent on the quality of governance. In developed countries, corruption always hin-ders sustainable development, while in developing countries the impact of corruption on sustainable development is regime-specific and dependent on the quality of governance. When the quality of governance is low, highly corrupt countries achieve higher levels of sustainable development, which is consistent with the "grease the wheels"hypothesis.(c) 2023 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland.

TI Schooling and wage income losses due to early-childhood growth faltering
   in developing countries: national, regional, and global estimates
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION
AB Background: The growth of >300 million children <5 y old was mildly, moderately, or severely stunted worldwide in 2010. However, national estimates of the human capital and financial losses due to growth faltering in early childhood are not available.
   Objective: We quantified the economic cost of growth faltering in developing countries.
   Design: We combined the most recent country-level estimates of linear growth delays from the Nutrition Impact Model Study with estimates of returns to education in developing countries to estimate the impact of early-life growth faltering on educational attainment and future incomes. Primary outcomes were total years of educational attainment lost. as well as the net present value of future wage earnings lost per child and birth cohort due to growth faltering in 137 developing countries. Bootstrapped standard errors were computed to account for uncertainty in modeling inputs.
   Results: Our estimates suggest that early-life growth faltering in developing countries caused a total loss of 69.4 million y of educational attainment (95% CI: 41.7 million, 92.6 million y) per birth cohort. Educational attainment losses were largest in South Asia (27.6 million y; 95% CI: 20.0 million, 35.8 million y) as well as in Eastern (10.3 million y; 95% CI: 7.2 million, 12.9 million y) and Western sub-Saharan Africa (8.8 million y; 95% CI: 6.4 million, 11.5 million y). Globally, growth faltering in developing countries caused a total economic cost of $176.8 billion (95% CI: $100.9 billion, $262.6 billion)/birth cohort at nominal exchange rates, and $616.5 billion (95% CI: $365.3 billion, $898.9 billion) at purchasing power parity-adjusted exchange rates. At the regional level, economic costs were largest in South Asia ($46.6 billion; 95% CI: $33.3 billion, $61.1 billion), followed by Latin America ($44.7 billion; 95% CI: $19.2 billion, $74.6 billion) and sub-Saharan Africa ($34.2 billion; 95% CI: $24.4 billion, $45.3 billion).
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that the annual cost of early childhood growth faltering is substantial. Further investment in scaling up effective interventions in this area is urgently needed and likely to yield long run benefits of $3 for every $1 invested.

TI Do the globalization and imports of capital goods from EU, US and China
   determine the use of renewable energy in developing countries?
SO CARBON MANAGEMENT
AB The developing countries rely heavily on imports of capital goods to spur economic growth. When the economy grows, energy consumption rises, adversely impacting climate change. The low levels of renewable energy share in total energy consumption, developing nations confront a difficult task in achieving the SDGs targets related to an increase in renewable energy share and access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy. Finding solutions to increase renewable energy usage is critical. International trade is an unavoidable part of development, prompting us to consider the impact of imports on renewable energy usage. This study explores the effects of imports of capital goods from China, EU and USA on renewable energy consumption in developing countries by using panel data from 20 countries spanning 2000-2018. It is found that capital goods imported from China in developing countries negatively impact renewable energy consumption while imports from EU have a positive impact on renewable energy consumption. However, in the case of US it is found negative but insignificant. The role of economic, social, and political globalization is explored, and it is found that three types of globalization are positively and significantly linked with renewable energy consumption. Thus, this study recommends that trade policies complement domestic efforts toward increasing renewable energy production and consumption in developing countries.

TI Remote Autonomous Energy Systems Project: Towards sustainability in

SO ENERGY
AB Throughout the world, but mostly in developing countries, there are presently regions where electricity supply is insufficient or non-existing. Innumerous authors affirm that this lack of access to electricity is a key factor in perpetuating poverty around the world and compromises the socio-economic progress of those places. Thus, improving energy access is a priority since 1.3 billion people around the world still lack access to electricity, 84% of them living in rural areas.
   However, the energy demand in developing countries is completely different from what is observed in the regions like Europe or North America. According to the International Energy Agency, the households in many non-OECD countries still rely heavily on traditional, non-marketed energy sources,, including wood and waste, for heating and cooking. Therefore, designing energy systems for developing countries presents a great challenge: designing from scratch a system that is both environmentally and economically viable and that enables social and economic development for the populations.
   This work focuses on the development of a system design methodology that optimizes the final solution taking into account a demand growth pathway that reflects the economic development associated with the introduction of electricity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Technological infusion and the change in private, urban green spaces
SO URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
AB Despite the fact that the multifaceted values of urban green spaces in the public and private domain constitute the core of urban sustainability, their importance is not adequately investigated in the context of developing countries. We undertook a survey of homegardens on private properties in Kozhikode, a city located in the state of Kerala, India. Our investigation reveals a substantial loss of private green spaces, defined in terms of the added economic value homegardens provided to households during the last decade. We hypothesise and validate empirically that this loss, over time, is negatively associated with technological infusion at the household level, which we measure by assessing the increase in the number of personal computer(s) possessed by households. We provide an economic framework to discuss the implications of our proposition. We conclude that the nature of positive externalities associated with private, urban green spaces demands policy intervention by the State. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

SO NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM
AB Informal mining activities provide livelihoods for millions of poor in mineral-rich developing countries. Yet, they continue to remain one of the least understood areas in mineral resource management. While its poverty reduction potential is acknowledged, the heterogeneous forms of mining that come under its purview are not well discussed. This article aims to draw attention to the politics of definition by briefly introducing the reader to the nomenclature currently used to describe such mining activities. Then the article examines the nature of informality that justifies the name, and then illustrates the claim by documenting a range of informal mining practices in India with cited examples from other Asian countries. It illustrates the variations in social-economic, technical and legal characteristics, by putting such mining in a community and participatory framework. Finally, the article discusses ways to move towards sustainable development with community participation in mineral-rich areas of developing countries.

TI Lymphoedema management: An international intersect between developed and
   developing countries. Similarities, differences and challenges
SO GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Lymphoedema is a chronic swelling condition that contributes to disability, dysfunction and lost quality of life. Significant disparities exist worldwide regarding the availability of resources necessary to identify, treat and manage lymphoedema. This disparity transcends socio-economic status and is a common problem in both developed and developing countries. The overall impact of lymphoedema as a public health problem, however, is underestimated, principally due to the lack of epidemiologic data. These problems pose barriers to optimal identification and management of this disabling, lifelong condition.
   In 1997, the World Health Organization (50.29) resolved that lymphatic filariasis should be eliminated as a public health problem. A component of this strategy focuses on disability management for those suffering from lymphatic filariasis-related morbidity. This initiative has enhanced lymphoedema awareness in developing countries. However, significant deficits persist in health care providers' knowledge, educational initiatives and basic disease identification and treatment.
   In developed countries, lymphoedema continues to be an underrecognised condition and assumed to be only cancer-related. Health care resources allocated to treat and manage the disease are insufficient for basic and ongoing care, resulting in disease progression and disability. The International Lymphoedema Framework project, established in 2002, seeks to establish a consensus for best practices in the management of lymphoedema worldwide to reduce this disability burden.
   A basic global construct for lymphoedema management is needed to decrease morbidity and promote optimal disease management across all cultural and socio-economic boundaries. Many countries are unaware of the importance of lymphoedema management and have not defined a national strategy with respect to this problem. The objective of this article is to define similarities and differences in strategies for lymphoedema management between developed and developing countries and advocate for a cohesive and concerted approach to disease management.

TI Seismic floor isolation using recycled tires for essential buildings in
   developing countries
SO BULLETIN OF EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING
AB Historical earthquakes in developing countries, particularly in South America, have caused devastating effects in essential buildings, such as hospitals. As a result, some structural retrofits and new designs of essential facilities in South American countries have concentrated on increasing the seismic design forces beyond what is normally required by building codes. This increased-strength approach can lead to quasi-elastic structural response during earthquakes with much larger induced floor accelerations than expected from code-designed structures. In critical structures, sub-par performance of critical non-structural elements, such as medical equipment in a hospital, due to high-induced floor accelerations can have consequences as devastating as structural failures. Passive seismic protection systems, such as seismic isolation, provide a practical means of controlling seismic demand and are now common in developed countries. However, the applications of protection systems have been far fewer in developing countries due to economic considerations and lack of technical expertise. This paper presents the experimental and numerical studies supporting the development of a novel low-cost sustainable protection system incorporating recycled automobile tires for isolating designated floors or rooms in essential buildings in developing countries. The main innovation of the proposed floor isolation system is the geometric arrangement of the rubber tires that allows isolation from both, horizontal and vertical floor accelerations. Horizontal and vertical cyclic testing conducted on tire specimens are first described followed by the development of a numerical model able to reproduce the experimental results. Finally, an existing case-study hospital in Ecuador is considered for evaluating numerically the seismic performance of the proposed floor isolation system.

TI Desert reclamation, a management system for sustainable urban expansion
SO PROGRESS IN PLANNING
AB Urbanisation is occurring at an unprecedented scale worldwide, with developing countries claiming the biggest share. Developing countries are increasingly facing enormous pressures to manage their urban and rural areas challenged by limited resources, exploding numbers of population and rising expectations for a higher quality of life. Sustainability is central to the management of existing and newly developed areas. It can offer a comprehensive discourse for understanding the functioning of cities and their hinterlands, with an aim to achieve a balance between environmental, economic and social issues for current and future generations. Managing the urbanization of newly developed areas requires innovative thinking and an ability to predict and evaluate the impacts of possible futures. As the new map of Egypt is redrawn and much hope lies on the development of its deserts constituting 95% of the total land area, an efficient process of directing and facilitating urban development is urgently required. This paper presents an Urban Sustainable Management System (USMS) using the process of Integrated Assessment to assess three possible development scenarios based on different economic bases for new developments on desert reclaimed land. Indicators of a quantitative and qualitative nature are used to describe environmental, social and economic capitals of three scenarios as well as setting targets towards the aim of sustainability. Pressure points hindering the sustainable development of reclaimed land are drawn under the three different scenarios. The USMS provides an urban management system that overcomes difficulties of data availability, combines interdisciplinary knowledge and deals with uncertainties of future developments; struggles decisionmakers confront across the divide but more so in developing countries.

TI Neighbourhood Density and Social Sustainability in Cities of Developing
   Countries
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Within the concept of sustainable development, there is very little known about social impacts and levels of acceptability of compact urban form in the context of cities of developing countries. Social sustainability of these cities in developing countries might have a huge impact on the overall global sustainability, considering their large population size and high economic growth. This paper provides new empirical evidence from 11 case study neighbourhoods of different densities and built forms within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region to evaluate the relationship between social sustainability and urban densities. In doing so, impacts of both physical and perceived density on selected aspects of social sustainability in the context of Mumbai were examined. The findings suggest that, on social aspects of sustainability, higher household density and population density have no negative impacts. However, importantly, most of the negative associations of density were related to the perceptions of density, and therefore the built form, layout, design and amount of mix of uses as well as socio-demographic variables such as family income and location were found to have an important role in achieving social sustainability.

TI Where is the gap?: the contribution of disparities within developing
   countries to global inequalities in under-five mortality
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Background: Global health equity strategists have previously focused much on differences across countries. At first glance, the global health gap appears to result primarily from disparities between the developing and developed regions. We examine how much of this disparity could be attributed to within-country disparities in developing nations.
   Methods: We used data from Demographic and Health Surveys conducted between 1995 and 2010 in 67 developing countries. Using a population attributable risk approach, we computed the proportion of global under-five mortality gap and the absolute number of under-five deaths that would be reduced if the under-five mortality rate in each of these 67 countries was lowered to the level of the top 10% economic group in each country. As a sensitivity check, we also conducted comparable calculations using top 5% and the top 20% economic group.
   Results: In 2007, approximately 6.6 million under-five deaths were observed in the 67 countries used in the analysis. This could be reduced to only 600,000 deaths if these countries had the same under-five mortality rate as developed countries. If the under-five mortality rate was lowered to the rate among the top 10% economic group in each of these countries, under-five deaths would be reduced to 3.7 million. This corresponds to a 48% reduction in the global mortality gap and 2.9 million under-five deaths averted. Using cutoff points of top 5% and top 20% economic groups showed reduction of 37% and 56% respectively in the global mortality gap. With these cutoff points, respectively 2.3 and 3.4 million under-five deaths would be averted.
   Conclusion: Under-five mortality disparities within developing countries account for roughly half of the global gap between developed and developing countries. Thus, within-country inequities deserve as much consideration as do inequalities between the world's developing and developed regions.

TI Electrification Processes in Developing Countries: Grid Expansion,
   Microgrids, and Regulatory Framework
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE
AB Shortages and poor diversification of generating capacity, high environmental impacts, and low qualities of supply and affordability are common characteristics of the electricity sector in most developing countries (DevCs). Recent cost reductions in the telecommunication sector and some generation technologies, especially renewable-based, with improved economic feasibility have paved the way for new electric infrastructures. This is especially true for emerging economies, as locally dispatched hybrid microgrids introduce flexibility and show the promise of technical and economic advantages. The design and integration of microgrids require detailed assessments to ensure the effective deployment of capital to minimize the risk of stranded assets and capital waste. Microgrids can be considered an affordable option for a rapid response to the electrification challenge, recognizing that, in the horizon, a sharing of resources with the bulk electrical power system will remain, technically and economically, advantageous. This article presents a comprehensive review of the approaches commonly adopted for microgrid electrification. challenges of a standalone microgrid versus a grid-connected system. The need for an improved regulatory framework presented as the cornerstone problem to be solved to allow an effective integration of microgrids in the national grid.

TI Challenges of Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 From the
   Perspectives of Access to Modern Cooking Energy in Developing Countries
SO FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH
AB Sustainable development goal 7 (SDG 7) focuses on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all by 2030. This goal has a lot of synergies and associations with the rest of SDGs and in particular to goals 1, 3, 4, 5, and 15. Nevertheless, achieving this goal with the provisions of access to affordable and sustainable modern cooking energy will be very challenging when past failed programs are considered. The challenges could be paramount in Sub-Saharan Africa, where still the majority of the population does not have access to improved cooking energy services. The low achievement attributes to the interrelated deep-rooted socio-economic, cultural, and technical factors. Without breaking these barriers and having an integrated economic and social policy, achieving this goal remains ambitious without success. Hence, continuing with business as usual with the existing policy may not work. Besides, there can be unforeseen circumstances like the COVID-19 pandemic with a lot of health, economic, and social crizes that also needs to take into account. In addition to having a better policy to ease the socio-cultural issues, there should be the availability of sufficient economic incentives to invest in energy projects and support the households. Otherwise, achieving this goal may remain ambitious by leaving over 70% of the people in Sub-Saharan Africa dependent on traditional use of biomass energy by 2030. This study recommends further study on specific policy direction and system integration.

AB Sound strategies for community water supply and sanitation programmes in developing countries should be based on (i) a clear understanding of the existing problems, (ii) the beneficial impacts achievable, and (iii) the factors which determine sustainability The impacts of many water and sanitation programmes are limited, and many systems break down and are abandoned prematurely; only limited impacts are achievable in the short term without greatly increased investment. Sustainability, in the sense of continued delivery and uptake of services, is threatened by numerous attitudinal, institutional and economic factors, and community participation approaches alone are no guarantee of success. The key to sustainability is that all stakeholders involved in consumption/use, maintenance, cost recovery, and continuing support, perceive it in their best interests to deliver high-quality services.
   This paper, based upon the authors' experiences in Africa and Asia, proposes new sets of programme aims and objectives in relation to impact and sustainability, which can be used in programme design, monitoring and evaluation. It also makes longer-term recommendations to external support agencies.

TI Advances and challenges for the expanded programme on immunization
SO BRITISH MEDICAL BULLETIN
AB Over 3 million deaths from measles, neonatal tetanus and pertussis are prevented by vaccination each year. In the Americas, poliomyelitis has been eliminated, and measles is close to elimination. Globally, reported poliomyelitis incidence has declined by over 80% since 1988.
   Strategies have evolved from strengthening routine childhood immunization services, to establishing disease surveillance and defining specific activities for disease control and elimination. Efforts to ensure the supply and quality of vaccines are underway. New vaccines against major pathogens will be licensed soon. Some of these will be used for groups other than mothers and infants, requiring re-definition of the 'EPI target groups'.
   Despite global successes, in 1995, six of the world's most populous developing countries reported coverage levels below 70% and coverage is below 50% in several African countries. Immunization programmes will need to be tailored to the level of economic and health systems development of a country. Industrialized countries must offer sustained support to expand immunization programmes in ways that strengthen health systems in developing countries.

SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING
AB During the last 40 years, The Center for Marine Environmental Studies (CMES), Ehime University collected a variety of environmental and biological material comprising about 1000 species and 100 000 samples from many developing and developed countries and also open seas and oceans all over the world. They were categorically archived, catalogued and stocked in our Environment Specimen Bank (es-BANK) facility equipped with a similar to 25 degrees C cold room. We have already exchanged specimens with many scientific institutions and are also eager to widen our collaboration with other specimen banks. In our survey using the air, water, wildlife and human samples, we found that the major emission sources for the industrial chemicals like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are in the developed nations while those of organochlorine (OC) pesticides like dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites (DDTs), hexachlorocyclohexane isomers (HCHs), etc. are located in developing countries. However, significant emission of modern environmental contaminants such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) also seems to occur predominantly in countries with high economic growth rates. Apart from the modern incinerators and other industrial installations in developed nations, the compounds, like dioxins and related compounds (DRCs), were also found to be released in significant levels from the municipal solid waste dumping sites of developing countries. By evaluating the distribution patterns of various persistent toxic substances (PTSs) in our studies, we could conclude that DRCs and DDTs are regional contaminants, while PCBs, PBDEs, HCHs and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) are global contaminants. We also found that the pollution by PBDEs has been increasing in the last two decades while that of the legacy OCs has been decreasing.

AB The relationship between economic development and the ecological environment is the key to sustainable development of human society. With the rapid economic development, the demand for resources has increased dramatically, which has led to problems such as depletion of resources and environmental pollution. Therefore, the relationship between resource use and economic growth needs to be studied to formulate corresponding resource use policies to facilitate the sustainable development of human society. This paper uses the resource decoupling indicators to study the decoupling condition of domestic material consumption (DMC) and material footprint (MF) indicators of three BRICS countries and three OECD countries from 1990 to 2015. Resources include biomass, non-metallic minerals, fossil fuels, and metal ores. Based on the results from these cases, we find that developed countries have a better decoupling condition than developing countries in the DMC level, but there is not much difference between developed and developing countries at the MF level. The developing countries' decoupling condition of MF is better than that of DMC, while the developed countries' decoupling condition is opposite. This study also emphasizes the importance of developing decoupling policies by selecting an appropriate resource use indicator.

   FinTech
SO CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB Transformation of agribusiness is critical in light of the Agenda for Sustainable Development. FinTech and the integration of FinTech with other (green) technologies as well as with digitized agriculture plays an important role when it comes to, for example, SDG 12, specifically, responsible production, as it can mitigate trade-offs and enhance synergies between environmental and social SDGs, for example, 1 and 15, increasing profitability without additional use of natural resources. Important limitations and risks need to be addressed, however, for developing countries to fully benefit from the potential that FinTech holds in this context. Mitigating factors include massive infrastructure investments and large-scale capacity building. Rigorous research on economic sustainability and cost-effectiveness of newer FinTech models is needed to make sound policy recommendations.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS
AB PurposeCorporate social responsibility (CSR) remains a prevalent topic for businesses worldwide, especially for those operating in developing countries. The attention on small and medium-sized enterprises' (SMEs') CSR engagement in developing countries has been neglected, although SMEs play a vital role in socio-economic development in African countries like Kenya. This paper aims to conceptualize the relationship between the SME manager's values, ethics, emotional commitment to long-term socio-economic development and the firm's CSR practices.Design/methodology/approachThe authors conducted seven semi-structured interviews with Kenyan and German SMEs located in Nairobi. A deductive-inductive analysis approach was chosen, confirming previous findings and contributing new ideas to the International Business (IB) literature.FindingsThis paper develops a concept linking the values and beliefs of the SME manager with the firm's CSR practices in developing countries via the manager's emotional commitment to local long-term socio-economic development. The Kenyan managers tend to show a higher degree of emotional commitment, which the authors explain by two drivers: (1) philanthropic, self-motivated driver and (2) expectation-based, environment-motivated driver. The authors' findings add to the literature on SMEs' CSR engagement in developing countries by looking at the individual level of analysis.Originality/valueThis paper develops a concept linking the values and beliefs of the SME manager with the firm's CSR practices in developing countries.

SO DISCOVER SUSTAINABILITY
AB Most countries strive to reach effective sustainable development policies, given the repercussions of this policy on many aspects, such as the economic growth of countries. The adoption of policies of sustainability by developing countries may lead to their development faster than expected. This research aims to study the strategies applied in one of the universities of developing countries and the sustainability policies adopted at that university which is Damascus University. The study focuses on the time during last four years of the Syrian crisis through several factors, with a focus on the analysis based on the SciVal and Scopus databases and the strategies applied by the university itself. In this research, we use the method of extracting and analysing the data of the sixteen sustainable development goals (SDGs) of Damascus University within Scopus and SciVal. We also analyse the strategies used in the university in order to reach some of the determinants of SDGs. By analysing Scopus and SciVal data, we find that the third goal of SDGs is the most widespread in terms of scientific research in Damascus University. We find that the application of such policies led to an important goal in the environment, which is the ratio of green space in Damascus University reaching to more than 63 percent of the total flat area of the university. In addition, we find that the application of sustainable development policies led to the generation of energy from renewable sources by 11% of the total electrical energy consumed at the university. The university has been able to reach lots of indicators of the sustainable development goals and it remains apply others.

TI Interrogating Climate Adaptation Financing in Zimbabwe: Proposed
   Direction
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Reducing vulnerability to climate change and enhancing the long-term coping capacities of rural or urban settlements to negative climate change impacts have become urgent issues in developing countries. Developing countries do not have the means to cope with climate hazards and their economies are highly dependent on climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture, water, and coastal zones. Like most countries in Southern Africa, Zimbabwe suffers from climate-induced disasters. Therefore, this study maps critical aspects required for setting up a strong financial foundation for sustainable climate adaptation in Zimbabwe. It discusses the frameworks required for sustainable climate adaptation finance and suggests the direction for success in leveraging global climate financing towards building a low-carbon and climate-resilient Zimbabwe. The study involved a document review and analysis and stakeholder consultation methodological approach. The findings revealed that Zimbabwe has been significantly dependent on global finance mechanisms to mitigate the effects of climate change as its domestic finance mechanisms have not been fully explored. Results revealed the importance of partnership models between the state, individuals, civil society organisations, and agencies. Local financing institutions such as the Infrastructure Development Bank of Zimbabwe (IDBZ) have been set up. This operates a Climate Finance Facility (GFF), providing a domestic financial resource base. A climate change bill is also under formulation through government efforts. However, numerous barriers limit the adoption of adaptation practices, services, and technologies at the scale required. The absence of finance increases the vulnerability of local settlements (rural or urban) to extreme weather events leading to loss of life and property and compromised adaptive capacity. Therefore, the study recommends an adaptation financing framework aligned to different sectoral policies that can leverage diverse opportunities such as blended climate financing. The framework must foster synergies for improved impact and implementation of climate change adaptation initiatives for the country.

SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW AND POLICY
AB Purpose - This paper seeks to provide an in-depth discussion on the impact of agricultural biotechnology in developing and least developed countries (LDCs) as well as the concomitant biosafety concerns that might have an impact on trade and the environment whilst highlighting the importance of choosing development pathways that are conducive to the specific needs of these nations without endangering the biodiversity and affecting people's health.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper adopts a socio-legal approach by undertaking a content analysis of decided cases, relevant treaties and existing studies conducted in areas related to agricultural biotechnology within the framework of sustainable development imperatives.
   Findings - The paper suggests that developing countries venturing into agricultural biotechnology need to enrich the technology according to their needs and capabilities in order to be able to weigh the benefits against the risks in the production and import of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) specifically via the implementation of the "precautionary principle" and viable "risk assessment" techniques which conform to their existing international law obligations in view of the findings that most of these nations have not formulated adequate legal and institutional frameworks supported with the necessary expertise to regulate, monitor, and ensure safety of agricultural GMOs produced and/or imported by them.
   Practical implications - The issues and suggestions in this paper will enable the development process of developing and least developed economies to conform to the tenets of sustainable development and minimize the loss of Earth's biodiversity.
   Originality/value - The paper is of practical use to stakeholders and policymakers alike venturing into agricultural biotechnology. It pools the findings of a cross-section of studies to look at the implications therein and the arising biosafety and trade issues with special reference to developing and LDCs.

AB To date, a well-developed business perspective on how to promote sustainability for those in poverty is sorely lacking. For sustainability enhancing innovations in developing countries, poverty presents unique challenges. In this paper, we argue that if sustainability enhancing innovations introduced in developing countries are to stick, they need to be designed with local customers, networks, and business ecosystems in mind. We illustrate this view using case examples from mobile telephony, fuel efficient stoves, clean drinking water, and household electrification. Our paper underscores the need for today's managers to understand poverty as an integral part of the sustainability nexus and the new international business equation.

TI Estimating Infrastructure Financing Needs in the Asia-Pacific Least
   Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries, and Small Island
   Developing States
SO ECONOMIES
AB To assist with the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, this paper develops a framework to estimate infrastructure financing needs of the Asia-Pacific least developed countries (LDCs), landlocked developing countries (LLDCs), and small island developing States (SIDS) by 2030. The framework takes into account the financing required to close existing infrastructure gaps, keep up with growing demands for new infrastructure, maintain existing infrastructure, and mitigate the vulnerability of infrastructure to climate-related risks. Based on a panel of 71 developing economies from 1990 to 2015 and the application of unit costs to the level of physical infrastructure stock projected to 2030, the required resources are estimated to amount to 8.1% of GDP per annum on weighted average, which exceeds current levels of infrastructure funding of 5-7% of GDP. The paper finds that a large proportion of financing needs in LDCs and SIDS arises from the current infrastructure shortages, particularly in the transport and energy sector, implying that provision of universal access to basic infrastructure services would require large outlays of resources. The results also suggest that LLDCs and some SIDS require over one-third of their spending to be allocated to maintenance and replacement of existing assets, while those in low-lying coastal areas face substantial long-run costs in improving infrastructure to mitigate climate change and protect them against loss and damages caused by extreme weather events. Meeting future infrastructure financing needs will require greater engagement of the private sector and other global and regional initiatives to ensure that sufficient resources can be raised for investment in infrastructure.

AB In recent years, tourism has taken on considerable importance as a factor of economic and social development in the world, contributing not only to the economic growth of developing countries, but also to the improvement of the quality of life of the people involved in the sector. However, given the global health crisis caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19), the tourism sector was one of the most affected sectors due to the various public safety policies adopted by different countries in the world, especially by European countries that account for more than 50% of international tourism in the Americas, Africa, and the Middle East. The objective of this research was to estimate and project international tourism demand in Peru with monthly time series data from January 2003 to December 2020 through a seasonal ARIMA process proposed by Box-Jenkins called SARIMA. The results show that the seasonal ARIMA model (1,1,1)(0,1,1,1)12 was appropriate for the projection given the Akaike (AIC) and Schwarz (SC) criteria. The model estimates a parsimonious cyclical recovery of international tourist arrivals to our country; however, the evolution of COVID-19 in public health maintains uncertainty about new challenges in the tourism sector that would allow its sustainability and resilience over time Immediate fiscal and monetary measures are urgently needed to safeguard employment and survival mechanisms for businesses.

AB Many developing countries face unique water treatment challenges and barriers because these communities do not have a well established socio-economic, educational, and technological infrastructure, which is capable of supporting conventional water treatment solutions. It is not uncommon for many proposed and implemented water treatment solutions to fail in the developing countries, especially in small, impoverished and rural communities. This chapter examines underlying factors that contribute to water treatment challenges and barriers in developing world communities and proposes a systems approach for developing a sustainable water treatment solution in small, rural, and impoverished communities. Five different categories of challenges and barriers to water treatment solutions in developing countries are identified and examined: (1) economics driven factors; (2) knowledge based factors; (3) socio-cultural implications; (4) adequacy of supporting infrastructure; and (5) environmental specifics. A systems approach, which stems from the need to resolve these challenges, is elucidated in an attempt to minimize the failure rate of implementing inadequate water treatment solutions in small, rural, and impoverished communities of the developing world.

TI Does environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis exist? Evidence from dynamic
   panel threshold
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND POLICY
AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have been rising globally and have raised public concern regarding their detrimental effects to human life. This article investigates the validity of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis in developing countries in a nonlinear framework. The article applies the dynamic panel threshold method, which is able to estimate the EKC turning point. The main findings reveal the existence of a nonlinear relationship between income (GDP per capita) and carbon dioxide emissions. Precisely, for developing countries (low and middle income) the results reveal that GDP per capita is positive and significantly related to CO2 emissions, below and above the threshold. These results challenge the validity of the EKC hypothesis in developing countries, suggesting that developing countries are still below the desired income turning point, at which better economic development will lead to reduced environmental damage. Based on the study findings, it may be inappropriate for the policymakers in developing countries to adopt the EKC postulate as the theoretical basis for policies favouring economic growth.

TI Metal Toxicology in Developing Countries
SO HANDBOOK ON THE TOXICOLOGY OF METALS, VOL I & II, 4TH EDITION
AB Environmental health problems associated with metals in developing countries are complex and frequently severe. They relate to the mining of mineral deposits in these countries, the smelting of metal-containing ores, and the secondary smelting of batteries and electronic waste products transported into these countries for recycling. Despite efforts in the international community to promote sustainable development, these activities are frequently conducted in developing countries under conditions of limited health and safety regulation due to the limited resources available to implement environmental and occupational health standards in many developing countries. Poor nutrition and a general lack of food are also contributory factors that exacerbate susceptibility to metal toxicity. These issues are further compounded by metal contamination of food crops through the utilization of cadmium-containing phosphate fertilizers, arsenic in irrigation water from contaminated groundwater, and other metals or chemicals from industrial or municipal wastewater sources. The economies of developing countries are often highly dependent on the mining, smelting, and recycling of metals, as well as on agricultural products, so tighter regulation of ongoing practices is frequently a secondary concern. This multiplicity of factors combines to create an overall situation that frequently places populations in developing countries at an elevated risk of adverse public health outcomes from metal exposures. However, it also should be noted that, given the increased globalization of industries and the food supply, metal contamination of the environment in-developing countries with-aeolian transport of metals in the atmosphere, ocean currents, and food may also present potential public health problems to populations in developed countries. For these reasons, the issues discussed in this chapter are generic and global in nature.

TI Economic and Biological Conditions Influence the Sustainability of
   Harvest of Wild Animals and Plants in Developing Countries
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB Promoting sustainable use of wild animals and plants is a global target in biodiversity conservation. However, the role of wild harvest as a conservation tool remains controversial. When unsustainable, wild harvesting leads to population decline or even extirpation of species. When sustainable, it has the potential to promote win-win solutions for conservation and development. We reviewed 87 cases of wild harvesting of vertebrates and plants in developing countries to understand the conditions influencing its sustainability. We used random forest and logistic regression to find the most important predictors among a range of biological, demographic and economic indicators, and to detail the predicted effects on sustainability of harvest. Species resilience, GDP per capita and poverty headcount ratio were the strongest predictors of sustainability. Species resilience was positively related to sustainability of harvest, whereas GDP per capita and poverty ratio were negatively related. Harvesting a species with low resilience is more likely to be unsustainable when harvested in a middle-income, high poverty ratio country than in a low-income, low poverty ratio country. This study highlights the risks of wild population harvest under the challenging economic conditions inherent in developing countries, and visualize where efforts are most needed to achieve sustainable harvest.

TI The potential of using anaerobic digesters in developing countries
SO CLEANER ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Developing countries are suffering from the negative effects of accumulating local waste and garbage, which increases the level of pollution, affects public health, and increases the incidence of epidemics. Moreover, it negatively affects the visual image of the neighborhoods. Egypt is one of these developing countries that has no clearly defined policies for organic waste (OW) management, which drains a large portion of the local economy and inflicts severe environmental hazards. The Egyptian environmental ministry stated that in 2018-2019, 14.3 Mt of organic waste was dumped in the dump field. The presented research intends to find a solution to get rid of organic waste (OW) and reuse it to generate energy that satisfies the neighbourhoods and turns them into sustainable neighborhoods. This study will demonstrate the potential of using anaerobic digesters (AD) for treating organic waste (OW) and turning the waste into gas and electricity as a sustainable technique for reusing the organic waste (OW) and protecting the environment. The presented study provides an estimation of the energy produced from using anaerobic digesters (AD) for treating organic waste (OW), with a focus on the economic aspects by using a quantitative method to measure the efficiency of anaerobic digesters (AD) in Egyptian neighborhoods. The results revealed that using anaerobic digesters (AD) tanks in Egyptian residential areas will produce 30,000 times more than the gas consumed by the residential sector and will satisfy 0.84% of the electricity needed. This non-stop energy generation will help in solving one of the major challenges facing developing countries, which is satisfying their energy needs and getting rid of their organic waste (OW). It will also decrease epidemics and the percentage of pollutants, especially in low-income areas with very weak medical services.

AB The green economy has been considered as the main vector on the way to sustainable development, taking into account relevant development priorities. The focus is not on the opportunities and green economy benefits for the sustainable development of developing countries, but rather on the challenges and risks associated with the transition to a green economy. Due to the fragmentation and narrow focus of research on the meso- and micro-level, the article examines and systematizes the risks associated with the introduction of green technologies and innovations at the macroeconomic level in developing countries and countries with economies in transition. Based on allocation of four generalized groups of innovations to risk sources, and considering the simplified model of consumer goods, the authors analyzed the formation of "green economy" risks. Key reasons for the low efficiency of innovative "green" technologies were identified. Special attention is paid to the identification and differentiation of the causes and consequences of the manifestation of the "rebound effect" in the application of innovative "green" technologies, taking into account the projection on different categories of benefits.

AB Ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable modem energy is a key challenge in reducing poverty in developing countries. Off-grid rural electrification based on decentralized renewable energy has been recognized as an effective way to increase access to energy in remote areas. However, there is some doubt about its long-term sustainability. Previous studies have indicated that once renewable energy generation facilities are installed, the responsibility for operation and maintenance is often handed over to the local community, and, eventually, the project fails because of a lack of maintenance budget. This paper discusses issues related to the sustainability of MHP-based rural electrification as a case study in a remote village in West Java, Indonesia, that is deeply steeped local traditions. A complementary approach between the community and a private company was introduced to improve the economic sustainability of MHPPs while simultaneously conserving local traditions and livelihoods.

TI A critical review of sustainable built environment development in Iran
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-ENGINEERING
   SUSTAINABILITY
AB Population explosion, irresponsible consumerism, environmental catastrophes, tremendous market-based urban development and the dedication of cities to cars and concrete rather than citizens and environment has put a big question mark over the future of the world's developing countries. Urban sustainability has emerged as the only solution to the environmental, social and economic challenges facing our cities. In recent years in countries struggling with the concept of urban sustainability, such as Iran, academic circles and the state have had heated debates over sustainable development. The purpose of this paper is to examine the current situation of sustainable development of the built environment in Iran. The focus is on recognition of urban governance, policies and regulations. The paper examines the scope of sustainable technologies employed in Iran in terms of the development of energy efficiency and renewable energies. This is followed by an investigation of urban sustainability assessment methods through which the paper tackles policy, technology and assessment mechanism issues from a perspective of sustainable built environment development in both theoretical research and practical development in Iran.

AB Globalisation is triggering significant and rapid developmental changes thus creating the impetus for emerging economies to evolve towards knowledge-based societies. This evolution is fuelled in part by the transfer of technologies mostly embedded in products and services. It has become a critical challenge for developing countries to build and sustain the capacity for the transfer of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) because of the rapid pace of change; and this further exacerbates the challenge of making well-informed policies and appropriate decisions with regard to technology transfer. It is important in this regard to understand what relationships (if any) exist between; (i) technology transfer and sustainable development, (ii) technology transfer and capacity building, and (iii) capacity building and sustainable development. Within the context of a developing country, this paper examines and summarises a Delphi study of the range of influencing factors for technology transfer, capacity building and sustainable development. The outcome of the Delphi Study forms the basis for further study of possible correlations between the factors of technology transfer, capacity building and sustainable development.

TI Development of management systems for sustainable municipal solid waste
   in developing countries: a systematic life cycle thinking approach
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Waste management (WM) is a complex sustainability issue because of its intrinsic association with many environmental and economic drivers. Addressing this issue requires clear vision, consideration of the waste life cycle, integrative approaches, and implementation of best-practice WM systems. Therefore, this research aims to present an approach to sustainable management of municipal solid waste in developing countries through systematic life cycle thinking. The study examined the practices in Lebanon as a case study of uncontrolled disposal. The environmental impacts of Lebanon's waste disposal were evaluated to better understand their serious threats. In the next step, 30 alternative WM systems of waste handling were designed. They were assessed for their environmental and economic benefits to demonstrate the proposed approach of developing WM systems and selecting alternatives. The results showed that recycling coupled with composting notably reduces the environmental impacts. It also showed that different waste compositions play a major role in the environmental performance of a WM system, and therefore, they should be considered when developing WM plans. In this regard, high fractions of organic waste are associated with multiple environmental impacts. Such organic waste levels create a challenge for making better use of recycling due to the high amounts in developing countries. Overall, the study concluded that sustainability of WM is a broad concept and should be defined at the local level, with the most pressing environmental issues addressed by each country.

TI Active ageing in developing countries? - trip generation and tour
   complexity of older people in Metro Manila
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY
AB There is by now quite a substantial body of literature discussing the impact of an ageing population in developed countries on travel needs and required changes to transport policy. As many newly developed and developing countries are following demographic trends of "first world" countries, but offset by some decades, the problem is, however, not limited to the industrialised nations. The focus of this paper is on Metro Manila and analyses travel patterns by those aged 60 or over. Trip frequency and tour complexity are analysed with ordered probit regression, separating the effects of socio-demographic characteristics as well as land-use patterns. The results are compared to observations made for cities in developed countries, in particular London as an example for a city in a first world country. We show that there is a more pronounced decrease in total trips made with increasing age in Manila. However, analysing for specific trip purposes we find, similarly to trends in developed countries, that the number of recreational trips is fairly constant in all age groups. Recreational activities also seem to take more time per day than average for younger old, possibly indicating the advent of similar active ageing trends as in industrialised nations. The paper concludes by discussing some implications given future economic trends and advocates that better datasets from developing and newly developed countries are required for urban planning in developing countries.

AB Where does Turkey's performance in the health dimension of the Preston Curve stand with regard to comparable countries on the development ladder? When one observes the chronological progression of health and wealth values embedded in the Preston Curve for developing countries, one sees a near monotonic increase across the board, with only a very small number of downwardly mobile countries. In the face of this near-universal increase in health and wealth values, it is necessary to adopt a more comparative perspective in order to situate the Turkish state's choices and performance within the general story playing out for developing countries in the second half of the 20th century. Utilizing just such a comparative framework, this article uses China's experience between 1960 and 2010 as an alternative through which to understand Turkey's development experience.

TI Breaking Out of Carbon Lock-In: Malaysia's Path to Decarbonization
SO FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB Malaysia has made an ambitious commitment to reduce the intensity of its carbon emissions, notably a 40% reduction (compared to 2005 levels) by 2020 and a 45% reduction (compared to 2005 levels) by 2030. As with other developing countries, Malaysia's challenge is to decarbonize its energy-centric economy in the face of population growth pressures and substantial levels of poverty. Drawing on extensive interviews with both public and private stakeholders, we examine how Malaysia has launched its transition to a decarbonized development path. Based on our multi-year analysis, we identify key breakout factors, including behavioral transformations, institutional shifts, and action by a broad network of actors that have allowed Malaysia to begin decarbonizing its economy. At the same time, we note that federal-state friction, limited government capacity, the absence of a centralized management agency, the lack of international funding, incipient environmental awareness, and numerous barriers to investment in renewable energy reinforce carbon lock-in. Our analysis suggests ways in which other rapidly developing countries can learn from Malaysia's initial successes and challenges.

AB The current era of industrial advancement is known as Industry 4.0 with the adoption of digitization to integrate real and virtual world together using the cyber-physical system, internet of things, cloud computing, the blockchain, and semantic technology. A huge difference has been observed in the manufacturing environment between developed and developing countries. Still, developing countries are in the phase of achieving a target of a significant contribution from the manufacturing sector in their economy without focusing towards numerous environmental and societal concerns. A term Inclusive Manufacturing has been coined in the manufacturing domain to achieve the environmental, economic, and social factors altogether. This paper presents, a simple framework of the Inclusive Manufacturing (IM) with the concept of Digital Twin (DT) by considering various other emerging technologies. To show the inclusiveness, a simulated case study on the manufacturing of a stop valve is incorporated with a mathematical representation of societal, environmental, and economic issues.

AB Cement is the most produced material around the world. Developing countries face a growth of population involving an increasing need of infrastructures. Due to this situation, the cement industry needs to find the best comprise between increasing the cement production and without increasing the negative environmental impact. A promising solution has been found in the use of supplementary cementitious materials (SCM), these materials are used to replace clinker in cement because of their pozzolanic reactivity. In this paper, a method was developed to assess the details of the economic and environmental potential of the specific Limestone Calcined Clays Cement LC3 technology in the Cuban context. A comparison with traditional Portland cement and the current commercial blended cement with zeolite (PPC) sold in Cuba was made. The results provide evidenced based data for the development of a strategy to adopt the LC3 technology by the Cuban market This assessment method can then be easily extended to markets in other developing countries.

   under a Globalized Intellectual Property Regime

AB Global trade and investment have become increasingly liberalized in recent decades. This liberalization has lately been accompanied by substantive new requirements for strong minimum standards of intellectual property (IP) protection, which moves the world economy toward harmonized private rights in knowledge goods. While this trend may have beneficial impacts in terms of innovation and technology diffusion, such impacts would not be evenly distributed across countries. Deep questions also arise about whether such globalization of rights to information will raise roadblocks to the national and international provision of such public goods as environmental protection, public health, education, and scientific advance. This article argues that the globalized IP regime will strongly affect prospects for technology transfer and competition in developing countries. In turn, these nations must determine how to implement such standards in a pro-competitive manner and foster innovation and competition in their own markets. Developing countries may need to take the lead in policy experimentation and IP innovation in order to offset overly protectionist tendencies in the rich countries and to maintain the supply of global public goods in an emerging transnational system of innovation.

TI Impact of income inequality on CO2 emissions in G20 countries
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Over the past three decades, the G20 countries have experienced rapid economic growth but also a widening income disparity and deteriorating environment. We examined whether and how income distribution affects CO2 emissions during economic growth under the extended EKC framework. Using simultaneous quantile regression analysis, we show that, for developing countries, a more equal income distribution favors reductions to the CO2 emissions per capita, whereas, in most developed countries, income inequality hardly affects CO2 emissions. Meanwhile, the EKC hypothesis is valid in G20. Based on the empirical results, we particularly emphasize the importance of reducing income inequality in developing countries and that the entire G20 takes the path of sustainable development.

TI Urban sprawl, food security and agricultural systems in developing
   countries: A systematic review of the literature
SO CITIES
AB In developing countries, urbanisation and associated demographic changes pose unprecedented challenges in terms of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition. A systematic review methodology was conducted, combined with data synthesis, to examine the interactions between urban sprawl, land and resource use changes, agricultural production and food security in developing countries. The Web of Science and Scopus databases were searched to identify 188 relevant articles. The results revealed that existing literature has widely failed to take interactions between different aspects of urban food systems (UFS) into account, indicating disconnects and fragmentation in the approaches used to analyse these interactions. Therefore a further focus on food system transformation pathways, system feedbacks and trade-offs is recommended. Moreover, the results imply that UFS are complex interlinked systems and therefore that policies intending to assure food security in developing countries need to consider these interlinkages and approach them holistically. Finally, an absence of studies examining urban and rural systems from an interconnected perspective was identified. An acknowledgement of such rural-urban connectivity gaps is crucial in order to ensure more inclusive links within food systems and agricultural value chains, and achieve more resilient food systems and more sustainable urbanisation in developing countries.

TI Evolution and feasibility of decentralized concentrating solar thermal
   power systems for modern energy access in rural areas
SO MRS ENERGY & SUSTAINABILITY
AB The desire of the international community to balance global economic growth against concerns of accelerated CO2 emissions has brought solar technologies into the forefront for meeting increasing energy demands. This manuscript discusses the historical and potential future roles for small-to-medium scale solar thermal technologies in addressing the challenge of leveling energy access standards across countries with widely variable economic resources and consumer needs.
   Access to modern energy services, such as heating for water, pumping for agricultural irrigation or potable water sources, and an on-demand 24/7 electrical grid, is central to provision of high quality social services, economic growth, and improved quality of life; however, over 1 billion people remain unelectrified globally. Enabling the projected growth in energy demands without relying on fossil fuels requires consideration of the viability of renewable energy technologies to serve these markets; this manuscript provides a discussion of the role of solar thermal energy systems in this capacity. A survey of systems under 1 MW capacity reported in the literature (academic and commercial) was conducted, with projects aggregated by service type (heat, cooling, electricity, or multi-) in the database provided as an appendix to this manuscript. In general, many hardware configurations have been explored, with economics driven substantially by supply chain pricing, and no clear winner has emerged. Process heat applications demonstrate economic competitiveness over a wide range of commercial applications; however, early explorations into power generation-or co/tri-generation confi gurations-provide indications that such technologies, while not expected to reach grid-parity tariffs, may in fact provide the most economical pathway to energy delivery in the currently most underserved communities.

TI The double burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases in
   developing countries
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB Now, at the dawn of the third millennium, non-communicable diseases are sweeping the entire globe. There is an increasing trend in developing countries, where the demographic and socio-economic transition imposes more constraints on dealing with the double burden of infectious and non-infectious diseases in a poor environment, characterized by ill-health systems. It is predicted that, by 2020, non-communicable diseases will cause seven out of every ten deaths in developing countries. Among non-communicable diseases, special attention is devoted to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer and chronic pulmonary disease. The burden of these conditions affects countries worldwide but with a growing trend in developing countries. Preventative strategies must take into account the growing trend of risk factors correlated to these diseases. In parallel, despite the success of vaccination programmes for polio and some childhood diseases, other diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and dengue are still out of control in many regions of the globe. This paper is a brief review of recent literature dealing with communicable and non-communicable diseases in developing countries. It gives a global view of the main diseases and their impact on populations living in low- and middle-income nations. (c) 2005 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

TI INTEGRATION OF LOGISTICS SYSTEMS OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES INTO
   INTERNATIONAL LOGISTICS CHANNELS
SO ACTA LOGISTICA
AB Modern logistics significantly influences the globalization and internationalization processes. Logistics systems are becoming increasingly important in today's rapidly changing environment. The aim of the article was to investigate the national logistics systems of developing countries in the context of their integration capabilities. The main methods used in this study are statistical analysis, index, graphical and analytical methods, methods for estimating structural dynamic shifts, comparisons. Commonly used methods of economic research, as well as statistical analysis and interstate comparisons, economic modelling (trend analysis to determine the forecast level of LPI for Ukraine), etc. were also involved. The logistics environment of Poland, Bulgaria, India and Ukraine, as well as the factors of its formation are evaluated. The components of the logistic portrait of the country in the context of integration capabilities of the logistic system are offered. It was found for the studied countries that the destimulator of the national logistics system is infrastructure (for Poland), infrastructure and customs (for Bulgaria and Ukraine), customs (for India). It is these components that need priority attention in the context of increasing the integration capabilities of logistics systems, because the results indicate that they lag far behind international standards Prospects for further research involve studies of the impact of pandemics, globalization, digitalization on logistics systems, including that of developing countries.

TI Adaptive reuse: an innovative approach for generating sustainable values
   for historic buildings in developing countries
SO ORGANIZATION TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT IN CONSTRUCTION
AB Sustainable development has become a goal for all countries seeking a balance between social, environmental and economic needs. The principal vision of a sustainable built future is about developing creative designs that utilize energy and materials effectively. However, this vision should consider historic buildings that were built centuries ago. Although many of these buildings are standing in a stable state, they are obsolete and their values are not fully utilized. Towards revitalizing and generating sustainable values of these buildings, adaptive reuse is adopted as a process of modifying, adapting and reusing obsolete buildings with their existing structures to extend their life cycle whilst performing a new function. This is currently practiced worldwide, specifically when a building has a unique architectural character and is in a stable condition. The adaptive reuse of a historic building should have minimal impact on the heritage significance of the building and its setting. This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of adaptive reuse as an innovative approach for generating sustainable values of historic buildings in developing countries. To achieve this aim, a research strategy is designed to accomplish four objectives: first, literature related to sustainable development, sustainable values, adaptive reuse and developing countries is reviewed; second, two case studies are presented and analysed to investigate the role of adaptive reuse towards increasing the sustainable value of heritage buildings; third, a strategy with its action plan is developed for facilitating adaptive reuse of historic buildings in developing countries and finally, research conclusions are outlined and recommendations useful to professionals concerned with adaptive reuse of historic buildings are proposed.

TI A Business approach for transformation to sustainable construction: an
   implementation on a developing country
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Construction industry in several developing countries has undergone major transitions to cope with their national economic goals and - as importantly - to align their markets with the growing global sustainability trends. This study proposes a business approach addressing the common barriers against the strong presence of sustainable construction materials in these countries. The Egyptian market was selected as a candidate for a potential sustainable transformation. The use of sustainable concrete is advocated as a pivotal market transformation that warrants technical leverage in the construction industry and ensures local development as well as global competitiveness. A mixed-mode survey was performed to estimate the level of understanding of sustainable construction and, thus, gauge market's receptiveness to change. Like most sustainable changes in developing countries, the use of sustainable concrete in Egypt as a mainstream construction material is challenged by the stagnant culture of the industry and the absence of a proactive legislative role. Business implementation of the desired transformation is suggested to endure the three stages of the Kotter's model for change: unfreeze-change-lock. In view of the noted commonness of the barriers and similarities in construction cultures of developing countries, due consideration to the proposed approach could be given in these markets. The business dimension of this effort is intended to complement past attempts promoting sustainable transformation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Handling of solid wastes has been a serious problem for all the countries in all over the world.
   Increase in the population, change in the life standard and life style, industrialization and production of new products contributed to the increase of the amount of solid wastes and consequently the problems generated by them. Developed countries, being aware of the significance of the problems, established regulatory programs while economically developing countries continued to handle the solid wastes in a very primitive way such as dumping them into "open dumps".
   Economically developing countries should establish "solid waste management programs" and publish related regulations and by-laws, and strictly control the application of them. Turkey as an economically developing country has 2020 open dumps. Istanbul, being a densely populated Metropolitan City, has faced serious disasters such as "Hekimbasi Open Dump accident" from the mal-management of the solid wastes up to recent years. (Kocasoy, Curi, 1995) By the publication of the Solid Waste Control Regulation of Turkey in 1991, municipalities have started to abandon and rehabilitate the existing open dumps and construct sanitary landfills according to the standards. The Municipality of the Metropolitan City of Istanbul has constructed six transfer stations and two sanitary landfills since 1995.
   For the protection of the environment and sustainable development economically developing countries should develop National Policies for the solid waste management and recycling/recovery programs and start conducting inventory studies for the amount and quality of the solid wastes without any delay.

AB The dependence on oil, gas, and mineral exports arguably has a negative impact on economic growth in resource-rich, developing countries. This article looks at the impact of resource dependence on adjusted net savings (ANS) as an indicator of weak sustainability. Our results, based on a panel of 104 developing countries during the recent commodity price boom, confirm a negative relationship between resource extraction and sustainable development as measured by ANS. We further look at the specific role of armed conflict and armed violence as captured by the homicide rate. Armed conflict, which is positively associated with resource dependence, negatively affects ANS per capita according to both our OLS and instrumental variables (IV) estimates. Similarly, armed violence has a detrimental effect on sustainable development. Our IV estimate suggests that a one-point increase in the homicide rate decreases ANS per capita by $60. Since education expenditures are a critical ANS component, we further examine the impact of resource dependence and violence on human capital. Consistent with previous findings, resource-dependent countries underinvest in education but armed conflict and violence do not affect the instantaneous share of education expenditures, hinting at a detrimental effect working through physical and social capital rather than education.

TI Hierarchical multi-objective optimization of India's energy strategy
   portfolios for sustainable development
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY SECTOR MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose - Optimization of energy planning for growth and sustainable development has become very important in the context of climate change mitigation imperatives in developing countries. Existing models do not capture developing country realities adequately. The purpose of this paper is to conceptualizes a framework for energy strategy optimization of the Indian energy sector, which can be applied in all emerging economies.
   Design/methodology/approach - Hierarchical multi-objective policy optimization methodology adopts a policy-centric approach and groups the energy strategies into multi-level portfolios based on convergence of objectives appropriate to each level. This arrangement facilitates application of the optimality principle of dynamic programming. Synchronised optimization of strategies with respect to the common objectives at each level results in optimal policy portfolios.
   Findings - The reductionist policy-centric approach to complex energy economy modelling, facilitated by the dynamic programming methodology, is most suitable for policy optimization in the context of a developing country. Barriers to project implementation and cost risks are critical features of developing countries which are captured in the framework in the form of a comprehensive risk barrier index. Genetic algorithms are suitable for optimization of the first level objectives, while the efficiency approach, using restricted weight stochastic data envelopment analysis, is appropriate for higher levels of the objective hierarchy.
   Research limitations/implications - The methodology has been designed for application to the energy sector planning for India's 12th Five Year Plan for which the objectives of faster growth, better inclusion, energy security and sustainability have been identified. The conceptual framework combines, within the policy domain, the bottom-up and top-down processes to form a hybrid modelling approach yielding optimal outcomes, transparent and convincing to the policy makers. The research findings have substantial implications for transition management to a sustainable energy framework.
   Originality/value - The methodology is general in nature and can be employed in all sectors of the economy. It is especially suited to policy design in developing countries with the ground realities factored into the model as project barriers. It offers modularity and flexibility in implementation and can accommodate all the key strategies from diverse sectors along with multiple objectives in the policy optimization process. It enables adoption of an evidence-based and transparent approach to policy making. The research findings have substantial value for transition management to a sustainable energy framework in developing countries.

TI The intermittent effects of renewable energy on ecological footprint:
   evidence from developing countries
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB This paper examines the relationship between renewable, non-renewable energy, natural resources, human capital, and globalization on ecological footprint from 1990 to 2016 for developing countries. We apply Westerlund co-integration technique to check the long-run relationship among the variables. The long-run elasticity of the model is analyzed through MG, AMG, and DCCE. For the robustness check of the long-run relationship among the variables, we use FMOLS and DOLS approach. The direction of causal relationship is determined through Dumitrescu and Hurlin causality test. Our findings revealed that economic growth, non-renewable energy, natural resource, and urbanization are inducing the ecological footprint of developing countries and reducing the environment's quality. To cope up with this situation, developing countries are bound to use more fossil fuel energy. The use of non-renewable energy consumption leads to increase the extraction of natural resources like coal and oil. However, renewable energy reduces the ecological footprint or improves environmental quality. Similarly, human capital and globalization have negative effects on ecological footprint. The results of causality test reveal that there are feedback effects between ecological footprint with economic growth, globalization, and natural resources. This study suggests that these developing countries should focus more on the investment in the renewable energy sector, improve quality education, and make stringent environmental policy for protecting the nations from ecological issues.

TI Effects of demographic and related microeconomic change on and quality
   in hills and mountains of developing countries
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB More than 70 empirical studies indicate that local population growth and its microeconomic manifestations in hills and mountains of developing countries do not necessarily threaten forest production, agriculture, livestock production, or watershed stability. Population growth can make the cost of land relative to labor increase. As this cost increases, people often change their methods of managing economic plants and animals and make land improvements to offset initial declines in productivity that result from more frequent use of land. Thus, the relationship between land productivity and relative land-labor costs often resembles a 'U'. Halting population growth or removing people from well-settled areas might not improve productivity or reduce some off-site damages. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Smart neighbourhood: A TISM approach to reduce urban polarization for
   the sustainable development of smart cities
SO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose This paper aims to identify the key factors to design efficient, healthy and potentially economical neighbourhood places in the surroundings of smart cities to reduce the urban polarization for the sustainable urban development.
   Design/methodology/approach A two-stage methodology is followed. First, the key factors for neighbourhood are identified from literature studies. The selected factors are validated by sample t-tests. Second, the total interpretive structural modeling is used to interpret the complexity of relationships among various factors. Further, cross-impact matrix multiplication is applied for classification analysis to find the most driving factors for neighbourhood design.
   Findings The contribution of this research is to show hierarchical relationships among the various factors to design the neighbourhood places as smart from the perspectives of city planners and decision makers.
   Research limitations/implications The applicability of the research findings is limited to developing countries mainly where population is large and most of cities have high pressure on its infrastructure to fulfil the citizens' demands.
   Practical implications This paper will aid policymakers, city planners and government officials to design a sustainable smart city model in which smart neighbourhood would also be the potential solution to decrease pressure on a city's critical infrastructure especially in developing countries.
   Social implications A smart city could be considered as the centre point of smart initiatives to develop a place smart, and it should continue beyond the city boundaries to enhance the facilities, services, resources utilization and working environment in neighbourhood places also.
   Originality/value The study explores the various literature on neighbourhood planning and then link with smart city development as current need of urban development scenario. The authors propose a hierarchical relation framework to develop the neighbourhood places as smart places to meet the future demand of urbanization in developing countries like India.

TI Return to Dublin: Do Traditional Communities Manage Water as an Economic
   Resource?
SO TECNOLOGIA Y CIENCIAS DEL AGUA
AB While the idea of water as an economic good is not new, it has expanded since the Dublin Conference was held (1992). What is the meaning of water as an economic resource? We can identify two approaches or interpretations. The first considers water to be an input (a productive input), as any other in an economic system. In this context, water must have a price or be transferred through market institutions. These economic tools will create an efficient use of the water, that is, more benefits. Water thereby becomes a commodity. The second interpretation is defined in broader economic terms. Water as an economic resource means that it is a scarce resource and must be carefully managed to attain the goals established by a particular society. Treating water as an economic good does not imply the use of one specific set of economic tools. While prices, markets, private property, etcetera are tools that can all be found in a particular toolbox, other toolboxes exist. There are other ways to sustainably manage water from a social, economic and ecological point of view. We will apply this second interpretation to the analysis of water management in traditional communities. We will attempt to answer the question of whether traditional communities manage water as an economic resource. Social science research about the management of small scale irrigation systems shows that those systems generally manage water as an economic resource; that is, as a scarce resource. Although traditional irrigation systems had generally operated well in social, economic and ecological terms, modern water science and policies have ignored them, transforming or destroying them by applying universal concepts, criteria and tools. We conclude that traditional and indigenous institutions and organizations have many lessons to teach in regard to the treatment and management of water, and they should be supported and protected.

   empirical assessment
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ECONOMICS
AB We explore the space-time and mortality dynamics of recent infectious diseases outbreaks which have occurred in a large number of developed and developing countries. We fully acknowledge the heterogeneity of infectious diseases. We find that many outbreaks exhibit spatial dependence, due to the international movement of people and goods. All countries are exposed to these negative cross-border health externalities, which can be triggered by climate shocks. The mortality consequences are much more severe in developing countries. Paying attention to spatial dependence has important implications for economic research and international policymaking. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Universal Health Coverage: A Quest for All Countries But under Threat in
   Some
SO VALUE IN HEALTH
AB Over the past 50 years, health care has been making a growing contribution to population health in many countries. Yet its benefits are still denied to many people worldwide. This article describes how many countries, both developed and developing, have pursued the quest to achieve universal health care. This has been an explicitly political process. In Europe, it emerged from a belief in solidarity, a fear of revolution, and a changing view of the role of the state. In developing countries, progress was more erratic, characterized by debates about the affordability of universal health care, until it was realized that functioning health systems were essential to deliver development goals. Throughout, the United States has been an exception. An analysis of progress toward universal health care, combining a review of existing theories and new empirical analysis, identifies five factors as important: the strength of organized labor and left-wing parties, adequate economic resources, absence of societal divisions, weakness of institutions that might oppose it (such as organized medicine), and windows of opportunity. Having noted the substantial benefits accruing from universal health care, the article concludes with an analysis of how universal health care is under threat in some European countries and a warning about the risks posed by current radical austerity policies.

TI Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 in developing countries: novel challenges
   in a new therapeutic era
SO CLINICAL KIDNEY JOURNAL
AB Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism characterized by marked hepatic overproduction of oxalate due to deficiency of hepatic peroxisomal alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase caused by AGXT gene mutation. One major hallmark of PH1 in developed as well as developing countries (DC) is the diagnostic delay. Notably in DC, where the disease is most prevalent and probably underdiagnosed, there are many challenges in PH1 diagnosis and management, with economic constrains and ethical concerns. This has led to the existing gap in the management of PH1 between developed and DC, which is expected to further deepen with the advent of novel therapeutic agents unless appropriate actions are taken. Until recently, treatment possibilities were limited to supportive measures. Thanks to a better understanding of the molecular basis of the disease a number of new therapies are developed, or being developed, leading to profound changes in management strategies. In this review we discuss the current situation of PH1 in DC as well as the accessibility challenges and the advantages of using promising novel therapeutics to bridge the currently existing gap. We also provide an overview of an integrated approach to ensure equitable access of sustainable therapeutics to PH1 patients in DC. This is expected to reduce global PH1 healthcare disparities, improve its standard of care and reduce disability linked to extrarenal complications of PH1 by implementing personalized medicine.

TI Sustainable WEEE management solution for developing countries applying
   human activity system modeling
SO MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
AB Purpose-Waste of electric and electronic equipments (WEEE) disposal methods adopted by most of the countries are based on adhocism and therefore cannot provide sustainable solution. The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework for sustainable WEEE management based on Human Activity Modeling. The macro model is developed to provide a problem-solving approach for policy makers and to aid them in determining strategic directions in policy making.
   Design/methodology/approach-Qualitative research paradigm is used to review WEEE management in developed and developing countries and Activity Theory (AT) approach is extended into environmental management domain to design a sustainable system.
   Findings-The approach recommends that the real world complexity must first be analyzed by "problem modeling" of the contemporary activity in the environment and then based on this mapping "solution modeling" must be carried out to obtain sustainable solutions.
   Research limitations/implications-The solution recommended is based on theoretical foundations but still a need for experimental evidence is felt to further strengthen the argument. Second further studies are needed to cascade the strategic-level model presented in the study to connect it with the community-level interaction.
   Practical implications-Strategic policy recommendations are given to modify the role of three major actors identified in the society and resultantly attain socio-economic balance among the actors for obtaining sustainable solution.
   Originality/value-The study advocates a new paradigm for solving environmental management issues by using AT approach, focussing on redesigning human interaction in socio-cultural perspectives.

TI Financially sustainable investments in developing countries water
   sectors: what conditions could promote private sector involvement?
SO INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS
AB A scarcity of public resources and insufficient international aid have contributed to the deep crisis that water sectors in developing countries are in, as less has been invested than is considered necessary to improve and increase their efficiency. Private investment could therefore play a crucial role in the building of new infrastructure and in the restructuring of existing services. In fact, according to the Global Water Partnership's forecasts, to achieve the UN Millennium Development Goal related to water, it will be necessary to increase the level of investment per year in the sector from 75 billion dollars to 180 billion dollars. The "Plan of Action" of the Second World Water Forum held in The Hague in 2000 stated that 95% of the additional investments in the water sector should come from the private sector, underlining the need for wider participation by the private sector through public-private partnerships. This means that water has to become a more attractive good from a financial point of view; however, this process requires the existence of a strong regulatory and legal system, transparent contractual procedures and risk allocation between parties. What is the present situation? Through analysis of the private sector's behaviour and amounts invested, and a description of the economic features of production and provision of water that have made it difficult for the private sector to be involved in an efficient way, this paper proposes the conditions required for the financial sustainability of investments in water sectors in developing countries.

AB For the past 40 years, the most dynamic economies in the world were China and India. From approx. 5% of US GDP level, China grows to 26% and India to 11% of current US levels. The ratio of foreign trade to GDP is similar for both countries as well as capital flows to GDP. So why did China outperform India twice in terms of GDP growth and why is India first now catching up?
   This is of extreme relevance in relation to implementation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of Agenda 2030 in which the objective is to eradicate poverty and to enhance economic growth in developing countries. The reduction of poverty in shortest time was best mastered by China over the last 30 years; hence, to put developing countries on the same track is the beginning of the path of their development. A theoretical comparison analysis, backed by observations of China, India, Uganda, and Chad GDP as well as their population growths, indicates that population growth is the major negative enabler of GDP growth per capita of developing countries. Using our drafted methodology, we can assess if certain levels of development aid will be sufficient to overcome the negative GDP per capita pull driven by overpopulation and calculate how much development aid is needed to get countries on sustainable GDP per capita growth path. We ask ourselves, are current SDGs (especially SDG 1, 2, and 8) in developing countries really financially achievable?

TI PLANT GENETIC-RESOURCES - PROBLEMS AND PERSPECTIVE
SO BIOLOGISCHES ZENTRALBLATT
AB In the chain of developing food security, plant genetic resources conservation is the first link. As a result of national and international efforts, national and regional genebanks are now established in about 100 countries.
   Initially genebanks concentrated on collecting and saving ex situ threatened material of landraces of the most important crops. This is now gradually complemented with conservation of wild forms of cultivated plants and their relatives as well as biodiversity in general. This development have received international recognition on the highest level with the Convention on Biodiversity, last year.
   The Convention introduces a number of requirements on the states becoming parties to the Convention, concerning e.g., access to plant genetic resources, national strategies, plans or programmes for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, measures for ex situ conservation, and transfer of knowledge and technologies from developed to developing countries. In this context, particular reference is made to the specific competence of the Institut fur Pflanzengenetik und Kulturpflanzenforschung to contribute in this transfer to cover the extreme need for taxonomy and taxonomists in the developing countries.
   With regard to problems relating to the collecting of material and information, the cost factor for actual collecting of material in developed countries is considered small, while the opposite is true for the collecting of the information. The situation in developing countries tends to be the reverse.
   With respect to maintaining both material and information, both in ex situ and in situ conservation. and seed versus vegetatively propagated material the conclusion is that developed countries comes away with in general lower cost level than developing for the ex situ as well as for in situ conservation.
   Considering the utilization of the genebank material in breeding and plant improvement in developing countries it seems likely that the cost part of this aspect will be low while the probability of gain is high, thus the prize per unit gain becomes lower. With regard perspectives, the developing countries have a very demanding period ahead. In many cases. know-how and scientific competence have to be developed at the same time as material and information has to be rapidly saved from extinction. Considering the economic and population situation in most of those countries a massive support is needed from the international community.
   For Europe, this means that in addition to present internal needs for steeply increased funding to own plant genetic resources conservation due to committments to the Biodiversity Convention, the contribution to developoing countries should be drastically increased.

TI Emergency management of disasters involving livestock in developing
   countries
SO REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE DE L OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES
AB Different disasters have similar consequences on the health and welfare of livestock. Numerous geophysical disasters can exacerbate epizootics, resulting in the deaths of many animals and the reduction of production efficiency. These disasters also present a considerable threat of spoilage of processed foods, endangering public health. Furthermore, large-scale disasters involving animals can modify the long-term stability of national economies, the environment and social structures.
   The authors discuss the vulnerability of the livestock industry to natural disasters and the impact of floods, droughts and transboundary diseases and pests on national economies. Examples are given on how some losses can be avoided, evaluated and compensated. The role of the veterinarian is presented in relation to work conducted by other relief organisations in cases of emergency. In developing countries, mitigation programmes should focus on strengthening global animal health services. Preparedness needs to be community based, with education provided in a timely manner. Effective recovery from disasters should be based on mitigation programmes, including international trade and mutual aid agreements between neighbouring countries to supply appropriate goods and environmentally and culturally appropriate breeds of livestock.
   Disaster relief for the care of livestock should be recognised as a form of humanitarian assistance, given the benefits to be derived for public health and the socio-economic implications of successful intervention.

TI Childhood Diabetes Mellitus and the 'Double Burden of Malnutrition': An
   Emerging Public Health Challenge in Developing Countries
SO JOURNAL OF DIABETES & METABOLISM
AB The 'double burden of malnutrition' refers to the simultaneous existence of both undernutrition and overnutrition in the same population across the life course. Diabetes mellitus (DM) -a major non-communicable disease -has been linked to both chronic undernutrition and obesity; the latter is now assuming prominence in developing countries. The present review aims to highlight the global burden of this non-communicable disease in children and its relationship with the ` double burden of malnutrition'. Type 2 DM has rapidly evolved from a disease of the Western world to a global disease; from a disease of affluence to a disease that now afflicts the poor; and from an adult-onset disease to a disease that is gaining prominence in the pediatric population. Estimates from the International Diabetes Federation show that diabetes affects at least 285 million people worldwide out of which two-thirds occur in developing ( low-to middle-income) countries. The global epicenter of diabetes epidemic is located in China and India as Asia has undergone rapid economic development, urbanization and transitions in nutritional status. Overweight and obesity are propelling the worldwide diabetes epidemic. Central obesity is correlated with both insulin resistance and type 2 DM. Moreover, the scourge of chronic undernutrition among children in tropical developing countries may predispose them to malnutrition-modulated diabetes mellitus (MMDM) later in life. Children in these regions are thus faced with a health-related dilemma. There is an urgent need to develop a comprehensive prevention program targeted at reducing diabetes risk and promoting proper nutrition among children in these countries.

This paper discusses its unfolding during 2008-2009 and traces its initial effects on developing countries. The paper takes note of the greater resilience of many developing countries this time around (as opposed to previous global recessions) and discusses the global responses to the crisis during 2008 and 2009, concluding that the weak response of the rich world to help developing countries may contribute to a paradigm shift in international development.

TI The multidimensionality of energy poverty in Brazil: A historical
   analysis
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB The different dimensions that characterize energy poverty can be assessed by a Multidimensional Energy Poverty Index (MEPI). This study adapts and calculates MEPI for Brazil, which contributes to understanding the evolution of energy poverty incidence and intensity in the country. Using three different energy dimensions - physical access, appliances ownership, and affordability - we calculate MEPI for the 2002-2018 period. Results show that, despite a significant improvement in modern energy fuel access and, in rates of some primary appliance ownership, Brazil still shows a significant prevalence of energy poverty. Problems related to affordability have not been widely solved, and nowadays this remains the main issue: 11% of households still live in conditions of energy poverty, and in rural areas this number reaches 16%. Taking into account Brazil's social and geographic heterogeneity, we characterize energy poverty across different regions and socioeconomic groups. Results show that isolated areas in the northern region are those most lacking in energy services. We also underscore the income inequality that relates to conditions of energy poverty, and conclude that non-energy poor households tend to have an income at least twice as high as that of households considered energy poor.

This paper aims to determine the impact of EG on agriculture in developing countries. This aim was met by conducting a systematic review (SR) of 64 papers from Scopus and Web of Science (WoS). EG has influenced various elements of agriculture in developing countries, including i) product, supply chain, food security, ii) trade, iii) economic, social, political element and environment and iv) technology and research and development (R&D). We propose several policies in this paper to maximise EG's positive impact while minimising its negative impact.

TI Achieving SDG 5, gender equality and empower all women and girls, in
   developing countries: how aid for trade can help?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate whether aggregate and sectoral disbursement of aid for trade (AfT) facilitates achieving gender equality and women empowerment in aid-recipient developing countries for the period 2005-2019. Design/methodology/approach The study develops static and dynamic panel data and empirical specifications and employs fixed effects and generalised method of moments (GMM) estimation techniques to estimate the impact of aggregate AfT and different categories of AfT on women empowerment. The study uses the Gender Inequality Index (GII) and Global Gender Gap Index (GGI) as the proxy measures of SDG-5, where the higher (lower) value of GII (GGI) implies higher gender disparities and lower women empowerment, and vice versa. Findings The study finds that aggregate AfT and aid disbursement for the development of economic infrastructure, productive capability building and trade policy and regulations contribute significantly to achieve women empowerment by reducing gender inequalities concerning the labour force and political participation, education enrolment and better healthcare and by increasing gender gap index in relation to economic participation, educational attainment, health and survival and political empowerment. The impact of aggregate AfT and its different categories is found significant only in low- and lower-middle-income developing countries. The findings also indicate that the impact of AfT is not noticeably different across different regions of the world as well as the religious belief of the developing countries. Practical implications The study recommends that more allocation of gender-responsive AfT, whether aggregated or disaggregated, significantly helps women empowerment and assists developing economies to achieve SDG-5. Originality/value This study is one of the few that investigate the impact of aggregate AfT on gender inequality and women empowerment. This is the foremost study that examines the effects of each individual category of AfT on women empowerment vis-a-vis SDG-5.

First, the nature of the relationship between urbanization and increased resource use is elaborated upon, and the impact of the development transition upon levels of is empirically multiple regression energy consumption analysed in a framework, using cross-national variations in urbanization and other development indicators to estimate a fixed-effects model of the determinants of energy usage. The same set of hypothesized determinants is then used to measure their contribution to estimated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the full set of countries. Next, we focus upon the subsample of developing countries to study the effects of urbanization upon their evolving profiles of energy use, disaggregated by final use sector and fuel type, and estimate the magnitude of the greenhouse effects attributable to each of these component fuel uses. Finally, we present some of the implications of the results for policies toward urbanization and energy strategies for developing countries in the context of global environmental management imperatives.

TI Demystifying pollution haven hypothesis: Role of FDI
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB This study explores the interrelationship between FDI, institutional factors, financial development and sustainability by revisiting the pollution haven (or halo) hypotheses. The data is sourced from the World Development Indicators (WDI) database over the period of 1990-2016, covering 21 developed and developing countries with high carbon emissions. The study uses dynamic panel data estimations by applying the generalized method of moments (GMM) and system-generalized methods of moments (Sys-GMM) over sample countries. The results indicate that FDI has a significant positive impact on environmental degradation. There is evidence of pollution haven hypotheses, especially in developing countries. We contribute to existing literature by revisiting the Environment Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis and presenting the effect of FDI on carbon intensity in the light of institutional factors and financial development. The findings relating to FDI, institutional factors and financial development may cause researchers and policymakers to reiterate the sustainability dimension of foreign capital inflows in both developed and developing countries. We propose the policy framework to include a mandatory Statement of Environmental Disclosures for both listed and unlisted home and host companies at the time of their origin, expansion and fund raising in order to achieve sustainable business goals (SBGs).

AB The purpose of the present study is to analyse the effects of renewable energy and non-renewable energy on sustainable development. This study is pioneering in this respect because it analyses the effect of renewable energy on adjusted net savings, which is a good sustainable development variable. For this purpose, the data of 40 developed and 73 developing countries were included. According to the estimation results obtained in the study, renewable energy has a positive and statistically significant effect on sustainable development both in developed countries and in developing countries. The impact of renewable energy on sustainable development is greater than the impact of non-renewable energy. In this respect, as the renewable energy amount increases, the level of sustainable development increases. According to these results, the fact that countries use renewable energy more than non-renewable energy sources is extremely important in terms of making progress towards sustainability of development and the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.

TI Sustainable and renewable implementation multi-criteria energy model
   (SRIME)-case study: Sri Lanka
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
AB Sustainable and renewable are certainly very appreciated terms nowadays. These words may summarize a whole new attitude towards our world and the people who live in it. This paper's goal is to define an original multi-criteria energy model, named SRIME, specially designed for developing countries. First, an extensive research will be carried out on: energy demand; potential renewable energy, its current know-how and potential future development; potential avoided emissions (CO2, NOX, SO2); and the possible international support versus the in-country possibilities. The precedence constraints will be applied to establish in which degree renewable energy may be substituting for the fossil fuel: the purely economic approach will give way to a sustainable, renewable, development focused energy planning. It must be noted that an innovative function has been specifically included in the SRIME, which evaluates, applying the precedence constraints, the influence renewable energy may have on developing countries rural health and education. Six functions have been established: replaceable amount of fossil energy; CO2, NOX and SO2 avoidable emissions; rural health and education development maximization; and the cost function. These functions will be optimized through the Chebyshev distance (L-infinity) compromise programming minimization, so that the Pareto optimal solution may be obtained.

TI Sustainability out of the past: how archaeology can save the planet
SO WORLD ARCHAEOLOGY
AB There has been much interest in the failures of the past and the environmental disasters that ensued because of poor land management practices. I argue that the successes of the past are of equal importance, and this is increasingly recognized as early agricultural techniques are rediscovered and reinstated. Some of these systems are not only more sustainable than modern technologies, but more resilient in the face of environmental extremes. Ancient engineering and agricultural methods are often more appropriate for developing countries than modern technologies based on fossil fuel and imported materials. As global warming and desertification increase, it is crucial that we learn how to deal with marginal environments in ways that are sustainable and accessible to people in developing countries. Sustainable agriculture can also benefit the developed world by increasing yields, promoting biodiversity and supporting the rural economy.

AB The water crisis is now a global issue and is growing parallelly with the increasing population, urbanization, and industrial progress. Those increases in the water-stressed regions are hampering the economic prospects of the nations. Along with the water scarcity, lack of hygiene, poor sanitation, and water pollution is already hindering the developments of the countries. The most afflicted ones are the developing countries which are at greater risk due to their sizeable population, inadequate infrastructure, and impoverished policies. Accompanying the developing countries many developed nations which are naturally water deficit are also struggling to manage the water crisis. The escalating effects of climate change may disturb the water demand and supply. By extensively reviewing various literature, this paper will assess the current situation of water scarcity and policies of both developed and developing countries from South Asian and Middle Eastern parts of the world, alongside reviewing their policies towards managing the water crisis. The outcome of the research paper is inclusion of lacking provisions which can further strengthen the existing regulatory framework in a way that doesn't affect economic growth meanwhile improving water sustainability.

AB The economic growth and its sustainability have attracted significant interest of academics and policy makers in recent decades. Faster economic growth observed in developing countries has been associated with capital mobility. Therefore, the first aim of this study is to examine the finance-growth link and effectiveness of financial systems in promoting sustainable economic growth in developing countries. On the other hand, developing countries have experienced vast changes in their economic and institutional environment in order to integrate with the world economy. Thus, the second aim of this study is to examine the quality of the institutional environment and its role in providing conditions for sustainable growth in developing countries. The proposed analyses are conducted on the sample of Western Balkan countries using indicators provided by the World Bank database. According to the results of panel data analysis the level of financial development, especially the level of banking sector development, significantly influences the level of economic growth. It can be concluded that international capital flows are not the main determinant of the growth rate of GDP in observed developing countries as well as that financial development leads to economic growth.

TI Equity Analysis: Identifying Who Benefits from Family Planning Programs
SO STUDIES IN FAMILY PLANNING
AB This study examines current disparities in access to family planning services in developing countries with data drawn from 64 Demographic and Health Surveys conducted between 1994 and 2008. The percent of demand satisfied is used as a proxy measure for access to family planning. In all regions, married women aged 15-19 have greater difficulty than older women in meeting their need for contraceptive services. Inequities in the percent of demand satisfied among individuals of varying economic status, area of residence, and education are observed in all regions except Central Asia. These gaps are larger and more common in sub-Saharan Africa. Strategies that seek to increase contraceptive use rapidly without consideration for disadvantaged groups are likely to increase observed inequities in percent of demand satisfied in the short term. Efforts to monitor progress toward the goals enumerated in 1994 at the International Conference on Population and Development and toward other development goals must go beyond global, regional, and national averages to address the needs of population groups that are at greatest risk of adverse health outcomes.

TI Enablers and Constraints of Female Entrepreneurship in Khyber
   Pukhtunkhawa, Pakistan: Institutional and Feminist Perspectives
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Entrepreneurship is often considered a male-gendered concept, and carries masculine connotations. However, the importance of women entrepreneurs and their contribution to the economy has recently been realized. Nonetheless, there is limited research about female entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship in the developing countries context. This paper challenges the implicit masculinism of the traditional entrepreneurship research, and aims to explore the enablers and constraints of female social entrepreneurship within the context of a developing country. Our theoretical focus is based on institutional and feminist perspectives, thus developing logic through reconciling predictions from these two competing theories. This integration contributes by offering novel insights about social entrepreneurship. Utilising an interpretive qualitative research approach, data from in-depth interviews with ten female social entrepreneurs of KP, Pakistan were analyzed using thematic analysis. Empirically, we identify and discuss a number of interesting and explanatory themes affecting female entrepreneurship such as women empowerment, patriarchal culture, role of culture and societal norms, religious extremism and terrorism, forced entrepreneurs, change creators, unique institutional constraints, institutional corruption and security issues. The findings highlight female entrepreneurs' struggle for sustainability, and explain how this occurs. The paper also provides an interesting insight into how context determines social entrepreneurship in KP, Pakistan.

TI Drivers of Sustainable Adoption of Building Information Modelling (BIM)

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which are the backbone of any economy are often on the disadvantaged side of the digital divide in the construction industry. With the advent of building information modelling (BIM), the SMEs are facing challenges and are slow with its uptake. Hitherto, extant research studies on BIM have focused primarily on the large firms and there is an observed trend of underrepresentation of the SMEs in BIM studies. Thus, this paper aims to investigate the major drivers of sustainable adoption of Building Information Modelling in SMEs and the dynamics of these drivers in developing countries using interpretive structural modelling approach and Matrice d'Impacts croises-multipication applique a classement (MICMAC) analysis. The findings reveal that organizational readiness is of utmost importance for the proliferation of BIM in SMEs. Also, the independent drivers which are the most important drivers consist of BIM characteristics, internal and external environment drivers and thus portray the BIM adoption as a complex socio-technical system. This study categorizes the drivers for easy intervention of SMEs' managers and policymakers. It contributes to the nascent studies of BIM adoption in SMEs of developing countries.

TI Appropriate wastewater treatment systems for developing countries:
   criteria and indictor assessment in Thailand
SO WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB This paper presents a comprehensive approach with factors to select appropriate wastewater treatment systems in developing countries in general and Thailand in particular. Instead of focusing merely on the technical dimensions, the study integrates the social, economic, and environmental concerns to develop a set of criteria and indicators (C&I) useful for evaluating appropriate system alternatives. The paper identifies seven elements crucial for technical selection: reliability, simplicity, efficiency, land requirement, affordability, social acceptability, and sustainability. Variables are organized into three hierarchical elements, namely: principles, criteria, and indicators. The study utilizes a mail survey to obtain information from Thai experts-academicians, practitioners, and government officials-to evaluate the C&I list. Responses were received from 33 experts on two multi-criteria analysis inquiries-ranking and rating-to obtain evaluative judgments. Results show that reliability, affordability, and efficiency are among the most important elements, followed by sustainability and social acceptability. Land requirement and simplicity are low in priority with relatively inferior weighting. A number of criteria are then developed to match the contextual environment of each particular condition. A total of 14 criteria are identified which comprised 64 indicators. Unimportant criteria and indicators are discarded after careful consideration, since some of the indicators are local or site specific.

AB Many developing countries whose economy is in transition are changing their structure towards liberalization and open market economies. Because of population growth and restructuring changes in these countries, electricity demand is growing at a high rate of 7-10% annually. As capacity installation in electricity sector is time consuming and requires high capital investments, governments of developing countries are burdened to spend heavy budgets in this sector. Electric sector in these countries is taking into consideration the change from monopoly towards free competition markets and allowing private sector to invest in Electricity capacity expansion. Some developed nations with less capacity growths and stronger markets have experienced busts and booms after deregulation. This feature can result to much more instabilities and higher risks of market collapse if necessary policies and supports are not taken by the governments. This paper examines a case study for Iran which is a developing country for the case in which Generation sector has become completely deregulated and generation market: is open to private sectors to invest for building capacities, operating and owning or transferring to the government (B.O.O and B.O.T schemes). For this purpose, system dynamics modeling has been used to examine the impact of deregulation on generation capacity growth in economies in transition and finding necessary actions required to reach a more stable and sustainable growth after deregulation.

TI Analysis on the equity differential on household healthcare financing in
   developing countries: empirical evidence from Tanzania, East Africa
SO HEALTH ECONOMICS REVIEW
AB Background Achieving equity in healthcare services has been a global priority. According to the literature, a slew of initiatives aimed at increasing household equity in healthcare financing have exacerbated the problem, making it hard for most developing countries to understand the real cause of the problem. Method The non-experimental research design has been used to explore the Tanzania Panel Survey (NPS) data 2019/2020, to investigate equity differential in household healthcare financing in Tanzania by the use of conventional instrumental variable methods of Two-stage and Three-stage least square methods Results Despite the global agenda of universal health coverage, this paper reveals that 86 percent of Tanzania lacks health insurance with a high degree of inequitable distribution of health facilities as 71.54 percent of the population is in rural areas, yet these areas have poor health systems compared to urban ones. These disparities increase pressure on household healthcare financing and widen the inequity and equality gaps simultaneously. Additionally, a household's income, education, health care waivers, out-of-pocket expenditure, and user fees have been found to have a significant impact on household equity in healthcare financing. Conclusion To reverse the situation and increase equity in household healthcare financing in most developing countries, this paper suggests that an adequate pooling system should be used to allow more people to be covered by medical prepayment programs, and the donor-funded programs in developing countries should focus on health sector infrastructure development and not the capacity building.

TI Biodiversity conservation attitudes and policy tools for promoting
   biodiversity in tropical planted forests
SO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB Biodiversity loss poses a real threat to the livelihoods, food security and health of the poor. In Vietnam, nearly 700 species are threatened with national extinction and over 300 species are threatened with global extinction. Deforestation is the main contributor to these biodiversity losses. This study examines biodiversity conservation attitudes of foresters and proposes policy options to promote biodiversity in planted forests. A household survey of 291 foresters in Yen Bai Province, Vietnam, was conducted to examine attitudes to biodiversity conservation. A range of forest policy tools was investigated to find the most appropriate one to enhance biodiversity, given the specific social-economic conditions of foresters. A forest-level optimisation model was employed to design the optimal level of payment for biodiversity conservation. The results suggest that a large number of foresters would agree to the idea of enhancing biodiversity in planted forests if they were financially supported. It is concluded that policy options for the Government of Vietnam include refinements to the current payment scheme and considering increasing the payment level to foresters to enhance biodiversity. These findings may have some generalisability to the plantation forestry sector in other developing countries in tropical zones, and implications for implementing the REDD+ mechanism in developing countries.

However, pavement maintenance backlogs and the high capital costs of road rehabilitation require the use of pavement evaluation tools to assure the best value of the investment. This research presents a methodology for analyzing the collected pavement data for the implementation of a network level pavement management program in Kazakhstan. This methodology, which could also be suitable in other developing countries' road networks, focuses on the survey data processing to determine cost-effective maintenance treatments for each road section. The proposed methodology aims to support a decision-making process for the application of a strategic level business planning analysis, by extracting information from the survey data.

AB Livestock are vital to subsistence farming and sustainable livelihood in most developing countries. Of India's population of one billion people, more than 70 percent live in the rural areas. India also has more than 30 percent of the world's bovine population. This has resulted in not only egalitarian ownership of cattle, but also in an almost inseparable cultural and symbiotic relationship between rural families and their farm animals, particularly large ruminants. It is against this scenario that the ethical, social and environmental issues of gene-based technologies need to be carefully evaluated.
   The use of transgenic cows with modified milk composition or for any other purpose has little economic benefit in a system of "production by masses", as typifies India and a few other developing countries, compared with "mass production" systems in developed countries. Rather, the use of rDNA technology for developing drought-resistant fodder and forage crops is likely to bring immediate relief to most regions. Cattle, particularly in India, have poor quality feeds and this results in poor nutrition, with production of large amounts of methane. Immunocastration through biotechnological means would also be advantageous. Developing countries like India need sustainable livelihood security, and, in this regard, gene-based technologies in animal agriculture seem more to raise ethical, social and environmental concerns, rather than being likely to transform "subsistence farming" into vibrant agribusiness. Ethical issues concerning animal welfare, rights and integrity are also discussed, in addition to social, environmental and economic issues.

We therefore set out to present primary data relating to household food waste disposal for South Africa within the sub-Saharan African context. As the Gauteng Province contributes about 45% of the total municipal waste generated in South Africa, the case study area covers two of the large urban metropolitan municipalities in Gauteng, namely Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg, with a combined population of 8.33 million, representing nearly 15% of the South African population. Municipal solid waste characterisation studies using bulk sampling with randomised grab sub-sampling were undertaken over a 6-week period during summer in 2014 (Johannesburg) and 2016 (Ekurhuleni), covering a representative sample of the municipal waste collection routes from households in each of the two surveyed municipalities. The food waste component of the household waste (excluding garden waste) was 3% in Ekurhuleni and 7% in Johannesburg. The results indicate that an average of 0.48 kg (Ekurhuleni) and 0.69 kg (Johannesburg) of food waste (including inedible parts) is disposed of into the municipal bin per household per week in the two municipalities, respectively. This translates into per capita food waste disposal of 8 kg and 12 kg per annum, respectively, in South Africa as compared to the estimated 6-11 kg per annum in sub-Saharan Africa and South and Southeast Asia.
   Significance:
   Research on food waste in developing countries is limited.
   This study is the first of its kind undertaken in South Africa.
   Food waste research is important to address food security issues.
   This study provides evidence to support Sustainable Development Goal 12.3.

AB Purpose: In the era of global knowledge economy, urban regions-seeking to increase their competitive edge, become destinations for talent and investment, and provide prosperity and quality of life to their inhabitants-have little chance achieving their development goals without forming effective knowledge-based urban development (KBUD) strategies. KBUD paradigm suggests that the economic future of cities increasingly depends on the capacity to attract, generate, retain and foster creativity, knowledge and innovation-and make space and place for knowledge generation and knowledge communities. Thus, the paper aims to shed light on the planning and development processes of the KBUD phenomenon with respect to the construction of sustainable knowledge community precincts (KCPs) aimed at making space for knowledge generation and place for knowledge communities-and provide useful lessons for the developing country cities seeking such sustainable and KBUD.
   Design/methodology/approach: This paper undertakes a thorough review of the literature on KBUD and strategic asset-based planning. The paper conducts policy and best practice analyses to learn from the planning and development processes of internationally renowned KCPs-i.e., from Copenhagen, Eindhoven, Singapore and Sydney. In the light of the sustainable KCP global best practice analyses findings, this paper provides recommendations for successfully establishing space and place for both knowledge economy and society in the developing country cities.
   Originality/value: First, the study presents the empirical findings of a KBUD analysis of six successful KCPs-i.e., from Europe, Asia and Australia-providing a new unique context and setting for the academic discussion. Second, these findings are critically evaluated in light of the literature. Third, the empirical investigation of best practices provides invaluable lessons learned from the global case studies for the developing country cities.
   Practical implications: The paper discusses the findings of a study that scrutinizes the KBUD experience of globally successful cities-primarily focusing on their sustainable KCPs. The research provides an invaluable opportunity to inform the local and regional decision and plan making mechanisms of developing country cities-in building sustainable KCPs.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB The paper describes the main ideas surrounding the topic of innovation for sustainability in developing countries. Innovation is a crucial element to foster sustainability as well as an egalitarian development. The work illustrates that sustainable development is possible by exploiting local potential and traditional knowledge in order to achieve at the same time economic growth, social equality and environmental sustainability. In order to prove such an assumption a specific case study is described: The renewable energy sector in Bolivia. The case study analyses several dimensions of the innovation process in developing countries such as technological transfer, diffusion and adaptation, social dimension and development issues. The Bolivian case showed that it is possible to foster sustainability and local entrepreneurship by triggering the endogenous energies embedded in territories and traditional knowledge.

In this sense, we will try to have the link between corruption governance and economic performance in developing countries. At this level, we are dealing with an empirical study using panel data for a group of 30 developing countries over the period 1998-2011. Indeed, our results show that improving the quality of political institutions is associated with a decrease in the level of corruption and sustainable economic growth in developing countries. Finally, we conclude that the governance increases government accountabilities to citizens and also strengthens their commitment to policies chosen especially in the fight against corruption.

TI Embodied pollution in trade: estimating the 'environmental load
   displacement' of industrialised countries
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB The present paper sets out to aid in the development of 'environmental load displacement' indicators. Developing the notion of the 'environmental memory' of physical flows, we estimated embodied pollution in trade of 18 industrialized countries with (a) the rest of the world and (b) developing countries, from 1976 to 1994. We found that in the last years of analysis, total imports of Japan, USA and Western Europe have entailed, in general, larger air pollutant emissions than local exports, The balance of embodied emissions in trade (BEET) seems to follow an inverted-U shape across time in Japan and Western Europe, and an N-shape in the US. In the period of analysis, Japanese and European environmental terms of trade with developing countries 'improved' (from the Japanese and European point of view), whereas American environmental terms of trade with developing countries 'deteriorated' over time. Although there is no statistical trend between income and embodied emissions in imports in a cross-section analysis, there does seem to be a positive relationship between both variables at a national level. The results suggest that, despite many shortcomings. this type of assessment may shed useful insights on the international aspects of sustainable development. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Corporate Social Responsibility of Foreign Multinationals in a
   Developing Country Context: Insights from Pakistan
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This paper aims to explore the dynamics of corporate social responsibility (CSR) of multinational companies (MNCs) subsidiaries operating in Pakistan. To do this, the corporate social performance (CSP) model, has been modified and integrated with the relevant models of CSR for multinational companies (MNCs). Empirical evidence from MNCs operating in the developing country context was collected and analyzed from MNCs operating in Pakistan. Findings from semi-structured interviews uncover that CSR is yet to institutionalize and most MNC executives understand CSR in narrow philanthropic and ethical terms and ignore the legal and economic aspects. Interestingly, there is evidence that MNCs are able to modify global CSR strategies to respond to local contexts and issues. In addition, the sample MNCs lack systematic environmental scanning, stakeholder management and demonstrate a short-term reactive approach to CSR. We believe that the proposed theoretical framework of the study can be utilized to understand MNCs CSR practices in both developed and developing countries. However, these empirical findings are context bound and cannot be generalized.

TI Impact of Decentralization and Rail Network Extension on Future Traffic
   in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In many large cities in developing countries, investments in transportation infrastructure are insufficient for the growing population, resulting in chronic traffic congestion and overcrowding. The urban population of developing countries is expected to increase further toward the middle of this century, and urban planning and transportation policies that foresee future population changes and economic growth are necessary to make these cities more sustainable. Bangkok is one of the most congested metropolitan areas in the world, and transport projects such as the extension of the public transportation system are being implemented. However, due to the monocentric urban structure, both road and rail traffic is extremely congested during peak hours, which impedes some economic activities and personal interaction. In this study, we simulate the impact of urban and transportation measures in Bangkok from today to 2050. In addition to the expansion of the planned rail transit network, we evaluate the effects of a land use scenario in which sub-centers are established to develop a polycentric urban structure. The impact of alternative zoning and transportation policies and projects in Bangkok is discussed. Although this study is focused on Bangkok, the findings are assumed to be transferable to other large cities in developing countries.

TI FRACTAL ANALYSIS AND THE URBAN MORPHOLOGY OF A CITY IN A DEVELOPING
   COUNTRY: A CASE STUDY OF ISTANBUL
SO MARMARA GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW
AB Cities are complex entities which are the result of social, economic, and technological agents and the physical environment. Understanding the elements influencing the development of cities can assist in understanding not only their historical, but also their future development. The use of fractal analysis is proving to be an innovative technique to study urban morphology and urban form/structure. In this paper, the fractal analysis is applied to Istanbul, as an example of a city in middle income developing country. This study found that the fractal dimension measurements of Istanbul indicate that its overall or global urban structure is similar to major cities in Europe and the United States, such as New York and London. However, the intensity of the development (or fractal dimension) in Istanbul is higher than comparable cities in developed regions, which may be indicative of other urbanized areas in developing countries. The addition of the lacunarity measurement (the measurement of a fractal's texture) would seem to give greater clarity when examining urban fractals. Overall, it appears that due to the globalization of technology that urban structure is making urban structure increasingly similar regardless of the political, cultural or economic climate.

SO ENERGIES
AB The objective of the present work is to assess the global wind and wave resources in the vicinity of some developing countries by evaluating 16-year of data (2001-2016), coming from the European Centre for Medium range Weather Forecast (ECMWF). Until now, not much work has been done to evaluate and use the renewable energy sources from these marine environments. This is because most of the attention was focused on more promising areas, such as the European coasts, which are more advanced in terms of technical and economical aspects. A general perspective of the current energy market from the selected target areas is first presented, indicating at the same time the progresses that have been reported in the field of the renewable energy. Besides the spatial and seasonal variations of the marine resources considered, the results also indicate the energy potential of these coastal environments as well as the performances of some offshore wind turbines, which may operate in these regions.

TI Regulation, governance and the role of the informal sector in
   influencing environmental quality?
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB We investigate the effect of the informal sector and a range of governance indicators on both global and local pollutants for a panel of 58 countries during 1996-2011. The analysis employs a fixed effects-instrumental variable generalized method of moments approach. We find that the size of the informal sector has a significant impact on environmental quality, which is conditional on the level of economic development. For developing countries, the informal sector has a significant positive impact on local pollutants, whereas for the developed countries the informal sector has a significantly negative effect on global pollutants. The findings also reveal that the impact of governance depends on the type of governance measure, the level of economic development and type of pollutant. Control of corruption emerges as the single most important factor especially in the non-OECD countries in improving environmental quality. We argue that the efficacy of an environmental policy for a country with a large informal sector will be low if the policy measures do not address governance, size of the informal sector and environmental policy targets.

TI THE FIGHT AGAINST TOBACCO IN DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES
SO TUBERCLE AND LUNG DISEASE
AB The battle to reduce the tobacco epidemic is not being won; the epidemic is merely being transferred from rich to poor countries. Tobacco-related mortality will rise from the present annual global toll of 3 million to over 10 million by the year 2025. Currently, most of these deaths are in developed countries but 7 out of the 10 million deaths will occur in developing countries by 2025. Developing countries cannot afford this increase, either in terms of human health or in economic costs, such as medical and health care costs, costs of lost productivity, costs of fires or costs of the misuse of land used to grow tobacco. As many of the tobacco-related illnesses, such as lung cancer or emphysema, are incurable even with expensive technology, the key to tobacco control lies in prevention. The essential elements of a national tobacco control policy are the same for all countries throughout the world - the only differences lie in fine tuning to a country's current situation. While indigenous production and consumption of tobacco remain a problem, of particular concern is the penetration of developing countries by the transnational tobacco companies, with aggressive promotional campaigns and the use of political and commercial pressures to open up markets and to promote foreign cigarettes. This includes specific targeting of women, few of whom currently smoke in developing countries. Also, tobacco advertising revenue prevents the media from reporting on the hazards of tobacco, a particularly serious problem in developing countries where awareness of the harmfulness of tobacco is low. Governments in developing countries are often preoccupied with other health or general matters, such as high infant mortality and communicable diseases, and few have experience in fighting this new type of epidemic. In developing countries the legislative controls and other measures which in industrialized countries succeed in limiting the use of tobacco currently lag far behind those taken in developed countries. However, systems are finally being put into place that will eventually reduce the tobacco epidemic - tobacco data are slowly being collected, health education programmes introduced, and legislation implemented.

   analysis
SO SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES
AB This is the first quantitative, cross-national study that incorporates predictors designed to test hypotheses linking overurbanization to environmentally induced migration. The study is based on a sample of fifty-eight developing countries using lagged dependent variable panel regression. Our major findings are quite clear with respect to newer rural-push and urban-pull arguments that developing countries suffering from various forms of environmental degradation are prone to overurbanization. Deforestation exerts a positive and significant effect on overurbanization, whereas environmental sustainability exerts a negative and significant effect on overurbanization. In addition, our results support hypotheses derived from the political modernization perspective that civil society and democratic regimes help to reduce overurbanization, as well as hypotheses suggested by neo-Malthusian theory that high levels of population growth contribute to high levels of overurbanization. We also find support for dependency theory in that transnational economic linkages based on multinational corporations and international lending institutions foster increased overurbanization in the developing world.

AB This paper discusses the need for geospatial information technologies in developing countries to support sustainable development. One of the major issues facing many developing countries is the need for better utilization and protection of their natural resources. In the world's industrialized nations remote sensing and GIS technologies are used in many applications that include, but not limited to, natural resources management and protection, environmental monitoring, agriculture, geology, hydrology and water resource management, disaster management, urban planning, monitoring spread of infectious diseases, and marine studies. These nations have made heavy investment in building and deploying space assets to monitor earth resources. However, very little has been done to promote the leveraging of this investment in technology by developing countries. There are far reaching benefits to these emerging economies through the exploitation of this technology. Not only could they be forewarned about natural disasters to minimize loss of life and property, but, they could use it to enhance their country's critical food supply and water resources and even develop an effective natural resource exploitation (e.g. oil and gas) capability. These capabilities will allow developing countries to become more self-reliant and less dependent on other countries and international aid agencies.
   Remote sensing and GIS technologies can be transferred to developing countries for implementation of large-scale and national GIS systems. Such systems will integrate advanced computing platforms, high-speed networks, high performance image processing and GIS products, sophisticated data capturing devices, state-of-the-art product generation equipment, and robust archival and dissemination elements. A variety of remotely sensed data (multi-temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution), geospatial, and in-situ data will be integrated to generate value-added products, extract thematic/spatial features, and derive information to support operational governmental applications and decision-making
   When fully implemented, a national GIs system will revolutionize public and private sector practices through modernization of records and computerization of services. This technological revolution will significantly contribute to the continual economic and technological advancement. Through such a system, government officials will be provided with reliable, accurate, current data and automated tools to make informed decisions, formulate sound polices, and implement sensible short-term and long-term plans to properly allocate and manage resources. As a result, citizens of developing countries will realize higher standards of living and a wide-range of socioeconomic benefits.

SO PSL QUARTERLY REVIEW
AB The purpose of this study is to assess, from a Balance of Payment Constraint Growth (BPCG) theoretical perspective, current key challenges of developing countries that spring from two broad exogenous factors. These factors are: i) global shocks that affect the world economy, and ii) major economic policy changes in developed countries. The BPCG perspective helps to identify to what extent these challenges are rooted in the developing countries' vulnerabilities and structural weaknesses linked to their role in international trade and capital markets. To discuss the current uncertain global environment potential implications for developing economies - growing inflation, hawkish monetary policy, cross-border flows redistribution, as well as the geopolitical redefinition of international trade and global value chains, among others - the present work builds a BPCG model for the post-COVID era and applies it to evaluate challenges to growth in six countries: Chile, Colombia, Ghana, India, Mexico, and Turkey.

TI Tackling Psychosocial Risks and Work-Related Stress in Developing
   Countries: The Need for a Multilevel Intervention Framework
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRESS MANAGEMENT
AB This exploratory study aimed to provide a framework for raising awareness and tackling emerging psychosocial risks in developing countries. We considered regulation, working conditions, hazardous sectors, health impact, vulnerable workers, and multilevel interventions while recognizing existing challenges and barriers. We used a triangulated methodological approach where each stage provided the basis for the development of the next. Semi-structured expert interviews informed the development of a two-round Delphi survey to build consensus, followed by a series of focus groups to explore findings in-depth. A total of 121 experts participated across all research stages. This article concentrates on the last stage of the research, the focus groups, while making reference to the findings of the first two research stages. Results for developing countries indicate that occupational health and safety priorities have changed during the last decade and point to the need for a comprehensive framework for action, for monitoring psychosocial risks and addressing work-related stress, violence, harassment, and unhealthy behaviors. Attention to socioeconomic conditions and processes of globalization, and an extended research and action paradigm, different from that applied in industrialized countries, are required. There is lack of research, infrastructure, information, and motivation by policymakers to act and a pressing need for capacity building, stakeholder mobilization, and international exchange and collaboration. Developing countries are not spared from the health, economic, and societal impact of psychosocial risks and work-related stress and this article outlines a framework for concerted action at different levels.

TI Use of Drones for construction in developing countries: barriers and
   strategic interventions
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT
AB Drones are argued to assist in alleviating the challenges and enhancing efficiency in construction. Using the construction industry of South Africa and India, and a survey research method, this study, explored the barriers and challenges, and the factors that influence the use of Drones in construction. Also, it evaluated strategies to enhance the use of Drones in construction. A survey research method that includes the collection of data from stakeholders of the construction industry from developing countries such as South Africa and India and relevant statistical methods including ordinal regression model estimation was used for this study. Findings suggested that several barriers and factors under economic, operational, social-legal & environmental, and construction-related aspects influence the use of Drones. However, five strategic measures that include the creation of objective government policy, regulations and legal provisions, enabling competency building through training and piloting licences, permitting airspace for use of Drones for construction in and around construction sites, budgeting the cost of Drones and their operation in the project cost, and creation of organizational culture for adopting technological change can enhance the use of Drones in the construction industry in developing countries.

TI Is there any room for renewable energy innovation in developing and
   transition economies? Data envelopment analysis of energy behaviour and
   resilience data
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Developing countries suffer from greater energy vulnerability and therefore decreased resilience to energy shocks. This feature significantly influences the innovation process which fact calls for selected explorations disentangling the behavioural aspects of socioeconomic and ecological features associated with energy policy. Such an inquiry has the purpose to detect energy efficiency characteristics connected with renewable energy innovation, pollutants and their contribution to enhancing resilience in developing countries. This returns important information on human behaviour related to energy use and policy interventions. To reach these goals, non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is exploited along with the Tobit model. Energy policy and sustainable development data are scrutinised for a total of 148 developing and transition economies. It thus emerges that the innovation in renewable energy improves efficiency, acting on the resilience of the analysed countries. Renewable energy improve the energy efficiency performance both in the case of carbon emissions and particulates. These outcomes clarify the possible role of energy transition and innovation in less industrialised countries. This finding seems to suggest important environmental implications for energy policy modelling.

TI Spatiotemporal differentiation of carbon emission efficiency and
   influencing factors: From the perspective of 136 countries
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The severity of the global climate issue is rising, primarily as a result of excessive carbon dioxide emissions. Climate change is a global problem. How to reduce carbon dioxide emissions while promoting social and economic develop-ment is a problem that all countries need to face. This study examines global carbon emission efficiency in order to make recommendations for comprehensively improving global low-carbon development level. We extend the research scale of carbon emission efficiency from countries, regions, economic belts and sectors to the world, which can show the differences of countries and has theoretical guiding significance for global low-carbon development. This study calculates the carbon emission efficiency for 136 countries from 2000 to 2019 using the Super-EBM model. The discussion that follows examines the temporal and spatial characteristics of carbon emissions efficiency in 136 countries from the perspective of countries, developed and developing countries, and regions. Finally, the Tobit model is used to comprehensively analyze the factors that affect carbon emission efficiency. The results show that: (1) There are great differences in carbon emission efficiency among countries and regions. Only a few countries reach the production frontier, mainly in Europe, which are Switzerland, Luxembourg, Iraq, Norway, Denmark and the United Kingdom. The carbon emission efficiency of most countries is not ideal, being mainly concentrated in Asia and Africa, and has not achieved significant improvement over time. Asia has the lowest carbon emission efficiency. Mongolia, Ukraine, Iran, Angola, Belarus and Uzbekistan are the key governance areas for global energy conservation and carbon emis-sions reduction. (2) Developed countries have the much higher average carbon emission efficiency than developing countries. Combined with the industrial development stages of developed and developing countries, this is in line with the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. The average carbon emission efficiency gap between developing and developed countries shows a trend of "first narrowing and then widening", which demonstrates that developing countries' reliance on energy input to boost their economies will improve carbon emission efficiency, but only temporarily. (3) Urbanization level, foreign trade and proportion of renewable energy effectively improve the car-bon emission efficiency, while industrial structure and proportion of electricity users have an inhibitory effect on the carbon emission efficiency. Global low-carbon development should be hastened by strengthening international cooperation, optimizing industrial structure, promoting urbanization and foreign trade, and adjusting the energy structure.

TI SMEs respond to climate change: Evidence from developing countries
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB Given the concerns stemming from climate change, it is important to investigate whether SMEs could become innovative (and thereby invest in technologies mitigating climate change) because of heightened climate change risk. This study explores the impact of climate change on SMEs' innovation from a resource-based view (RBV) standpoint. Using the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation of panel data for 443 SMEs from 14 developing countries during the period 2007-2016, we found that climate change has a significant positive impact on SMEs' innovation performance. In economic terms, climate change of one standard deviation variation resulted in a 6.6 % increase in innovation investment. Interesting results emerged when the sample was divided into firms with high and low growth, high and low profit, and high and low slack resources, and industries with high and low vulnerability. The results show that SMEs' innovation response to climate change may vary sub-stantially across firms and industries. In high-growth, high-slack-resources firms, and in highly profitable and non-vulnerable industries, SMEs' innovation responds positively to climate change. Our study contributes to the SME and climate change literature by being the first to examine the impact of climate change on SMEs' inno-vation. Managerial and policy implications are discussed.

TI Production of solid biofuels from organic waste in developing countries:
   A review from sustainability and economic feasibility perspectives
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The current increase in the world population and its energy demand promotes the study and implementation of cleaner energy forms since the traditional energy recovery systems are seriously affecting the environment. Biofuels and especially biomass or solid biofuels represent a sustainable energy source for developed and developing countries. This review aims to discuss the characteristics and advantages of solid biofuels, analyse the pretreatments and thermal treatments required to recover energy, and compare them with traditional fossil fuels. Other areas such as the sustainability and economic feasibility of solid biofuels are likewise addressed by explaining frequently used tools to evaluate the environmental impact as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Comparatively, more recent methodologies are examined as efforts for accomplishing sustainability in the biofuel industry, namely Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) and certification schemes like the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), the Inter-American Development Bank Sustainability Scorecard, and initiatives like the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Finally, it was revealed that the economic feasibility and competitiveness of solid biofuels differ among developing countries but represent a notable contribution to their energy matrix.

AB As a social rule, institution can coordinate social economic relations and reduce transaction cost in social economic activities. Institution quality refers to the general name of institution's quality and degree. A good institution can promote the all-round development of economy, society and people, whereas a bad one curbs social development and realization of justice. Most developing countries don't lack corresponding institutions, but quality systems. With the current development pattern of the world economy, the competition among countries is not only manifested in the hardware environment such as economy scale, but also gradually turned to soft power like institution quality. For China, as the most competitive developing country, issues such as how to compete with developed countries in terms of institution, remedying deficiency in its own institution quality, reducing the gap with developed countries, creating its own institution advantage, and promoting sustainable economic and social development have far-reaching practical significance.

TI Extension of energy crops on surplus agricultural lands: A potentially
   viable option in developing countries while fossil fuel reserves are
   diminishing
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB The rapid depletion of fossil fuel reserves and environmental concerns with their combustion necessitate looking for alternative sources for long term sustainability of the world. These concerns also appear serious in developing countries who are striving for rapid economic growth. The net biomass growing potential on the global land surface is 10 times more than the global food, feed, fiber, and energy demands. This study investigates whether the developing countries have sufficient land resource to meet the projected energy demand towards 2035 by planting energy crops on surplus agricultural land after food and feed production. The annual yields of four commonly grown energy crops specifically jatropha, switchgrass, miscanthus, and willow have been used to make scenarios and estimate land requirements against each scenario. This paper first performs literature reviews on the availability of land resource, past and future trends in land use changes, demand of lands for food production, and potential expansion of croplands. The energy demands towards 2035 are compiled from energy scenarios derived by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the British Petroleum (BP). This paper also reviewed bio-physiological characteristics of these energy crops to determine whether they are cultivable under tropical climatic conditions in developing regions. This paper found that projected energy demand through 2035 in developing regions could be provided by energy crops grown on a portion of surplus croplands or upgraded grasslands (27% and 22% respectively for miscanthus scenario). Sustainable land management practices, improved agricultural productivity, and adopting suitable energy crops cultivation can potentially supply increasing energy demands. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI MANAGEMENT OF THE QUALITY OF WATER RESOURCES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
   BASED ON INDUSTRIAL AND MANUFACTURING ENGINEERING
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR QUALITY RESEARCH
AB The goal of this paper is to justify the prospects and develop recommendations for consistent management of the quality of water resources for sustainable development based on industrial and manufacturing engineering, while taking into account the specific features of developed and developing countries. The originality of the research is that water resources are considered in terms of quality, and a consistent scientific view of the quality of water resources is formed for the first time in the unity of all its signs. It is suggested to use the methodology of comprehensive quality measurement which is being tested using the example of developed and developing countries in 2020. The uniqueness of the paper consists in the development of a new, non-financial approach to managing the quality of water resources, one that would involve reliance on industrial and manufacturing engineering in the digital economy. The novel nature of the research consists in examining the experience of developed and developing countries in order to identify and take into account their specific features and to develop specific highly-refined application-specific recommendations to ensure high efficiency management of the quality of water resources. In order to improve the quality of water resources in developed countries, it is recommended that e-government is developed by 95.74 per cent, and the active use of Big Data and analytics is increased by 96 per cent. In developing countries, it is recommended that the degree of robots distribution is increased by 96.02 per cent.

TI What makes consumers adopt to innovative energy services in the energy
   market? A review of incentives and barriers
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB The paper provides a review of the incentives and barriers of a successful adoption of innovative energy services (IES) in the energy market. Although IES can have different attributes and roles, they still have a lot in common with each other.
   On the other hand, the literature suggests that to achieve large market penetration rates of IES, the consumers must be firstly aware of them. They must be also supported by the access to reliable information and advice to limit their confusion of choice. The perceived difficulty of adoption has to be reduced to encourage consumers to get interested in the services. Also the distribution channels of the innovations, namely social influence in the consumers' social networks and advertisement in mass-media should be effectively used to boost the diffusion.
   We analyze a great number of research studies, field experiments and mathematical models in order to firstly summarize the findings related to incentives and barriers of IES adoption among customers, then to recognize recent trends in examining these services and modeling and finally to propose some strategies that could boost the diffusion of IES.
   We argue that to overcome the barriers of adoption, the entities involved in creating and offering IES (e.g. policy makers, energy suppliers and power system operators) should find a way to offer and promote these services together. Such a strategy can bring a synergic effect and increase the financial and non-financial benefits to the consumers and hence increase their interest and engagement.

TI Inviting MNFs' green offshoring: Is it an effective way to coordinate
   economic and environmental sustainability?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB Nowadays, to achieve sustainable development, many developing countries are worrying about the deteriorating lock-in issues of high carbon. Therefore, policies including tax break, consumer green education, and subsidy for green production are set out to motivate multinational firms (MNFs) to build green factories in developing countries. This results in transboundary issues that induce MNFs' offshoring besides the traditional consideration of production cost. In this paper, we formulate the tradeoffs of an MNF headquartered in a developed country in building green factories overseas in developing countries that help the latter reshape urban infrastructure and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We show that the MNF's offshoring cost (e.g., the supply chain decentralization loss and the overseas delivery time cost) can be compensated by the tax-planning benefit because of the developing countries' tax break policies. We also show that the softened downstream market competition, improved consumer green awareness, and subsidy for green production serve as alternative weapons to encourage the MNFs to build green factories in developing countries.

TI Suitability of pavement type for developing countries from an economic
   perspective using life cycle cost analysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PAVEMENT RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Road infrastructure plays a significant role in enriching economy of a developing country. Sustainability of transportation infrastructure aids in this development process, hence road authorities thrive to build roads with longer service life. Bangladesh being a developing country, road maintenance and management task have become a challenge due to tropical weather condition and traffic stream with overloaded vehicles. Flexible pavements constitute most of the pavements in this country, and it has been found that these pavements lose their serviceability at the end of fifth year instead of sustaining for the design period of twenty years. Under such circumstances, rigid pavement can be a possible alternative. In this study, life cycle cost analysis of both rigid and flexible pavements have been performed for a particular case study of Sylhet-Bholaganj Road Project. Future costs have been estimated using growth factor, then all associated costs have been converted to Net Present Value (NPV) to estimate the life cycle cost. The life cycle cost analysis was performed using the Roads and Highways Department (RHD) Schedule of Rates 2015 and 2002 version for performing sensitivity analysis and it has revealed that rigid pavement is economically superior to flexible pavement. The need of frequent periodic maintenance of flexible pavement causes its life cycle cost to increase significantly whereas rigid pavements do not need costly periodic maintenance. Rigid pavements follow the build and forget concept which eventually makes it economically viable and sustainable type of pavement especially for developing countries facing overloading phenomenon under tropical climate.

SO SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY
AB Objective. The purpose of this study is to explore sources and varieties of environmentalism in developing countries. Methods. Environmentalism in developing countries with both rich and poor natural resources is investigated. As a more industrialized developing country with poor natural resources, Korea is analyzed empirically to show evidence of diversity in environmentalism in developing countries, using data from a survey of a large Korean city. Results. In developing countries, environmentalism is inevitably interrelated to industrialization and various social and natural conditions. In Korea, environmentalism is characterized in diverse ways: environmentalism as a means for political activists to achieve democracy, environmentalism for health and safety, and environmentalism against "the very material effluents of affluence," as well as victim-based environmentalism. The effects on environmentalism of age, religion, and income of the population are also different from those in the United States. Conclusions. Environmentalism in developing countries is rooted in diverse sources and is qualitatively different from Western environmentalism. Future studies of environmentalism in developing countries should take into account the natural, economic, political, religious, sociocultural, and objective environmental conditions.

TI An extended institutional theory perspective on the adoption of circular
   economy practices: Insights from the seafood industry
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB The management of seafood processing by-products (SPBPs) is an interesting but underexplored topic in the circular economy (CE) research stream. The extant CE literature is mainly devoted to the topic's theoretical aspects and largely neglects the linkages between theory and practice, particularly in developing countries. This paper aims to empirically investigate CE implementation and its associated drivers and barriers in the context of SPBP management in a developing country. A multiple-case design is used on a sample of five firms that engage in SPBP treatment in Vietnam. We find evidence of circular practices in SPBP management that aim at cascading use and higher value creation. We also delineate eight drivers and 14 barriers rooted in four clusters: regulatory, socio-cognitive, economic and supply chain, and technological factors. In addition to generic factors, we identify three exclusive drivers and five unique barriers specific to our cases. The findings are then interpreted through the lens of extended institutional theory to derive a holistic framework that captures the dynamic influences of various factors on CE diffusion. Our framework includes two add-ons: institutional logic and uncertainty. 'Legitimacy-embedded efficiency' is established as a shared logic of CE, whereby economic growth is achieved in harmony with environmental protection via the optimal use of resources. Uncertainty moderates the relative influences of legitimacy and efficiency-related factors on CE diffusion. Our practical contribution is to offer an actionable guide for key stakeholders of the SPBP supply chain, including local authorities in the transition from low-efficiency practices to novel circular ones.

AB This paper is part of a broader research on the relationship between globalization and institutional quality in developed and developing countries. Institutional quality is approached here in terms of three basic parameters - quality of life, quality of governance and business conditions. Globalization is often understood as increasing global economic integration, global forms of governance and globally inter-linked social and environmental development. The aim of this article is to map, analyze and evaluate, by means of statistical analysis, the mutual relationships between three dimensions of globalization (economic, social and political) and the quality of governance in developing countries and developed market economies. The first part provides the methodology of measuring overall globalization using the composite Index of Globalization KOF 2011. The second part introduces a way of measuring the quality of governance: for this purpose Worldwide Governance Indicators - WGI 2011 are used, respectively the aggregate indicator of the quality of governance matters. The third part compares indices and scores together and analyzes them. It is possible to conclude from the results that a statistically significant association between globalization and governance matters was demonstrated for both groups of countries with one exception: the quality of governance in developed and developing countries is not significantly correlated with the country's political dimension of globalization.

AB Cyber security awareness among smartphone users is becoming one of the main challenges of cyber security in both developed and developing countries. This paper focuses on Thailand, a developing country that is ranked among the riskiest countries in the world with regards to cybercrime. Through a survey exploring the knowledge and practices of Thai student smartphone owners, as the young population is the largest user group, we seek to estimate the level of their cyber security awareness about the most common risks. The findings reveal that they are most susceptible to identity theft or data compromise, while they were on the whole found to have a higher level of security awareness than students in other countries. We argue for Thailand's digital economy to be sustainable, ICT4D projects need to extend their focus to this population of smartphone users to increase security awareness.

TI Is Eco-Certification a Win-Win for Developing Country Agriculture?
   Organic Coffee Certification in Colombia
SO WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB According to advocates, eco-certification is a win win solution to the problem of environmental degradation caused by developing country agriculture, improving both the environmental and the economic performance of farmers. However, these notional benefits can be undercut by the tendency of relatively wealthy farmers already meeting eco-certification standards to disproportionately participate. Using original farm-level survey data along with matching and matched difference-in-differences models, we analyze the producer-level effects of organic coffee certification in southeastern Colombia. We find that certification is associated with changes in farm practices linked to improved environmental outcomes. It significantly reduces sewage disposal in the fields and increases the adoption of organic fertilizer. However, we are not able to discern economic benefits. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI SPECIALIZATION VERSUS DIVERSIFICATION AS ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES FOR
   SUSTAINABLE GROWTH IN RESOURCE-RICH DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. CASE OF
   NIGERIA
SO STUDIA UNIVERSITATIS VASILE GOLDIS ARAD SERIA STIINTE ECONOMICE
AB The question of whether developing countries should pursue specialization or diversification in export as a driver of sustainable economic growth has been a subject of an intense debate in economic literature. At present, one understanding of the debate, as postulated by Imbs and Wacziarg (2003), is that economies grow through two stages of diversification and concentration as income grows: they initially diversify but re-specialize once a (relatively) high level of income per capita is attained. A U-shaped curve best explains the notion. With Nigeria as a reference country, we employed ARDL procedure and examined the aforementioned exposition over the period 1960-2019. Specifically, the non-monotonic relationship between diversification and growth is examined. In furtherance, we examined the impact of diversification on the effect of non-oil exports on growth. Employing an augmented production-function framework and two distinct measures of diversification, we find, contrary to the Imbs-Wacziarg notion, a monotonic (increasing) relationship between diversification and growth, suggesting that diversification, rather than specialization, continues with growth. Applying a similar framework and five different measures of non-oil exports, we find that the impact of diversification on the effects of agricultural and industrial sectors on growth is higher, as compared to building and construction, wholesale and retail, services sectors.

AB In a globalized world, the world trade fleet plays a pivotal role in limiting transport costs. But, the management of obsolete ships is an acute problem, with most Ship Recycling Facilities (SRF) situated in developing countries. They are renowned for their controversial work and safety conditions and their environmental impact. Paradoxically, dismantlement is paid for by the shipowners in accordance with international conventions therefore it is more profitable for them to sell off ships destined for scrapping. Scuttling, the alternative to scrapping, is assessed in the present review to compare the cost/benefit ratios of the two approaches. Although scrapping provides employment and raw materials - but with environmental, health and safety costs - scuttling provides fisheries and diving tourism opportunities but needs appropriate management to avoid organic and metal pollution, introduction of invasive species and exacerbation of coastal erosion. It is also limited by appropriate bottom depth, ship type and number. The present review inventories the environmental, health, safety, economic, and forensic aspects of each alternative.

TI Empirical analysis of crop diversification and energy poverty in Ghana
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB Despite the importance of energy in countries' economies, the vast majority of people, especially in developing countries, live under the energy poverty line. To mitigate this trend, several policy options have been enacted to promote the use of clean and modern fuels given the targets set out in the Sustainable Development Goal Two (SDG2). However, there is a lack of systematic empirical evidence on how crop diversification can alleviate energy poverty in developing countries. This study used the seventh round of the Ghana Living Standard Survey (GLSS 7) to test the effect of crop diversification on the multidimensional energy poverty index (MEPI). I employ the instrumental variable (IV) and the Lewbel two stage least squares (2SLS) techniques and perform several robustness checks to address the potential endogeneity in crop choices. The estimates show that crop diversification is associated with a 0.829 standard deviation decreases in household energy poverty. The effect is prominent for urban and high-income earning households. Household income is identified as the main potential channel through which crop diversification influences energy poverty.

TI Ending fishery overexploitation by expanding from local successes to
   globalized solutions
SO NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
AB The United Nations has launched several initiatives to achiewe sustainable development, with the most recent being the Sustainable Development Goals within the 2030 Agenda. In a fisheries context, this initiative sets a target of ending oerexploitation by 2020. Despite such efforts, the percentage of overfished fish stocks has oscillated around 30% globally since 2009. Here, we show that while developed countries are improving the way they manage their fisheries, developing countries face a worsening situation in terms of overcapacity, production per unit of effort and stock status. This situation is fuelled by economic interdependencies through international trade and fisheries agreements coupled with limited management and governance capacities in developing countries. We conclude that the present successes accomplished in some countries and regions are not sufficient to address the fisheries crisis and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals target globally. We highlight an urgent need to replicate and readapt successful policies and measures in the light of the realities of specific fisheries, and to implement transformational changes in fishery management and governance that influence entire sectors of the economy.

TI Integrating social-ecological dynamics and resilience into energy
   systems research
SO ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB The ecological impact of energy production and consumption is often relegated in analytical accounts of the evolution of energy systems, where production and consumption patterns are analysed as the interaction of social, economic and technological factors. Ecological and social-ecological dynamics are, we argue, critical in the context of imperatives for access to modern energy services that are inadequate for significant sections of the world's population. The ecological impacts of energy use are often analysed as a set of externalities, many of which are uncertain or unquantifiable, particularly if they stem from earth system change such as anthropogenic climate change. Here we outline the benefits from analysing energy systems as social-ecological systems. We review the extensive literature from ecology and resilience theories, and compare the analytical domains, major findings and emphasis of social-ecological systems with socio-technical transition research. We illustrate these differences with the example of the multiscale impacts of biofuel expansion. We show that social-ecological systems research combines analysis of interactions with ecological systems and power relations between actors in energy systems, and has the potential to do so across production, distribution and consumption domains whilst illustrating the dynamics of such energy systems, identifying potential trade-offs and regime shifts.

AB Prospective studies generally evaluate the contribution of solar energy to the world energy mix in the range of hundreds of Mtoe. Considering the actual mature solar technologies, this figure leads to a potential of hundreds of solar power plants at the horizon 2020. Development of such a programme requires RD&D to reduce costs and elaborate new systems. It requires also incentives to favour the initial market penetration in a context of low prices of energy. Along with some other technologies, solar power has the potential to mitigate the CO2 problem and therefore appears as a competitor in the international environment protection system. Several economic tools are available or under discussion to help financing the "incremental cost" of development projects in developing countries which are less emitting than current practices. The concept of activities implemented jointly" can foster the partnerships for both climate and development, and finally give support to solar energy. As a non polluting and long lasting technology, solar thermal power appears as a potential contributor to sustainable development. Nevertheless, in the context of hard competition for financing priorities, it has to prove that it is really good for economic development and that developing countries can afford it.

In developing countries, their existence is not only compatible and complementary, but also necessary, since they meet different needs and pursue diverse and essential objectives, in addition to collecting and sharing geo-located data. In this context, this paper describes the Leon Emergente initiative, a collaborative living atlas for the city of Leon in Nicaragua. The results are presented through two main maps that illustrate, for the first time, the formal and informal economic activity of the city as well as the health facilities in relation to the distribution of population across the city.

TI Understanding, recognizing, and sharing energy poverty knowledge and
   gaps in Latin America and the Caribbean - because conocer es resolver
SO ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB Despite specific historical, geographical, sociodemographic, and infrastructural conditions that in combination could produce very high levels of energy vulnerability, there are significant and enduring knowledge gaps concerning energy poverty in Latin America and the Caribbean. Bringing together a multi-disciplinary and multinational team, we focus on establishing the state-of-the-art in knowledge and policy for 5 diverse case studies Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, and Mexico - as well as for the wider region. Our article has three specific aims: to establish the range of approaches used to research energy poverty across the region; to examine national and supranational policy obligations; and to lay the framework for new research and policy agendas. In combination, our extensive academic and grey literature reviews, and accompanying scientometric, legal and statistical analyses, confirm that energy poverty is a relatively nascent topic, with only 62 scientific articles on the region published since 1991. From this body of knowledge, we identify key differences in the geographies of energy poverty identified by different metrics, with energy services-based approaches generally indicating higher vulnerability within rural areas, while energy expenditure metrics point towards higher risk in urban areas. We also find a dominance of quantitative approaches that tend to use existing (and often limited) forms of survey data, and a relative absence of detailed qualitative research. As such, we argue there is an urgent need for transformative research and policy activities within Latin America and the Caribbean, in order to support access to clean, reliable, and affordable energy services for all.

TI Role of financial inclusion and ICT for sustainable economic development
   in developing countries
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB Sustainable economic development and its close link with financial inclusion have gained so much attention in the empirical literature in the past. However, with the advent of information and communication technology and its association with financial platforms, a system has emerged that offers new opportunities to fill the wealth gaps in the developing world. Empirical investigations are rare in the context of the developing region, and this study strives to fill this gap. We aim to investigate this link for developing countries based on innovation diffusion theory. For this purpose, we select an extended sample of 110 developing countries from 2004 to 2020. Through principal component analysis, we formulate composite financial inclusion and ICT indicators based on broader attributes. We employed Driscoll-Kraay standard errors (D-K), Generalized linear model (GLM), feasible general least squares (FGLS), and difference GMM to obtain compressive and consistent regression coefficients without the need to address temporal dependence and heteroscedasticity. The robust panel estimation illustrates a significantly positive effect of financial inclusion, information communication and technology and sustainable economic development. Our results hold for subsamples based on different income levels of countries. The policymakers are recommended to develop policies for an inclusive financial system and access to ICT on an equitable basis to ensure sustainable economic growth.

AB The activities in agricultural biotechnology are progressing rapidly, but the benefits of this new biological revolution have not yet reached the poorest parts of the world. One reason is that developing countries lack intellectual property rights (IPRs) protection, which limits the private sector's ability to introduce cutting-edge technology to these countries. Strengthened IPRs at the national level do not just serve the current net exporters of technology; in the long run they also promote sustainable economic growth in developing countries. Companies from the developed world have a role to play in the targeted transfer of technologies and know-how to local agencies in the developing world that can support subsistence farmers. These technologies must be in a form that can help improve the quality of life of the local population. Only then can we say that the developed world is helping to optimize the benefits of biotechnology for the poor.

TI Green transition, industrial policy, and economic development
SO OXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY
AB This paper outlines possibilities for a green industrial policy with particular emphasis on developing countries. The question of green industrial policy is investigated by examining experiences and barriers to phasing-in green technologies, focusing on solar PV and energy efficiency as areas for a green industrial policy. The paper outlines a green transition approach to sustain a shift to cleaner and more energy-efficient production processes through clever policy mixes involving elements of push and pull. Rent management and policy adaptation by competent authorities are also part of the model. The paper offers concrete guidance to the question of what governments in developing countries can usefully and realistically do to phase in green technologies given the priorities for development, imperfect institutions for policy-making and implementation, weakly developed innovation systems, and problems of lock-in.

TI Exploratory research on digitalization transformation practices within
   supply chain management context in developing countries specifically
   Egypt in the MENA region
SO COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB With no doubt, the adoption of Artificial Intelligence applications in customer service reduces the time to market. Nevertheless, the question remains whether or not its adoption in production and logistics will transform the supply chain into a more agile one in developing countries context. Manufacturers are increasingly facing global competition to fulfil incoming orders within limited lead time, and in compliance with the international quality standards, also supporting a customised service. The emergence of industry 4.0 brought many promises to the leading firms. This research paper gives insight information for applying AI algorithms in production cycle then monitoring the production process and subsequently leading to strategic and tactical engineering decisions through the investigation of a number of case studies. The investigation demonstrates that incorporating AI technologies and machine learning opens up fresh perspectives on a variety of topics, including warehousing and logistics management, cooperation, and supply chain management. AI is embraced by business for productivity improvement, given the fact that the more AI adoption rate, the less employment rate and wages will be. Information & Communication Technology alignment model is endorsed in this paper in order to grant fostering of an environment that streamlines, incentivizes and supports AI expansion prior the implementation of any AI practices to ensure its successful and justified investments. The research concludes that the process is extremely challenging in the context of emerging economies which is restricted with low wages rate, inadequate labour skills and insufficient financial resources.

TI Emerging Market Countries' Access to International Financial Markets
SO INTERNATIONAL ADVANCES IN ECONOMIC RESEARCH
AB Recent global imbalances have changed the way international capital flows are shared among developed and developing countries. In the new environment, the U.S., a former lender, has become a borrower. This article discusses how the privileged position of this new borrower might influence developing countries' access to international financial markets. It suggests that for some emerging market countries, the recent increase in current account surpluses might be because of worsening in their borrowing opportunities. Empirical analysis for 39 emerging market economies shows that the increase in the U.S. deficit limited the access of emerging market economies that we analyzed in Commonwealth of Independent States, Developing Asia, Central and Eastern Europe to international financial markets for the 1980-2009 time period.

TI Urbanization and Floods in Sub-Saharan Africa: Spatiotemporal Study and
   Analysis of Vulnerability Factors-Case of Antananarivo Agglomeration
   (Madagascar)
SO WATER
AB Flooding is currently one of the major threats to cities in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The demographic change caused by the high rate of natural increase, combined with the migration toward cities, leads to a strong demand for housing and promotes urbanization. Given the insufficiency or absence of adequate planning, many constructions are installed in flood-prone zones, often without adequate infrastructure, especially drainage systems. This makes them very vulnerable. Our research consists of carrying out a spatiotemporal analysis of the agglomeration of Antananarivo (Madagascar). It shows that urbanization leads to increased exposure of populations and constructions to floods. There is a pressure on land in flood-prone zones due to the exponential growth of the population at the agglomeration level. Some 32% of the population of the Antananarivo agglomeration lived in flood-prone zones in 2018. An analysis of the evolution of built spaces from 1953 to 2017 highlights that urban expansion was intense over those years (6.1% yearly increase of built areas). This expansion triggered the construction of built areas in flood-prone zones, which evolved from 399 ha in 1953 to 3675 ha in 2017. In 2017, 23% of the buildings in the agglomeration, i.e., almost one out of every four buildings, were in flood-prone zones. A share of the urban expansion in flood-prone zones is related to informal developments that gather highly vulnerable groups with very little in terms of economic resources. Better integration of flood risk management in spatial planning policies thus appears to be an essential step to guide decisions so as to coordinate the development of urban areas and drainage networks in a sustainable way, considering the vulnerability of the population living in the most exposed areas.

AB Since global warming has seriously endangered the living environment of human being and their health and safety, the development of low-carbon economy has become an irreversible global trend. Under the background of economic globalization, low-carbon economy will surely exert a significant impact on global trade pattern. Countries are paying more and more attention to the green trade. The emission permits trade of carbon between the developed countries and the developing countries has become more mature than ever. The carbon tariff caused by the distribution of the "big cake" will make the low-cost advantage in developing countries cease to exist, which will, in turn, affect the foreign trade, economic development, employment and people's living in developing countries. Therefore, under the background of this trend, we should perfect the relevant laws and regulations on trade and environment as soon as possible, optimize trade structure, promote greatly the development of service trade, transform thoroughly the mode of development in foreign trade, take advantage of the international carbon trading market by increasing the added value of export products resulted from technological innovation to achieve mutual benefit and win-win results and promote common development.

TI Households from developing countries do not sort their solid waste:
   truth or myth?
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB By practicing solid waste source separation, some materials can be reused or recycled, thus achieving environmental, economic, and social benefits. Solid waste source separation reduces the emission of gases that cause global warming and climate change. Despite its benefits, previous studies have shown that it is a rare practice in households in developing countries. In this study, the behavior of households in Ecuador is analyzed regarding the separation of organic and inorganic waste. The importance of studying both the urban and rural population is highlighted, and it is found that glass is the least classified material in the country. Moreover, it is shown that the level of education and access to the Internet are determinants of household behavior when separating waste. However, this effect is greater in the rural population than in the urban one. Finally, public policies are recommended according to the results obtained.

TI Prioritizing health problems in women in developing countries: comparing
   the financial burden of reproductive tract infections, anaemia and
   depressive disorders in a community survey in India
SO TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB OBJECTIVE To compare the health care and opportunity costs of three common health problems [depressive disorders, reproductive tract infections (RTIs) and anaemia] affecting women and their associated risks of catastrophic health expenditure (defined a priori as out-of-pocket expenditure on health care exceeding 10% of the total monthly household income).
   METHODS Cross-sectional survey of 2494 women who consented to participate, from a randomly selected sample of 3000 women aged 18-50, living in the catchment area of a primary health centre in Goa, India. Depressive disorders were diagnosed with the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule; anaemia on the basis of a fingerprick sample of blood using the Haemocue system; and RTI using PCR, culture and microscopy with vaginal or urine specimens. Economic consequences were measured using the Costs of Illness Schedule and the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule. Health provision costs were calculated using previously derived unit costs for services for the main types of health care provider.
   RESULTS Catastrophic health expenditure, defined a priori as > 10% of total household income spent out of pocket on health in the previous month, was reported by 138 women (5.5%; CI: 4.7-6.5%); they were more likely to report economic difficulties, such as having gone hungry in the past 3 months because of lack of money (OR 1.99, CI 1.1-3.6, P = 0.02). Only depressive disorder was associated with significantly higher health care costs, lost time costs and risk of catastrophic health expenditure (OR 2.66, CI 1.6-4.4, P < 0.001, after adjustment for possible sociodemographic confounders and other physical health problems). There was a linear association between the psychological morbidity score (arranged into quintile groups) and the risk of catastrophic health expenditure (adjusted).
   CONCLUSIONS If economic arguments were considered a key driver for global health policy, then depressive disorder should be considered a major health priority for women in developing countries.

TI Dial "A" for agriculture: a review of information and communication
   technologies for agricultural extension in developing countries
SO AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB Agriculture can serve as an important engine for economic growth in developing countries, yet yields in these countries have lagged far behind those in developed countries for decades. One potential mechanism for increasing yields is the use of improved agricultural technologies, such as fertilizers, seeds, and cropping techniques. Public sector programs have attempted to overcome information-related barriers to technological adoption by providing agricultural extension services. While such programs have been widely criticized for their limited scale, sustainability, and impact, the rapid spread of mobile phone coverage in developing countries provides a unique opportunity to facilitate technological adoption via information and communication technology (ICT)-based extension programs. This article outlines the potential mechanisms through which ICT could facilitate agricultural adoption and the provision of extension services in developing countries. It then reviews existing programs using ICT for agriculture, categorized by the mechanism (voice, text, internet, and mobile money transfers) and the type of services provided. Finally, we identify potential constraints to such programs in terms of design and implementation, and conclude with some recommendations for implementing field-based research on the impact of these programs on farmers' knowledge, technological adoption, and welfare.

TI Reuse of Waste Plastics in Developing Countries: Properties of Waste
   Plastic-Sand Composites
SO WASTE AND BIOMASS VALORIZATION
AB Waste plastics are a major problem in developing countries, where efficient collection and recycling systems often do not exist. Plastic bonded sand composites provide a low-cost recycling alternative for selected waste plastics. This research has investigated the production and properties of plastic bonded sand manufactured using low-density and high-density polyethylene (LDPE and HDPE). Plastic bonded sand production in The Gambia was used as a case study to identify potential barriers to the technology. Processing was done by oven moulding, or a heat-mixing technique, and the properties of the LDPE and HDPE bonded sand samples formed have been determined. Processing at temperatures between 250 degrees C and 325 degrees C produced optimum compressive and flexural strengths. Higher processing temperatures reduced strength and lower temperatures produced inhomogeneous samples. Thermal plastic degradation occurs at 400 degrees C in N-2 and 250 degrees C in air. Processing at temperatures below 250 degrees C in anoxic conditions is necessary to control off-gases. The optimum sand addition to produce the highest compressive strength was between 65 and 80%, depending on the sand particle size. HDPE produced higher maximum compressive strengths (37.1 MPa) compared to LDPE (27.2 MPa). Plastic bonded sand has increased strength, toughness, ductility, and thermal conductivity compared to C20/25 concrete and sandcrete and it can be used for wall construction blocks and paving tiles. The potential applications and implications of processing waste plastics in developing countries into plastic bonded sand are discussed.

TI An institutional theory perspective on non-financial reporting The
   developing Baltic context
SO JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ACCOUNTING
AB Purpose The paper aims to explore the impact of institutional factors on non-financial reporting in the Baltic countries. The vast majority of research in the scientific literature references practices of sustainable disclosures in developed countries with a focus on legal factors and their effect on corporate reporting. Meanwhile, there is a lack of in-depth empirical data for identifying correlations between institutional (mandatory, normative and company-specific) factors and non-financial reporting in developing countries. Design/methodology/approach The theoretical framework of neo-institutional theory was applied to explore how the external environment affects practices of non-financial reporting in developing countries. The approach used in the paper is quantitative. Findings The research results reveal that if companies are likely to disclose voluntarily one of non-economic aspects in their reports, they are also likely to disclose more about the other non-economic issues. However, no significant correlations were detected between the disclosure of voluntary (non-economic) and mandatory (economic) aspects. Mandatory factors promote both - economic and non-economic reporting - while normative and company-specific factors promote non-economic reporting more. Practical implications The authors contribute to the foreign investors and practitioners by helping to better understand corporate non-financial reporting practices in post-communistic countries. Originality/value The research adds to the growing body of research on non-financial reporting practices with particular reference to the developing Baltic context. This study also contributes to scientific literature by exploring the impact of different institutional factors to non-financial reporting in developing countries.

TI Benefits of an integrated water and nutrient reuse system for urban
   areas in semi-arid developing countries
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Urban areas of developing countries face the challenge to implement adequate water and sanitation infrastructures while using natural and financial resources sustainably. The objective of this study was to identify benefits and challenges of different nutrient and water reuse systems. For this, we evaluated and compared four systems; (1a) the local conventional water and sanitation system, (2a) a novel water and nutrient reuse system connecting sanitation, advanced wastewater treatment and nutrient rich water reuse for the irrigation of human food crops, (1b) the local conventional water and sanitation system adapted for water reuse and (2b) the novel water and nutrient reuse system adapted to be low tech. Our case study, a town in Namibia, exemplifies the typical problems of urban areas in developing countries. We compared the four systems using ecological, economic, societal, institutional, political, and technical criteria, via multi-decision criteria analysis with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Our results indicate that the novel water and nutrient reuse system (2a) scores highest with environmental and societal criteria when weighting all evaluation criteria equally. Its challenges lay especially in the economic criteria. Nonetheless, for our case study, an urban area in a developing country, the novel water and nutrient reuse system (2a) is a viable sanitation, wastewater and irrigation infrastructure for using fewer resources, being economically feasible, institutionally and politically practical and technically sound. However, the preference for a particular water and sanitation infrastructure also depends on which criteria the decision-maker is willing to assign the highest weight to. The presented methodology helps decision-makers and engineers with complex decision-making by evaluating numerous criteria in order to have proper information on the benefits and challenges of water and sanitation systems.

TI Saving the Girls: Medical Colonialism and the HPV Programme
SO POSTCOLONIAL STUDIES
AB Mass immunisation is a central aspiration of global health programmes, such as in the 2000 Millennium Development Goals (MDG), as a means of addressing the glaring inequalities in life expectancy that separate the Global North and South. A recent initiative, the Human Papillomaviruses (HPV) vaccine, is being rolled out in so-called developing countries to prevent a number of sexually transmitted diseases, including one of the rarer forms of cervical cancer. Despite its apparent good intentions, resistance to the vaccine has occurred, in developed as well as in developing countries, not least because it constitutes a largely gendered form of medical intervention which is promoted according to Western concepts of risk, biomedical knowledge and normative understandings of female sexual behaviour. As a major component of the MDG health strategy aimed at developing countries, the HPV vaccine initiative carries implicit tendencies towards 'medical colonialism' underpinned as it is by hegemonic scientific masculinity, in which gendered forms of structural violence are legitimised through the discursive affiliations of progress and global health. This paper will examine the intersecting themes of political economy, gendered structural violence and hegemonic medical masculinity underpinning HPV immunisation programmes within the context of development. It interrogates how masculine scientific narratives of disease prevention, which legitimises the state-endorsed (and increasingly mandated) pharmaceuticalised protection of young women as objects of patriarchal care and control, have become the new missionary voices, saving bodies rather than souls.

TI Achieving SDG target 8.1 (sustain economic growth) in developing
   countries: how aid for trade policy and regulations can assist?
SO JOURNAL OF CHINESE ECONOMIC AND FOREIGN TRADE STUDIES
AB Purpose
   This study aims to examine how aid for trade policy and regulations (AfTPR) contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 8.1 (sustain per capita economic growth) and whether the effectiveness of AfTPR is conditional to the stable political environment.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper uses a widely accepted endogenous growth framework and applies panel data fixed effects and two-step difference and system generalized method of moments estimation strategies on panel data of 50 developing countries over 2005-2017.
   Findings
   The findings of the study confirm that aid to trade policy promotes sustainable economic growth in developing countries, but this category of development assistance is only effective and significant for low and lower middle-income (LLMI) economies. The positive and significant effect of AfTPR in upper middle-income countries is conditional to their level of political stability. Under a stable political situation, the positive effect of AfTPR on sustainable growth remains almost same for the LLMI countries, whereas for the upper middle-income countries this growth effect reached almost double.
   Research limitations/implications
   International trade is considered as a driver for inclusive and sustainable economic growth, whereas aid for trade is acknowledged for its prospective contribution toward achieving these goals. The findings have dominant policy implications for the international development organizations and donors, which recommend that it is more desirable to transmit aid toward developing and implementing trade policy and regulations as per capita economic growth improves in the aid recipient countries.
   Originality/value
   According to the authors' knowledge, no prior study empirically analyzes the effect of AfTPRs on SDG target 8.1.

TI Is the expansion of biofuels at odds with the food security of
   developing countries?
SO BIOFUELS BIOPRODUCTS & BIOREFINING-BIOFPR
AB The production of ethanol and biodiesel has been growing rapidly in Brazil, the USA and the EU. Although the current share of overall fuel consumption is quite small, if biofuels become a global mainstream energy source, their production will eventually affect the traditional food and feedstock market. This may cause further problems in already food-insecure nations (mainly developing countries) owing to food price increases. This perspective discusses possible responses to supply variability that developing countries may make to mitigate the odds against them and take advantage of the opportunities offered by price increases through efficient marketing systems, investing in agricultural research, improving agricultural practices, and developing an extension system focusing on the sustainable use of limited land and renewable resources. Developing technology that can convert cellulosic materials to biofuels efficiently will also help defuse the demand stress on traditional food supplies worldwide.

TI An international comparative analysis of local hazard mitigation plan
   evaluation for flood The USA, Japan and Korea
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESILIENCE IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB Purpose - This research aims to identify the qualitative differences between local hazard mitigation plan (LHMP) of the developing country when compared to those of developed countries. It also seeks to demonstrate the relative importance of public private partnership and the need for PPs to be integrated into LHMP because they help to create strong LHMP, thereby making communities will become more resilient to not only floods but also other natural disasters. It focuses on the components of hazard mitigation from a developed country perspective and how these influence the contents/focus of the LHMP especially when compared to those of a developing country.
   Design/methodology/approach - Based on official information such as population, climate and major threat that has faced, research sites were selected. Each LHMP can be downloaded from the official city websites, except Korea. Through plan evacuation protocols the LHMP for each city - USA (Baltimore), Japan (Kumamoto) and Korea (Pohang) - were assessed three times by the research team. Plans were evaluated using a plan coding evacuation process.
   Findings - The LHMP of the developing country did not contain maps illustrating to the people who are exposed to flood and evacuation routes and who are vulnerable (both economically and physically), when compared with the developed countries plan. However, quicker response because of simple political hierarchy can be possible in Japan and Korea when compared to the USA, which has three different tiers of political governments - federal, State and Local government - though Korea is a developing country.
   Originality/value - In recent times, pre-disaster response, which is a proactive approach to natural disasters, is an emerging issue rather than post disaster response because of sustainable and resilient ideas of the locals that have repeatedly suffered from natural hazards. This study compares LHMPs of each country to better understand strengths and weakness, as well as to identify strategies that will enhance the quality of mitigation plan for the developed country and developing country. It is hoped that this study will inform and augment existing literature by assisting underdeveloped and developing countries suffering from floods with the preparation of their LHMPs based on the suggestion of this research.

TI Navigating a trilemma: Energy security, equity, and sustainability in
   the Philippines' low-carbon transition
SO ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB Nearly a decade after the Philippines began promoting renewable energy through legislation, the country has seen gains and encountered roadblocks in its transition to low carbon. This paper examines the Philippines' experience in attempting to escape conditions of lock-in and path dependency on fossil fuels, and attempting a governed transition to low-carbon energy sources. The Philippines is a developing country with substantial economic growth aspirations, yet it is among the most vulnerable to climate change, so it has great interest in mitigating global carbon emissions. Yet, the country itself is heavily dependent on imported coal for its energy needs. In the context of its existing regulatory and techno-institutional landscape, the authors examine the Philippine experience in governing its energy transition. The paper discusses challenges in balancing the trilemma of energy security, equity, and sustainability. It then identifies some priorities for the Philippines as it attempts to move away from fossil fuel dependency and accelerate its transition towards low-carbon energy. The authors consider developments beyond the energy sector, particularly the early entry-into-force of the Paris Agreement, as a tool to favor the trilemma's sustainability pillar. The Philippine case may provide lessons for other developing countries undergoing their own transitions.

TI Accounting for Accountability: A Critical Reflection on the Private
   Higher Education in Bangladesh
SO ADMINISTRATION & SOCIETY
AB The World Bank has pioneered the concept of private in developing countries with the aim of creating economic and social sustainability since the 1990s. This study examines private universities by focusing on the accountability framework in Bangladesh. Using a multi-method approach (a survey of 1,046 students from all 52 universities in the country and policy documents from 1992-2014), the study reveals that weak macro accountability (specifically, a vague regulatory framework, lack of enforcement, government leniency, and corruption) is a contributing factor in the unsuccessful drive for higher growth of private higher education institutions (HEIs). The study also raises a question on the success of the Washington Consensus in a developing country. The findings demonstrate that urgent attention is required from the Bangladesh government and donor agencies (The World Bank, the UNESCO, and the International Monetary Fund [IMF]).

SO VESTNIK MEZHDUNARODNYKH ORGANIZATSII-INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS
   RESEARCH JOURNAL
AB This paper discusses the results of a survey of multinational corporations with affiliates in developing countries. The paper explores corporate perspectives and decision making across the stages of the investment cycle: attraction, entry and establishment, operations and expansion, linkages with the local economy, and, in some cases, divestment and exit. Through interviews with 754 executives, the survey finds that political stability and a business-friendly regulatory environment are the top two factors influencing multinational corporations' investment decisions in developing countries. Investors seek predictable, transparent, and efficient conduct of public agencies. The survey results also show that investors are heterogeneous, and their perceptions vary with motivation and size. Multinational corporations that are involved in efficiency-seeking investment are more selective than investors motivated by other considerations, and that relatively smaller multinational corporations are more sensitive to host country characteristics and investment climate factors than large firms.

TI LEAPFROGGING TO RENEWABLE ENERGY: THE OPPORTUNITY FOR UNMET ELECTRICITY
   MARKETS
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
AB Electricity plays a crucial role in the socio-economic development of any country. Developing countries, however, unlike their developed counterparts, do not have electricity markets that are fully satisfied, nor are they 'laden' with large-scale infrastructure that could create inertia about making the transition. The objective of this paper is to identify the potential trajectories for unmet electricity markets in sub-Saharan Africa to leapfrog to renewable energy as they strive to accelerate access to electricity. The following key drivers of renewable energy leapfrogging in unmet electricity markets were identified from the review: the need to achieve sustainability targets; the availability of renewable energy resources on a sufficient scale; growing investment in renewable energy; maturing niche renewable technologies; a weakening renewable energy cost hypothesis; and a growing population and increasing urbanisation. The paper further conceptualised three potential transition paradigms: revolutionary, scattered, and coned pathways. These paradigms were defined by the pace and magnitude of the transition that can be observed, and depend on the intensity of the identified drivers in a specific unmet electricity market. The paper argues that the largely unmet electricity market in sub-Saharan Africa provides an opportunity to leapfrog the fossil-intensive energy regime to adopt a renewable energy regime.

TI Benefits of adopting smart building technologies in building
   construction of developing countries: review of literature
SO SN APPLIED SCIENCES
AB Smart building technology has received a broad audience due to digitalisation and benefits in the construction industry. With global interest, the construction of smart buildings has become a new trend in development. Many studies identified a significant interest in the smart building technology application more than in conventional buildings. However, in developing countries, construction professionals have paid little attention to the adoption of smart building technology. Therefore, this paper aims to identify the benefits that are attached to the adoption of smart building technology (SBT) in the construction industry. The study is based on a systematic review of published articles in peer-reviewed journals and conferences. A total of 55 papers comprising conferences and journal articles retrieved from Scopus database were utilised for the study. The study's findings revealed efficient energy consumption, cost-effective building maintenance and operation, job creation, health care management, real-time monitoring, safety and security, among others, as benefits of smart building technologies (SBTs). For smart building technology to thrive in emerging economies, a comprehensive understanding of its benefits is highly imperative. This will not only promote construction professionals' knowledge of its concept but also enhance its successful adoption in these regions. Thus, the paper provides some insights into the benefit of smart building technology in developing countries while suggesting the formation of a synergic structure between the research community and practitioners in the construction sector.

AB Since global warming has seriously endangered the living environment of human being and their health and safety, the development of low-carbon economy has become an irreversible global trend. Under the background of economic globalization, low-carbon economy will surely exert a significant impact on global trade pattern. Countries are paying more and more attention to the green trade. The emission permits trade of carbon between the developed countries and the developing countries has become more mature than ever. The carbon tariff caused by the distribution of the "big cake" will make the low-cost advantage in developing countries cease to exist, which will, in turn, affect the foreign trade, economic development, employment and people's living in developing countries. Therefore, under the background of this trend, we should perfect the relevant laws and regulations on trade and environment as soon as possible, optimize trade structure, promote greatly the development of service trade, transform thoroughly the mode of development in foreign trade, take advantage of the international carbon trading market by increasing the added value of export products resulted from technological innovation to achieve mutual benefit and win-win results and promote common development.

AB Access to clean and stable energy, meeting sustainable development goals, the fossil fuel dependency and depletion are some of the reasons that have impacted developing countries to transform the business as usual economy to a more sustainable economy. However, access and availability of finance is a major challenge for many developing countries. Financing renewable energy projects require access to significant resources, by multiple parties, at varying points in the project life cycles. This research aims to investigate sources and new trends in financing RE projects in developing countries. For this purpose, a detail and in-depth literature review have been conducted to explore the sources and trends of current RE financial investment and projects, to understand the gaps and limitations. This paper concludes that there are various internal and external sources of finance available for RE projects in developing countries.

TI The US response How to energize women
SO BULLETIN OF THE ATOMIC SCIENTISTS
AB Lack of access to modern energy services represents a pressing problem in the developing world, not least for women. Many poor women spend much of their time on menial work that could be performed much more easily if energy were available, and safety concerns often prevent women from going out at night where there are no streetlights. Children suffer too-more than 50 percent of the developing world's children attend primary schools that lack electricity, and this can lead to markedly worse educational outcomes. Access to modern energy services might be improved through, among other approaches, establishing small-scale hydroelectric projects, facilitating the use of home solar systems, or providing grid electricity (which itself might be produced either with conventional fuels or through renewable means). Three authors-Kalpana Sharma of India (2014), Dipak Gyawali of Nepal (2014), and Corinne Hart of the United States-discuss which methods of expanding energy access show most promise for improving the lives of the developing world's poor women and children.

TI Measuring energy poverty: Focusing on what matters
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB The provision of modern energy services is recognised as a critical foundation for sustainable development, and is central to the everyday lives of people. Effective policies to dramatically expand modern energy access need to be grounded in a robust information-base. Metrics that can be used for comparative purposes and to track progress towards targets therefore represent an essential support tool. This paper reviews the relevant literature, and discusses the adequacy and applicability of existing instruments to measure energy poverty. Drawing on those insights, it proposes a new composite index to measure energy poverty. Both the associated methodology and initial results for several African countries are discussed. Whereas most existing indicators and composite indices focus on assessing the access to energy, or the degree of development related to energy, our new index the Multidimensional Energy Poverty Index (MEPI) focuses on the deprivation of access to modern energy services. It captures both the incidence and intensity of energy poverty, and provides a new tool to support policy-making. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Various global development opportunities have been escalated through the Internet of Everything (IoE) with the potential of progressing Sustainable Development goals - dramatically accelerating and improving lives of millions. The emerging economies of developing countries with minimal investments have crafted a huge array of (IoE) technologies strongly demanding interoperability and interconnectivity that are affordable, scalable and available, significantly improving people's quality of life. Growing number of devices requiring interconnectivity referring to the concept of (IoE) headed beyond sensors, chips, computers and smartphones. The modern replete technology has enabled both synchronous and asynchronous communication without human interaction in many industrial processes, fleet management, stock exchanges, inventory systems and environment monitoring regardless of their extensive deployment. Information Communication Technology (ICT) is a fast evolving industry in developing countries, offering (IoE)'s huge potential of transformation and disruption. The global development challenges have emphasised the need for communication and due to (IoE) advancements, long-standing issues (health care, stock, management, cross-border, technology diffusion etc.) would be surmounted in an affordable and quick manner. The developing countries would turn-around with the help of a long-awaited (IoE) technology aiming at improving their economies and lives of millions of people.
   The key to increased usage is the interconnectedness of diverse range of devices which formerly were incompatible with each other. The interoperability between devices has rendered (IoE) both practical and possible and in accordance with the international communication standards. Research and industrial organisations have stipulated the formation of a hyper-connected society where tens of billions daily life objects and devices would communicate, forming a global network of smart devices. The successful provision of intelligent and smart devices through (IoE) services leads to challenging security concerns especially in developing countries where communication and devices are cheap but there is a lack of secure (IoE) infrastructures. The current paper would envisage a secure architecture for diversely connected objects within developing countries. A secure configuration methodology of the bootstrapping scheme is proposed as a solution in this paper. The bootstrapping scheme is activated as soon as a new object get connected to an operational network. This method is feasible to secure the devices and avoid data exploitation within developing countries where communication across devices is still lacking protected infrastructures. A review of the Internet of Everything (IoE) is represented beneath, along with a brief portrayal of the applications and difficulties confronted by the (IoE).

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This paper introduces the preliminary results of a development project focused on waste recycling and recovery in La Paz (Bolivia). The aim is to share best practices and to present real-world challenges when implementing appropriate waste management systems in developing countries. Environmental pollution, social inequality, lack of resources, and economic discrepancies are challenges still present in the 21st century, and a global call-for-action is needed to support sustainable development. The project "LaPazRecicla", financed by the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation, provides perspectives that are potentially useful for policy-makers, waste management practitioners, and circular economy visionaries. The article aims to present the effective contribution of the practical actions to the local municipality, and to introduce the reason for why theoretical methods were employed to support the project. The outcomes provided two main indications: on one hand, cooperation among interdisciplinary actors and financial support can give the chance of improvement, suggesting international donors should continue in this direction; on the other, political instability, lack of local technical knowledge, and the absence of planning for a long-term period makes these actions unsuitable for tangible change. Global reflections are required in order to measure the potential benefits of small-scale projects, evaluating the time needed to move towards a sustainable future in low-income countries.

As most host CDM countries have not established the proper institutional capacity to approve CDM projects and, at the same time, are prerogative to define sustainable development criteria for CDM projects, there is a clear need for a single set of guidelines or one evaluation system that accounts both climate and sustainable development considerations in the approval process of CDM projects. This paper proposes a set of sustainability criteria and indicators for CDM projects screening, reflecting the environmental, social, economic and technological dimension of sustainable development. Sufficient attention has been paid to determine globally relevant criteria and indicators. Priority has been given to energy sector CDM projects.

Common themes across the literature were identified covering four factors regarding the adoption of SSCM: drivers, barriers, mechanisms and outcomes. A conceptual model integrating these factors and based on institutional theory was advanced to explain the adoption of sustainability practices along supply chains in developing countries. The paper concludes by identifying gaps in the literature that require further research on this topic, particularly for the context of developing countries.

AB The coming decades will bring dramatic increases in morbidity and mortality from cancer in the developing world. The burden of cancer is increasing globally, with an expected 20 million new cases per year in 2020, half of which will be in low- and middle-income countries. Despite an already overwhelming burden of health problems, developing countries must somehow address this cancer pandemic and their alarming share of cancer illness. Many large-scale and innovative worldwide initiatives have been launched in the fight against cancer. These programs represent colossal efforts to expand resources for health education among people and healthcare workers in developing countries and to increase awareness of cancer prevention. Many novel evidence-based and culturally-relevant programs are being implemented for screening and early prevention of common cancers. Several key initiatives are supporting clinical research, guideline development, oncology training, and appropriate technology transfer, such as access to electronic medical literature. Treatment programs are expanding access and quality of radiologic and pharmacologic therapies for cancer. These initiatives represent an unprecedented level of and cooperation among international agencies, governmental and nongovernmental organizations, international foundations, scientific societies, local institutions, and industry. This review examines the scope of need in response to the increasing burden of cancer in the developing world and major initiatives that have been created to respond to these needs.

The results or findings differ in various economic context, sectors and industries. There is no universally or commonly accepted direction of this relationship. The reviews also revealed that a growing pattern in investigating this relationship in developing countries recently. This further suggested that more empirical research must be undertaken to study on the relationship between corporate sustainability and organizational efficacy in developing countries. The findings of these papers can be generalized only to the specific population of online databases selected for this research and not for the entire universe of sustainability literature.

AB Managing municipal solid waste is a major concern for cities around the world. Particularly urban communities with developing economies are urged to improve their waste management practices, and set up appropriate waste management systems. Waste management is a city-specific topic; there is no ideal solution that can be operationalized everywhere. In developing cities, municipalities and decision makers need simple and effective indicators to assess the sustainability of their current waste management systems, and set a performance reference point. The current study investigates available literature and suggests a list of measurable sustainability indicators which are specific to solid-waste management. The list encompasses 27 indicators that cover the building blocks of an integrated solid-waste management system, i.e., collection and sorting, recycling, composting, energy recovery, and landfilling. An assessment tool is developed through a five-point Likert scale, evaluating these indicators. Case studies of Cairo and Brussels were analyzed. The outcomes of this analysis can be used as a benchmark on a local level in planning, clarifying policy objectives, and setting priorities.

TI The New Silk Road as an Emerging Model of Regional and International
   Economic Cooperation-A Brief Review of the International Symposium on
   "The New Silk Road and China-Africa Economic Relations"
SO INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT
AB At the International Symposium on "The New Silk Road and China-Africa Economic Relations" held in Kenya, some 30 scholars shared their understanding of the "One Belt One Road" plan announced by the Chinese government. The themes of the symposium covered the definition and political-economic implications of "One Belt One Road," its effects on China-Africa economic relationships, and the key points and procedures of related projects. Most of the scholars attending the symposium declared that " One Belt One Road" is the updated version of traditional forms of Chinese aid to developing countries, especially African countries, and meets the need for cooperation among developing countries and the industry upgrading of Chinese enterprises. The plan's core ideas differ from those of the United States; they represent a new international order and an emerging model of regional cooperation and international economic cooperation. As well, recommendations on fostering state-owned enterprise systems and a sustainable labor force in African countries were also discussed.

TI World employment: ILO perspective
SO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL WEEKLY
AB The ILO report on World Employment 1996-97 attempts to understand unemployment in the light of globalisation and technological change in the major economic regions of the world. It takes a positive view of globalisation as promoting efficiency and enabling high-productivity, high-wage jobs. The report does not hold labour market rigidities. as responsible for unemployment in either industrialised or developing countries. The macro-economic environment - appropriate fiscal policy, wage setting institutions, and welfare programmes - is seen as central to growth and employment creation. The report downplays the fact that there is little room for fiscal:manoeuvre in most countries so that interest rates may rise or that debt-deflation or the size of the welfare state may be responsible for the economic downturn in industrialised countries. Moreover, balanced growth is not a good option for developing countries as it results in enlarging low-paid, dead-end, informal sector jobs.

TI Sustainable Charcoal and Firewood Production and Use in Africa
SO BIOENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN AFRICA
AB The energy sector in Africa is characterized by low per capita consumption of modern energy in a continent endowed with extensive but under-developed energy resources. The majority of the population depends on wood-fuels (charcoal and firewood) because modern energy such as LPG, kerosene and electricity are either unavailable or unaffordable. Deforestation and forest degradation is a major problem created by the current energy consumption patterns in Africa. The negative environmental impacts of cooking with wood-fuels are increasing in most African countries. Poor forest management and increasing demands are leading to land degradation, which for rural women translates to increasingly long daily treks to gather fuel-wood. On average less than 30% of the Sub-Saharan African population has access to electricity and more than 70% depend on wood-fuels for cooking and heating. The current low access to modern energy services in Africa causes negative impacts on poverty reduction efforts and the attainment of the MDGs. Despite the understanding that wood-fuels are the main energy source for the majority of the African population, improvements in wood-fuel production and use is currently not of high priority in energy development strategies. There are no specific wood-fuel policies, strategies and programmes supported by African governments. However, the use of wood-fuels is critical for meeting basic energy needs of the majority of the population in African countries. Due to this low prioritization of wood-fuels, the sector is poorly funded and lacks good governance. Therefore, securing political commitment for formulating and implementing effective policies and strategies are crucial elements that could ensure sustainable production and use of wood-fuels in Africa.

TI The Economics of Household Air Pollution
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF RESOURCE ECONOMICS, VOL 7
SE Annual Review of Resource Economics
AB Traditional energy technologies and consumer products contribute to household well-being in diverse ways but also often harm household air quality. We review the problem of household air pollution at a global scale, focusing particularly on the harmful effects of traditional cooking and heating. Drawing on the theory of household production, we illustrate the ambiguous relationship between household well-being and adoption of behaviors and technologies that reduce air pollution. We then review how the theory relates to the seemingly contradictory findings emerging from the literature on developing country household demand for clean fuels and stoves. In conclusion, we describe an economics research agenda to close the knowledge gaps so that policies and programs can be designed and evaluated to solve the global household air pollution problem.

AB The powerful forces of market-based globalization have been the central concern in the consideration of the development policies, of individual developing countries for several years and will increase their salience in the coming period. Water policy should not be an exception. Market-based globalization having diametrically opposite forces, namely integration into the world economy and marginalization from it, the developing world has been divided into three categories, each requiring a different set of policy responses, including water policies. They are: (1) those countries that are being integrated into the world economy; (2) those that are marginalized from it; and (3) those where both forces (integration and marginalization) are at work simultaneously. Relevant policies, such as full cost pricing, environmental considerations, water productivity in agriculture, conflict in water allocation and others, need to be elaborated along the lines of these three categories of countries.

TI Does economic prosperity lead to environmental sustainability in
   developing economies? Environmental Kuznets curve theory
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Since developing countries experience economic and environmental sustainability challenges, it is desirable digging into the linkages between economic and environmental parameters. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the existence of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) theory (i.e., the inverse U-shape connection between real GDP per capita and per capita carbon dioxide emissions) in the sample of 11 developing countries. By using balanced annual panel data in the period between 1992 and 2014 and two alternative estimation techniques, we explored the potential inverted U-shaped linkage between carbon dioxide emissions and real GDP per capita in the sample of interest. For analysis purposes, Pedroni and Westerlund co-integration techniques are employed. Then, fully modified ordinary least squares, pooled mean group methods are applied for long-run parameter estimations. And, the Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality approach is employed for causal directions. Firstly, this work's findings provide the supportive evidence to the inverse U-shaped linkage in the long-run, indicating that an increase in real GDP per capita and electricity consumption tends to mitigate long-run carbon dioxide emissions in the developing countries, for the whole sample. Secondly, the country-specific findings suggested the presence of EKC theory for Brazil, China, India, Malaysia, the Russian Federation, Thailand, and Turkey. It implicated that these countries are on the path of attaining environmental sustainability in the long-run. However, Mexico, Philippines, Indonesia, and South Africa failed to lend credence to the EKC theory. It manifested that these countries need to design strategies directed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from economic activity and electricity generation through efficiency improvement or promotion of renewables. Finally, bidirectional causal links are observed among all the variables of interest. The findings suggest that country-specific targeted action plans should be implemented to ensure the environmental sustainability in the developing world.

TI Digital financial innovations in the twenty-first century Do transaction
   tax exemptions promote mobile money services for financial inclusion in
   developing countries?
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB Purpose Premised on the assertion that financial digitalization is currently the panacea and game changer in delivering progress towards the sustainable development goals (SDGs) through universal financial inclusion, especially in developing countries, the purpose of this paper is to establish the moderating effect of transaction tax exemptions in the relationship between mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion. Design/methodology/approach A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data from 379 micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which use mobile money services drawn from the Northern District of Gulu in Uganda to provide responses for this study. The predictive relevancy and the effect size of the model were determined by running partial least square algorithm through structural equation model (SEM) with 5,000 bootstrap samples in SmartPLS-SEM 3.0. Findings The findings indicated that all the latent variables of transaction tax exemptions showed significant and positive impact on mobile money adoption and usage to advance financial inclusion in developing countries. Moreover, when combined together, the overall SEM predictive model revealed a significant moderating effect of transaction tax exemptions in the relationship between mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion. This implies that transaction tax exemptions on digital financial innovations such as the mobile money services can stimulate economic growth through increased level of financial inclusion labeled as the main enabler in achieving the SDGs by the year 2030. Research limitations/implications Whereas data were collected from users of mobile money services, the samples were drawn specifically from MSMEs' owners located in the Northern District of Gulu in Uganda. Thus, users located in other districts were not included in the sample for this study. Similarly, this study limited itself to only financial services offered through the mobile money platform. It ignored other digital financial channels such as the internet and electronic banking. Practical implications Going forward, in order to improve the economic well-being of households at the "bottom of the pyramid," governments in developing countries should embrace the significant role of transaction tax exemptions in promoting digital financial innovations such as the mobile money services for increased level of financial inclusion. The governments in developing countries where mobile money has greatly spurred financial inclusion should not only reduce the existing transaction taxes on mobile money services but scrap it off in order to champion progressive increase in the level of universal financial inclusion prescribed as a key enabler in eliminating global poverty, especially in developing countries. Originality/value This study hints on the moderating effect of transaction tax exemptions in the relationship between mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion. The paradox in the current trends on transaction taxes on mobile money services, especially in developing countries remain a dearth in the nascent global FINTECH ecosystem.

TI Agricultural biotechnologies in developing countries and their possible
   contribution to food security
SO JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Latest FAO figures indicate that an estimated 925 million people are undernourished in 2010, representing almost 16% of the population in developing countries. Looking to the future, there are also major challenges ahead from the rapidly changing socio-economic environment (increasing world population and urbanisation, and dietary changes) and climate change.
   Promoting agriculture in developing countries is the key to achieving food security, and it is essential to act in four ways: to increase investment in agriculture, broaden access to food, improve governance of global trade, and increase productivity while conserving natural resources. To enable the fourth action, the suite of technological options for farmers should be as broad as possible, including agricultural biotechnologies. Agricultural biotechnologies represent a broad range of technologies used in food and agriculture for the genetic improvement of plant varieties and animal populations, characterisation and conservation of genetic resources, diagnosis of plant or animal diseases and other purposes. Discussions about agricultural biotechnology have been dominated by the continuing controversy surrounding genetic modification and its resulting products, genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The polarised debate has led to non-GMO biotechnologies being overshadowed, often hindering their development and application.
   Extensive documentation from the FAO international technical conference on Agricultural Biotechnologies in Developing Countries (ABDC-10), that took place in Guadalajara, Mexico, on 1-4 March 2010, gave a very good overview of the many ways that different agricultural biotechnologies are being used to increase productivity and conserve natural resources in the crop, livestock, fishery, forestry and agro-industry sectors in developing countries. The conference brought together about 300 policy-makers, scientists and representatives of intergovernmental and international non-governmental organisations, including delegations from 42 FAO Member States. At the end of ABDC-10, the Member States reached a number of key conclusions, agreeing, inter alia, that FAO and other relevant international organisations and donors should significantly increase their efforts to support the strengthening of national capacities in the development and appropriate use of pro-poor agricultural biotechnologies.

TI Benchmarking in public procurement
SO BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Purpose - This paper investigates the technique of benchmarking to improve the quality of the public procurement process and discusses the importance of benchmarking to overcome perceived weaknesses with these processes. This is followed by a case study of Sri-Lanka, exploring the difficulties faced by public sector employees in separating the daily business of government from the political influences of its elected leaders.
   Design/methodology/approach - Initially the literature review was used to examine the key principles of government procurement and how they could be benchmarked. This formed the theoretical base for the discussion. The case study of Sri-Lanka has been used very effectively to discuss the experiences of developing countries.
   Findings - It is revealed that reform solutions within government procurement systems must include measures that address issues of accountability, transparency, value for money, a professional work force and ethics.
   Research limitations/implications - The major limitation of this study is that it relies solely only on the experience of Sri-Lanka. Perhaps including the experiences of other developing countries such as India, Bangladesh and Indonesia could increase the transference of findings of Sri-Lanka to these countries as well.
   Practical implications - Poor procurement practices hinder sustainable development and negatively impact upon economic growth. Therefore, developing countries need to recognise the importance of the technique of benchmarking to improve the public procurement process.
   Originality/value - Provides an effective framework to public sector employees in developing countries to benchmark and overcome weaknesses in the public procurement process.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY
AB The foreign investment and economic growth relationship in developing countries have attracted considerable attention in comparative international sociology. However, despite nearly fifty years of research, this relationship is still not well understood. I bring new cross-national evidence to bear upon this issue with analyses that improve upon previous research on the foreign direct investment and economic growth nexus in developing countries. I analyze cross-national longitudinal data using panel regression models with fixed effects and instrumental variables to account for possible endogeneity. Foreign capital penetration appears to be positively associated with economic growth in developing countries, which supports the expectations of neoclassical economic theory. Rather than critiquing any particular theoretical paradigm, this research hopefully serves to help reinvigorate scholarly discussion amongst comparative international social scientists regarding the economic growth effects of foreign direct investment in developing countries.

SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB Biogas-based circular bioeconomy can provide a long-term way out of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste. The barriers to biogas production are obstructing the growth of the biogas-based circular bioeconomy. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the barriers to biogas in developing countries for the wider implementation of biogas technology. Twenty barriers are identified and categorized into technical, logistical, institutional, and social dimensions. The analytical hierarchy process is applied to rank the barriers. The result of barrier ranking shows that the lack of appropriate segregation facilities is the most crucial barrier, followed by waste characteristics variation, and inconsistent supply. This study will provide an outline for rational decision -making in the sustainable organic fraction of municipal waste management.

AB The study seeks to demonstrate the potential role that industrial ecology could play towards energy poverty reduction and environmental conservation in Kenya through sustainable charcoal production and consumption. This is achieved through an exploration of the application of the life cycle management (LCM) concept that identifies various opportunities for technological intervention for energy and environmental conservation and reduction of material and energy losses. It also identifies opportunities for income generation at various stages of the product's life cycle; an aspect critical in poverty reduction in developing countries. The study finds that applying LCM in the charcoal trade in Kenya can deliver social, economic and environmental benefits to developing country communities and should, therefore, be promoted.

TI Rethinking international taxation and energy policy post COVID-19 and
   the financial crisis for developing countries
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY & NATURAL RESOURCES LAW
AB There is a key role for taxation in energy and public policy following the 2020 COVID-19 and resulting financial crisis. Taxation was already under the microscope at national, regional and international levels prior to 2020, and the potential for reform may slow down. Developing countries in particular are utilising their tax systems to mitigate the impacts of the 2020 crisis. This article highlights the race to the bottom in terms of taxation as governments seek foreign direct investment (FDI). It also highlights the issues in an influential sector of the economy - that of energy - and the impact on human rights as a result of tax abuse. It is advanced here that a 'race to the bottom' in international taxation will result in further erosion of human rights. In thinking of the future and after the 2020 crisis, developing countries need to develop sustainable and resilient economic growth, and consequently they need clear and strategic taxation policy. It can be acknowledged that there is a role for FDI in a crisis-hit economy, but for taxation policy not to have negative consequences more international action is needed in this area. Aggressive tax planning and erosion of the potential to raise tax revenue cannot inhibit the progress made over the last decade on all areas of international taxation.

SO ENERGY
AB A transition plan for conventionally structured generation portfolios dominantly based on coal fired plants has been offered through four models. The models are primarily focused on elevated penetration of facilities based on intermittent renewable sources and CO2 emission reduction by at least 20% compared to the initial state, accordingly addressing balancing output power variation problems and social aspects of the considered society. These models are:
   Flexible generation portfolio model, which can provide balancing power by itself;
   Open system model that provides balancing power at the balancing market;
   Hybrid system model with hybrid plants based on wind, hydro and solar energy, having the ability to store, convert and use this energy for balancing purposes;
   Mix model that includes options from the previous three.
   The models are elaborated on an arbitrary conventional power system and simulated applying International Atomic Energy Agency's software tools.
   Considering chosen technical, economic, environmental and social parameters, conducted analyses resulted with the Mix model as the most suitable option for a sustainable development of the treated power system type. Due to similarities between generation portfolio structures in developing countries, the model can provide guidelines for sustainable planning and contribute to a low carbon future.

TI Identification of the Regional and Economic Contexts of Sustainable
   Urban Logistics Policies
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Urban logistics policies have become instrumental in achieving sustainable transport systems. Developing and emerging countries still lag far behind in the implementation of such policies when compared with developed countries. This exposure gap provides an opportunity for policy transfer, but this is a complex process requiring knowledge of many contextual factors and involving multiple steps. A good understanding of those contextual factors of measures by cities may be critical for a successful transfer. Our study aimed to identify the different contexts of urban logistics measures or policies worldwide and to assess their significance for policy transferability. In this study, urban logistics measures discussed in the literature were retrieved with a systematic literature review method and then the contexts were recorded, distinguishing between economic development levels and geographical regions. The analysis revealed that the economic level and geographical location of cities both have a strong association with the type of measure implemented. Barriers and drivers were identified by assessing policy transfer between developed and developing countries. Institutional and physical barriers appeared to be highly pertinent for a range of measures, while drivers or facilitators were identified from specific problems in developing countries and the respective measures in developed countries. Thus, the analysis of contextual factors can provide a first response to the key challenges and opportunities of sustainable urban logistics policies transfer to developing countries.

AB The 'water-energy nexus' is now receiving more attention as policy- and decision-makers grapple with measures to enable the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon economy. South Africa, in particular, finds itself in a polycrisis in terms of dealing with economic development, to alleviate poverty, within water and energy constraints. In the Western Cape Province of the country, desalination is suggested as one solution to the water shortage crisis, but the critical issue is that of energy supply, and the related cost implications, for water supply; concentrated solar thermal technology options are currently considered. In this paper a systems dynamics approach is used to assess the sustainability of these types of renewable energy technologies. The objectives of the paper are thus twofold. Firstly, the paper demonstrates the potential suitability of system dynamics modelling to inform policy- and decision-making in the developing country context. Secondly, the paper highlights the sustainability issues that must be addressed appropriately if concentrated solar thermal, and other renewable energy systems, are to be used in developing countries at the scale of desalination. Recommendations are made accordingly to improve the analysis, and its usefulness, to utilise this technique effectively in the future.

TI Research on supporting developing countries to achieve green development
   transition: Based on the perspective of renewable energy and foreign
   direct investment
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Transitioning to green development and decarbonizing the energy consumption structure is important for developing countries and global climate change governance. In developing countries, however, sustainable development is more difficult due to financial and technological constraints. This study was undertaken to investigate how foreign direct investment and renewable energy utilization can support developing countries in achieving green development, and to identify the complex relationships among internal and external influencing factors. A state-of-the-art data envelopment analysis method, coupled with the global non-radial directional distance function and a meta-frontier Malmquist index, measures the green total factor productivity and efficiency of 77 developing countries. A causal network that reflects both long-term and immediate relationships between green development performance and impact factors was constructed by embedding Geweke causal decomposition into Granger causality test. The study found that most developing countries are at the stage of high green levels and slow development, with the lack of green development potential serving as a hidden problem hindering their green development. The power and emission reduction technologies, economic agglomeration effect and industrial restructuring that foreign direct investment brings are contributing to green development achievements of developing countries, among which infrastructure construction, renewable energy investment, employment rate, and research and development investment are important transmission channels. With both long-term and immediate causalities to the economy, energy and industry of the host country, foreign direct investment is a key node of the causality network. In addition to helping developing countries achieve green development transition, this study provides information on the investment propensity and selectivity of investing countries.

TI Environmental factors in trade during the great transformation:
   advancing the geographical coverage before 1950
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HISTORY
AB In the study of trade-embedded environmental factors (land, water, energy, or material flows), three conflicting interpretations prevail concerning what happened before 1950. The 'great specialization' narrative argues that trade served to lighten pressure on the environment by redistributing environmental services from where they were abundant to where they were scarce. The 'great divergence' sees an exploitative transfer from poor countries to rich and powerful ones or an environmental load displacement from rich to poor. The 'great acceleration' dismisses flows as insignificant either way. We review long-term national studies and find an almost exclusive focus on developed countries, mostly European and especially the UK, where more systematic studies tend to support 'specialization' and/or 'acceleration'. By contrast, more qualitative studies on individual exports from developing countries often support 'divergence', but, since imports are excluded by design, this can never be demonstrated. We propose widening the geographical scope of long-term national studies beyond Europe and extending existing studies with bilateral trade, and suggest that 'developing country' trade be quantified according to existing methods of environmental accounting.

TI Effectiveness of aid-for-trade: Are there strings attached? Empirical
   evidence and the case of Vietnam
SO POST-COMMUNIST ECONOMIES
AB This paper tests empirically whether Aid-for-Trade has been working since its launch in the early 2000s. Using panel data consisting of 102 developing countries from 2002 to 2017, this paper finds that the Aid-for-Trade (AfT) initiative has been working conditionally. Specifically, AfT itself turns out to be effective in export promotion in developing countries, but more so only in a few countries with high growth rates. That is, AfT has greater effects in recipients with high state capacity and a sound economic environment. Additionally, the WTO-led AfT initiative, launched in 2005, has contributed to export promotion by aid recipients, indicating that more commitments from donor sides are essential for the effectiveness of AfT. These empirical findings are supported with evidence from the case of Vietnam, one of the largest recipients of both ODA and AfT, which illustrates the importance of the economic environment in which AfT initiative is implemented. Strategic economic policies implemented by the Vietnamese government have moved its centrally planned economy to a market-based economy, thus promoting integration with the global economy and creating a compatible environment for AfT.

TI Convergence of planning practices towards LUT integration: Seeking
   evidences in a developing country
SO LAND USE POLICY
AB City planning is a complex challenge that asks for problem-solving expertise to address stakeholders' diverging interests, while its multidisciplinary essence imposes communication difficulties among specialists from different disciplines. After decades developing planning theories and practical solutions in isolation, transportation planners acknowledged the importance of mutual influences between composing urban subsystems and proposed the concept of Land Use and Transport Interaction (LUTI) planning, where both urban-space and transportation planning efforts should converge to admit common problems and goals. Contemporary literature confirms that this convergence prospered in developed countries, but not so much in developing countries, due to political and economic issues. This paper aims to verify if urban-space planning concepts converge to the paradigm advocated by LUTI planners in the context of a developing country. To do so, a series of urban master plans developed in the past 50 years for Fortaleza, the 5th most populated city in Brazil, were assessed using an ALUTI (Activity, Land-Use, and Transport Interactions) conceptual framework as the analytical tool. Every intra and interrelations among the three urban subsystems were systematically checked. Evidences indicate that, considering Fortaleza a representative case of large cities in Brazil, urban-space planning in a developing country already share similarities with LUTI planning concepts that drive the latest evolutionary stage of transportation planning. The reviewed plans seem to have reached an evolutionary stage with evidences of more integrated practices, as it recognizes all ALUTI subsystems and its mutual relations. This indicates that the proposed conceptual structure is a tool capable of helping to assess whether the products and concepts of urban-space planning are aligned with the LUTI concepts or not, within some limitations.

TI Critical barriers to brownfield redevelopment in developing countries:
   The case of Pakistan
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Due to the scarcity of land for urban development, Brownfield Redevelopment (BR) is considered a sustainable urban land tool in developed countries, but its adoption in developing countries remains in its infancy. Barriers impeding BR need to be investigated in detail. However, few studies have analyzed barriers to BR in developing countries. This study aims to analyze the critical barriers to BR in Pakistan by using a two-stage methodology including the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Initially, 41 barriers were identified through a comprehensive literature review. FDM screened out 33 barriers through expert opinion. Survey questionnaires were sent to major stakeholders involved in the BR process. Finally, valid responses were analyzed using SEM to verify and rank the most critical barriers. Study results indicated 26 critical barriers. The top five critical barriers were lack of policy incentives, the complexity of public-private partnerships, lack of professional and technical personnel, the conflict between stakeholders, and lack of awareness of environmental law. A comparative analysis of barriers to BR in Pakistan and other countries including the USA, Canada, the UK, Germany, and China showed that critical barriers vary by country. Furthermore, factor analysis results extracted five major categories for 26 critical barriers, including political and legal barriers, financial and economic barriers, technical and operational barriers, management system barriers, and environmental barriers. The most dominant barrier category was technical and operational barriers, impeding BR in Pakistan. This study creates value in the BR literature by identifying the most critical barriers to BR in a developing country. It could support practitioners and land use policy makers in developing appropriate strategies to promote BR. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Leveraging intellectual capital in developing countries: evidence from
   Kenya
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore how organization's resources and community aspects shape intellectual capital (IC) performance in developing countries. In fact, it is still unclear to what level organizational aggregation can influence forms of IC performance in the simultaneous presence of strong traditional legacy and eagerness for development.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on a project of aggregation of artists in Kenya. It uses a mixed methods approach.
   Findings - The analysis first documents that multiple capital resources, i.e., human, social, and organizational contribute to improve IC performance. Social and organizational resources have the largest positive effects. This study then supports the importance of community aspects in fostering IC performance. In this light, it appears to facilitate knowledge interaction and interrelationship networks rather than accentuate possible pre-existing groups' rivalry.
   Research limitations/implications - The results are inferred from a single case study, and so the reader is given the caveat that the results cannot be easily generalized. The evidence gathered can represent a useful ground on which to build future studies comparing different legal, social, cultural, and economic contexts.
   Practical implications - This study gathers insights on how organization's resources can lead to IC performance in developing countries and in a setting characterized by a high degree of institutional complexity. It also addresses the call for more research on programs implemented at local level to leverage IC and to valorize traditional knowledge in a sustainable and concrete way.
   Originality/value - Evidence on IC in developing countries is still scant, besides their potential for growth. This study attempts to address this gap. Moreover, it pays attention to the context by analyzing the community aspects. Finally, the use of mixed methods further validates previous evidence on the relationship between organization's resources and IC performance.

TI Dynamics of electricity consumption, oil price and economic growth:
   Global perspective
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB This study uses the data from 157 countries from 1960 to 2014 to analyze the relationship between economic growth, electricity consumption, oil prices, capital, and labor. The economic growth of developing countries with industrial infrastructure has a more significant association with electricity consumption than oil prices. We use oil prices and electricity consumption jointly to study highly predictive observations for economic growth. The data are categorized by income, OECD and regional levels. The panel cointegration, long-run parameter estimation, and Pool Mean Group tests are used to analyze the cointegration and short-run and long-run relationships between the variables. The empirical results indicate the presence of cointegration between the variables. The presence of feedback effects between electricity consumption and economic growth, oil prices and economic growth is valid. These findings confirm that in spite of the oil prices, developing countries rely heavily on electricity consumption for economic growth. In the short run, growth and feedback effects suggest that more vigorous electricity policies should be implemented to attain sustainable economic growth for the long-term.

TI Global food crisis: magnitude, causes and policy measures
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the magnitude and various causes of the global food crisis. Further, the paper aims to suggest policy measures towards the solution of global food crisis problem.
   Design/methodology/approach - To verify the problem of global food crisis, the paper mainly utilizes food price index of UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and qualititative information to highlight the international reaction/initiative/scenario in food crisis regime.
   Findings - Food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food for a healthy and active life. Unlike nutrition, where treatment is guided by standard protocols based on human nutritional requirements, food security must take into account a wide range of factors such as climate, geography, socio-economic systems, and political structures. The challenges in achieving food security are to reduce poverty, increase food security without further degrading natural resources, and to cope with population growth, rising incomes and inflation, changing food habits, conversion of food crops into biofuels, increasing speculation in the commodity market and urbanization. To solve the problem of global food crisis, a coordinated multi-stranded approach is needed.
   Practical implications - Improving food security will help governments to achieve the millennium development goals (MDGs). Food security will not only help to eradicate hunger, it will also help to reduce child mortality and improve maternal health. Most importantly, it will help to break the cycle of poverty.
   Originality/value - The paper presents comprehensive research work in the field of global food crisis and highlights the various dimensions of the global food crisis problem. The paper also provides innovative policy measures to solve the global food crisis.

TI Teaching about development in a post-development society: the case of
   geography
SO INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH IN GEOGRAPHICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION
AB This article charts social and economic transformation in the developing world over recent decades by drawing on a number of different secondary data sources. I propose that this rapid change means that we need to re-think the teaching of development in the curriculum to move beyond a polarised view of developed versus developing. The article explores how the geography curriculum in England has been slow to capture this transformation due to the internalisation of post-development thought (the narrowing of notions of progress and human agency). Fears about environmental, social and moral limits have led to a prevailing standpoint that is sceptical of economic growth and large-scale development, and elevates consumption over the productive sphere. This standpoint is reflected in alternative theories of post-development and sustainable development which favour development that is small-scale, local and environmentally benign, all of which are embedded in the English geography curriculum. A case is made for re-claiming the meaning of development, necessitating an open exploration of how lives are being improved and cultural capital advanced as developing countries expand their productive potential and diversify their economies.

AB An organisation's competitive advantage depends on its ability to transfer knowledge effectively. Research suggests that knowledge transfer (KT) remains a problem for many organisations, particularly those in developing countries with emerging knowledge economies. Analysis of organisational KT problems in this context could be helpful in diagnosing particular challenges for sustainable development. In this paper, we apply a formal modelling approach to represent the KT processes within organisations. Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) are used to model human interactions during the transfer and model-checking techniques are used to analyse obstacles to effective KT. The application of CSP in analysing KT models in such a way is a novel idea. To demonstrate our approach we present a case study of a Chinese company and show how cultural attitudes in organisations, widely prevalent in some developing countries, could lead to problems in effective KT.

TI Ecological Sanitation - a way to solve global sanitation problems?
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Today about 2.4 billion people in rural and urban areas do not have access to adequate sanitation services. Within 20 years, it is expected that an additional 2 billion will live in towns and cities, mainly in developing countries, demanding sanitation. Still over 90% of sewage in developing countries is discharged untreated, polluting rivers, lakes and coastal areas. Conventional sanitation concepts, based on flush toilets, a water wasting technology, are neither an ecological nor economical solution in both industrialized and developing countries. The water-based sewage systems were designed and built on the premises that human excreta are a waste; suitable only for disposal and that the environment is capable of assimilating this waste.
   A sanitation system that provides Ecological Sanitation (EcoSan) is a cycle-a sustainable, closed-loop system, which closes the gap between sanitation and agriculture. The EcoSan approach is resource minded and represents a holistic concept towards ecologically and economically sound sanitation. The underlying aim is to close (local) nutrient and water cycles with as less expenditure on material and energy as possible to contribute to a sustainable development. Human excreta are treated as a resource and are usually processed on-site and then treated off-site. The nutrients contained in excreta are then recycled by using them, e.g., in agriculture.
   EcoSan is a systemic approach and an attitude; single technologies are only means to an end and may range from near-natural wastewater treatment techniques to compost toilets, simple household installations to complex, mainly decentralised systems. These technologies are not ecological per se but only in relation to the observed environment. They are picked from the whole range of available conventional, modem and traditional technical options, combining them to EcoSan systems.
   The paper presents an introduction to EcoSan principles and concepts including re-use aspects (available nutrients and occurring risks), and case studies of EcoSan concepts in both industrialized and developing countries. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Future Smart Food: Harnessing the potential of neglected and
   underutilized species for Zero Hunger
SO MATERNAL AND CHILD NUTRITION
AB Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2: 'Zero Hunger'-eradicating all forms of hunger and malnutrition-is a major challenge in many developing countries. To be successful, agriculture and food policies need to target both production and consumption. Conventional agri-food systems in developing countries could become more sustainable through agricultural diversification. In Asia, over-reliance on a few staple crops is a leading cause of low dietary diversity and persistent malnutrition. Promising neglected and underutilized species (NUS) that are nutrient dense, climate resilient, economically viable, and locally available or adaptable have been prioritized as Future Smart Food (FSF) and have a central role to play in the fight against hunger and malnutrition. An enabling environment for agriculture diversification with a food system approach-to promote sustainable production, processing and consumption of FSF-is essential for achieving Zero Hunger. This article (a) provides the context of hunger and malnutrition and highlights the features and gaps in current agriculture and food systems, (b) demonstrates the multidimensional benefits of FSF as an effective means to bridge production and nutrition gaps to address Zero Hunger and (c) offers a holistic food systems approach that promotes sustainable production, processing and consumption of FSF as a key element for achieving Zero Hunger.

The simple, economic and rapid Micro Biological Survey (MBS) method does not require an equipped laboratory nor special instruments and skilled technicians, but it can be very useful for routine water analysis. The aim of this work was the application of the MBS method to evaluate the microbiological safety of different water sources and the effectiveness of different drinking water treatments in the Horn of Africa. The obtained results have proved that this method could be very helpful to monitor water safety before and after various purification treatments, with the aim to control water-borne diseases especially in developing Countries, whose population is the most exposed to these diseases. In addition, it has been proved that Moringa oleifera water treatment is ineffective in decreasing bacterial load of Eritrea water samples.

AB Much of the developed world has gained experience and success with product energy efficiency standards and labeling programs over the last 20 years, and some developing countries have followed suit. Yet, many developing countries still have little or no experience in the field. Recently, a number of those countries recognized the potential economic and environmental benefits of standards and labeling and have begun to plan or develop such programs.
   This paper summarizes the history of standards and labeling programs internationally and notes the current status of such programs. The paper goes on to describe the creation of a network for sharing international experience on the implementation of energy efficiency standards and labels and accessing the financial, technical, and information resources that are available globally for policymakers. A list of countries that have expressed interest in developing and implementing standards and labeling programs is also provided(1).

AB In the conditions of globalization the effectiveness of a national economy and sustainability of economic development are increasingly influenced by foreign economic and trade relations. However, the character of such an influence is different for developed and developing countries and economies in transition. Development of integration processes in the region of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), striving of certain CIS countries for integration with the EU, and uncertain economic and trade relations between Russia and neighbor countries (tensions with Ukraine, future of economic and trading relations with the EU, bilateral economic and trade sanctions, etc.) transform market patterns and affect agricultural production, rural development and food security in both the EU and the CIS. The paper addresses those distortions, analyses how economies in transition transform to market economies through trade, and discusses what structural changes are needed for selected economies in transition to ensure their competitiveness on the global food market.

TI Global cost-effectiveness of cataract surgery
SO OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB Objective: To determine the cost-effectiveness of cataract surgery worldwide and to compare it with the cost-effectiveness of comparable medical interventions.
   Design: Meta-analysis.
   Participants: Approximately 12 000 eyes in the studies selected.
   Methods: Articles were identified by searching the literature using the phrase cataract surgery, in combination with the terms cost, cost-effectiveness, and cost-utility. Terms used for the comparable medical interventions search included epileptic surgery, hip arthroplasty, knee arthroplasty, carpal tunnel surgery, and defibrillator implantation. The search was restricted to the years 1995 through 2006. Cataract surgery costs were converted to 2004 United States dollars (US$). Cost-utility was calculated using: (1) costs discounted at 3% for 12 years with a discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gain of 1.25 years, and (2) costs discounted at 3% for 5 years with a discounted QALY gain of 0.143 years. The Cataract Surgery Affordability Index (CSAI) for each country was calculated by dividing the cost of cataract surgery by the gross national income per capita for the year 2004.
   Main Outcome Measures: Cost-utility in 2004 US$/QALY and affordability of cataract surgery relative to the United States.
   Results: Cost-utility values for cataract surgery (first eye) varied from $245 to $22 000/QALY in Western countries and from $9 to $1600 in developing countries. In developed countries, the cost-effectiveness of cataract surgery estimated by Choosing Interventions That Are Cost Effective ranged from, in international dollars (1$), 1$730 to I$2400/disability-adjusted life years (DALY) averted, and I$90 to I$370/DALY averted in developing countries. The CSAI varied from 17% to 189% in developed countries and 09% to 133% in developing countries compared with the United States. The cost-utility of other comparable medical interventions was: epileptic surgery, $4000 to $20 000/QALY; hip arthroplasty, $2300 to $4800/QALY; knee arthroplasty, $6500 to $12 700/ QALY; carpal tunnel surgery, $140 to $280/QALY; and defibrillator implantation, $700 to $23 000/QALY.
   Conclusions: The cost-utility of cataract surgery varies substantially, depending how the benefit is assessed and on the duration of the assumed benefit. Cataract surgery is comparable in terms of cost-effectiveness to hip arthroplasty, is generally more cost-effective than either knee arthroplasty or clefibrillator implantation, and is cost-effective when considered in absolute terms. The operation is considerably cheaper in Europe and Canada compared with the United States and is affordable in many developing countries, particularly India.

TI Low-carbon consumer behaviour in climate-vulnerable developing
   countries: A case study of Sri Lanka
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB A low-carbon economy requires low-carbon consumption by the public. Despite the importance of consumers in low-carbon economies, so far, most studies have ignored low-carbon consumer behaviour in developing countries that are vulnerable to climate change and its consequences. This indicates inattention to the socio-economic aspects of the general life style of the people in promoting sustainable consumption and accountability. This study examines the determinants of low-carbon consumption behaviour of consumers in climate-vulnerable developing countries by focusing on consumers in Sri Lanka. Combining the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and the Theory of Perceived Marketplace Influence (TPMI), the data collected from 440 Sri Lankan consumers was analysed using a structural equation model. The findings revealed the antecedent variables of TPB (i.e., attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control) and the additional variables (i.e. low-carbon-self-identity and implementation intention) that fully explains the carbon-conscious decision-making phenomenon in a developing country setting. The results confirm the appropriateness of the proposed model for predicting lowcarbon consumer behaviour in climate-vulnerable developing countries such as Sri Lanka as it increases the predictive power of the TPB framework. Accordingly, policy level implications and strategies for promoting individual low-carbon consumption behaviour are proposed.

TI BARRIERS TO SUSTAINABLE TOURISM DEVELOPMENT IN JAMAICA
SO TOURISM ANALYSIS
AB Many destinations have recognized the importance of implementing sustainable tourism development. However, for many developing countries worldwide, economic, social, and physical challenges pose great hindrances to sustainable development. The aim of this article is to investigate and evaluate the difficulties of implementing sustainable tourism development practices in Jamaica. The primary research is based on qualitative analysis to find out the obstacles regarding the implementation of sustainable tourism development, based on three themes, namely financial constraints, social instability, and lack of coordinated tourism planning. The overall results revealed that, in terms of sustainable practices, there are several initiatives being implemented by both public and private sectors, but they lack management, cohesiveness, and in some cases, collaboration. Also, if sustainability is to be achieved in a developing country, it will require effective financial management of all industries and a serious concentration on social sustainability.

TI COMMUNITY FORESTRY IN DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES - A
   COMPARATIVE-STUDY
SO FORESTRY CHRONICLE
AB Concerns about the ecological and economic sustainability of industrial forestry led to the revival of community forestry (CF) in the developing countries.  Recently, the developed countries are also examining the feasibility of CF as a land management alternative for the similar reasons.  This paper compares the opportunities and challenges of CF in the developing and developed countries.  Particular emphasis is placed on the goals and objectives, participants and beneficiaries, land tenure, size and management, ecology and economics of CF.  In the developing countries CF is generally small, labour intensive and geared to meeting the basic needs of the community people.  By contrast, CF in the developed countries is large, capital intensive and market oriented.  Notwithstanding the differences, CF provides an opportunity for ecosystem management to maintain community stability and ecological integrity in both developing and developed countries.

TI Research approaches for improved pro-poor control of zoonoses
SO FOOD AND NUTRITION BULLETIN
AB Background. Developing countries face difficulties in sustainably utilizing tools to effectively implement control measures for zoonoses. This is mainly due to dispersed and heterogeneous smallholder livestock systems, predominance of informal markets, poor infrastructure and lack of resources to deliver information, interventions, and regulations. In addition, developing countries lack an evidence base for planning and targeting control efforts. Zoonotic infections are receiving more and more international attention as diseases of neglected and impoverished communities, at the intersection between livestock production, human health, and poverty.
   Objective. To review research innovations and trends that can help identify and test targeted control strategies for zoonoses tailored to poor communities, focusing particularly on Africa.
   Methods. Review of recommendations of relevant working groups and scientific literature.
   Results. New and innovative research approaches promise to better capture the impact of zoonoses from a societal perspective and the perspective of poor livestock owners through more comprehensive frameworks that consider benefits of the control of zoonoses to the public health, livestock, and private sectors. It is challenging to better assure food safety in informal markets. Risk-based approaches with participatory elements provide a framework in which stakeholders can decide an appropriate level of protection to balance the needs for safe food, cheap food, and pro-poor economic growth. Appropriate information for all stakeholders and capacity-building Of national and regional authorities is an important element of this process. New diagnostic tools that are accurate and easily used in developing-country health centers and markets can assist in reporting of cases, detection of patients, and testing of control strategies.
   Conclusions. A research agenda on zoonoses of the livestock sector should be interdisciplinary and participatory and include intersectoral collaborations, notably between the livestock and public health sectors.

TI A rationale for stakeholder-based management in developing nations
SO JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE
AB Purpose - The paper aims to provide a rationale for stakeholder-based management in developing countries. To implement the objectives, the paper contrasts the implications of agency and stakeholder theories as they apply to developing countries and highlight "total wealth creation"and "purposive adaptation"that support developmental goals of developing countries. This "purposive adaptation"also implicates the use of management accounting tools in a flexible way to meet the needs of the strategy.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses conceptual analysis and the case study approach
   Findings - The Tata Steel case illustrates the normative stakeholder approach in the developing country context. Specifically, the case highlights strategy developed through "stakeholder engagement"and the application of the balanced scorecard to address stakeholder issues in implementing the strategy, illustrating the rationale underlying the stakeholder approach in addressing developmental concerns through more dispersed and larger wealth creation.
   Research limitations/implications - There is limited scope to use methods other than illustrating the theory using specific instances of its application, as in the case approach.
   Practical implications - The paper illustrates long-term implications on sustainable development.
   Originality/value - Few papers consider contextualizing theoretical implications of management to developing countries. This is important as the theory has implications on development in such aspects as environmental costs, increasing inequality, and associated issues. The paper directs attention to the importance of identifying theory that addresses the unique management challenges in developing countries and can potentially enable further research to systematize and generalize management approaches in developing countries.

SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Background There is increasing recognition of the complexity underlying WASH conditions in developing countries. This article explores the complexity by assessing the vulnerability of a specific area to poor WASH conditions using a qualitative approach. Methods We present our findings for the district of East Sumba in Indonesia. This area is known as one of the poorest regions in Indonesia with inadequate WASH services, indigenous belief that hinder the practice of WASH-related behaviours, and has a high rate of children malnutrition. All the factors that contribute to poor WASH conditions were discussed through the lens of the Financial, Institutional, Environmental, Technological, and Social (FIETS) framework. We then summarised the factors and visualized the "system" using a mind map which shows how factors are interconnected and helps to find the root causes of poor WASH conditions. Results There are three main challenges that inhibit the improvement of WASH conditions in this area: inadequate institutional capacity, water scarcity, and poor socio-economic conditions. We found that a village leader is the most important actor who influences the sustainability of WASH services in this area and healthcare workers are influential WASH promoters. This study also shows how culture shapes people's daily lives and institution performance, and influences the current WASH conditions in East Sumba. The mind map shows there is an overlap and interconnection between FIEST aspects and WASH conditions in the study area. Conclusion WASH conditions are influenced by many factors and are often interconnected with each other. Understanding this complexity is necessary to improve WASH conditions and sustain adequate WASH services in developing countries. Finally, WASH interventions have to be considerate of the prevailing cultural practices and should involve multidisciplinary stakeholders.

TI Greenhouse gas emissions in the construction industry: An analysis and
   evaluation of a concrete supply chain
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Significant anthropocentric environmental impact derives from civil construction. In developing countries, such as China, Turkey, and Brazil, this sector plays a relatively larger economic role. Adopting sustainable concrete production and usage strategies not only reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions but also decreases consumption of energy and water, two critical commodities likely to be in short supply in developing economies. Moreover, in developing countries, there is uneven and inadequate access to social and economic benefits (e.g., housing, roads, energy, etc.) for a substantial segment of the society. These emerging economy nations will have to engage in large scale civil construction and energy production projects to improve living conditions. As a result, transitioning to a low carbon economy becomes even more critical and at the same time more burdensome for developing countries. Due to the importance of the civil construction industry to Turkey and the industry's adverse impact on GHG emissions and resulting climate change, this study investigates measurement and management of the total GHG emissions for a major tunnel project by a Turkish construction company. As a case study, emission values are calculated for the raw materials constituting tunnel construction rings, which are the major structural component of the tunnel. The GHG emissions-measured in equivalent carbon dioxide, (CO(2)e) -used in this study are the sum of the emissions during the production of the raw materials and emissions during their transportation from the suppliers to the company. The results are also useful across countries who utilize similar concrete specifications as prescribed by regulators and industry associations. A broader sustainability, including socio-economic concerns, is included as complementary discussion to the emissions/environmental calculations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
AB Access to clean and affordable energy remains United Nations' seventh sustainable development goal (SDG 7), illustrating its importance for the global community. The situation is particularly alarming in developing countries where a lack of access to electricity undermines their social and economic development. Against this backdrop, this study highlights the relevance of human capital in reducing energy poverty in emerging economies. For this purpose, the empirical investigation relies upon a large sample of 108 developing economies over the period 2000-2019. Our results, based on the Pedroni cointegration technique, confirm the presence of long-run relationships among the variables. Furthermore, the outcomes of dynamic ordinary least square estimations confirm the existence of a positive relationship between education and access to electricity in the sample economies. Moreover, we also confirm the influence of financial development and income in energy poverty reduction of the sample economies. These findings have some important policy implications for developing countries.

AB Energy shortage is one of the major impediments to social, industrial and economic growths in developing countries. For instance, only about 40% of Nigeria's population (about 170 million) has access to electricity. Due to this, petrol/diesel generators are used for electricity generation in various sectors of the country, which are not eco-friendly. Though developing countries are thought to emit lesser greenhouse gases compared to industrialized nations, due to low industrial activities, a global cooperation is necessary to mitigate climate change.
   The intent of this paper is to develop solar power generation systems through Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which involves investments in clean technologies, in developing countries by governments, companies or agencies from developed countries, with the aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, at an optimum cost. This could offer a possible solution to energy poverty, and also lead to sustainable development in developing countries, including Nigeria. Case studies were conducted for Nigeria using small-scale PV systems for different applications. The paper also presents the modalities for CDM agreement between two parties, the benefits and challenges. The CO2 emissions that could be avoided by adopting the proposed energy systems are also discussed.

AB Worldwide, where freshwater resources are limited, a major water scarcity problem occurs. Population growth, which leads to increased water consumption with high inefficiencies of household water use behaviour especially in developing countries, makes the problem worse. In this situation, a sustainable urban water management approach which considers household water consumption patterns is required. However, country specific water consumption data particularly for the developing countries is limited. This paper investigates per capita water consumption in Sirte city by evaluating the indoor and outdoor domestic water uses using a survey. The survey contains information about demographic, socio-economic and household water end use behavioural characteristics. The preliminary results suggest that water consumption varies with the type of dwelling and females tends to consume considerable more water in comparison to males. Household income does not seem to affect water consumption.

TI Scaling up climate-smart regenerative agriculture for the restoration of
   degraded agroecosystems in developing countries
SO SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
AB Climate change and anthropogenic forces have increased the soil and water vulnerability of arid and semi-arid developing countries. Particular interventions are required to mitigate the soil, water, and food insecurity crises, and enhance the resilience of farming systems to climatic and anthropogenic stressors. This research contributes to the development of such systems by identifying the most efficient interventions for the restoration of soil and water resources and investigating the principal drivers of resilient farming. Given the complexity of the farm eco-systems, the challenges and problems of agricultural development in a vulnerable community (Kerman Province, Iran) were assessed. Using qualitative research, 37 barriers were identified. Also, AHP analysis identified climate -smart regenerative agriculture (CSRA) as a plausible and prominent solution for restoring degraded agroecosystems. However, CSRA development is in the incipient stage in developing countries, and its adoption rate is low. Interpretive structural modeling and MICMAC analysis indicated that political, strategic, economic, in-stitutional, structural, technological, ecological, social, cultural, and psychological changes are required to give the CSRA a chance at prosperity. Demand-driven and interactive research, regime transformation, mobilization of re-sources, market development, and multilateral coordination are keys to successful scaling up CSRA in soil and water vulnerable areas.(c) 2023 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

TI Adoption and Abandonment of Partial Conservation Technologies in
   Developing Economies: The Case of South Asia
SO LAND USE POLICY
AB Conservation agriculture (CA), a resource saving production system, could increase marginal farmers' incomes and sustainable agricultural systems, but adoption of CA includes the adoption of multiple technologies in the form of a package. Consequently, a complete adoption of a package of full CA technologies could be costly in the developing countries. Alternatively, encouraging the adoption of a complete package of CA technologies, in some cases, partial adoption of selected CA technologies (or PCA) may be suitable for the developing countries. Using farm-level data this study investigates the factors affecting the adoption and abandonment of PCA in the Indo-Gangetic plains of India. Particular attention is given to the role of spouses and social networks in the adoption and abandonment decisions of PCA. Findings show that social networks have a significantly positive effect on the adoption, but a significantly negative effect on the abandonment of PCA. Additionally, spouse's involvement in agricultural activities has a significant effect on the adoption of PCA. Finally, we find that farmers who saw PCA in action and not just heard from their neighbors, were more likely to adopt and less likely to abandon PCA. Therefore, promotional events through audio and visual media may not be as effective in the adoption of PCA.

TI Development of a pragmatic methodology for the environmental assessment
   of uncontrolled dumpsites in developing countries
SO ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
AB The management of solid waste is a major determinant for sustainable development due to the social, economic, and environmental implications that the sector can have on public health and the environment. Generally, the practice of solid waste disposal by means of landfilling in developing countries is below par resulting in numerous open dumps/uncontrolled landfills that lack the necessary remedial and control measures. Several models and approaches have been applied for the environmental assessment of uncontrolled landfills that depend on complex physical models and probabilistic concepts that are normally difficult to use, involve large amount of data and thus are time consuming and costly. This research aimed to formulate a pragmatic methodology that can be utilized in low- and middle-income countries where comprehensive environmental assessment studies are scarce. The proposed methodological framework can guide decision makers in prioritizing sites for remediation according to their potential for contamination of surface and groundwater as well as air. A pilot basin and dumpsite were selected to test the methodology. Application of the methodology provided plausible results on the significance of the impacts on water resources and air quality and provided a systematic approach to guide the decision-making process on the need to rehabilitate the dumpsite.

TI Fiscal Policy Effects on Private Expenditure for Sustainable Economic
   Growth: A Panel VAR Study from Selected Developing Countries
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This study examines the effects of fiscal policy on private expenditure using a panel VAR for the sample of 60 developing countries from 1990 to 2020. The VAR panel model framework was used to focus on the disaggregated government expenditures which included the defense, economic and social expenditure. The main findings showed a positive shock effect of defense expenditure which led to crowding out effect on private expenditure and domestic income. Conversely, economic and social expenditure had the crowding in effect on private consumption and domestic income. To detail out the analysis, the composition of government spending was divided into two, namely productive expenditures and non-productive expenditures. Therefore, the findings indicate that defense expenditure is non-productive since it does not stimulate an increase in private spending and national income while economic expenditure and social expenditure are classified as productive expenditure with the ability to increase economic activity. The policy implication suggests that the government should carefully examine and identify the sectors or composition that have greater potential, capacity and relevance in stimulating sustainable economic growth.

AB Technology transfer of renewable energy technologies is very often unsuccessful in the developing world. Aside from challenges that have social, economic, financial, institutional and environmental dimensions, technology transfer has generally been misunderstood, and largely seen as mere delivery of high tech equipment from developed to developing countries or within the developing world from R&D institutions to society. Technology transfer entails much more, including, but not limited to: entire systems and their component parts, know-how, goods and services, equipment, and organisational and managerial procedures. Means to facilitate the successful transfer of energy technologies, including the sharing of lessons are subsequently extremely important for developing countries as they grapple with increasing energy needs to sustain adequate economic growth and development. Improving the success of technology transfer is an ongoing process as more projects are implemented, new problems are encountered and new lessons are learnt. Renewable energy is also critical to improve the quality of lives of the majority of people in developing countries. In rural areas energy is primarily traditional biomass. The consumption activities typically occur in an inefficient manner, thus working against the notion of sustainable development. This paper explores the implementation of technology transfer in the developing world (sub-Saharan Africa). The focus is necessarily on RETs since most rural energy initiatives are RETs-based. Additionally, it aims to highlight some lessons drawn from the cited RE projects and identifies notable differences where energy technology transfer was judged to be successful. This is done through a literature review based on a selection of documented case studies which are judged against the definition provided for technology transfer. This paper also puts forth research recommendations that might contribute to improved technology transfer in the developing world.
   Key findings of this paper include: Technology transfer cannot be complete without satisfying pre-conditions such as: affordability, maintenance (and associated plans), knowledge and skills transfer, appropriate know how, ownership and commitment, ability to adapt technology, sound business principles such as financial viability and sustainability, project management, relevance and many others. It is also shown that lessons are learnt in both successful and unsuccessful projects.

TI Import product diversification and renewable energy: a new appraisal
   from developed and developing countries
SO ENERGY SOURCES PART B-ECONOMICS PLANNING AND POLICY
AB This study investigates the role of the import diversification in the renewable energy consumption for a global panel of both developing and developed economies. The study applies panel co-integration and panel quantile regression analysis on the panel data of 138 countries during 1995-2018. For empirical analysis, the authors used Pedroni) cointegration test and panel-quantile regressions. The investigation proves that the import diversification significantly reduces the renewable energy consumption and there is a major need for designing and implementing some revised and synchronized policies of trade with the energy mix and sustainable development goals. The empirical findings claim that the foreign direct investments, natural resources and GDP increase significantly boost the renewable energy demand for both groups of developing and developed countries. Therefore, this study shows that generally the current trade policies might be ineffective and import diversification policies should be reformed to match with the energy regulations, manufacturing, and sustainable development goals.

SO DISABILITY AND REHABILITATION-ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY
AB Purpose: The burden of hearing impairment and disability is substantial in the developing world. This review outlines the associated need for amplification devices in low and medium income countries and some of the initiatives that have been taken to improve access to such devices, particularly hearing aids. The main observed barriers to access are listed and possible ways to improve access are considered. Methods: Prevalence estimates for disabling hearing impairment are reviewed and a number of national and international examples of initiatives to facilitate use of hearing assistive devices in low and medium income countries are provided. Technologies that are potentially appropriate for hearing instruments in developing countries are suggested, as well as fitting programs that are more likely to be maintained over the long term. Results: Challenges to successful hearing instrument fitting in low and medium income countries are many. However, some programs point the way to improved access to such devices. Successful hearing aid fitting programs in developing countries have typically combined appropriate technology with a sustainable local support base. Conclusions: With a rising middle class in many developing countries, advances in technology, and ongoing training programs for those involved in amplification fitting, hearing device usage rates may eventually reach parity with those in developed economies.

It demonstrates how the great climate debate between the 'skeptics' and 'supporters' does not lead developing countries anywhere. The article shows that the emerging middle-path approach, which suits developing countries will lead to win-win opportunities both for the environment and the economy. The proponents of this approach are termed as 'climate realists', who consider climate mitigation as a by-product of sustainable development solutions. The article also discusses the issue of discount rate that should be applied for problems which are likely to peak in the medium to long-term future. Finally, various market-based mechanisms with 'no-regret options' are discussed and we advocate the use of sustainable development paradigm for climate-change policies.

TI Resource Misallocation and Energy-Related Pollution
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Developing countries face the conflict between economic development and environmental protection. Resource misallocation will not only affect the effectiveness of economic development, but also have environmental impacts. Based on two large-scale enterprise databases in China, this paper measured the level of enterprise resource allocation, and further used empirical research methods to investigate the environmental impact of enterprise resource misallocation and specific mechanisms. The results show that the low efficiency of resource allocation will harm the quality of China's environment. Further investigation, resource misallocation is accompanied by an increase in total energy input, a decrease in the labor-to-energy ratio and the capital-to-energy ratio, and a loss of energy efficiency, which in turn affects the environmental performance of enterprises. China is the largest developing country in the world, and research on China's environmental and economic issues is important. The conclusions of this paper can provide experience and suggestions for other developing countries to improve environmental quality and promote sustainable development from the perspective of resource misallocation.

TI Climate change, sustainable development and India: Global and national
   concerns
SO CURRENT SCIENCE
AB Climate change is one of the most important global environmental challenges, with implications for food production, water supply, health, energy, etc. Addressing climate change requires a good scientific understanding as well as coordinated action at national and global level. This paper addresses these challenges. Historically, the responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions' increase lies largely with the industrialized world, though the developing countries are likely to be the source of an increasing proportion of future emissions. The projected climate change under various scenarios is likely to have implications on food production, water supply, coastal settlements, forest ecosystems, health, energy security, etc. The adaptive capacity of communities likely to be impacted by climate change is low in developing countries. The efforts made by the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol provisions are clearly inadequate to address the climate change challenge. The most effective way to address climate change is to adopt a sustainable development pathway by shifting to environmentally sustainable technologies and promotion of energy efficiency, renewable energy, forest conservation, reforestation, water conservation, etc. The issue of highest importance to developing countries is reducing the vulnerability of their natural and socio-economic systems to the projected climate change. India and other developing countries will face the challenge of promoting mitigation and adaptation strategies, bearing the cost of such an effort, and its implications for economic development.

TI Assessment of municipal infrastructure development and its critical
   influencing factors in urban China: A FA and STIRPAT approach
SO PLOS ONE
AB Municipal infrastructure is a fundamental facility for the normal operation and development of an urban city and is of significance for the stable progress of sustainable urbanization around the world, especially in developing countries. Based on the municipal infrastructure data of the prefecture-level cities in China, municipal infrastructure development is assessed comprehensively using a FA (factor analysis) model, and then the stochastic model STIRPAT (stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence and technology) is examined to investigate key factors that influence municipal infrastructure of cities in various stages of urbanization and economy. This study indicates that the municipal infrastructure development in urban China demonstrates typical characteristics of regional differentiation, in line with the economic development pattern. Municipal infrastructure development in cities is primarily influenced by income, industrialization and investment. For China and similar developing countries under transformation, national public investment remains the primary driving force of economy as well as the key influencing factor of municipal infrastructure. Contribution from urbanization and the relative consumption level, and the tertiary industry is still scanty, which is a crux issue for many developing countries under transformation. With economic growth and the transformation requirements, the influence of the conventional factors such as public investment and industrialization on municipal infrastructure development would be expected to decline, meanwhile, other factors like the consumption and tertiary industry driven model and the innovation society can become key contributors to municipal infrastructure sustainability.

AB As the second millennium ended, Cardiovascular disease (CVD) (heart disease and stroke) accounted for over 15 million death world-wide. Much of these deaths due to CVD occurred in the developing countries (DC) and economies in transition (ET) (former Soviet Union countries). The projections for the next two decades are even more alarming for DC and ET, as the CVD would become the number one cause of death. Many of the international organizations including World Health Organization (WHO), World Heart Federation (WHF), World Bank (WB), and others are concerned about this growing epidemic. As the non-communicable diseases are rising in the DC and ET, in contrast to the decline in developed countries, they face a double jeopardy of both communicable and non-communicable disease burden.
   In an attempt to combat the pandemic of CVD in DC and ET, the WHF assessed the global situation to take stock of (i) available resources-both human and fiscal; (ii) base-line data on which to embark on programs; (iii) prevention programs and legislations. The outcome of this effort was a resource document entitled "Global Pandemic of Cardiovascular Disease: Opportunities for prevention and control of cardiovascular disease in developing countries and economies in transition", often referred to as the WHF White Book.
   This paper describes the magnitude of the problem of CVD, burden of disease, lack of baseline data, prevention programs and absence of legislation against tobacco. Based on the White Book, it is clear that the DC and ET can not afford to follow the western medical strategy to solve the CVD epidemic, since the available resources in many of these countries is $25, or less, per person per year for the entire health care. It is essential to approach this issue largely through health promotion, and primordial and primary prevention. At the same time, clinical care should be provided to those who have been manifested with the disease. Available resources must be equitably expended with careful planning. There is a role for health professionals and voluntary agencies to partner with international agencies, the public and governments in addressing the CVD pandemic. The lessons learnt from the west could be adopted in the DC and ET with appropriate cultural sensitivities. This is a global problem and the solutions must be global too.

TI R&D Expenditure for New Technology in Livestock Farming: Impact on GHG
   Reduction in Developing Countries
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The achievement of the objectives of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has increasingly received attention and support from decision makers and research by scholars. The livestock sector has always been one of the major sources of GHG emissions, especially in developing countries that do not have green technologies to improve the management of livestock waste. In order to achieve an absolute reduction in emissions, developed countries have applied a wide range of mitigation options; however, there are few studies from the developing world, although greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries have registered a rapid growth. Therefore, this research aims to assess and understand whether public R&D investments can affect emissions deriving from the livestock sector in developing countries. We made use of the FAOSTAT data (FAO Statistical Databases United Nations) and ASTI data set (Agricultural Science and Technology Indicators), collecting data from 29 Africa countries, in 2014 (latest data available). The data were analyzed by means of a Generalized Propensity Scores (GPS) approach, an increasingly widespread technique that is more robust than regression models, especially in small datasets. Our analysis suggests that the livestock sector in these countries shows an improvement in its relationships with the environment and GHG emission levels when the level of public R&D (Research and Development) investment on agriculture is greater. Therefore, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by investing in research and development can lead to more efficient and sustainable resource management for developing countries.

This paper probes into the specific patterns of the technological innovation regime of the developing countries. Features of the market-oriented stage and the knowledge-based stage of innovation are illustrated. At the first stage of the market-oriented innovation, clusters undergo a rapid and radical expansion and their technology cumulativeness level is increased. Restructuring happens at the knowledge-oriented innovation stage, driving the clusters to upgrade from production to higher value-added sectors in the industrial chain and leading to more promising developmental outcomes. By analyzing the interactions between market expansion and knowledge accumulation of Shaoxing, a leading textile cluster in China, this paper suggests the construction of a supportive environment which facilitates the sustainable improvement in the innovation capability and the economic performance of industrial clusters in the developing countries.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB Epidemiological disaster management, using geoinformatics (GIS), is an innovative field of rapid information gathering. Dengue fever, a vector-borne disease, also known as break bone fever, is a lethal re-emerging arboviral disease. Its endemic flow is causing serious effects to the economy and health at the global level. Even now, many under-developed and developing countries like Pakistan lack the necessary GIS technologies to monitor such health issues. The aim of this study is to enhance the effectiveness of developing countries through disaster management capabilities by using state-of-the-art technologies, which provide the measures to relief the disaster burden on public sector agencies. In this paper, temporal changes and regional burden for distribution of this disease are mapped using GIS tools. For the prevention of disaster burden, these types of studies are widely used to provide an effective help and relief. This study concludes that a public sector institute can use such tools for surveillance purpose and to identify the risk areas for possible precautionary measures.

This method of tourism has become common in most countries of the world which is one of the dimensions of tourism for development like metal industry or sport industry. The stability and dynamism of country's economy help the development of ecotourism. Furthermore, medical tourism with economic consequences can have significant environmental effects. For this purpose, this research was done to study and evaluate the factors affecting the development of medical tourism in developing countries. The approach governing this research is developmental, and the research method is descriptive and analytical. A multivariate regression test was used to analyze the hy-potheses of research, and statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 19.0 software. The ecotourism and economic management can have a global or local roles as suitable tools for sustainable tourism. Ecotourism is often not properly oriented and mainly defined in such a way that the practitioners are far from the declared standards to achieve and succeed in the sus-tainability process. The current research is descriptive-explanatory which compiled using library documents. The analysis of the path of above factors shows that all factors of price, quality, fa-cilities, and information and communication technology directly and indirectly play a significant role to enhance the medical tourism.

AB Over the last two decades, global electricity production has more than doubled and electricity demand is rising rapidly around the world as economic development spreads to emerging economies. Not only has electricity demand increased significantly, it is the fastest growing end-use of energy. Therefore, technical, economic and environmental benefits of hydroelectric power make it an important contributor to the future world energy mix, particularly in the developing countries. On the other hand, the hydropower industry is closely linked to both water management and renewable energy production, and so has a unique role to play in contributing to sustainable development in a world where billions of people lack access to safe drinking water and adequate energy supplies. In addition to, approximately 1.6 billion people have no access to electricity and about 1.1 billion are without adequate water supply. However, resources for hydropower development are widely spread around the world. Potential exists in about 150 countries, and about 70% of the economically feasible potential remains to be developed-mostly in developing countries where the needs are most urgent. This paper deals with renewable energy systems and the role of hydropower in Turkey.

TI Trade liberalization and its economic impact on developing and least
   developed countries
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE LAW AND POLICY
AB Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the impact of trade liberalization on economic growth of selected developing and least developed economies by augmenting standard production function.
   Design/methodology/approach - The panel fixed effect model is used to estimate impacts of macroeconomic variables on economic growth. Real GDP million US$ is taken as proxy for economic growth. The capital stock series for each cross-section is generated from gross fixed capital formation. The total trade to GDP is taken as proxy for trade liberalization.
   Findings - The result shows significant positive impact of selected macroeconomic variables on economic growth, except trade liberalization index. The one unit increase in trade liberalization deteriorates economic growth, of developing countries by -280.86 million US$ and least developing by -3555.09 million US$.
   Research limitations/implications - The significant negative impact indicates the relatively greater share of import than exports. The developing nations should develop production side and adopt export promotion policies besides managing imports for the achievement of sustainable growth.
   Originality/value - This study uses augmented production function and constructed capital stock for individual countries. The total trade to GDP is taken as index for trade liberalization and was found to have significant negative impact.

TI Can Trade Green China? Participation in the global economy and the
   environmental performance of Chinese firms
SO JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CHINA
AB How does participation in the global economy influence the pollution management practices of firms in a developing country? Research on trade and the environment leads one to anticipate that integration into the international economy should enhance domestic firm environmental behavior. Integration facilitates access to cleaner technology, exposes domestic firms to global norms of corporate environmentalism, and compels developing country firms to meet trading partners' environmental standards or risk losing market access. This article tests these propositions by exploring the environmental compliance of internationally oriented firms in China-a country whose rapid economic expansion and increasingly prominent role as a foreign investor have considerable implications for protection of the global environment. It finds that there is only modest market-induced enhancement of environmental performance among Chinese companies. In terms of their compliance with environmental law, Chinese firms with connections to the global economy are either no better than domestically oriented companies or, in the case of firms that export heavily, are worse.

TI Sustainable recycling model: A comparative analysis between India and
   Tanzania
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Higher economic growth in developing countries has caused higher amounts of wastes. Local government authorities in these countries usually fail to provide adequate services to dispose the increasing amounts of waste, resulting in threats for both the population and environment health. There is therefore an urgent need for recycling as a form of waste management in order to stop the devastating effects of solid waste in developing countries. Using a qualitative method of analysis, this study presents a model to measure and rank the sustainability of recycling programs in India and Tanzania. The model consists of six main constructs including "production, economic. governmental, social, technological, and international factors". The results showed that India outperforms Tanzania in sustainable recycling programs: per capita waste generated per day in Delhi is higher than in Dar es Salaam; the government of India focuses more on developing recycling plans and techniques as compared to the government of Tanzania where the country is not actively involved in the recycling process; and the solid waste management planning in India is being performed better than Tanzania.

AB Education is one of the most important government expenditures, and is touted by many as a fundamental factor in leveling the field, overcoming inequality to achieve sustainable economic growth and prosperity. It is also a means to further opportunities for greater social development and societal wellbeing. In this study World Bank's information spanning from 1972 to 2011 is used, and the premise of education's role in economic growth is tested by studying Granger's causality of education spending in both developed and developing countries. While countries with high growth rates invest more in education, such increased educational spending does neither imply nor determine necessarily an increased growth. This result sheds doubts on the efficacy of government spending in education and its role in the economic growth of nations. The work presented aims to contribute from the public policy perspective, leaving open the possibilities for future, more disaggregated studies on this subject.

TI Social integration as a factor of economic growth: experience and
   perspectives of developing countries
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL POLICY
AB Purpose The purpose of the work consists in studying social integration as a factor of economic growth. The authors focus on experience and perspectives of developing countries, as they show the highest rate of economic growth and have high potential of its acceleration. Design/methodology/approach The authors determine the interconnection between the processes of social integration in the four distinguished manifestations with the help of regression analysis and determine the level of homogeneity of data selections for each studied indicator with the help of variation analysis. Scenario analysis of future perspectives of the change of economic growth depending on the influence of the factor of social integration in the unity of its distinguished types is performed. Monte Carlo method is used for forecasting of change of the values of indicators of social integration. Findings It is substantiated that social integration is an important factor of economic growth. At the same time, the influence of this factor on economic growth of developing countries is ambiguous. Due to the offered proprietary classification of social integration according to the criterion of involved subjects, it is possible to establish that such types of social integration as integration of social groups, integration of business and society and integration of state and society have a positive influence. However, individual's integration into society has a negative influence. Originality/value The research contributes to development of economics by substantiating the significance of the social integration factor for economic growth and specifies the logic of management of this factor, which should be flexible. The perspectives of developing countries in acceleration of the rate of economic growth based on managing the factor of social integration are rather wide and envisage the increase of society's inclusion and the level of consumer consciousness and more active involvement of population into state management in the digital economy.

TI Experiences in renewable energy and energy efficiency in Tunisia: Case
   study of a developing country
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Tunisia is one of the few developing countries to have developed a proactive policy for the promotion of renewable energy and energy efficiency already in the mid-1980s. This policy gained special momentum starting in the mid-2000s, in the context of spiraling international oil prices and the development of a steadily growing energy deficit.
   This momentum resulted in the development of ambitious energy efficiency and renewable energy development programs, designed to meet energy requirements in a cost-effective manner and to reduce the Tunisian economy's vulnerability to rising fossil fuel prices. The three-year (2005-2007) and four-year (2008-2011) programs as well as the Tunisian solar plan are strong indicators of Tunisia's commitment to a genuine, large-scale sustainable energy policy. They represent a framework for development and investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency in Tunisia. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI An integrated methodology for establishing industrial effluent limits in
   developing countries: Iran as a case study
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB BackgroundEnvironmental policies should be developed in a contextual decision-making process regarding local environmental concerns emphasizing the economic, technical, social and institutional considerations. Establishing emission limit levels, especially in the industrial sector, is one of the most problematic environmental issues in developing countries, for which it is essential to include several criteria that reflect their country-specific constraints and capacities. Since Best Available Technology (BAT) is acknowledged to be the reference element for sustainable development and a basis for Emissions Limit Values (ELVs), the objective of this study is to present a reliable methodology for establishing ELVs thresholds with an emphasis on the BAT concept for national regulation at the sector level.MethodsA hybrid fuzzy multiple-criteria decision-making (FMCDM) process, consisting of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (fuzzy TOPSIS) method, is structured to aggregate the different criteria and rank different ELV alternatives in this complicated evaluation. In order to use the most profound knowledge and judgment of a professional expert team, this qualitative assessment highlights the importance of supportive information.ResultsThe results obtained indicate that experts have considered the country-specific information as a reliable reference in their decisions. Among different key evaluation criteria in effluent standard setting, the highest experts' priority is Environmental protection. For both the conventional and toxic pollutants, the influence of all other criteria namely Economic feasibility, Technology viability and Institutional capacity, as constraining criteria in developing countries, have not reduced the responsibility towards the environmental objectives. In ELVs ranking, experts have made their decisions with respect to the specific characteristics of each pollutant and the existing capacities and constraints of the country, without emphasizing on any specific reference.ConclusionsThis systematic and transparent approach has resulted in defensible country-specific ELVs for the Iron and Steel industry, which can be developed for other sectors. As the main conclusion, this paper demonstrates that FMCDM is a robust tool for this comprehensive assessment especially regarding the data availability limitations in developing countries.

TI Studying the Effect of Corruption on Income Per-capita Level in an IV
   Estimation in Developing countries
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Income per-capita is a measure of economic well-being. Through its effect on economic development, it can indirectly affect sustainable development. Hence, it is essential to study the determinants of Income per-capita Level. Recently, corruption level has played an influential role in determining income per-capita. However, theoretically and empirically its effect is still debatable. Besides the traditional determinants of income per-capita, the effect of corruption on Income per-capita level is examined in a sample of developing countries between1996-2013. There is a potential endogeneity problem that arises from the two way relationship between corruption and income per capita levels which threatens internal validity. Accordingly, an instrumental variable (IV) in a two stage least squares (2SLS) estimation is conducted. The results indicate its presence. Furthermore, the results show that corruption is a significant determinant of income per-capita level in developing countries. Policy implications to promote governance which in turn affect sustainable development are also given.

TI Preventing violence in developing countries: a framework for action
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INJURY CONTROL AND SAFETY PROMOTION
AB Violence is an enormous global public health problem that increases the risk of injury, disease and poor mental health while also impeding economic and social development. This paper articulates a framework for violence prevention in developing countries that is grounded in the knowledge gained from research and programmatic efforts in rich and in poor countries over several decades. This framework can be used by countries and funding agencies as a guide to building strong foundations for ongoing violence prevention efforts and for identifying violence prevention strategies most likely to be effective. The world has learned a lot about preventing violence and, without a doubt, there is a great deal more to learn. As a global community, however, it is not possible to wait for perfect solutions to these problems to act. The obligation is to act now to use the valuable knowledge that has been gained about violence prevention to improve the world.

TI Does Corporate Governance Affect Sustainability Disclosure? A Mixed
   Methods Study
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This research paper aims to understand the impact of corporate governance (CG) on economic, social, and environmental sustainability disclosures. This paper adopted an explanatory sequential mixed methods approach. The data regarding corporate governance and sustainability disclosure were collected from top 100 companies listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSE) for the period ranging from 2012 to 2015. In addition to the quantitative data, we collected qualitative data through interviews with five board members of different companies. Overall, our results indicate that CG elements enhance sustainability disclosures. This study concludes that a large board size consisting of a female director and a CSR committee (CSRC) is better able to check and control management decisions regarding sustainability issues (be they economic, environment, or social) and resulted in better sustainability disclosure. This paper, through quantitative and qualitative analysis, provides a methodological and empirical contribution to the literature on corporate governance and sustainability reporting in emerging and developing countries.

AB Donors, developing country governments, and NGOs are searching for ways to use funding for HIV/AIDS programs that strengthen the functioning of weak health systems. This is motivated both by the realization that a large share of donor funding for global health is and will continue to be dedicated to HIV/AIDS, and that the aims of more and better treatment, prevention, and care can be achieved only with attention to systemic capacities. For AIDS resources to strengthen health systems, decision makers should: (a) mitigate the risks that AIDS spending may weaken the ability of health systems to respond to other health problems; (b) find ways for procurement, Supply chain, management information, and other systems that are created to support AIDS-treatment to,be broadened to serve other types of services; and (c) build upon the ways in which AIDS programs have overcome some demand-side barriers to use of services. In pursuing this agenda, donors should recognize that health system development is a function of the national and local political economy and place respect for national sovereignty as a central tenet of their policies and practices.

TI Peri-urbanization and sustainability of a groundwater resource
SO ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB In developing countries, such as Indonesia, urbanization equates to industrialization. To actuate rapid economic development, the government generally puts in place strong policies to transform rural into industrialized peri-urban/urban areas. This triggers a number of environmental problems, one of which is the degradation of groundwater resources. This study aimed to investigate whether rural to urban transformation caused such environmental degradation. We selected the Majalaya District, a typical peri-urban area of Bandung Metropolitan, where rapid industrialization, mainly related to the textile industry, is taking place. This research adopted a water balance analysis applied to a shallow groundwater resource, contrasting supply with demand after 9 years of development (2005-2014). Data concerning water supply and demand were collected from relevant stakeholders, except for water consumption by vegetation and agricultural land use. For the latter, GIS andQuickBirdimage analysis were conducted. The results indicate that the industrial development in Majalaya has caused a groundwater crisis. A nine-year period of fast-growing number of industries has caused water deficit, which was also intensified by the rate of land conversion.

TI The Rapid Urban Growth Triad: A New Conceptual Framework for Examining
   the Urban Transition in Developing Countries
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Although the urban transition is a universal event that unfolds in all countries, the determinants, patterns, and outcomes do not necessarily follow a uniform process. With the urban transition being basically completed in developed countries around the turn of the 21st century, the growth of cities today is almost entirely confined to developing countries. Still, much of our conceptual understanding of this process is derived from earlier accounts, with definitions rooted in a historical context. This has resulted in common misconceptions such as a tendency to view the growth of cities primarily as an outcome of rural to urban migration, neglecting the growing contributions of urban natural population increase and reclassification of rural areas. A tendency to treat the components of urban growth in isolation has created a rift within the urban studies discourse, preventing any real theorization of their combined impacts and the interplay among them. Applying a systems thinking approach, this paper introduces a multidisciplinary framework for conceptualizing rapid urban growth in developing countries. The framework offers explanatory power to previously neglected components of urban growth and serves as a diagnostic for examining the urban transition-ultimately revealing new policy levers for managing it in a sustainable way.

The climate change effects on the national surface water resources of Macedonia were assessed by (1) examining temperature trends and other descriptors of global warming spanning over 50 years; and (2) testing three data-driven hypotheses. The 50-year historical records describe statistically significant trends: increase in national average temperatures, surface water resources depletion, and fluctuations in the magnitude of precipitation. Realizations of such grim scenarios could create substantial socio-economic and environmental challenges for the Republic of Macedonia if adequate mitigative measures are not implemented.

TI Sport mega-events, the "non-West' and the ethics of event hosting
SO SPORT IN SOCIETY
AB Events and sports events are perceived as having the potential to contribute to a number of benefits for the host country and its communities. The socio-political and economic environment of the host is an important consideration for both prospective hosts and event owners when allocating hosting rights. It is therefore, unsurprising that concerns have been raised over the relatively recent relocation of events to developing countries which, by their nature, frequently lack the economic, political and social stability of the traditional industrialized host. Developing nations are less affluent and arguably less prepared to deliver large scale sports events than developed nations. Therefore, this paper asks, are governing bodies, when equipped with this knowledge, ethically obliged to withhold hosting rights from developing countries?' The paper argues that denying sovereign States the right to make their own decisions would appear to compound the disadvantaged status of countries that mega-event hosting is perceived to address. The paper contends that event hosts - particularly those in the developing world - are potentially vulnerable to exploitation by the event owner.

TI The Dynamic Relationship between Inequality and Sustainable Economic
   Growth
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This study empirically tests the effects of income inequality on growth for 43 countries from 1991 to 2014 based on a cumulative growth model. The results show that, first, the estimation results using a reduced equation reveal a positive correlation between the income inequalities of lagging countries and the respective growth gaps with the frontier country. This confirms that the increase in income inequality negatively affects growth. Secondly, a cumulative growth model using 3SLS estimation shows that income inequality has a negative effect only on investment. However, we fail to find correlations between technological innovation and income inequality and between human capital accumulation and income inequality. Considering that investment has a positive impact on productivity, we conclude that income inequality has a negative impact on investment and that the resulting sluggish investment has a negative impact on productivity, which in turn negatively influences growth. Third, contrary to Kaldor and Barro's prediction, we find that income inequality in developing countries is negatively correlated with growth, particularly for investment. The effects of income inequality on investment are found to be similar in both developed and developing countries. We also find region-specific differences in the paths through which income inequality affects sustainable economic growth.

TI Impact of the Economy Digitalization on Welfare in the Developed and
   Developing Countries
SO EKONOMIKA REGIONA-ECONOMY OF REGION
AB Digitalization is one of the key world economic trends. Countries with the wealthiest economies have integrated the digitalization program into their economic development plans. At the same time, monitoring of the digitalization's dynamics and degree of impact on welfare is of great importance for all countries of the global community. Nowadays, there are practically no integrated studies assessing institutional, cultural, economic, educational and infrastructural consequences of the digitalization. This article assesses how the digitalization affects the mentioned drivers of social and economic development. Moreover, it examines the digitalization's impact on welfare of the developed and developing countries. The relevance of defining the effects of digitalization's rapid implementation in various countries determined the study's purpose. We based the methodology on building the balanced panel regression. The key metric for measuring the digitalization is the Digital Evolution Index of 50 countries for 2008, 2013 and 2017. The research findings have confirmed positive impact of the digitalization in the developed countries due to a high levels of digital inclusivity, public and private investment, and digital literacy and trust. At the same time, in the developing countries the digitalization's impact on welfare was not confirmed due to a low level of state involvement in digitalization development and rigid, non flexible institutional environment. The obtained empirical results can be used for forming management tools of the digitalization strategy for regions with various levels of social, economic, institutional and digital environment development.

TI Perceptions of Psychosocial Hazards, Work-related Stress and Workplace
   Priority Risks in Developing Countries
SO JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH
AB Perceptions of Psychosocial Hazards, Work-related Stress and Workplace Priority Risks in Developing Countries: Evelyn KORTUM, et al. Institute of Work, Health and Organisations, University of Nottingham, UK-Objectives: During the last few decades, major global developments in the world of work include an international trend to shift production to developing countries, with wide variations in working conditions and exposure to traditional and emerging occupational risks, such as psychosocial risks. The latter have rarely been addressed or explored in developing and economically-emerging country contexts while we find an abundant body of research from industrialized countries. The research presented, which is part of a larger study, explored the perception of multi-disciplinary experts from different regions, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), of the nature of psychosocial hazards, and work-related stress, as well as their views on workplace priorities that require urgent attention. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 29 experts from developing countries which were subjected to thematic analysis. A two-tiered Delphi survey was completed by 74 experts in the first round with 53 of these experts completing the survey in the second round. Results: Psychosocial hazards and work-related stress were mostly seen as interchangeable in terms of source and effect and all participants perceived them as concern to their workforce. Through the interviews and the Delphi surveys they allude to our contemporary understanding of psychosocial risks. Workplace risks of priority differed by region but primarily work-related stress, injury and accident prevention, and substance abuse and risk behaviors were reported to require urgent attention. Conclusions: The current lack of awareness and research in the area of psychosocial risks and work-related stress hampers action in developing countries. International experts should support the exchange of information and the development of interventions in workplaces in developing countries with a view to integrating these emerging risks into comprehensive occupational health and safety policy frameworks to make such approaches more effective.

TI Assessing the adoption of sustainability practices in tourism industry
   Insights from a developing country
SO BOTTOM LINE
AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to assess the key determinants of sustainability practices and policy adoption in small- and medium-sized tourism accommodation firms and its possible impact on the firm's competitive advantages. Design/methodology/approach A combined model has been developed and tested with a set of relevant hypotheses based on primary data collected from tourism firm's owners and personnel. Structural equation modeling has been used to test and validate the hypotheses. Findings The key results indicate that collaboration and innovation of tourism firms, employee culture, technological infrastructure, tourism intermediary's sustainability practices and top management support have a significant impact on sustainability practices adoption, whereas government sustainable tourism policy and local's attitude toward sustainability have an insignificant impact.
   Originality/value The novelty of this empirical study is that sustainability practices and policies adoption is entirely a new phenomenon. However, the mediating impact of the construct on the competitive advantage of small and medium tourism accommodation firms enhances the effectiveness of emerging tourism economy.

TI THE INFLUENCE OF RESILIENCE AND SUSTAINABILITY PERCEPTION ON AIRPORT
   BRAND PROMOTION AND DESIRE TO REUSE OF AIRPORT SERVICES: THE CASE OF
   IRAN AIRPORTS
SO TRANSPORT
AB Sustainability and resilience are important in social, economic and environmental aspects. However, inspections show that in developing countries like Iran, sustainability and resilience strategies lose their significance when economic problems and high workload come to matter. This research tries to determine what factors encourage managers to consider airport sustainability in long-term and different situations. Such investigations are essential for a developing country like Iran, which has 54 airports under a central management system, which can help deploying selected strategies. Results of this study show that if passengers perceive the sustainability activities and ethical cores of an airport, they consider it more prestigious and become willing to reuse airport services for their future travels. They also turn out as evangelists and changes of the way people travel becomes visible on a wider scale. This can help managers to understand recent travel behaviour of airport passengers and enhance the airports' performance considering different aspects equally, which are profitable for airport system, public and environment as a whole.

TI Assessment of economic viability of solid waste service provision in
   small settlements in developing countries: Case study Rosetta, Egypt
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Problems associated with solid waste management (SWM) service provision in developing countries are reaching all ever increasing magnitude, leading to considerable adverse impacts oil the environment and quality of life of the inhabitants. Such problems are usually associated with limited managerial, technical and financial capabilities of municipal authorities. Municipal authorities in Egypt that arc responsible for SWM services have always been accused of providing a less than satisfactory service, leading to huge quantities of solid waste being uncollected. This study assesses the potential for the provision of an effective and sustainable service, by estimating willingness of the residents to pay for such a service and the cost involved in its provision. The study covered the Rosetta urban centre and its adjacent areas, which are located in the northwestern part of the Nile Delta. It was found that, from an economic perspective, a viable SWM service could be provided in the study area using local funds. In order to increase the likelihood of success Of Such a service, it may be provided by a local firm or a cooperative to be established for that purpose. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   West Africa: A review
SO HELIYON
AB Off-grid hybrid power systems with renewable energy as the primary resource remain the best option to electrify rural/remote areas in developing countries to help attain universal electricity access by 2030. However, deploying these systems in West Africa faces several challenges and regularly fail to transition from pilot, donor-sponsored projects to sustainable large-scale implementations. The study examined the drivers and challenges by conducting a review of previous studies done in the region and a short survey in Ghana. Using Political, Economic, Social, Technical, Legal and Environmental dimensions, the review and survey showed that economic challenges have the worst impacts on the sustainable development of off-grid renewable energybased power systems in WA. Further, the analysis revealed patterns and linkages among the challenges that make it detrimental to focus solely on the most pressing challenges.

AB Integrated industrial wastewater recycling has become an important issue in recent years especially in developing countries, which can be obtained by comprising three aspects of collection system, treatment processes, and reuse target, jointly called "functional group". The main aim of this study is proposing a framework for creating industrial wastewater recycling functional groups as the alternatives for future sustainability assessment, especially for developing countries. For this purpose, SWOT method (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats), PESTEL method (political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal factors), and decision tree tool are combined with expert ideas and their scoring, and then the methodology is applied to a real case in Iran (Toos Industrial Park, Khorasan Razavi Province). The proposed methodology tries to tackle challenges such as lack of exact data and insufficient experience, which are required to create possible options by other complex tools, such as multi-criteria decision-making processes or optimization procedures.

TI FISHERIES CERTIFICATION IN LATIN AMERICA: RECENT ISSUES AND PERSPECTIVES
SO INTERCIENCIA
AB This paper describes the Marine Stewardship Council fisheries certification experiences in Latin America. The Council certification program is a market-based incentive that recognizes and rewards sustainable fishing. It is currently the most widespread eco-labeling program worldwide, with 69 certified fisheries, including two in Latin America. This region represents an opportunity for the program in its attempt to certify more fisheries in developing countries. Latin American fisheries present specific features for participation in the program, for which post-certification benefits are different. It is found that, at least for Mexican fisheries, this certification does not function as a market incentive. In most cases, costs associated with the certification process are not fully assumed by the fishing companies. However indirect non-economic benefits are an important incentive. It is proposed that market/political/social reality and lack of sufficient scientific knowledge will prove the key considerations for a more intense participation of Latin American fisheries in the certification initiative.

TI The effect of sustainability on foreign direct investment inflows:
   evidence from developing countries
SO SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL
AB Purpose
   This paper aims to analyse, the issue concerning the quality of inward foreign direct investments (FDI) by empirically investigating the role of four sustainability determinants of FDI, namely, economic, environmental, social and governance using data from 22 developing countries of the Asian region over a period from 2000-2016.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The methodology adopted to achieve this purpose is dynamic panel estimation (two-step difference generalised method of moments) by developing three econometric models. The data is sourced from the World Development, Worldwide Governance Indicators, International Telecommunication Union and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
   Findings
   The econometric results indicate that, in general, control of corruption, political stability and electricity consumption influence sustainable FDI favourably; and CO2 emissions lower the extent of sustainable FDI. The result underlines deficiencies in the information technology aspect, which has a non-significant yet positive relationship with sustainable FDI. A pertinent finding of this study is that the past value of FDI inflows increases the current year's FDI inflows in developing countries.
   Practical implications
   The findings related to gender and information technology aspects found in this paper will be of interest to both researchers and policymakers for substantially reorienting the sustainability attributes to foreign investment.
   Originality/value
   The authors' main contributions are to encapsulate the conceptual framework into an empirical model by combining all the four dimensions, namely, environmental, economic, social and governance for developing countries.

In recent years, with the rapid development of economy in Sichuan province of China, electric power demand has entered a highspeed development period. For power grid companies, studying on the development trend of electricity is the key to expand electricity market and promote sustainable development for almost all industries. From the perspective of society, electric power construction is necessary for maintaining rapid economic growth. Based on Granger causality and co-integration relationship model, long-term equilibrium relationship between electricity consumption and GDP in Sichuan is studied. Analysis results show that, electric power has an obvious effect on the development of economic, so Sichuan should maintain preferential development of electric industry to serve as the firm foundation for the growth of economy. Furthermore, the analysis results can also be a reference for developing countries in Latin America.

TI Gender, Empowerment and Food Security Status of Households in Nigeria
SO AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB Gender inequality in access to productive and economic resources has been a topical issue in sub-Saharan Africa. The restrictive access to resources, assets and decision making by women has been linked to food insecurity. Using a large cross-sectional dataset from the 2018/2019 Living Standard Measurement Survey, this paper examines the interrelationship among gender, empowerment and households' food security status in Nigeria. The analytical techniques adopted include the empowerment index, dietary diversity score and the Tobit and the ordered probit regression models. The findings suggest that the level of empowerment is generally low in Nigeria (21.63%) but much worse among the female gender (11.78%). The results also show that female gender and rural and North West residents were mostly in the food insecure and disempowered group. The study concludes that empowerment and food policy measures that would enhance access and control of productive and economic resources by the female gender and rural and North West residents should be formulated to ensure the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of ending hunger and promoting gender equality.

   ratio and per capita income for different metals The cases of Brazil,
   China and India
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB Purpose - The main purpose of the paper is to propose an empirical analysis of the relationship between total consumption of different key metals (aluminium, copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc) and per capita income of some important developing countries (Brazil, China and India) today present in the international scenario with very different perspectives from in the past.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research is carried out investigating a double aim. Mainly, whether the environmental Kuznets' Curve (EKC) model related to material consumption (and hence "renamed" as material Kuznets' Curve) could be used - in empirical terms - as a possible explanatory pattern of past and current trends for these three important countries. Second, whether the observable trends in industrialised countries is similar to those already implemented in the developing ones. After a brief, but ineluctable, premise considering the theoretical basic assumptions to define the issue and regarding general statements, the specific cases for Brazil, China and India are proposed.
   Findings - Results do not closely fit the theoretical expectations but, as has already been seen for industrialised countries in previous research work, there is a prevailing trend in the lowering of material intensities with rising per-capita income levels.
   Originality/value - Without pretending to be exhaustive, this paper can be useful in improving the understanding of such developing economies, considering features not yet included in the international literature.

TI Securing a Sustainable Future Through a New Global Contract Between Rich
   and Poor
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Global sustainable development depends on the capacity of natural, social and economic systems to adapt to external stimuli. However, building this adaptive capacity in the developing world context of sub-Saharan Africa will require substantial investment in these systems, which most countries in this region simply cannot afford. Given that their social, economic and environmental security depends on developments in developing countries, we argue that developed countries should assume a leading role in making such investments in developing countries, in order to secure their own long-term well-being. This will require cooperative governance between developed and developing countries, and targeted investment in a number of key areas. This calls for a new global contract between rich and poor nations in order to achieve global stability and sustainability. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

Study shows that: carrying capacity of integrated resource of Henan province is overload, overloading population between 10.8 similar to 28.9 million, showing a "low - high - low" fluctuations; before 1996, land resources is the main capacity resources of Henan province, while economic resources become the main capacity resources from then on, mainly due to the decrease of indices of the carrying capacity of land resources. The key factors to restrict sustainable development in Henan province is a weak economic foundation and a large population, so Henan province should speed up economic development, enhance the carrying capacity of economic resources; control the rapid population growth, improve population quality, make great efforts to achieve sustainable development of resources, environmental, economic and population in Henan province

TI Energy consumption and economic growth: Evidence from the economic
   community of West African States (ECOWAS)
SO ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB Access to modern energy is believed to be a prerequisite for sustainable development, poverty alleviation and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.
   However, theoretical models and empirical results offer conflicting evidence on the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth that we remain largely unsure of the cause-and-effect nature of this relationship, if indeed a relationship exists at all.
   This paper tests, in a panel context, the long-run relationship between energy access, and economic growth for fifteen African countries from 1980 to 2008 by using recently developed panel cointegration techniques. We adopt a three-stage approach, consisting of panel unit root, panel cointegration and Granger causality tests to study the dynamic causal relationships between energy consumption, energy prices and growth as well as relationship between electricity consumption, prices and growth.
   Results show that GDP and energy consumption as well as GDP and electricity move together in the long-run. By estimating these long-run relationships and testing for causality using panel-based error correction models, we found unidirectional long-run and short-run causality. The causality is running from GDP to energy consumption in the short-run, and from energy consumption to GDP in the long-run. There is also evidence of unidirectional causality running from electricity consumption to GDP in the long-run.
   This study thus provides empirical evidence of long-run and causal relationships between energy consumption and economic growth for our sample of fifteen countries: suggesting that lack or limited access to modern energy services could hamper economic growth and compromise the development prospects of these countries.

TI Urban Environmental Health Hazards and Health Equity
SO JOURNAL OF URBAN HEALTH-BULLETIN OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE
AB This paper outlines briefly how the living environment can affect health. It explains the links between social and environmental determinants of health in urban settings. Interventions to improve health equity through the environment include actions and policies that deal with proximal risk factors in deprived urban areas, such as safe drinking water supply, reduced air pollution from household cooking and heating as well as from vehicles and industry, reduced traffic injury hazards and noise, improved working environment, and reduced heat stress because of global climate change. The urban environment involves health hazards with an inequitable distribution of exposures and vulnerabilities, but it also involves opportunities for implementing interventions for health equity. The high population density in many poor urban areas means that interventions at a small scale level can assist many people, and existing infrastructure can sometimes be upgraded to meet health demands. Interventions at higher policy levels that will create more sustainable and equitable living conditions and environments include improved city planning and policies that take health aspects into account in every sector. Health equity also implies policies and actions that improve the global living environment, for instance, limiting greenhouse gas emissions. In a global equity perspective, improving the living environment and health of the poor in developing country cities requires actions to be taken in the most affluent urban areas of the world. This includes making financial and technical resources available from high-income countries to be applied in low-income countries for urgent interventions for health equity. This is an abbreviated version of a paper on "Improving the living environment" prepared for the World Health Organization Commission on Social Determinants of Health, Knowledge Network on Urban Settings.

TI Competitiveness Model-A Double Diamond
SO JOURNAL OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY
AB Since Schumpeter, it has been assumed that innovation typically plays a key role in competitiveness at firm, industry and national levels. This assumption has been applied to firms both in developed and developing countries. However, the innovative capacity and business environments of firms in developing countries are different from these of firms in developed countries. It stands to reason that innovation and competitiveness models based on developed countries may not well be applicable to developing countries. Drawing on theoretical bases of competitiveness, technology, and innovation, the current research adds to the literature in three respects. First, it introduces a more systematic innovation-led competitiveness model in which higher productivity is achieved through higher efficiency in the global knowledge economy; second, it presents an empirical analysis of driving forces of innovation and competitiveness; third, it identifies the impacts of intellectual property rights protection. The innovation-led competitive advantage model extends Porter's Competitiveness Diamond, in which a firm's capacity in identifying, negotiating, networking with and improving its existing technological capacity is at the core of competitiveness.

AB In developing countries industry accounts for more than a third of total final energy consumption, and seventy to eighty percent of this sector's energy demand is for heat production (process heat for low or high temperature applications). Given the topical concerns of global warming, environmental pollution, energy security and international industrial competitiveness, there is an increasing need for industry to make use of modem (i.e. clean and efficient) sources of energy. Solar and biomass-based technologies have very considerable technical potential to meet in a sustainable way the growing energy needs of many industrial enterprises, especially for small and medium scale enterprises in developing countries. Renewable energy technologies have recently also proved economically competitive for meeting growing energy needs of SMEs. This is, for example, highlighted by enhanced use of solar (thermal) technologies for low heat / drying applications. However, currently only a tiny fraction of solar energy is being used for industrial processes. Biomass-based fuels ("biofuels") have recently attracted a lot of attention for their potential to displace conventional transport fuels. However, also in the industrial sector, modem biomass technologies such as biomass gasification can contribute to achieving of the above-mentioned concerns. This paper presents an overview of the potential of renewable energy in industrial applications, especially for SMEs in developing countries, and the key role solar and modem biomass technologies can play in this context.

TI Migration of health-care workers from developing countries: strategic
   approaches to its management
SO BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
AB Of the 175 million people (2.9% of the world's population) living outside their country of birth in 2000, 65 million were economically active. The rise in the number of people migrating is significant for many developing countries because they are losing their better-educated nationals to richer countries. Medical practitioners and nurses represent a small proportion of the highly skilled workers who migrate, but the loss for developing countries of human resources in the health sector may mean that the capacity of the health system to deliver health care equitably is significantly compromised. It is unlikely that migration will stop given the advances in global communications and the development of global labour markets in some fields, which now include nursing. The aim of this paper is to examine some key issues related to the international migration of health workers and to discuss strategic approaches to managing migration.

TI Corporate Social Responsibility of Oil Companies in Developing
   Countries: From Altruism to Business Strategy
SO CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The growing importance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in today's competitive business climate is well known. CSR is particularly important for firms in sectors characterised by their close ties with their social and environmental context, especially multinational enterprises (MNEs) operating in resource-rich developing countries and, more specifically, in the oil sector. Numerous question marks surround the extent to which oil MNEs really contribute, through CSR activities, to sustainable development in these countries. Based on a case study, this paper examines the adoption of an environmental management system (EMS) in Luanda Oil Refinery in Angola. The results illustrate the potential of CSR, when integrated into MNE business strategy, to improve the social and environmental situation of such countries, due not only to its impact on the company's immediate surroundings but on the wider legislative, administrative and entrepreneurial context also.

AB Air pollution has become ail increasingly important environmental issue in the entire world and in particular developing Countries. High levels of suspended particulates have become a common parameter of many regions. Emissions of gases have been rising steadily as industrialization Occurs. Projections indicate that potentially large increases in emissions may Occur during the next 20-50 years if current development patterns persist. Local concentrations of air pollutants depend upon the strength of their Sources and the efficiency of their dispersion. It was also well understood that air pollution is responsible for many aspects of human health, inefficiency and loss of environmental productivity. It was also realized that natural air pollution may be synergistic with some specific anthropogenic air components leading to prospects of higher damage to health, materials, productivity and economy. Nowadays, air quality is taken as a major aspect of the quality of life leading to sustainable development in many areas of the world. Risk assessment of air pollutants is based on a single question; is the ambient concentration above a level considered to pose a risk to the population?

AB Change has become the cosmic leitmotif in the modern business environment. This panoply of change is expressed in the frequent mergers, acquisitions, new technologies, restructuring, downsizing and a mercurial regulatory environment which all forge an unnerving climate of uncertainty. Organisations, particularly, work organisations are pressured to respond willy-nilly as change superciliously sweeps across the workplace. Many organisations are vulnerable to the situation because of the instability, conflict and frequency of change programmes that arise. Industrial organisations in developing countries are not immune from the existing pressure cooker that the business environment has become. It is either they conform or they continue to play a marginal role in global commerce. In this paper, effort has been expended to examine the concepts of organisational change and change management. The paper also identified sources of resistance to change and strategies for managing resistance to change with focus on the lessons these portend for industrial organisations in developing countries. For those organisations who manage change skilfully, it could become the force to perpetuate success and accomplishment for them, their workers and the local economy.

AB The paper presents a number of ideas on how climate change policy implementation in developing countries can be supported by alternative international cooperation mechanisms that are based on stakeholder interests and policy priorities including broader economic and social development issues. It includes a brief review of current development policies, technological research and promotion efforts, and climate change that demonstrates that mutual policy initiatives undertaken by governments and the private sector actually have major positive impacts on climate change without being initiated by this global policy concern. Furthermore a number of examples are given on how future development objectives in Brazil, China, and India jointly can support economic and social goals and global climate change concerns if these goals are taken into consideration and supported by international cooperative mechanisms. The paper proposes international cooperative mechanisms that can support the implementation of integrated development and climate change policies. The mechanisms include an international sustainable development (SD) and Climate Finance Mechanism (SDCFM), technology development and transition programmes, technology standards, and other measures.

TI Promoting sustainability of use of biomass as energy resource:
   Pakistan's perspective
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Biomass is primary source of energy for household in rural communities. Developing countries are focusing on increasing utilization of indigenous energy resources for energy security and to achieve sustainable development goal. Combustion of solid biomass is the primary approach for utilizing biomass to generate electricity and heat. Sixty-eight percent of population of Pakistan is living in rural areas while 30% population is still without electricity. The traditional household appliances used for cooking and heating are less efficient, more hazardous to users, and more damaging to the environment. Low carbon energy system prerequisites access to modern energy services. This paper presents an assessment of biomass resources potential in Pakistan as renewable energy resources and reviews potentials to adopt efficient use of biomass for cooking, heating, and small decentralized electricity generation. Objective of this study is to increase the sustainability of the use of biomass as source of energy in developing countries like Pakistan by an integrating energy-efficient and modern appliances and technologies that fit into a sustainable development path. Promotion of cleaner technologies and efficient use of biomass energy constitute appropriate strategies to mitigate global climate, health risks, and help in attending the targets set by sustainable development goal (SDG) to confirm worldwide access to reliable, affordable, and modern energy services by 2030.

AB Increasing population, urbanisation and disposable incomes in developing countries are fuelling a strong growth in demand for animal food products, which in turn will have a strong impact on the location and organisation of global livestock production. Changes in the latter will in turn strongly impinge on animal and human health, the livelihoods of the poor and the environment. The consequences of these trends, termed the 'livestock revolution', are expected to dramatically change the face of animal agriculture in coming decades, including a major increase in the developing countries' share in world livestock production and consumption; a gradual substitution of cereals and other basic foods with meat and milk in the developing countries' diets; a change from multiple production objectives to more specialised intensive meat, milk and egg production within an integrated global food and feed market; a shift to more industrial production and processing; rising use of cereal-based animal feeds; and greater stress on fragile extensive pastoral areas and more pressure on land in areas with very high population densities and close to urban centres. Henning Steinfeld, an agricultural economist from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, reviews here trends associated with the 'Livestock Revolution' and predicted implications for animal health. The presentation was given in a plenary session at the 19th International Conference of the World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology (WAAVP) held in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA during 10-14 August 2003.

AB There is a significant need for capacity building in the interdisciplinary area of land management, especially in developing countries and countries in transition, to deal with the complex issues of building efficient land information systems and sustainable institutional infrastructures.
   Capacity building in land management is not only a question of establishing a sufficient technological level or sufficient economic resources. It is mainly a question of understanding the interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral nature of land administration systems, and understanding the need for human resource development in this area. Furthermore, capacity building should ensure that the focus is on building sound institutions and good governance rather than just high-level IT-inftastructures.
   This overall approach to capacity building in land management is used for implementing a new land policy reform in Malawi. ne paper presents the new decentralized land policy developed as a response to the current land related problems in Malawi. The deficit in terms of qualified personnel is remarkable and calls for immediate action. An integrated curriculum is developed to provide the necessary skilled technicians and professionals for implementing the new land policy. The curriculum combines the diploma and the bachelor level and it combines the key areas of land surveying, land management and physical planning.

AB Soil conservation entails efficient land management for higher productivity leading to sustainable land use. Various factors influence efficient land management. Under subsistence agriculture, as practised in many developing countries, factors like land tenure, size of farm holdings, the use of farm inputs, availability of agricultural credit, availability and effectiveness of agricultural extension services, farmers' awareness of available technologies, farmers' abilities to afford and apply the technologies and the overall agricultural infrastructure contribute significantly to the achievement of sustainable land use.
   Some studies have been undertaken in Swaziland, a small country in Southern Africa, to assess the impact of socio-economic factors on soil conservation and land degradation in particular. Early attempts at soil conservation were focused on physical structures on government aided projects but the use of grass strips has survived most of the experiments. There is need however to review some of the existing legislation on land use so as to ease the pressure on Swazi Nation Land, and provide some incentives for sustained land use. A re-examination of existing land tenure arrangements is necessary if cost-effective measures of soil conservation are to be implemented.

Systematization literary sources and approaches for solving the problem of the difference of institutions quality and values of environment performance index. Methodological tools of the research methods were 14 years of research contain 48 developed countries and 139 developing countries. We used dynamic panel data models and especially the system Generalized Method of Moment (GMM) estimator of Arellano and Bover (1995). The research empirically confirms and theoretically proves that the level of growth proxied by the GDPG exerts a positive effect on the level of the environmental performance and institutional quality, (represented by control of corruption, regulatory quality, government effectiveness and rule of law and act), are significantly on the environment performance for the whole sample. Then, we prove that a good institutions quality enhance a significantly environment performance for developed countries. The results of the research can be useful for developing countries indicate that all variables reflected institution qualities decreased the environmental performance except for the government effectiveness which exerts a positive and significant effect.

TI Adaptation responses to climate change differ between global megacities
SO NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
AB Urban areas are increasingly at risk from climate change, with negative impacts predicted for human health, the economy and ecosystems(1,2). These risks require responses from cities to improve their resilience. Policymakers need to understand current adaptation spend to plan comprehensively and effectively. Through the measurement of spend in the newly defined 'adaptation economy', we analyse current climate change adaptation efforts in ten megacities. In all cases, the adaptation economy remains a small part of the overall economy, representing a maximum of 0.33% of a city's gross domestic product (here referred to as GDPc). Differences in total spend are significant between cities in developed, emerging and developing countries, ranging from 15 pound million to 1,600 pound million. Comparing key subsectors, we demonstrate the differences in adaptation profiles. Developing cities have higher proportional spend on health and agriculture, whereas developed cities have higher spend on energy and water. Spend per capita and percentage of GDPc comparisons more clearly show disparities between cities. Developing country cities spend half the proportion of GDPc and significantly less per capita, suggesting that adaptation spend is driven by wealth rather than the number of vulnerable people. This indicates that current adaptation activities are insufficient in major population centres in developing and emerging economies.

TI The changing nature of extreme weather and climate events: risks to
   sustainable development
SO GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
AB This paper discusses climate-development linkages, with a focus on developing countries but also drawing lessons from the experiences of developed countries. Increases in weather and climate extremes leading to natural disasters have been observed in recent decades. Such events are impeding economic and social development in developing countries, as are socio-economic changes that increase their exposure and as well as the likelihood of mal-adaptation. For the Pacific Islands region, the most recent decade has been somewhat anomalous, with the marked absence of El Nino conditions resulting in fewer people being affected by natural disasters. Further increases in these extreme events are anticipated as a result of global warming, imposing still further barriers to sustainable development. However, integrating appropriate adaptation measures, including disaster risk-reduction measures, into development policies and plans provides developing countries with the opportunity to reduce socio-economic risks associated with extreme weather and climate events. This will help ensure the longer-term viability of development, despite a changing climate. Emphasis should be on no-regrets interventions.

TI Dynamic Response and Failure Mechanism of Concrete Arch Dams under
   Extreme Loadings: A Solid Foundation for Real-World Actions to Reduce
   Dam Collapse Losses during Wartime or Terrorist Attacks
SO WATER
AB With massive energy demands, the majority of developing countries are at a critical juncture in their industrial development. Their energy structure, on the other hand, is relatively specific and heavily reliant on fossil fuels, resulting in significant environmental pollution. As a result, the development of clean energy is on the horizon, which is related not only to whether developing countries can build a resource-saving and environmentally friendly society but also to whether they can achieve socially sustainable development. As a significant clean energy source, not only does hydropower play an important role in the development of an energy-efficient and environmentally friendly green economy, but it also has numerous benefits such as shipping, irrigation, flood control, and water supply. So, hydropower development is critical for developing countries to adjust their energy structures, achieve regional development balance, and ensure river defense safety. However, precision guidance technology is maturing around the world. If one side's water-retaining dam is accurately blasted in the event of a full-scale war or local conflict, it may cause significant economic and human losses. Dam safety and protection from strong explosions deserve special attention given the obvious seriousness of the consequences. It is critical to improve the anti-explosion safety of major hydraulic structures by revealing the dynamic response behavior, damage mechanism, and dam characteristics under explosion impact loads, as well as evaluating the dam's condition after extreme loads. In the critical work of disaster prevention and mitigation, this is crucial to our social and economic development. This study is not only a key technical problem and an important strategic task in hydraulic structure construction, but it may also serve as a guideline for governments to take effective measures to reduce the loss of dam break under special circumstances.

TI Energy-water-food nexus under financial constraint environment: good,

   countries
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Environmental sustainability agenda are generally compromised by energy, water, and food production resources, while in the recent waves of global financial crisis, it mediates to increase the intensity of air pollutants, which largely affected the less developing countries due to their ease of environmental regulation policies and lack of optimal utilization of economic resources. Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries are no exception that majorly hit by the recent global financial crisis, which affected the country's natural environment through the channel of unsustainable energy-water-food production. The study employed panel random effect model that addresses the country-specific time-invariant shocks to examine the non-linear relationship between water-energy-food resources and air pollutants in a panel of 19 selected SSA countries, for a period of 2000-2014. The results confirmed the carbon-fossil-methane environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) that turned into inverted U-shaped relationships in a panel of selected SSA countries. Food resources largely affected greenhouse gas (GHG), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions while water resource decreases carbon dioxide (CO2), fossil fuel, and CH4 emissions in a region. Energy efficiency improves air quality indicators while industry value added increases CO2 emissions, fossil fuel energy, and GHG emissions. Global financial crisis increases the risk of climate change across countries. The study concludes that although SSA countries strive hard to take some "good" initiatives to reduce environmental degradation in a form of improved water and energy sources, however, due to lack of optimal utilization of food resources and global financial constraints, it leads to "the bad" and "the ugly" sustainability reforms in a region.

AB One of the main issues faced by the oil and gas industry in developing countries is that of oil spill and its impacts on the social-cultural, economic and environment. The adverse effects of oil spill on the environment as well as the socio-cultural life of the inhabitants in the affected areas make it mandatory for proactive management of oil spills. Oil spill contaminated sites management in developing countries such as; (Venezuela, Libya, Iraq and Nigeria) suffers from a number of limitations: lack o f a clear statutory definition for contaminated sites, life cycle assessment-based approach, inexperience, weak policy frameworks and limited funding. From the literature on oil spill contaminated sites management, there are different approaches adopted by developed countries to improve the management process as well as the outcome of such processes. However, context specific approaches are sometimes required for successful management decisions to promote efficient policy transfer. In this study we propose an integrated life cycle assessment (LCA) that monitors and assesses the environmental impacts of oil spill and remediation processes applied on the case study environment (Nigeria) with a view to managing them sustainably. Life cycle thinking approach has been identified as a decision-making tool for remediation of contaminated sites because it presents the opportunity to take into consideration the inputs and outputs to the process of remediation, as well as the activities that take place during the remediation process. This research developed a conceptual framework for oil spill sites remediation in the Nigerian. The framework can also be applied to similar oil spill sites whose methodology is currently underdeveloped. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Global aspects of antimicrobial - resistance of enteric bacterial
SO UNIVERSA MEDICINA
AB Bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents is a global public health problem and becoming important in the treatment of enteric infections. In developing countries, resistance to the first-line drugs has been observed among the enteric pathogens due to the uncontrolled usage of antimicrobial agents. In some cases, the level of resistance has forced a change to more expensive second or third-line drugs. Resistance has emerged even to newer and more potent antimicrobial agents which caused economic burden and multiple resistance. In many developing countries, few data are available on the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance. The lack of laboratory facilities are major constrains to the development of effective surveillance. To maintain the useful life of antimicrobial drugs, especially in developing countries, there needs to be improved access to diagnostic laboratories, improved surveillance of the emergence of resistance, better regulation of the use of antimicrobial and better education of the public.

AB COVID-19 is a menace for Pakistan's fragile and overburdened health care system and infrastructure, insidiously permeating the socio-economic fabric. Globally complete to partial shutdown of educational institutions has been enforced, transitioning from face to face to online academics. Academic institutes are floundering to withstand the brunt. Therefore, the current study was conducted to attempt to review and highlight the impact and challenges posed by transition from conventional to online academics and how to approach them, in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic with the perspective of developing countries like Pakistan. For this purpose, search for relevant literature using search engines and websites including Google, Google Scholar and Web of Science as well as Medline database was conducted with keywords "Covid-19, academics, mental health, social impact and e-learning and combination of words". Thirty two English language, full text articles published in the last ten years from 2010 to 2020 were selected for the literature review. With this literature review, we conclude that this lockdown has caused significant distortion in the academic world yet unequal interruption in learning with significant disruptions in internal assessments and qualification examinations with developing countries like Pakistan, compounded by a compromised educational system. However, COVID-19 is spurring the case for conversion to online academics and developing countries like Pakistan are poised to develop reliable, cost effective and secure online academic system whether it is bane or boon.

AB This paper introduces a special edition of The Geographical Journal on the theme of 'environmental transformations in developing countries'. Geographical research into human-environment relations is well established. However. many recent studies of political ecology or constructivist approaches to environment either overlook biophysical aspects of environmental change, or uncritically accept 'orthodox' explanations of physical degradation without appreciating the social and political construction of such models. This paper, and those following, attempt iu outline ways in which environmental research may remain sensitive to political and cultural debates, vet also give insights to practical environmental management of biophysical resources 'externally real' to human experience. It is argued that understanding human impacts on environment may only be achieved through long-term environmental histories compiled using locally-based 'hybrid' social and physical research methods; plus an awareness of the social and political construction of environmental 'orthodoxies' by powerful domestic and global agendas. As such, 'transformations' may be viewed as both physical changes in factors such as land cover or health hazards: but also as the socio-economic transitions in the driving forces of environmental degradation and perceptions of risk which in turn fuel new orthodoxies in research and policy.

TI Importance of rural bioenergy for developing countries
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB Energy resources will play an important role in the world's future. Rural bioenergy is still the predominant form of energy used by people in the less developed countries, and bioenergy from biomass accounts for about 15% of the world's primary energy consumption and about 38% of the primary energy consumption in developing countries. Furthermore, bioenergy often accounts for more than 90% of the total rural energy supplies in some developing countries. Earth life in rural areas of the world has changed dramatically over time. Industrial development in developing countries, coming at a time of low cost plentiful oil supplies, has resulted in greater reliance on the source of rural bioenergy than is true in the developed countries. In developed countries, there is a growing trend towards employing modern technologies and efficient bioenergy conversion using a range of biofuels, which are becoming cost wise competitive with fossil fuels. Currently, much attention has been a major focus on renewable alternatives in the developing countries. Renewable energy can be particularly appropriate for developing countries. In rural areas, particularly in remote locations, transmission and distribution of energy generated from fossil fuels can be difficult and expensive. Producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative. Renewable energy can facilitate economic and social development in communities but only if the projects are intelligently designed and carefully planned with local input and cooperation. Particularly in poor rural areas, the costs of renewable energy projects will absorb a significant part of participants' small incomes. Bio-fuels are important because they replace petroleum fuels. Biomass and biofuels can be used as a substitute for fossil fuels to generate heat, power and/or chemicals. Generally speaking, biofuels are generally considered as offering many benefits, including sustainability, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, regional development, social structure and agriculture and security of supply.

TI Accelerating the energy transition to achieve carbon neutrality
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Shifting from fossil-fuel (FF) to renewable energy systems, a process known as energy transition (ET), is crucial for developing countries as the ET brings new opportunities to accomplish leapfrog development for achieving carbon neutrality. Parallel to climate change, developing countries face energy security and independence issues with extra pressures such as the Covid-19 pandemic and increasing inequality. Taking Mexico as a case, four ET scenarios under "gradual" or "rapid" narratives are developed with the Kaya Identity. Gradual Transition Scenarios (GTS) present a business-as-usual scenario with natural gas as the most significant fuel in the supply mix due to economic and social concerns. Rapid Transition Scenarios (RTS) propose a combination of FF and renewables or a full deployment of Renewable Energy Sources (RES). The results show that GTS reach 491 similar to 501 Mt CO2 emissions in 2050, risking a carbon lock-in, stranded assets and economic losses. RTS reach 87 similar to 103 Mt CO2 in 2050 with RES prioritization, energy efficiency improvements and coal phase-out. In particular, following GTS would mean failing to join global efforts to limit warming temperature to 1.5. C. Alternatively, following RTS brings Mexico closer to achieve carbon neutrality. Several strategies are proposed, including reducing the carbon intensity of the energy supply mix, increasing energy efficiency, prioritizing environmental protection, improving actions based on science, and promoting environmental education and awareness. This paper presents a consistent methodology to encourage ET in developing countries where the role of science is still not fully exploited under the goal of carbon neutrality.

The rise of global standards affecting food safety and environmental sustainability in agriculture sparks debates on the impact on smallholders in developing countries. This article presents a perspective on the links of international standards to knowledge and institution building for developing the capabilities of small producers. Interacting with global practices, indigenous private and public actors create local institutions to develop capabilities for product and process innovations that contribute to economic development and enhance food security. Local innovation depends on collective strategic efforts through increasing networks among small producers and other organizations, including firms, non-governmental organizations, and government, that foster knowledge circulation and bring diverse resources and support to build local capabilities.

TI The political economy of foreign direct investment-Evidence from the
   Philippines
SO POLICY AND SOCIETY
AB Much of the conventional wisdom about the political economy of foreign direct investment suggests that many developing country governments lower regulatory and/or legislative standards in order to woo potential investors. Using the case of the tobacco industry's efforts to influence excise tax policy reforms in the Philippines, we find a much more complex reality. Over a period of more than 15 years of concerted efforts and significant financial investment, a large multinational tobacco firm was consistently unable to realize its tax policy goals with serious, negative implications for the firm. In the most recent major policy confrontation over excise tax reform that led to one of the largest tax increases on tobacco products ever in a developing country, a number of major variables mitigated the powerful firm's influence. These variables included strong support for tax reform from a number of influential political actors and a well-organized civil society movement, which led to broader public support for both public health and fiscal reasons. Global governance around economic policy and the effects of domestic institutional structures also had marked effects on the outcomes. (c) 2014 Policy and Society Associates (APSS). Elsevier Ltd.

TI CONSERVING BIODIVERSITY IN DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES
SO FISHERIES
AB Countries richest in biological diversity ironically are often the poorest economically. In these countries, in which humans struggle daily to meet urgent basic needs, efforts to protect the environment will succeed only if implemented in the context of promoting economic growth. Yet economic growth itself depends on the normal functioning of ecosystems and on a sustainable supply of natural resources. This mutual dependence of development and environmental protection must provide the conceptual basis for any successful effort to protect diversity in the third world. Accordingly, the U.S. government, through the Agency for International Development (USAID), supports an extensive program to protect the world's biological resources as an integral component of foreign assistance. A primary goal of USAID's biodiversity program is to maximize the potential for both economic and environmental security in developing countries. A greater reliance on market forces, the judicious application of economic incentives, and the use of effective economic instruments within the framework of constructive regulations provide the foundation for USAID's approach to conserving biological diversity.

TI Declining Indian Agricultural Trade in an Unequal World: A Perspective

AB The Uruguay Round established rules that were expected to improve market access for agricultural products and reduced export subsidies and domestic support payments as an opportunity to level the playing field. Major global economic benefits were predicted from the establishment of WTO and Agreement on Agriculture (AoA). But what has happened since the Uruguay Round? Industrialized countries systematically use subsidies to skew the benefits of agricultural trade in their favour. The overall level of support to agriculture in these countries has fallen very little. What does free trade mean in a context where the world's largest exporter of dairy produce, the EU, is providing subsidies in excess of US $300 billion a year? India is the number one producer of milk and yet cannot compete. The European Union and the United States have invented a category of support-known as the Green Box and the Blue Box in WTO talks-deemed to be decoupled from production and therefore exempt from cuts in subsidies. The persistence of high trade barriers as well as regulatory controls related to food safety and environment make trade rules unfair. The overall feeling is that AoA is an 'unequal treaty' as high support continues in OECD countries. There is no level playing field. Agricultural surpluses in rich countries, generated through protection and subsidies and then dumped onto world markets, have hurt agricultural development in developing countries. Developing countries as a whole are projected to increase their net imports of cereals for all purposes to a total of more than 200 million tonnes of net annual imports from the developed countries by 2020. Developing countries like India will become net agricultural importers. It is argued that the Uruguay Round agreements did not go far enough in reducing trade barriers in developed countries, to have a significant impact. It did, however, establish a framework for negotiating further reductions in support. The Doha Round offers the opportunity to level a tilted playing field. Equally important is India improving its own agricultural policies. For years we have discriminated against agriculture.

TI Sustainable energy development: History of the concept and emerging
   themes
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Sustainable energy development is a complex multi-dimensional concept that can vary in meaning based on the context it is applied in and the perspective of the user. The role of energy in achieving sustainable development was recognized when the concept was first put forward in 1987. However, what that role consisted of was not made clear. Since then, the concept of sustainable energy development has developed to become a prominent policy objective on the international agenda, as evidenced by the introduction of the UN?s Sustainable Devel-opment Goal 7 on energy. This paper presents an overview of the history of the concept as well as its emerging themes. Through a citation analysis, the most cited open-access publications relevant to the concept were identified. A thematic analysis of these most cited publications led to the identification of four interrelated themes of sustainable energy development; access to affordable modern energy services, sustainable energy supply, sustainable energy consumption, and energy security. The overarching goal of sustainable energy development was defined as furthering sustainability. Equitable access to affordable and reliable modern energy services is integral to sustainable development. A transformation of the current energy system is necessary to reduce its harmful impacts, both on the supply and demand side. This transformation is not possible unless it is economically viable through, for instance, cost-competitive technologies and changes in energy pricing to reflect the external costs of energy.

SP Nestle Co, Inst Food Technol, FAO
AB Modern food biotechnology has moved a long way since ancient times of empirical food fermentations. Preservation and safeguarding of food are, however, still major objectives of fermentation. In addition, other aspects, such as wholesomeness, acceptability and overall quality, have become increasingly important and valued features to consumers even in developing countries where old traditions and cultural particularities in food fermentations are generally well maintained. Due to limitations in infrastructure and existing low technologies, rural areas in most developing countries have not been able to keep abreast of global developments toward industrialisation. At the same time, fermented foods play a major role in the diet of numerous regions in Africa and Asia. In many traditional approaches, the advantages of some form of inoculation of a new batch, e.g. by back-slopping or the repeated use of the same container (e.g. a calabash) is appreciated and generally practised. Still, the benefits of small-scale starter culture application as a means of improved hygiene, safety and quality control, in support of HACCP approaches, are not yet realised in small-scale fermentation operations. Approaches and considerations for the selection of pure cultures for small-scale, low-tech applications may differ in some respects from the large-scale industrial approaches practised since 100 years. Selection criteria should take account of the substrate, technical properties of the strain, food safety requirements and quality expectations. Lack of experience in the application of starter cultures in small-scale operations and under rural conditions presents a major obstacle but also an exciting challenge to food microbiologist and technologist. Culture preservation. maintenance and distribution demand special logistic and economic considerations. Quality, safety and acceptability of traditional fermented foods may be significantly improved through the use of starter cultures selected on the basis of multifunctional considerations, also taking into account the probiotic concept and possibilities offered for improved health benefits.

TI Financial distress and highway infrastructure delays
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Purpose - In developing countries, delays in highway infrastructure projects caused by financial distress-related factors threaten the construction industry's capacity to contribute optimally to economic development. Against this backdrop, this paper aims to determine factors contributing to financial distress and develops a conceptual framework to illustrate the relationship between financial distress and project delay.
   Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey collected data on factors that contributed to financial distress and delays in highway infrastructure delivery. In total, 78 responses were obtained, and factor analysis revealed that factors associated with payment, project financing, cash flow, economic issues, project planning and cost control influenced project delays.
   Findings - The research identifies the importance of efficient public and private policies to engender financial sustainability among construction firms in developing countries.
   Originality/value - This work presents the first research of its kind and strives to engender wider academic debate and renewed economic development in some of the world's most impoverished nations.

TI Globalising accessibility: drawing on the experiences of developed
   countries to enable the participation of disabled people in Zambia
SO DISABILITY & SOCIETY
AB This paper explores the accessibility situation in a developing country such as Zambia. The global view of accessibility for disabled people is provided to examine the accessibility situation in developed and developing countries, highlighting the role of the environment in achieving rights for disabled people. Recognition of disability rights relating to accessible built environments is a necessary element to ensure their participation. Limited disability research, lack of disability policies and systems, evaluation of disability rights and support from developed countries have been cited as contributing to the non-recognition of disability rights and low participation by disabled people in Africa. An international perspective of disability, accessibility and participation and the experiences of developed countries are examined and their potential for advancing accessible built environments for participation in developing countries considered. However, accessibility concepts, having been developed in western countries, are presented with caution acknowledging the geographical, social-cultural and economic differences that exist.

TI Eco-Oriented Economy as a Tool to Improve the Quality of Life: Prospects
   and Opportunities in the Context of Digitalization
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN DIGITAL ECONOMY: Perspectives from
   Russian Experiences
SE Research for Development
AB Purpose: The purpose of the work is to test the hypothesis and justify the prospects of using digitalization opportunities to improve the quality of life based on the construction of an eco-oriented economy, as well as the specificity of the management models of this process in developed and developing countries. Design/methodology/approach: The work uses a correlation analysis method, which identifies, firstly, the impact of an eco-oriented (green) economy on the quality of life. Secondly, the influence of various manifestations (sub-indices) of digitalization on the eco-oriented ("green") development of the economy is determined. The study is conducted separately in developed countries (using the example of OECD countries that showed the highest quality of life in 2020) and in developing countries (using the example of BRICS countries) in 2020. Findings: An eco-oriented economy in developed countries has been identified as an effective tool for improving the quality of life, while in developing countries the application of this tool is much less effective or even counterproductive (a decrease in the quality of life). In both categories of countries, significant prospects and opportunities for activating this tool in the context of digitalization were identified, but different approaches were recommended for this. Originality/value: It has been proved that in developed countries the improvement of the quality of life on the basis of an eco-oriented economy in the context of digitalization is carried out in accordance with the integration model, and in developing countries in accordance with the fragmentation model. Taking into account the features of these models identified and described in this work will improve the practice of public management of quality of life, eco-oriented economic development and digitalization, as well as ensure the achievement of the systemic effect of these processes.

AB Urban regeneration has been viewed as a path to a more sustainable city. In contrast with developed countries, where urban regeneration is seen as a renewal and adjustment to new trends, in developing countries it presents an opportunity to start from scratch. Aside from the pressing social-economic issues, several authors identify critical aspects in these informal settlements, these including: they are usually the only viable solution to transform the lives of the poorest in a meaningful and cost-effective way; and improvised solutions are within context and can use local resources and thus promote a more sustainable outcome. Thus, cities in developing countries can become a paradigm for urban development. This paper develops and discusses research on urban regeneration for developing countries based on the transformation of the informal into formal, within the framework of the sustainable city. A model to enable this transformation is presented. This model is designed at several scales, from policy to the actual physical transformation of the urban environment, creating a sequential process from concept to the implementation. The methodology combines a theoretical and empirical approach through the analysis of case studies and practical implementation. Public and private sector roles and actions are clearly defined and their physical results presented. Resulting urban options and the principles within the framework of the sustainable city as an inclusive "metabolism" based on social-economic and environment factors are discussed. The model is currently being implemented in the Oe-Cusse Region, in East-Timor, through a neighbourhood scale plan.

TI Global consumption of antimicrobials: impact of the WHO Global Action
   Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance and 2019 coronavirus pandemic
   (COVID-19)
SO JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL CHEMOTHERAPY
AB Background Little is known about the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on antimicrobial consumption worldwide. Objectives To describe the impact of the WHO Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (GAP-AMR) on antimicrobial consumption pre-pandemic and to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on antimicrobial consumption worldwide. Methods A cross-sectional time-series analysis using a dataset of monthly purchases of antimicrobials (antibiotics, antivirals and antifungals) from August 2014 to August 2020. Antimicrobial consumption per 1000 population was assessed pre-pandemic by economic development status using linear regression models. Interventional autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models tested for significant changes with pandemic declaration (March 2020) and during its first stage from April to August 2020, worldwide and by country development status. Results Prior to the pandemic, antimicrobial consumption decreased worldwide, with a greater apparent decrease in developed versus developing countries (-8.4%, P = 0.020 versus -1.2%, P = 0.660). Relative to 2019, antimicrobial consumption increased by 11.2%, P < 0.001 in March 2020. The greatest increase was for antivirals in both developed and developing countries (48.2%, P < 0.001; 110.0%, P < 0.001) followed by antibiotics (6.9%, P < 0.001; 5.9%, P = 0.003). From April to August 2020, antimicrobial consumption decreased worldwide by 18.7% (P < 0.001) compared with the previous year. Specifically, antibiotic consumption significantly decreased in both developed and developing countries (-28.0%, P < 0.001; -16.8%, P < 0.001). Conclusions The global decrease in antimicrobial consumption pre-pandemic suggests a positive impact of the WHO GAP-AMR. During the pandemic, an initial increase in antimicrobial consumption was followed by a decrease worldwide. AMR plans should specify measures to ensure full implementation of AMR efforts during health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI Reinforcing Effect of Terrorism and Corruption Nexus on Net Migration
   from Developing Countries: An Empirical Analysis
SO ZAGREB INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS & BUSINESS
AB The study intends to investigate the direct and indirect effect of terrorism and corruption on net migration for thirty-eight developing countries, along with other macroeconomic determinants like per capita GDP, globalization, inflation and institutional quality for the time period 1985-2015. Based on the Fixed and Random Effects models, findings show that terrorism and GDP per capita has negative while globalization has positively significant effect on the net migration in selected developing countries. The corruption and terrorism appeared to reinforcing each other in stimulating migration. Particularly, terrorism seeks its ways through corrupt financial activities which distorts the labor market and ultimately results in relatively large out-migration. The study suggests implementation of stiff anti-terrorism policies to improve domestic environment along with promoting globalization in such a way which can offer positive effect of out-migration on the domestic economy in the long run. And that is expected to take place at the onset of return migration of labor with enhanced skills and capabilities.

TI Facilitating organizational action regarding a co-operative's governance
   system in a developing country using the viable systems model
SO SYSTEMS RESEARCH AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
AB Studies in developing countries have demonstrated that co-operatives have the potential to become an important economic factor. However, these studies have revealed deficient management practices that could hinder co-operative's possibilities of playing this role in the economy. There are recurrent calls to study this issue and generate knowledge that could improve prospects for co-operatives. This paper advances current research by applying an already tested methodology inspired on the viable systems model to provide a better understanding on co-operatives' governance systems, in the context of developing countries. The results show positive evidence for how a participatory and facilitated systemic intervention could support the implementation of actions aiming to improve a co-operative governance system. The approach and methodology used in the project represent a promising toolkit to work on governance systems within co-operatives and provide new academic perspectives to address governance issues within these organizations.

   Cross-National Analysis of Nitrous Oxide Emissions in Developing
   Countries, 1990-2014
SO SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES
AB Scholars have long inquired the anthropogenic causes of greenhouse gas emissions. The majority of empirical work focuses on carbon dioxide and methane emissions, but limited attention is paid to nitrous oxide emissions. This is a crucial omission as nitrous oxide emissions are an extremely potent greenhouse gas and trigger ozone-depleting reactions upon reaching the atmosphere. Using a fixed effects panel regression of 106 developing countries, I estimate the effect of foreign direct investment dependence on nitrous oxide emissions. I find foreign capital dependency is positively associated with nitrous oxide emissions, supporting a refined ecostructural theory of foreign direct investment dependence. This analysis highlights the need for social scientists to consider the environmental impacts of the transnational organization of production beyond carbon dioxide emissions and methane emissions.

TI Chronological change of resource metabolism and decarbonization patterns
   in Pakistan: Perspectives from a typical developing country
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY
AB With economic growth in many developing countries, not all are making similar progress with regard to material and environmental efficiencies. This study examines material use and CO(2)emission patterns and intensities from 1971 to 2015 in a typical developing country, Pakistan, and investigates national-level and multi-country-level efficiency improvements using data envelopment analysis. The results are used to derive key policy insights for a sustainable economic transition with higher resource and carbon efficiencies. Results show that material intensity has reduced by 39.1% while CO(2)intensity has risen by 21.5% in the country. Pakistan, when compared with its top 10 export countries, was relatively more material and CO(2)intensive. National-level efficiency was found to be low in most of the periods due to material/energy intensive agriculture and industries, low value-added exports, etc. Insights from the national-level efficiency analysis indicate that surging CO(2)intensities have started to decline since 2010 and the economy has greatly stabilized. Multi-country analysis revealed that the efficiency gap between Pakistan and its developed export countries (such as the United Kingdom and France) has widened during the study period. Insights from the multi-country analysis suggest that the economic growth and industrialization improves material and environmental efficiencies to some extent, yet these improvements are not equally distributed among all countries. As a way forward, integrated policies on sustainable resource consumption, carbon mitigation, and economic growth are necessary for accruing higher benefits from rising global trade and resource connectedness.

TI Methodology for the development of a new Sustainable Infrastructure
   Rating System for Developing Countries (SIRSDEC)
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB The improvement of infrastructures in developing countries has become a priority for the most advanced economies, which have founded a broad range of international development organizations to undertake infrastructure projects worldwide. Infrastructure is the key driver that can accelerate the balance among the economic, social and environmental aspects forming the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) in these countries. Given the lack of appropriate tools to ensure the achievement of this goal, this paper describes the methodology conceived for the development of a Sustainable Infrastructure Rating System (SIRSDEC) aimed at promoting the design, construction and operation of sustainable infrastructure projects in these geographical areas. SIRSDEC is structured into a hierarchical decision-making tree consisting of three levels of elements (requirements, criteria and indicators) selected to assess infrastructure systems according to sustainability principles. The methodology on which SIRSDEC is based combines the action of two multi-criteria decision-making methods (MCDM) such as the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Integrated Value Model for Sustainable Assessment (MIVES). AHP is proposed to weight the elements forming the decision -making tree after processing the opinions provided by a group of international experts regarding the importance of requirements, criteria and indicators, whilst MIVES is suggested to value infrastructure projects according to their contribution to the TBL. The article emphasizes the added value provided by the combination of AHP and MIVES in the design of an ad-hoc rating system aimed at fostering the implementation of sustainable infrastructure projects in developing countries.

TI International Cooperation for Metal Recycling From Waste Electrical and
   Electronic Equipment An Assessment of the "Best-of-Two-Worlds" Approach
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY
AB This article addresses a market-based management concept for waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) known as the "best-of-two-worlds" approach. The concept is based on the idea that recyclers in developing countries and emerging economies can cooperate with technologically advanced refineries in industrialized countries to facilitate efficient recovery of valuable metals, such as gold and palladium, from e-waste. The article provides an overview of technical and environmental concerns underlying the concept and sheds light on the political framework, the waste-related trade issues, and the resource economics that need to be considered for further decision making. Building on this synthesis, I conduct a qualitative assessment of sustainability impacts of the proposed concept by analyzing two scenarios and their associated risks.
   The analysis suggests that, under certain preconditions, the best-of-two-worlds concept could yield significant improvements in terms of management of hazardous substances, resource efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions, income generation, and investments into social and environmental standards. Generally, two potential implementation scenarios were identified: Whereas under Scenario 1 only WEEE generated within developing countries and emerging economies is managed through the best-of-two-worlds approach, Scenario 2 additionally incorporates WEEE imported from industrialized countries. Although both scenarios can yield a variety of benefits, Scenario 2 might cause a net flow of hazardous substances from industrialized countries into developing countries and emerging economies, thus leading to less beneficial sustainability impacts.

TI The role of offshore financial centres in elite money laundering
   practices: evidence from Nigeria
SO JOURNAL OF MONEY LAUNDERING CONTROL
AB Purpose - In addition to contributing to the supply side of corruption in Africa, the West has historically played a major role in laundering the proceeds. The Offshore Financial Centres (OFCs) are characterised as jurisdictions that attract a high level of non- resident financial activity. The purpose of this paper is to examine how senior political figures, their relatives and close associates have used OFCs in moving funds that may be a product of foreign corruption into Western countries.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper locates the role of OFCs within the political economy theory of globalisation to argue that mobility of capital has been promoted by a number of advanced countries and micro- states that use their sovereignty and law- making powers to create an environment conducive to anti- social practices by the major corporations and the political elite. The paper uses publicly available evidence to illuminate the role played by offshore financial centres in facilitating elite money laundering practices.
   Findings - The evidence shows that, in pursuit of organisational and personal interest, the offshore financial centres create enabling structures that support illicit activities of the political and economic elite from developing countries. The paper concludes that the establishment of money laundering laws and the creation of anti- money laundering agencies had not brought about ethical conduct within the global banking systems.
   Practical implications - It is impossible to quantify the volume of money laundered, but it has been estimated that money laundering may account for as much as 5 per cent of the world economy. Social implications - Substantial amounts of illicit money undoubtedly flow out of developing countries. Combating money laundering is a key goal in all democracies, due to its corrosive efforts on the rule of law, economic development, democratic principles, and its serious consequences for people everywhere.
   Originality/value - The paper examines predatory practices of the international financial industry in money laundering activities.

TI Integration of International Service Learning in Developing Countries
   within Occupational Therapy Education: Process and Implications
SO OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY IN HEALTH CARE
AB International service learning (ISL) is included in an increasing number of courses at post-secondary levels of education, including programs which educate future occupational therapy practitioners. There is a limited amount of literature and research concerning best practices for course-based occupational therapy education featuring ISL experiences, in particular within developing countries. The purpose of this paper is to (a) to review key literature on ISL, (b) explicate key elements which can help design course-based ISL experiences; and (c) suggest areas for further research and development of course-based ISL. The seven elements of focus that provide a base to guide occupational therapy educators who create ISL courses with an immersion component in a country with a developing economy are discussed, as well as future challenges and possibilities when providing occupational therapy services to a global society.

TI Recycling of Plastic Waste: A Systematic Review Using Bibliometric
   Analysis
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Research into plastic recycling is rapidly increasing as ocean and land pollution and ecosystem degradation from plastic waste is becoming a serious concern. In this study, we conducted a systematic review on emerging research topics, which were selected from 35,519 studies on plastic recycling by bibliometrics analysis. Our results show that research on the biodegradability of plastics, bioplastics, life cycle assessment, recycling of electrical and electronic equipment waste, and the use of recycled plastics in construction has increased rapidly in recent years, particularly since 2016. Especially, biodegradability is the most emerging topic with the average year of publication being 2018. Our key finding is that many research area is led by developed countries, while the use of recycled plastics in the construction sector is being actively explored in developing countries. Based on our results, we discuss two types of recycling systems: responsible recycling in the country where plastic waste is generated and promoting recycling through the international division of labor between developed and developing countries. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches and propose necessary measures for sustainable and responsible production and consumption of plastics such as waste traceability system and technology transfer between developed and developing countries.

TI Consumers' behavior towards electronic wastes from a sustainable
   development point of view: An exploration of differences between
   developed and developing countries
SO SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
AB The management and control of waste electrical and electronic equipment have been among the most critical challenges in recent decades. However, the existing electrical and electronic equipment consumption patterns lead to negative consequences for the environment and social and economic aspects. On the other hand, social media has demonstrated itself as an important data source to extract large amounts of information from consumers' opinions. Therefore, an integrated approach of quantitative and qualitative methods (based on Twitter data and analysis of the literature followed by the Delphi method and the Analytic Hierarchy Process is adopted to analyze consumers' participation in electronic waste recycling schemes, from the standpoint of sustainable development, in developed and developing countries. Considering the three pillars of "sustainable development", the findings reveal that in developing countries, the "economic" pillar is of the highest, and the "environmental" aspect is of the least importance, and the "social" is somewhere in between. However, in developed countries, due to higher welfare, the priorities of the dimensions above are different wherein the "environmental" and the "social" pillars are of the higher importance, and the "economic" comes last. Therefore, governments and high-level policy-makers could apply the research findings to develop long-term strategies. (C) 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Using the water management policy as test, proves that developing countries ignore the commitments from the guiding vision of sustainable development like adopted during the UNED-conference in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro. The water resources as central part of sustainable development are continuously misused and irreversibly contaminated. Reason is the low social and economic value that is attributed to water.
   Ineffective public services depending on instability and unpredictability of politics hindered in Argentina long term planning as required for water resources management. Water-related social, financial, health and environmental problems are consequences. Most are related to economic aspects, e.g. the increasing public health costs by increasing water born diseases. Consequently economising water use and misuse is required and integral water resources management must be included in national economic planning by considering the total economic value of water, including all environmental and social values.
   Long term private concessions for water supply and sewer services including performance objectives and public control were granted in Argentina. Unconsidered remained performance objectives like not to overexploit or contaminate aquifers by improper exploitation and monitoring programmes. Pollution and water misuse may be correspondingly economised. Economic instruments are therefore that the polluter pays principle and the reduction of public health costs.

TI Economic analysis of rainwater harvesting systems comparing developing
   and developed countries: A case study of Australia and Kenya
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Rainwater is a naturally occurring potentially clean source of water. There has been an increased interest in rainwater harvesting (RWH) in both developing and developed nations. RWH can alleviate the effects of accelerated urbanisation and improve their water security in the face of uncertain future climate patterns. Australia's management of her millennium drought has proved the effectiveness of RWH systems. Success in Australia is promising for developing countries with inadequate water supply for drinking and sanitation and unreliable centralised water supply systems. However, there is little research on the economic analysis of RWH systems in developing countries. Here we have developed an economic analysis tool, called ERain, to combine daily performance analysis of RWH systems with life cycle cost analysis for use in economic evaluation. ERain has shown that the recent tendency towards smaller tanks in Australia is a poor choice economically, that RWH systems in Kenya can be economically beneficial if installed without reticulation, and that reliability (the percentage of days that the demand is met) can be a financial issue. ERain provides a realistic framework for establishing sustainable RWH solutions. The relationship between the benefit-cost ratio, reliability and efficiency (the percentage of available water used) is discussed as well as discrepancies between the benefit-cost ratio (BCR), and net present value (NPV) as economic indicators. Results highlight the need for innovation and reduction in capital and ongoing costs associated with RWH systems in preference to increasing the price of water to increase their economic viability. The impact of paying elevated prices for water purchased from street vendors on the other hand demonstrates the dependency of RWH system economic viability on regional freshwater cost. Results also show that a rebate that matches tank size would be a good initiative to encourage the installation of larger tanks and increase water security, while relying on customer perspective of value will tend towards installation of smaller tanks and a superficial water security.

AB In the context of globalization, the international economics is increasingly important in a country's economic development, especially for developing countries. The international economic situation is mainly manifested in balance of payments (BOP). It's not difficult to find that when a crisis or macroeconomic volatility breaks out in the opening-up process of developing countries, the country's BOP will deteriorate first. Therefore, the sustainability of BOP structure is very important to an open economy or an opening-up economy. The opening-up of BRIC countries began at the early 1990s. In nearly 20 years' exploratory process, though the four countries experienced very differently, their good economic performance attracts worldwide attention in the 21st century. Although the BOP structures of the four countries are distinctive, generally speaking, the sustainability has been significantly improved. After comparative study, this paper finds that there are some experience and lessons which should be summarized and learned from each other.

TI TRADE AND AGRICULTURAL-DEVELOPMENT IN THE 1980S AND THE CHALLENGES FOR
   THE 1990S - ASIA
SO AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
AB Asian developing countries have had varying experiences in trade and agricultural development in the 1980s, attributable in part to their differing stages of economic development and structural characteristics. Other important influences relate to the external economic environment and the policy choices made by their governments not only during the period but also in the preceding decade.
   The achievements of Asian developing countries under the adverse external conditions of the 1980s are discussed in terms of their macroeconomic and agricultural growth, the commodity structure of agricultural growth, their food production and trade, the expansion and diversification of their agricultural exports, and the policy and nonpolicy factors affecting them. Special attention is given to the role of policy reforms implemented in China and the South Asian countries, following similar policy developments in Northeast and Southeast Asia in the 1960s and 1970s, toward greater openness in their trade regime and increased private-sector participation in the economy. These reforms have contributed to the observed acceleration in GDP, agricultural, and export growth in the 1980s. However, macroeconomic imbalances have emerged that threaten the sustainability of economic liberalization in those countries.
   The major challenges for the 1990s also differ among the Asian developing countries- In the industrially advanced Northeast economies of Taiwan and South Korea, the primary need is to ease the transition of the remaining rural population as farm incomes continue to fall and workers move to industrial and service activities. This challenge has to be addressed in the context of growing external pressure to further open their domestic market for agricultural imports. Among the Southeast and South Asian countries, there is a need to reduce the existing policy biases against agriculture, particularly against export crop production. Moreover, China and the South Asian countries face the additional challenges of continuing to deregulate their trade regime and internal markets, and of promoting macroeconomic stability.
   Despite the external trend recently toward regionalism, Asian developing countries generally seem committed to an open trading system, on which in fact their past impressive economic performance has been predicated. An important challenge for them in the 1990s is to play an active role in arresting and reversing any protectionist tendencies arising from the formation of regional trading blocs and to support multilateral initiatives such as the Uruguay Round that promote global trade liberalization.

A new methodology to improve government spending is introduced. Epidemiological and economic analyses form the basis for a global priority setting exercise, leading to a recommended essential public health and clinical services package for low-and middle-income countries, Ministries of Health in many countries have expressed an interest in designing a national package of essential health services, using the methodology. Given the apparent importance attached to the study and its far reaching potential consequences, this article provides an overview of the method, the main issues and problems in estimating the burden of disease as well as the cost-effectiveness of interventions. Strengths and weaknesses in the databases, value judgements and assumptions are identified, leading to a critical analysis of the validity of the priority setting exercise on the global level.

SO WORLDS POULTRY SCIENCE JOURNAL
CT 22nd World Poultry Congress
CY JUN 08-13, 2004
CL Istanbul, TURKEY
AB Despite efforts to develop intensive poultry production, family poultry (FP) are still very important in developing countries. In most developing countries, the keeping of poultry by local communities has been practised for many generations. FP keeping is a widely practised activity. More than 90% of rural families in most developing countries keep one or more poultry species (i.e. chickens, ducks, guinea fowls, geese, pigeons, etc.), and all ethnic groups tend to be involved in FP production. Although generally requiring low levels of inputs, FP is an appropriate system for supplying the fast-growing human population with high-quality protein, while providing additional income to the generally resource-poor small farmers, especially women. FP is also a source of employment for underprivileged groups and less-favoured areas in developing countries. However, constraints facing FP production systems are related to high mortality (mainly due to Newcastle disease), housing, feeding, breeding, marketing, credit, education/training, extension and information dissemination. Organizers of FP development programmes must be sufficiently sensitive to socio-cultural and economic circumstances of potential beneficiaries. Developing schemes that aim to promote and improve the FP sub-sector in a way that is sustainable must not underestimate the specific roles and contributions of relevant members of local communities, as well as their different gender groups i.e. women, men, boys, girls, young and old persons. Therefore, getting new information and other various interventions to the front line of production requires well-designed gender research. This work, which must be done by multi- and trans-disciplinary teams to ensure that the production environment in which FP-keeping farmers work is fully understood, helps to identify the target groups of FP producers for development programmes such as in training, extension, information dissemination, provision of inputs and credit, marketing of poultry and their products. Ways to improve the productivity of FP management systems by taking into account sociocultural, especially gender, aspects in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation stages of FP development programmes at community level are also explored.

TI E-readiness assessment of non-profit ICT SMEs in a developing country:
   The case of Iran
SO TECHNOVATION
AB We are experiencing a new kind of commerce in the recent era, known as e-commerce, which considers information and communication technology (ICT) as the main enabler of commerce. Considering small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as micro elements of society and part of macro economy, ICT becomes crucial for e-commerce companies to attain sustainable competitiveness.
   Towards this, organizations must re-evaluate every aspect of their strategies and quickly adapt their working models to incorporate e-commerce as an essential factor for their success.
   SMEs are critical to the economies of all countries, and specially the developing ones. They cannot be left behind and many of them are already demonstrating their entrepreneurship strength by grasping the opportunities offered by ICT.
   E-readiness assessment is an evaluation tool that can be used for measuring the diffusion rate of ICT. However, critical issues for e-readiness assessment of SMEs have not been systematically investigated for developing countries. Some existing studies have derived their critical factors from macro perspectives at country level and have not considered the important factors at micro level for SMEs in an integrated way, This paper aims to bridge this gap.
   This research paper first reviews the e-readiness assessment models proposed for countries at macro scale and then identifies the critical factors for SMEs e-readiness assessment. This is achieved through factor analysis at the micro perspective of some Iranian non-profit ICT SMEs. The extracted factors are organizational features, ICT infrastructures, ICT availability and security and legal environment.
   This study is probably the first to provide a perspective of critical issues for e-readiness assessment in SMEs based on macro models in a developing country. It gives valuable insight and guidelines which hopefully will help the managers in developing countries to consider the critical issues for e-readiness assessment of their organization in an effective way.

TI Global access to infertility care in developing countries: a case of
   human rights, equity and social justice
SO FACTS VIEWS AND VISION IN OBGYN
AB According to WHO data more than 180 million couples in developing countries suffer from primary or secondary infertility. The social stigma of childlessness still leads to isolation and abandonment in many developing countries. Differences between the developed and developing world are emerging because of the different availability in infertility care and different socio-cultural value surrounding procreation and childlessness.
   Although reproductive health education and prevention of infertility are number one priorities, the need for accessible diagnostic procedures and new reproductive technologies (ART) is very high. The success and sustainability of ART in resource-poor settings will depend to a large extend on our ability to optimise these techniques in terms of availability, affordability and effectiveness. Accessible infertility treatment can only be successfully introduced in developing countries if socio-cultural and economic prerequisites are fulfilled and governments can be persuaded to support their introduction. We have to liaise with the relevant authorities to discuss the strengthening of infertility services, at the core of which lies the integration of infertility, contraceptive and maternal health services within public health care structures.
   After a fascinating period of more than 30 years of IVF, only a small part of the world population benefits from these new technologies. Time has come to give equitable access to effective and safe infertility care in resource-poor countries as well.

TI THE PROBLEMATIZATION OF MEDICAL TOURISM: A CRITIQUE OF NEOLIBERALISM
SO DEVELOPING WORLD BIOETHICS
AB The past two decades have seen the extensive privatisation and marketisation of health care in an ever reaching number of developing countries. Within this milieu, medical tourism is being promoted as a rational economic development strategy for some developing nations, and a makeshift solution to the escalating waiting lists and exorbitant costs of health care in developed nations. This paper explores the need to problematize medical tourism in order to move beyond one dimensional neoliberal discourses that have, to date, dominated the arena. In this problematization, the paper discusses a range of understandings and uses of the term medical tourism and situates it within the context of the neoliberal economic development of health care internationally. Drawing on theory from critical medical anthropology and health and human rights perspectives, the paper critically analyzes the assumed independence between the medical tourism industry and local populations facing critical health issues, where social, cultural and economic inequities are widening in terms of access, cost and quality of health care. Finally, medical tourism is examined in the local context of India, critiquing the increasingly indistinct roles played by government and private sectors, whilst linking these shifts to global market forces.

AB The convergence of information and communication technologies, the underlying concept of the Information Age, is one of the principal determinants of economic growth and a characteristic of advanced economic systems. This important role of applied knowledge and information has significant impact on developing countries as they seek to become competitive participants in a global market. However many developing countries, in particular the small island developing states (SIDs), face several challenges to entering the global economic market including the high costs of the basic infrastructure (including telecommunications); limited human and technological resources; dependence on a limited export market; low productivity; acute vulnerability to natural and environmental hazards; considerable dependence on foreign investment and aid; and their location on the periphery of the international system. Developing countries such as the island states of the Caribbean increasingly turn to the utilisation and exploitation of advanced information and communication technologies for the creation of an effective knowledge-based society or knowledge-based economy that is using embodied knowledge and information and communication technologies in order to increase the innovative capacity the countries. This paper presents an approach to the development of such a knowledge-based society within developing countries by examining the implementation of a wireless grid on a regional level. The technological feasibility of such a regional approach however cannot be viewed in isolation, but must necessarily take into consideration other factors such as political and economic variables.

TI How would GVCs participation affect carbon intensity in the ?Belt and
   Road Initiative? countries?
SO ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB Participating in global value chains (GVCs) brings great economic and ecological benefits in Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) countries. By combining the multi-region input-output analyses with regression models, this study examines the impact of GVCs participation on carbon intensity in BRI countries during 2005-2016. Results show that: most BRI countries are located in backward GVCs positions, and carbon intensity presents a decreasing trend. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that, forward (backward) GVCs participation mode is nega-tively (positively) associated with carbon intensity changes in BRI countries. Both forward and backward participation modes have greater impacts on BRI developing than that of developed countries. With the deep-ening of forward linkages, BRI developing countries could reduce greater carbon intensity than all global developing countries.Further analysis shows that technological innovation and industrial upgrading effects of forward mode play greater impacts on decreasing carbon intensity than that of backward mode. Taken together, BRI countries can strengthen cooperation in climate governance and promote synergy to reduce carbon intensity. In addition, it is necessary to seek a breakthrough in GVCs position to realize the function of environmental governance. Advancing technological innovation and upgrading industrial structure are also effective ways to reduce carbon intensity

TI The Environmental Kuznets Curve Hypothesis for Colombia: Impact of
   Economic Development on Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Ecological
   Footprint
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Climate change has become a significant concern for developing countries given the risk that it poses to energy and food independence, and to general productivity. Despite having an energy system with low carbon intensity when compared to other Latin American countries, Colombia is already facing climate change impacts and requires urgent efforts to mitigate them. As a developing country, the challenge is bigger as policies for economic growth should be in line with the global commitment of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. With the aim of contributing to the design of climate policies by using data driven methodologies and scientific evidence, this study assesses the impact of economic development on the environment by examining the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis for Colombia. Statistically validated and stable autoregressive distributed lag models are estimated for three different environmental indicators: carbon dioxide emissions, methane emissions, and the ecological footprint. Moreover, the effects of other variables such as urbanization, foreign direct investment, the value added by the agricultural and industrial sectors, and energy use are analyzed with dynamic simulations. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports of EKC estimation using these variables in statistically validated models for Colombia; thus, this paper adds to the scientific evidence of the EKC hypothesis in developing countries. Empirical evidence supports a long-run equilibrium relationship among investigated variables and the existence of an inverted U-shaped EKC relationship between gross domestic product (GDP) and methane emissions, and GDP and the ecological footprint. The results of this paper show that shifting to renewable energy sources and leveraging the use of cleaner technologies in agricultural and industrial sectors are key factors for economic growth without harming the environment, which has important scientific value because of its evidence-based approach for public policy making in developing countries, particularly Colombia.

TI Greening with IT: practices of leading countries and strategies of
   followers
SO MANAGEMENT DECISION
AB Purpose - The aim of this paper is to present green information technology (GIT) initiatives of leading countries and to suggest strategies for environmental sustainability for the follower countries.
   Design/methodology/approach - A comprehensive review of greening of IT and greening by IT programs for sustainable growth in leading countries, the growing GIT market, and possible GIT strategies for the follower countries is provided.
   Findings - Green IT initiatives and practices in leading countries mirror each country's IT infrastructure and governmental efforts for green growth society. Some of the best practices of these countries should be benchmarked by the follower countries that have recently experienced dramatic increases in energy consumption and CO2 emission.
   Research limitations/implications - Each country has its own unique political, social, and economic conditions. Thus, a universal set of GIT initiatives is not suggested in this study.
   Practical implications - GIT should be a critical national strategy for any country. The findings of this study provide guidance to government and corporate leaders, especially for the developing countries, on how to develop effective GIT programs for sustainable green society.
   Originality/value - This study presents a comprehensive discussion of GIT initiatives and practices of leading countries and the exploding GIT market around the world. It also provides new insights for GIT for the follower countries.

TI Markets versus institutions in developing countries: National attributes
   as determinants
SO EMERGING MARKETS REVIEW
AB While there is some discussion of national preferences for banking versus financial markets, there is little research on how national financing preferences are determined by legal, cultural, and other national characteristics. Using panel analysis on data fora recent eight-year period for sixteen emerging-economies, this paper documents that, in such countries, an increased predilection for equity markets is associated with increased prevention of corruption and countries being Asian. A decreased predilection for financing via equity markets is associated both with greater power of bank regulators and with more globalization and an English legal origin. One interpretation of our results suggests that while common law promotes both banking and financial markets, common law and societal openness act to promote banking more than markets in less developed environments. Our results have important public policy implications given that financial systems are still evolving in developing countries. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Property Rights, Law, and Economic Development
SO LAW AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
AB This article explores the relationship between property rights and economic performance. Property rights, or more precisely, formal, individualized property rights, have long been regarded as the fundamental precondition for sustainable economic growth. However, the available empirical evidence shows that formal private ownership fails to bring about desirable economic outcomes in most developing countries despite the advantages claimed by numerous economists and lawyers. This puzzle can be addressed by taking into consideration such factors as the functioning of related markets, the influence of social norms, and the role of the state.

TI How embodied carbon in trade affects labor income in developing
   countries
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB With the growth of international trade, the geographical separation of production and consumption links of goods has become increasingly common. Commodity-consuming countries can transfer carbon emissions generated in the production of commodities to commodity-producing countries through foreign trade while meeting their domestic consumption demands and emission reduction targets. This issue of embodied carbon emissions in international trade has received wide attention in recent years and has exerted significant impact on the labor income share of developing nations. This study determines the relationship between carbon emission and labor income share in the imports and exports of intermediate products from the perspective of the global value chain. Empirical results show that in developing countries, labor income share has a negative relationship with trade and a positive one with embodied carbon emission. Furthermore, to distinguish the heterogeneity between industries and verify the hypothesis, we classified 57 sectors into 7 main industries based on the method of Meng et al. (2018). Specifically, labor-intensive exports and technology-intensive imports increase labor income share while technology-intensive exports and labor-intensive imports reduce it. In addition to the light industry, the upgrading of women's employment structure can promote the increase of labor income share in host countries. The policy relevance of this study rests on its findings that developing countries can increase their labor income share through imports related to technology-intensive industries and exports related to labor-intensive industries; and that countries worldwide can fundamentally reduce embodied carbon emissions in trade by means of innovations in science and technology to realize sustainable development of the environment, economy, and society.

TI Self-Reported Abortion-Related Morbidity: A Comparison of Measures in
   Madhya Pradesh, India
SO INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVES ON SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
AB CONTEXT: Globally, abortion-related morbidity places a largely unmeasured physical, social and economic burden on women, yet little research has examined population-level morbidity, particularly in developing countries.
   METHODS: Data were drawn from a representative 2002 survey in Madhya Pradesh, India, of married women aged 15-39 who had at least one child; the analysis examined 966 abortion attempts associated with 737 pregnancies. The prevalence and severity of self-reported morbidity were determined using a symptom-based measure and a bed rest-based measure. Comparative and concurrency analyses assessed how the measures captured and categorized morbidity, and how their results differed between rural and urban settings and by provider and method used.
   RESULTS: Both measures found relatively high levels of abortion-related morbidity: The symptoms measure recorded morbidity in 58% and 46% of abortion attempts in rural and urban areas, respectively, and the bed-rest measure did so in 38% and 29% of attempts in these areas. With either measure, the proportion of attempts resulting in severe morbidity was higher for rural than for urban women. A substantial proportion of attempts were categorized as resulting in moderate or severe morbidity under the symptoms measure and in no morbidity under the bed-rest measure (16-20%), and a significant proportion were categorized as leading to severe morbidity under the first measure and to no or moderate morbidity under the second measure (6-17%). Differences also appeared in how the measures assessed morbidity according to the provider and method used.
   CONCLUSIONS: Each measure captured a distinct dimension of abortion-related morbidity, which suggests that multiple measures should be used to more fully assess the burden of morbidity among women in developing countries.

AB The demise rate of small firms every year is high worldwide and mostly these businesses struggle for many years without significant growth. Therefore, this study focused on identifying factors that contribute to the sustainability of growth for small firms in a developing country. Small firms are vital in the development and growth of bottom billion economies and are part of solutions to social problems that Namibia experience, inter alia, high unemployment rate. In developing countries, it is estimated that 45% of formal sector workers belong to SMEs and about 24% of GDP is contributed by small firms. SMEs are known for the common characteristics such as responsiveness, strategic agility, and leanness in operations management that are often aimed to meet and exceed variations of market demands. Thus far, it is crucial to study such behavior of small firms responsible for their growth or demise in the contemporary markets where small firms are crippled by raspy competition from MNCs.

AB Trends in urban transportation and environment are reviewed, with a focus on developing countries. "Sustainable transportation" is defined to include economic and environmental sustainability as well as equity as key criteria. Governance sustainability is also important if policies and technologies are to reduce the main externalities of urban transport. It is important to relate emissions to traffic, modal share, fuel use, and fuel characteristics; transport policies must confront all of these components if emissions are to be reduced significantly. Urban areas in developing countries have become the most polluted and congested cities in the world because of barriers to serious transport sector reform addressing these ills. However, some policies and technologies are permitting regions in Latin America and Asia to begin to change. Strong actions by cities, backed by national government formulation of equipment and fuel standards and supported by private-sector initiatives, are all needed-together with political will-to reverse the unsustainable trends in urban transport in the largest urban areas today.

AB 1. In developed countries, the major burden of disease is due to chronic diseases, such as heart disease and stroke. In contrast, the major burden of disease among people in developing countries has been due largely to diseases caused by malnutrition, poor sanitation and infection. In recent years, with increasing economic and demographic development, there has been a shift in developing countries from diseases caused by poverty towards chronic, non-communicable, lifestyle-related diseases. The rapid emergence of these chronic diseases has not occurred with a similarly rapid decline in infectious diseases. Therefore, these developing countries are experiencing high rates of both infectious and chronic diseases.
   2. The increase in chronic diseases in developing countries has been brought about by the increasing prevalence of risk factors, such as increased alcohol consumption, smoking, obesity, physical inactivity and low fruit and vegetable intake. In parallel with this, there is also increased evidence of high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels.
   3. The preventive strategies required to reverse this trend for these emerging diseases include the education of public health professionals, the introduction of surveillance activities to monitor changes in risk factors, the introduction of health promotion, the development of prevention research and improved advocacy for disease prevention programmes. Experience from other countries provides evidence that prevention programmes can work. The global challenge is to ensure that implementation of such programmes in the world's developing nations does not come too late.

TI Economy/Environment Interaction and Global Trade of Materials: An
   Empirical Examination for 95 Countries between 1980 and 2009
SO PERSPECTIVES ON GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Political economy theory posits decreasing economic intensity-i.e. the use of fewer materials per unit of economic growth-does not lead to a decrease in material extraction. Modernization theory suggests decreasing economic intensity may lead to a decline in the use of materials. Unequal ecological exchange theory suggests that the dominate position of developed countries in the global trade of materials allows them to protect their own environments by extracting materials elsewhere. By examining data from 95 countries between 1980 and 2009, this paper provides an empirical evaluation to theoretical statements discussed above. Findings show that economic intensity has declined markedly for decades while the total material extraction continues to increase worldwide. More developed countries enjoy an import surplus, while most materials extracted from developing countries are exported abroad. Positive associations (mediated by global trade of materials) exist between material extraction from developing countries and material consumption in developed countries.

TI The Impact of Financial Development on Carbon Emissions: A Global
   Perspective
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Financial development has been deemed to be an important factor influencing carbon emissions; however, the specific effect generated by financial development is still disputed. In this study, we examined the relationship between financial development and carbon emissions based on a system generalized method of moments and the data of 155 countries, and we further analyzed the national differences by dividing the sample countries into two sub-groups: developed countries, and emerging market and developing countries. The empirical results indicated that from a global perspective, financial development could significantly increase carbon emissions, and the analysis of the emerging market and developing countries reached the same conclusion; however, the results indicated that for developed countries, the effect of financial development on carbon emissions is insignificant. A series of robustness checks were conducted and confirmed that our empirical results were reliable. We suggest that policymakers in emerging market and developing countries should carefully balance financial development and environmental protection, as financial development will promote carbon emissions before countries reach a relatively high development level.

AB The UNU School for Land Administration Studies aims to promote the role of land administration worldwide for good governance in developing countries. A key component of the mandate of the School is to develop a worldwide network of academic partners. Each partner in this network contributes with complementary knowledge and experience, yet distribution of this knowledge to local capacity building institutes and curricula requires a mechanism to deliver content, skills, methods and approaches in a sustainable and student-centric way. To address this challenge, this paper discusses the design and the first experiences with e-learning courseware and activities within the network. The testbed of e-learning design concerned a module on land information infrastructure. Developing the teaching material and teaching approach with the other partners in the network was operationalized through a project, whereby the module was incrementally developed to an e-learning shared module with an e-learning environment. The results so far show that the incremental approach (in contrast to a radical change) meant that certain components migrated immediately to e-learning units, while other components remained initially conventional. This incremental approach not only had pragmatic advantages in terms of the resources needed for courseware development, but also allowed more time for interaction, testing and customization with partners in the network. We conclude therefore that developing e-learning courseware has enabled the network building among partners who build capacity in land administration. This network further enables combining and complementing both global and local knowledge and thus promotes the role of land administration worldwide for socio-economic development in developing countries.

AB We propose a framework that, building on the pledges made by governments after the Copenhagen Accord of 2009, could be used to assign allocations of emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), across all countries, one budget period at a time, as envisioned at the 2011 negotiations in Durban. Under this two-part plan: (i) China, India, and other developing countries accept targets at Business as Usual (BAU) in the coming budget period, the same period in which the U.S. first agrees to cuts below BAU; and (ii) all countries are asked in the future to make further cuts in accordance with a common numerical formula that each country is likely to view as fair. We use a state of the art integrated assessment model to project economic and environmental effects of the computed emission targets.

TI An investigation into the sustainability practices in PPP infrastructure
   projects: a case of Nigeria
SO SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB Purpose In the global construction industry, the concept of sustainability is not new, particularly within building projects. Against this backdrop, several studies have been conducted, mostly in developed countries, on sustainability in construction projects. However, efforts at investigating sustainability practices in public-private partnership (PPP) infrastructure projects in developing countries have received limited attention. Hence, the purpose of this study is to investigate the incorporation of sustainability practices within the context of Nigeria's PPP infrastructure projects. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey, which targeted four different types of stakeholders, was conducted in this study. These stakeholders included public sector authorities, concessionaires, consultants and banks undertaking PPP infrastructure projects in the Lagos State, Nigeria. The data collected were analyzed using frequency, percentage, mean score, standard deviation (SD) analyses and the Kruskal-Wallis test. Findings The findings of this study revealed that all the respondents are very much aware of sustainability principles and the vast majority of the respondents from the public sector authorities and the consultant organizations confirmed that they have incorporated sustainability requirements into their bidding documents for PPP infrastructure projects. The study revealed sustainability features in the three aspects of sustainability, namely, economic, environmental and social factors. Furthermore, the study revealed the top three-ranked economic factors of sustainability (considered to be the most important factors) were low maintenance costs, whole life costing and supporting the local economy, respectively. Similarly, the study revealed the top three-ranked environmental factors of sustainability were biodiversity, energy use during the operation stage and energy use during the construction stage, respectively. Furthermore, the study further revealed that the top three-ranked social factors of sustainability were the educational aspect, equity between stakeholders and health and safety, respectively. Practical implications The study will be of great value to PPP stakeholders involved in sustainability decision-making processes when delivering sustainable PPP projects, particularly in Nigeria. Also, the study's findings are important as not many empirical studies have been conducted on the sustainability practices of current PPP projects in Nigeria. Originality/value The study's findings would further inform the need for both the public and private sectors to take a more strategic approach to enhance sustainability in PPP projects.

TI Health research systems: promoting health equity or economic
   competitiveness?
SO BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
AB International collaborative health research is justifiably expected to help reduce global health inequities. Investment in health policy and systems research in developing countries is essential to this process but, currently, funding for international research is mainly channelled towards the development of new medical interventions. This imbalance is largely due to research legislation and policies used in high-income countries. These policies have increasingly led these countries to invest in health research aimed at boosting national economic competitiveness rather than reducing health inequities. In the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the regulation of research has encouraged a model that: leads to products that can be commercialized; targets health needs that can be met by profitable, high-technology products; has the licensing of new products as its endpoint; and does not entail significant research capacity strengthening in other countries. Accordingly, investment in international research is directed towards pharmaceutical trials and product development public-private partnerships for neglected diseases. This diverts funding away from research that is needed to implement existing interventions and to strengthen health systems, i.e. health policy and systems research. Governments must restructure their research laws and policies to increase this essential research in developing countries.

TI Context appropriate technologies for development: Choosing for the
   future
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB Technology foresight has been increasingly undertaken by developing countries to identify technologies whose adoption might serve as a platform for future economic growth. However, foresight activities have not, by and large, resulted in well-developed policy initiatives. Three factors are relevant for improvement. First, foresight activities would benefit from being more informed by the convergence literature and global convergence experience over the past several decades, and should therefore incorporate organically the concepts of absorptive capacity and technology gap into foresight exercises. Second, certain preconditions- in particular the existence of a functional national innovation system-enhance the likelihood that foresight exercises will be successful. Third, in order to achieve wide buy-in and promote the sustainability of initiatives generated by the foresight activity, developing countries are advised to consult widely in the foresight process. Policies emanating from foresight activities should additionally address two core challenges: a) a clear definition of those technologies that should be developed internally vs. those that should be sourced from abroad and b) identification of the internal capabilities to be developed in conjunction with those technologies targeted for acquisition from abroad.

CY JUN 15-21, 1996
CL DENVER, CO
AB In most developing countries more than 25% of total energy use comes from biofuels. In Ghana, the figure is between 70-80%. Bioenergy is mainly used for cooking and heating, and is also important in rural or cottage industries. As a developing country, Ghana's economic growth remains coupled to the availability and supply of energy. About 29% of this energy is obtained through hydropower and imported petroleum. The two hydropower installations generate about 1102 MW annually mainly for domestic and industrial uses. At the current 3.0% average annual population growth rate, a population of about 35 million is expected by 2025. Coupled with the country's efforts to promote industrialisation, future energy demand is expected to increase severalfold. This paper provides an overview of Ghana's current energy situation and discusses the role of bioenergy in the future energy demand of the country. The paper concludes with a recommendation for a major shift in energy policy to accommodate the conversion of biofuels into versatile energy carriers in a decentralised system to meet the energy requirements of the people and to provide a basis for rural development and employment.

TI Overview: Epilepsy surgery in developing countries
SO EPILEPSIA
CT 23rd International Epilepsy Congress on Epilepsy Surgery in Developing
   Countries
CY SEP 13, 1999
CL PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC
AB Epilepsy surgery (ES) is addressed in relation to economic classifications of national resources and welfare in developing countries. A decade ago, ten developing countries conducted ES; now 26 such countries have reported results of ES. A number of international authorities define indicators of national economic welfare. Adopting the economic classification of the International Monetary Fund, we find that ES is nonexistent in 98% of African countries, 76% of Asian countries, 58% of European countries, 82% of Middle East countries, and in 86% of countries of the Western Hemisphere. The 1980-1990 global ES survey conducted by the International League Against Epilepsy identified ten developing countries reporting ES (DCRES): Brazil, China, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Mexico, Poland, Taiwan, the U.S.S.R., Yugoslavia, and Viet Nam. The present survey based on the proceedings of the 19th-23rd International Epilepsy Congresses and Medline re ports from 1991 to November 1999 revealed at least 26 (18.3%) DCRES of 142 developing countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Estonia, Hungary, India, Iran, Israel, Korea, Lithuania, Mexico, P.R.China, the U.S.S.R., Singapore, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, Ukraine, Uruguay, and former Yugoslavia. National vital statistics expose the hardships of developing countries. The population ratio of developed countries to developing countries is similar to 1:5. The reverse per capita Gross Domestic Product ratio is 20:1. Great disparities exist in vital statistics, all to the disadvantage of the DCRES. The World Health Organization defines health-related sectors geographically, then divides developing countries into several subgroups. Disability caused by length of disease and years lived with disability can be quantified monetarily for epilepsy, and the total health expenditures of developed and developing countries can be compared. The DCRES are short of technology, and their ES teams must choose from an excess of surgical candidates, investigating with computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, noninvasive video-electroencephalography, and neuropsychology. The surgical outcomes achieved are similar to those in the developed world, but at a fractional cost. To internationalize ES, outcome, cost, and savings from care, evolution of assessment methodology is needed. Also needed is general support from the developed world.

TI Diversity and pluralism in earth system governance: Contemplating the
   role for global administrative law
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB This article aims to explore whether procedural rights and administrative law mechanisms - such as, for example, the right to a hearing, the duties to provide a reasoned decision and to disclose relevant information can enhance the accountability and democratic legitimacy of earth system governance. The democracy-enhancing potential of such mechanisms and rights - which in the national context have proved to be beneficial in strengthening citizens' participation and the acceptance of decisions - can be limited in the global arena, by a number of factors. One of these factors is "legal imperialism", understood as the grafting onto the global level rules and institutions that impose the hegemony of western values. In fact, administrative law mechanisms, being a construct of a certain type of western, liberal model of the state (and its capitalist model of development), could be perceived, in developing countries as an instrument to reproduce the dominant position of advanced industrialized countries and their economic actors. The analysis suggests that in order to realize their democracy-enhancing potential, these mechanisms should draw, as far as possible, on cross-cultural principles, and be supported by financial and technical instruments enabling "developing countries" and marginalized groups to engage in dialog with the most powerful actors.

TI Vaccinology capacity building in Europe through innovative platforms

SO HUMAN VACCINES & IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS
AB The 2012 Terrapinn World Vaccine Congress held from 16 to 18 October in Lyon addressed in a dedicated session the transfer of innovative vaccine technologies from Europe to emerging markets. Past and recent transfers and experiences from Europe's public domain were summarized by the Netherlands' National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) in Bilthoven. The role of capacity building through training courses for developing country partners was highlighted in several recent technology transfer programs developed in collaboration with the World Health Organisation (WHO).
   In another stream of the Congress, a case of human vaccine technology transfer from Europe's private sector to an emerging economy recipient in India was presented.
   The continuing globalization of vaccinology is further illustrated by the recent acquisition in 2012 of the Netherlands' public vaccine manufacturing capacity in Bilthoven by the Serum Institute of India Ltd, an emerging vaccine manufacturer.
   In a parallel development, the Netherlands' government decided to transform RIVM's vaccinology research and development capacity into a new not-for-profit entity: the Institute for Translational Vaccinology (see citation 1 in Note section for web address).(1) Under a public private partnership structure, InTraVacc's mission will include the fostering of global health through international partnerships in innovative vaccinology.
   Projected activities will include training courses and curricula, capitalizing on various currently established platform technologies and the legacy of previous producer -producer collaborations between the RIVM and emerging manufacturers over the past 40 y.
   It is suggested to consider this as a basis for a common initiative from Europe to develop and implement a practical vaccinology course for emerging countries with particular focus to the African region.

TI Distant water industrial fishing in developing countries: A case study
   of Madagascar
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
AB As industrial vessels continue to expand in both extractive capacity and spatial range, concerns have grown over foreign industrial fishing occurring within the marine territories of developing countries, both legally and illegally. Madagascar's status as a "least developed country", coupled with its high marine biodiversity, makes its waters particularly susceptible to fishing by distant water fishing nations (DWFNs). However, given constraints in management and research, it is unclear how foreign industrial fishing, both legal via foreign agreements and illegal, may impact local marine resources that many coastal communities depend on for food security, cultural meaning and livelihoods. We used satellite-derived fishing effort data from 2012 to 2020, via Global Fishing Watch, to analyze industrial fishing effort occurring within Madagascar's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). We documented 907,643 h of industrial fishing within the Madagascar EEZ across 277 vessels from 17 different countries. We found that Taiwanease vessels (39.8%) using drifting longlines and Malagasy (17.2% shrimp trawlers were the most prevalent. Fishing effort was highly seasonal (68% of effort between October and February) and increased with higher global fish prices and the Indian Ocean Dipole, which is a measure of regional water temperature cycles. We also found a number of instances (17.6% of the fishing effort for 170,726 total hours) of foreign fishing vessels operating close to shore and within a number of marine protected areas. These results highlight the need for increased transparency surrounding foreign fishing agreements and unauthorized fishing within the waters of developing countries. Increases in industrial fishing effort and encroachment into near-shore areas has the potential to severely threaten current sustainable fisheries management initiatives by conservation organizations and coastal communities.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT-IJRED
AB The global shipping industry has been contributing more than four-fifths of the volume of goods transported internationally. However, shipping is facing pressure from strict policies on combating climate change from the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Seaports are an essential component of shipping and are also having to change their development strategies to be more sustainable and smarter. The concept of a green port was born as an inevitable part of the green economic development path. Green port system development policies and strategies have been discussed and studied in recent literature reviews, and have revealed the limited reach of developing countries. This work focuses on evaluating successful green port policies and concepts in developed countries to highlight the distinctive features of green ports. Moreover, the experiences from the effective green port models of developed countries can be valuable lessons for developing countries like Vietnam. More interestingly, the core features of green ports, when piloted at several international ports in Vietnam, promote port efficiency and environmental friendliness. On the way to implementing the national green port strategy, Vietnam has been establishing legal and infrastructure corridors to realize the strategy of sustainable marine economic development by 2045.

AB Cancer is one of the leading causes of deaths worldwide. Among the women, gynecological cancers are most common. Cervical cancer is a main gynecological cancer of the women. The global burden of cervical cancer is disproportionately high among the developing countries where 85 per cent of the estimated 493, 000 new cases and 273, 000 deaths occur worldwide. There are several dimensions of the problem. Cervical cancer is a problem where people are poor, where the socio-economic status of the women is low and sometimes specific ethnicity also posses additional risk to the women to develop cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus infection is a main risk factor for the cervical cancer however there are some other factors which increase the risk. Among them some are number of sexual partners, age of first sexual intercourse, infection of sexually transmitted diseases, use of hormonal contraceptives, parity, age, smoking, food and diet. Apart from these factors, some other issues, such as policy on cancer, capacity of health system, socio-economic and cultural factors and awareness among the women are also associated with the cervical cancer related morbidity and mortality across the developing countries. There some interventions which give promising results in terms of reducing cervical cancer related morbidity and mortality. Among them visual inspection of cervix with acetic acid followed by treatment is one such effective method.

TI Effects of Science, Technology, and Innovation Official Development
   Assistance on Innovative Capacity in Developing Countries
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This study aims to empirically investigate the effect of Science, Technology, and Innovation Official Development Assistance (STI ODA) on the innovative capacity of developing countries. Particularly, this study attempted to examine the moderating effects of R&D investment and its effect on innovative capacity. To do this, a panel fixed model analysis was carried out with ODA and macroeconomic data on 84 developing countries from 2002 to 2018. The findings indicated that STI ODA was found to have no direct positive effect on innovative capacity. However, it had a positive effect on innovative capacity when the moderating effect of R&D investment was significant and when the proportion of R&D investment increased. The findings of this study serve as a guide for policymakers in terms of having better understanding of the relationship between STI ODA, R&D investment, and innovative capacity. Hence, policy makers and practitioners are able to design a good policy to be adopted such that absorptive capacity should be prioritized for STI ODA to be effective in helping developing countries to escape poverty and achieve sustainable development goals. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first of its kind to analyze the moderating effect of R&D investment on the relationship between STI ODA and innovative capacity in a developing country context.

TI Prioritization of sustainability indicators for promoting the circular
   economy: The case of developing countries
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB The concept of the circular economy has gained well-recognition across the world for the past decades. With the heightening risk of the impact of climate change, resource scarcity to meet the increasing world population, the need to transition to a more sustainable development model is urgent. The circular economy is often cited as one of the best solutions to support sustainable development. However, the diffusion of this concept in the industrial arena is still relatively slow, particularly in the developing country, which collectively exerts high potential to be the world's largest economies and workforce. It is crucial to make sure that the development of these nations is sustainable and not bearing on the cost of future generations. Thus, this work aims to provide a comprehensive review of the circular economy concept in developing country context. Furthermore, a novel model is proposed by adopting Fuzzy Analytics Network Process (FANP) to quantify the priority weights of the sustainability indicators to provide guidelines for the industry stakeholders at different stages of industry cycle to transition toward the circular economy. The results revealed that improvement in economic performance and public acceptance are the key triggers to encourage stakeholders for sustainable development. The outcomes serve as a reference to enhance the overall decision-making process of industry stakeholders. Local authorities can adopt the recommendations to design policy and incentive that encourage the adoption of circular economy in real industry operation to spur up economic development, without neglecting environmental well-being and jeo-pardizing social benefits.

TI The Role of Coffee Production and Trade on Gender Equity and Livelihood
   Improvement in Tanzania
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Achieving the sustainable development goals in developing countries will require the realization of benefits from the global supply and value chains, such as coffee, for inclusive economic development and poverty reduction. This study uses the data of 400 men and women randomly sampled coffee farmers from a developing country, Tanzania, to evaluate coffee income distribution, and how general coffee production and trade contribute to gender equity and livelihood improvement. Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition and Gini coefficient models are used for data analysis. We find a gender imbalance from the ownership and control of resources to the participation of men and women in the coffee supply chain. However, investing in supporting the coffee supply chain has an impact on livelihood improvement, due to coffee income inequality reducing effects. There is a gender gap in the income earned from coffee production and trading, which is 44% of the women's structural disadvantages. Empowerment for equal access to land and credit, and offering trade facilitation services will bridge the existing gender gap. Additionally, developing and disseminating new coffee production technologies that will reduce discrimination, by offering new opportunities and making coffee an inclusive supply chain, remains imperative.

AB High Technology Companies in Developing Countries are sometimes suspiciously viewed as "expensive endeavors" of doubtful benefit when these developing countries struggle with serious social problems such as poverty, unemployment and poor infrastructure. The argument being that the effort in high technology only benefits an elitist few and that the country has to put their resources to solving the social problems rather than dabble in high technology projects.
   To let developing economies benefit sustainably from high technology organizations requires many factors being in place: an appropriate technology-base and related products that will continue to be sought-after in the local and global market in the future, a trustworthy political system, and an effective integration of systems & processes, leveraging the advantages to the problems of the community and the holistic, effective and efficient management of such organizations to mention but a few.
   This paper will focus on the management aspects of large scale high technology and engineering efforts. The paper identifies and discusses the key success parameters for such a scenario and will focus on the benefits of managing an organization holistically so as to be globally competitive, which in turn results in sustainable contributions to the community and the national economy of developing countries.
   The paper introduces a holistic management model which has been applied successfully in a country such as South Africa and also implemented in international companies in a number of developed countries. The suggested methodology/model lends itself to understand and judiciously manipulate the dynamics of the high tech global business environment for sustained competitive advantage in a framework of a sustainable economy. The management model recognizes and enables the manager to address the many issues confronting them daily by giving a new strategic perspective with the help of sub-models. These sub-models form the anchors of the Strategic Intent whereby the fluid and complex situation can be managed reasonably, effectively, sustainably and hopefully, wisely, too.
   It is the contention of this paper that a mature, analytical and intuitive management approach which considers all stakeholders, based on the holistic management model introduced, and which is properly and consistently applied, Will lead to a significant contribution to a sustainable economy. The research methodology employed is mainly exploratory in nature.

TI Game dynamic model of optimal budget allocation under individual
   vaccination choice
SO JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY
AB Communicable diseases are leading cause of child mortality in developing and under-developed countries. Public health ministries in states and country allocate a considerable amount of budget every year for vaccination campaigns to control infections. Even third-party agencies such as Gates Foundation, UNDP, GAVI, World Bank, WHO also allocate huge funds to under-developed and developing countries for vaccination programs and disease eliminations. However, economic constraints and current disease prevalence are not enough driving factors for optimal decisions in budget allocations for vaccinations and controlling the disease. In a population under voluntary vaccination campaign, high vaccine coverage cannot be taken for granted, as individuals' free-riding behaviour plays a significant role in achieving the herd immunity level coverage. Individual-level vaccine exemptions and ignoring this important component by the policymakers are key determinants for failure of disease elimination program these days in many under-developed and developing countries. We integrate evolutionary game theory and compartmental model of disease transmission to analyze how individual vaccination choice influence the budget allocations and vice-versa. Our model illustrates that individuals' perceived risk plays an important role in optimal budget allocations to minimize infections. Analyses of our model indicate that the optimal distribution of third-party funds may be very different than usual, especially in multiple populations with contrasting demographic and economic profiles. These findings are certainly useful to public health policymakers and may help to quantify certain parameters in budget allocations to control vaccine-preventable diseases. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Climate Change and Developing-Country Cities: Implications For
   Environmental Health and Equity
SO JOURNAL OF URBAN HEALTH-BULLETIN OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE
AB Climate change is an emerging threat to global public health. It is also highly inequitable, as the greatest risks are to the poorest populations, who have contributed least to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The rapid economic development and the concurrent urbanization of poorer countries mean that developing-country cities will be both vulnerable to health hazards from climate change and, simultaneously, an increasing contributor to the problem. We review the specific health vulnerabilities of urban populations in developing countries and highlight the range of large direct health effects of energy policies that are concentrated in urban areas. Common vulnerability factors include coastal location, exposure to the urban heat-island effect, high levels of outdoor and indoor air pollution, high population density, and poor sanitation. There are clear opportunities for simultaneously improving health and cutting GHG emissions most obviously through policies related to transport systems, urban planning, building regulations and household energy supply. These influence some of the largest current global health burdens, including approximately 800,000 annual deaths from ambient urban air pollution, 1.2 million from road-traffic accidents, 1.9 million from physical inactivity, and 1.5 million per year from indoor air pollution. GHG emissions and health protection in developing-country cities are likely to become increasingly prominent in policy development. There is a need for a more active input from the health sector to ensure that development and health policies contribute to a preventive approach to local and global environmental sustainability, urban population health, and health equity.

TI Global reproductive health - Why do we persist in neglecting the
   undeniable problem of childlessness in resource-poor countries?
SO FACTS VIEWS AND VISION IN OBGYN
AB The consequences of involuntary childlessness in developing countries create more wide-ranging societal problems compared to Western societies, particularly for women. Negative psychosocial and economical consequences for childless couples are often severe and underestimated by the local and international society. Infertility treatment is often limited to certain procedures and certain costumers.
   Most common arguments against supporting infertility care in resource-poor countries are the "overpopulation" and the "limited resources" argument, but they totally neglect the reproductive rights and systematic exclusion of millions of women from the right to reproduce.
   Because ART procedures are very expensive, governments and international aid-organisations are currently not investing in this technique. But the scene has changed recently: inexpensive ovarian stimulation protocols for IVF have proven their value and simplified but high quality low cost IVF techniques are available nowadays.
   From an ethical point of view it is our belief that the community can no longer justify the systematic exclusion of one tenth of couples from the right to reproduce in resource-poor countries.

TI Soaring antiretroviral prices, TRIPS and TRIPS flexibilities: a burning
   issue for antiretroviral treatment scale-up in developing countries
SO CURRENT OPINION IN HIV AND AIDS
AB Purpose of review
   The achievement of significant reductions in the price of antiretroviral drugs constitutes one of the main economic pillars of antiretroviral treatment scale-up in developing countries. Today this economic pillar is threatened.
   Recent findings
   The prohibitive prices of newer first-line and second-line regimens have created a watershed in relation to the prices of earlier first-line treatments. These price increases are closely related to the World Trade Organization's Agreement on the trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPS) that imposes an important barrier to generic competition. Intellectual property flexibilities foreseen by the TRIPS agreement allow the manufacture and supply of affordable generic versions of new generations of antiretroviral under certain conditions. However, the capacity to supply a specified list of generics under such conditions is tight and the utilization of such flexibilities in their current form remains complex and unattractive.
   Summary
   The TRIPS agreement currently constitutes a significant barrier to providing access to new antiretroviral at affordable prices in developing countries. If the debate on initiatives for increased flexibility of intellectual property rights does not become more extensive or obtain the overwhelming support of the international community, serious consequences are to be expected in terms of the fight against AIDS in most of the developing countries.

AB Globally rural regions have been placed high on the developmental agenda of developing countries but no universally accepted definition of rural development exists. Rural development is defined as a developmental process which should lead to sustainable improvement of the quality of life of a rural community, including the poor. Rural regions are in dire need of revitalization. A paradigm shift is needed to focus more on rural regions due to over population and congestion in urban areas, technical development which leads to "space shrinking", growing pressure of food security and a need for a sense of community and belonging. Since 2011, rural development has been prioritized as part of government policy in South Africa, after it has been neglected for more than two decades. In this article, rural development in a developing country, namely South Africa is analysed by looking at current policy and a rural development process is formulated known as the "Feza Isimangaliso" model. A number of best practice rural development strategies are also listed as solutions for rural development in developing countries including the building of governance capacity, support for the agricultural sector, maintenance and extension of infrastructure and other strategies.

TI Development without energy? Assessing future scenarios of energy
   consumption in developing countries
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB We analyze the relationship between economic development and energy consumption in the context of greenhouse gas mitigation. The main contribution of this work is to compare estimates of energy thresholds in the form of minimum energy requirements to reach high levels of development with output projections of per capita final energy supply from a group of integrated assessment models (IAMs). Scenarios project that reductions of carbon emissions in-developing countries will be achieved not only by means of decreasing the carbon intensity, but also by making a significant break with the historically observed relationship between energy use and economic growth. We discuss the feasibility of achieving, on time scales acceptable for developing countries, both decarbonization and the needed structural changes or efficiency improvements, concluding that the decreases in energy consumption implied in numerous mitigation scenarios are unlikely to be achieved without endangering sustainable development objectives. To underscore the importance of basic energy needs also in the future, the role of infrastructure is highlighted, using steel and cement as examples. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Vacuum sewerage systems - a solution for fast growing cities in
   developing countries?
SO WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Developed more than a century ago, the potential of vacuum sewerage systems remains underexploited. At the same time, the rapid urbanization in Asia brings about major challenges for municipal utilities. In this context, the GIZ (Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Internationale Zusammenarbeit) project 'Integrated Resource Management in Asian Cities: the Urban Nexus' gives technical advice to stakeholders in the partner cities. Fraunhofer IGB, having operated a vacuum sewer system for more than ten years in the context of a research project, carried out a survey regarding current experiences with vacuum sewer systems and the transferability to countries of the Global South. In an environment with existing infrastructure, it is often not economically reasonable to install an additional sewer system. Nevertheless, with aging infrastructure and an increasing importance of circular economy concepts including water reuse, nutrient recovery and biogas generation, vacuum sewers can pose a viable alternative for refurbishments or new developments in semi-decentralized sanitation approaches involving local treatment and resource recovery.

TI How does foreign direct investment contribute to Sustainable Development
   Goals? Evidence from African countries
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The public and the private sectors play fundamental roles in mobilizing capital to achieve the 2030 Agenda of Sustainable Development. In particular, developing countries can benefit from foreign direct investment (FDI) as a source of external financing in the private sector. This study aims to investigate whether FDI contributes to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Africa. We analyse a sample of 44 African countries regarding their SDG scores and apply a multivariate analysis and an ordered probit model. Our results indicate that the presence of foreign investors positively influences SDG scores. However, although FDI has a positive impact in areas such as basic infrastructure, clean water, sanitation, and renewable energy, some adverse environmental consequences may occur for host countries. In fact, the relationship between FDI and the probability of achieving SDG13 (Climate action) is negative. This study contributes to the literature on sustainable development and can be useful for decision-makers in developing investment plans to support the achievement of SDGs. Furthermore, we provide evidence of a positive influence of FDI on the SDGs, which might encourage further investments in Africa. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
