TI Off-design performance of molten salt-driven Rankine cycles and its
   impact on the optimal dispatch of concentrating solar power systems
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB This paper presents a model for improving off-design performance predictions for molten salt-driven Rankine power cycles, such as in concentrating solar power tower applications. The model predicts cycle off-design performance under various boundary conditions, including molten salt inlet temperature, mass flow rate, and ambient temperature. The model is validated using industry performance data and benchmarked with results from the literature. A complete concentrating solar power plant, inclusive of solar heliostat field and receiver, is then considered, by implementing the Rankine cycle off-design performance results into the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's System Advisor Model software, which includes a tool that determines optimal power production schedules. The work improves upon the current System Advisor Model by updating off-design performance characteristics. A case study demonstrates the impact of cycle off-design behavior on annual performance for a stand-alone concentrating solar power system and a concentrating solar power-photovoltaic hybrid system. In addition, we demonstrate how cycle off-design performance influences optimal operator dispatch decisions and, thereby, overall system design and economics. We conclude that off-design cycle performance impacts "optimal" sub-system sizing, especially for a concentrating solar power-photovoltaic hybrid configuration in which concentrating solar power must dispatch in conjunction with photovoltaic generation.

TI Using concentrating-solar-power plants as economic carbon-free capacity
   resources
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT-X
AB Deep decarbonization of electricity systems raises concerns about the need for generating capacity that can maintain reliable energy supply. Given this concern, we explore the ability of concentrating-solar-power plants with thermal energy storage to provide a carbon-free source of such capacity. We develop an approach to assessing the capacity contribution of concentrating-solar-power plants that considers future systems. Such considerations are important, because of potential differences in net-load patterns compared to today (e.g., due to higher renewable-energy penetrations). Using historical data spanning an 18-year period, we demonstrate that concentrating-solar-power plants with thermal energy storage can provide this necessary capacity with little impact on their financial viability. We examine the impact of myopic decisions and imperfect foresight of future system conditions on the operation of concentrating-solar-power plants and the resultant impact on their capacity contributions. We find that imperfect foresight can have limited impacts on such a use of concentrating-solar-power plants, so long as proper forecasting techniques are developed and used. Overall, our work shows that concentrating-solar-power plants with thermal energy storage may have a role to play in delivering reliable electricity supply in a decarbonized energy system.

AB Concentrated solar power technology is a renewable energy power generation technology that can achieve friendly grid connection and effective peak shaving at the same time. Based on the characteristics of the synchronous generator of the concentrated solar power unit, this paper first studies the reactive voltage control mode of the concentrated solar power plant, proposes the control technology of the generator terminal voltage and the high-voltage side bus voltage of the concentrated solar power plant, and analyzes the transient response characteristics of the generator terminal voltage of the concentrated solar power unit and its support capacity for the grid voltage under fault conditions. Through the excitation control system of synchronous generator, the generator terminal voltage of the power station can be controlled, and the bus voltage at the high voltage side of the power station can also be controlled, realizing the reactive voltage support for the power grid. On this basis, a power system example of wind power-photovoltaic-solar thermal combined power generation sent to the load center is designed to study the transient reactive power and voltage support capacity of solar thermal power stations. The research shows that the generator terminal voltage changes after the disturbance, but it can quickly adjust to the reference value under the condition of small disturbances such as voltage and load; Under the large disturbance of short circuit fault, the generator terminal voltage changes sharply, but it can finally stabilize and adjust to the reference value under the control of excitation system.

TI Thermal Spray Processes in Concentrating Solar Power Technology
SO METALS
AB Solar power is a sustainable and affordable source of energy, and has gained interest from academies, companies, and government institutions as a potential and efficient alternative for next-generation energy production. To promote the penetration of solar power in the energy market, solar-generated electricity needs to be cost-competitive with fossil fuels and other renewables. Development of new materials for solar absorbers able to collect a higher fraction of solar radiation and work at higher temperatures, together with improved design of thermal energy storage systems and components, have been addressed as strategies for increasing the efficiency of solar power plants, offering dispatchable energy and adapting the electricity production to the curve demand. Manufacturing of concentrating solar power components greatly affects their performance and durability and, thus, the global efficiency of solar power plants. The development of viable, sustainable, and efficient manufacturing procedures and processes became key aspects within the breakthrough strategies of solar power technologies. This paper provides an outlook on the application of thermal spray processes to produce selective solar absorbing coatings in solar tower receivers and high-temperature protective barriers as strategies to mitigate the corrosion of concentrating solar power and thermal energy storage components when exposed to aggressive media during service life.

However, on Brazil the technology is still under development, and even though there are not commercial power plants installed, many studies and some research projects are being developed to establish the feasibility of this technology. This paper presents a general analysis of CSP economic aspects influenced by its technical parameters, according to simulation of two most developed systems used worldwide: Parabolic Trough Collector - PTC and Heliostat Field Collector - HFC. The simulation considered five variables that influence the total cost of the plant and their sensibility according to CSP technologies. This study shows that Brazil has a great potential for the insertion of this technology in its electric matrix.

TI A Review of Ammonia-Based Thermochemical Energy Storage for
   Concentrating Solar Power
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE
AB The development of a thermochemical energy storage system based on ammonia, for use with concentrating solar power is discussed in this paper. This is one of a number of storage options for concentrating solar power, including molten-salt storage, which is already operating commercially. The ammonia storage development has involved prototype solar receiver/reactors operated in conjunction with a 20-m(2) dish concentrator, as well as closed-loop storage demonstrations. An ongoing computational study deals with the performance of an ammonia receiver for a 489-m(2) dish concentrator. The ammonia storage system could employ industry-standard ammonia synthesis converters for superheated steam production. A standard 1500 t/day ammonia synthesis reactor would suffice for a 10-MWe baseload plant with 330 large 489-m(2) dishes. At this stage, an updated economic assessment of the system would be valuable.

TI Application of spectral beam splitting using Wavelength-Selective
   filters for Photovoltaic/Concentrated solar power hybrid plants
SO APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING
AB To maximize the utilization of solar energy, this study focuses on the investigation of a realistic performance of a photovoltaic/concentrated solar power hybrid using a developed wavelength-selective filter. The hybrid system is proposed for the modification and improvement of the performance of the currently operating solar electric generating station VI parabolic trough plant in California, USA. In the hybrid, photovoltaic system converts only the useful wavelengths after the splitting of the solar irradiance by the wavelength-selective filter, and the concentrated solar power uses the remaining wavelengths. Most relevant studies presented the hybrid performance using hypothetical filters instead of realization. Even studies utilizing realized filters have only used annual mean values to assess hybrid performance. Due to the intrinsic properties in real filters, the hybrid performance can be varied accordingly throughout the day and year. As a result, by presenting annual performance based on the measured optical properties of a real filter, this study intends to address this research gap. According to the findings, the proposed hybrid performed 9% better than the solar electric generating station VI concentrated solar power. The hybrid system was also 4% more efficient than the virtual photovoltaic-alone system. The proposed hybrid's Levelized Cost of Electricity is 9% lower than the solar electric generating station VI concentrated solar power. Even if the proposed filter accounts for 18.4% annual optical loss from the incident solar power, the proposed hybrid is still very promising for retrofitting and enhancing aged concentrated solar power plants.

TI A critical review on the development and challenges of concentrated
   solar power technologies
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS
AB Solar energy is considered to be one of the most promising renewable and sustainable energy sources. Two key technologies such as photovoltaic and concentrated solar power are mainly used to convert solar radiation, out of which photovoltaic directly converts solar radiation into electricity, while concentrated solar power technology converts solar radiation both into heat and electricity. The key advantages of concentrated solar power technology over photovoltaic is its capability of storing heat energy which can be utilised in the absence of sunlight, overcoming the limitation of the intermittent nature of solar power. Currently, the cost for the concentrated solar power with storage is about 9.0 cent/kWh (same as commercial photovoltaic system), which is expected to drop at similar to 5.0 cent/kWh by 2030. Besides four mainstream concentrated solar power technologies, this paper reviewed the application of concentrated solar power in thermolysis, thermochemical cycle, hydrocarbon cracking, reforming and solar gasification. Based on the literature review, this study has outlined the key challenges and prospects of concentrated solar power technologies. The main challenge in thermolysis is the requirement of very high temperature, while the thermochemical cycle is inefficient. Solar thermal cracking, reforming, and gasification integrate carbonaceous fuel to produce synthesis gas and hydrogen and therefore are not emission-free. The concentrated solar power technologies require further development and cost reductions before they can be scaled up to have a meaningful impact on renewable energy targets towards 2050.

AB Due to the growing motivation of countries to use renewable energy, instead of fossil fuels, for the production of electricity, the number of solar power plants had an increase in recent times. The sun as a renewable source is used by the Concentrated Solar Power systems (CSP) to achieve this goal. This process results in a considerable amount of concentrated solar radiation (visible light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation) inside and in the neighborhood of the installations. Some previous studies have addressed the possible risks for health of workers in environments where they perform activities in outdoors exposed to solar radiation. The overall purpose of this paper is to provide information about the environmental conditions in facilities using CSP technology, the effects of solar radiation in humans and the methods for the risk assessment in this type of facilities.

AB Electrification ratio in Indonesia by the end of 2011 was about 74%. This means that 26% of the population does not have electricity. Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) is developing small scale concentrated solar power plant using Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) that can be operated in remote, isolated areas or small islands. Some constraints of electrification in these areas are the cost of integrated grid construction is relatively high, the limitation of energy resources and the population of the area is relatively small. Reseach in concentrated solar power (parabolic trough) has been carried out by LIPI since 2010. A stand-alone power unit ("off grid") by utilizing local energy resources, especially renewable energy, will be constructed by LIPI. A hybrid system of solar thermal and biomass energy can be a suitable choice to solve the electricity problem in the area. This option is based on the relatively good potential intensity of solar energy in some areas of Indonesia which is daily average intensity is about 4.8 kWh/m(2)/day. This paper presents a series of activities in developing a concentrated solar power plant which includes the conceptual design of the small-scale system with the capacity of 10kW.

AB Greenhouse gas emission increased in recent years and it is the main reason for global warming. To overcome the challenges, sustainable and renewable energy sources are required. In this paper, an economic analysis fulfilled for 1.2 megawatt photovoltaic power plant with different tracking systems in several cities of Iran by RETScreen software. Moreover, results compared with the same capacity hybrid of concentrated solar power and fossil fuel power plant under several scenarios. The results show that the two-axis tracker photovoltaic power plant has 48% more capacity factor than a fixed state. Also, using the tracking system for the photovoltaic power plant and a thirty percent reduction in capital expenditure for the concentrated solar power system decreased the levelized cost of electricity by 21% and 28%, respectively. The minimum levelized cost of electricity is achieved US$ 0.084/kWh. Also, it was found that the concentrated solar power system reduces greenhouses gas emission two times more than the same capacity of photovoltaic. Finally, the concentrated solar power has a better economic, environmental and technical performance than the photovoltaic system in the future.

AB This study proposes a model predictive controller for concentrating solar power (CSP) plants. Few studies have considered a thermal energy storage system and a power system. The proposed model predictive controller maintains the heat transfer fluid temperature by manipulating its mass flow rate and stabilizes the power frequency by balancing power supply and demand. In the case of the direct normal irradiance is low, the thermal energy storage system makes up for the shortage of thermal. The simulation using actual solar direct normal irradiance data and electricity demand data shows the proposed controller contributes to stable operation of CSP plants.

AB The development of newer technologies in concentrating solar power (CSP) plants, particularly plants using dish Stirling systems, as well as changes in the design of photovoltaic (PV) inverters is creating new challenges in the design of low- and medium-voltage collector systems for large solar power plants. Furthermore, interconnect requirements for reactive power, voltage, and ramp rate control and the characteristics of solar power require unique solutions for optimal plant design. To ensure large solar plants can be connected successfully to the grid without impacting grid stability or reliability, the design process must include the development of suitable models of these plants for transient and dynamic simulation. Simulation tools and models can then be used to determine special requirements to deal with issues such as daily plant energization, low voltage ride-through, temporary overvoltage and feeder grounding, etc. The provision of dynamic and static reactive power and the optimization thereof for application at either low, medium, or high voltage and the control issues associated with plant-wide reactive power and voltage control are also key issues in the design.
   The presentation will focus on the key technical issues and design optimization of large solar power plants.

TI Preliminary Study on the Application of Concentrated Solar Power in
   Metallurgy of Titanium
SO CHEMENGINEERING
AB The applicability of concentrated solar power for metallurgy of titanium is discussed based on preliminary experimental works performed at Plataforma Solar de Almeria Spain, using solar furnace SF40 under protective argon atmosphere. As a starting material, titanium powder was used. The possibility of melting titanium compacts on yttria stabilized zirconia mat was investigated, and the effect of density and size of different green compacts was studied. It was observed that the time to achieve melting point is very short when concentrated solar power is used. The obtained results are expected to be similar for titanium sponge from which titanium powder is processed. After optimization of processing parameters, this will probably lead to a significant decrease of carbon footprint in the titanium ingots and castings production.

TI 4-E (energy-exergy-environmental-economic) analyses of line-focusing
   stand-alone concentrating solar power plants
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOW-CARBON TECHNOLOGIES
AB In this study, energy-exergy-environmental-economic (4-E) analyses of stand-alone line-focusing concentrating solar power plants are carried out for different plant capacities ranging from 1 to 50 MWe. Solar power plants based on concentrating power technologies are used to harness the solar radiation effectively. Among the solar power technologies, line-focusing concentrating systems such as linear Fresnel reflector (LFR) and parabolic trough collector (PTC) are simple in design and cost-effective with high dispatchability. The energy and exergy efficiencies of various components of the solar field and power block are determined. The overall energy and exergy efficiencies of 50-MWe LFR power plants are estimated as 12.17 and 17.21% and 23.16 and 32.76%, respectively, for the PTC power plant. The results show that a maximum energy loss occurs in the solar field and power block for LFR and PTC power plants respectively, and a maximum exergy loss occurs in the solar field for both power plants. The analyses of solar power plants have been carried out to estimate the environmental benefits; the results showed that a 1-MWe stand-alone line-focusing concentrating solar power plant can save 1813 tonnes of CO2, 12.52 tonnes of SO2, 6.23 tonnes of NOx and 0.98 tonnes of particulate matter annually compared with that of an Indian subcritical coal power plant. The levelized electricity cost for the LFR-and PTC-based stand-alone solar power plant varies from INR 14.77 to INR 10.19 and INR 14.7 to INR 8.48 for the plant capacities that vary from 1 to 50 MWe.

When solar power was applied to the TEG, solar energy is concentrated by PMMA lens firstly. The concentrated energy is absorbed as heat energy through phase-change of phase change material (PCM). And then, the liquid PCM lens focuses energy on the TEG. After removing energy source, the latent heat in PCM is released. Therefore, the proposed TEG generates energy steadily.

AB There are two ways by which solar energy can be harnessed viz. solar Photo-Voltaic (PV) and Concentrating Solar Power (CSP). This paper focuses on the parameters required for the commissioning of solar power plants in India using these technologies. The key parameters have been identified through the literature review and discussion with the experts. The parameters thus obtained, are classified under PV and CSP technologies and then categorized into technical and economical parameters. A survey is conducted to understand the perceptions of Indian key players in the area of solar energy and to rank forty one identified parameters. Analysis of survey shows that location of the site and direct investment cost are the highest preferred technical and economical parameters respectively. The results of this study will help decision makers and policy makers of solar technologies in India. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Annual simulation of photovoltaic retrofits within existing parabolic
   trough concentrating solar powerplants
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB Solar power for electricity production comes from either photovoltaics or concentrating solar power plants. The former has seen rapid growth and expansion due to the rapid fall in global prices, while the latter has seen moderate growth due to ability to cheaply store thermal energy for later use. Hybridization, or combining photovoltaics with concentrating solar power represents a potential way for lowering cost while enabling long term storage. Over 5 GW of capacity exist worldwide using parabolic trough style technology for concentrating solar power which presents a unique option for optimization in the form of a photovoltaic retrofit. While it is possible to analyze the performance with detailed physics models, it is necessary to create a model that can handle simulating the plant level performance to fully understand the potential performance. Here, the first utility scale plant level model of a hybrid photovoltaic-concentrating solar power plant is developed. The model is applied to existing concentrating solar power plants around the world utilizing RP-3 mirrors without thermal energy storage to understand the impact on electricity production. Model results indicate that the photovoltaic retrofit can increase yearly electricity production by up to 30% for plants with solar multiples exceeding 1.5, and that increasing the fraction of solar energy reflected further increases the yield. The increased electrical production declines as the plant solar multiple is decreased. The minimum LCOE observed was $0.07/kWh for plants with larger solar multiple and fraction of solar energy reflected to the PV is 50% of the total aperture.

TI Environmental impacts of large-scale CSP plants in northwestern China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS
AB Several concentrated solar power demonstration plants are being constructed, and a few commercial plants have been announced in northwestern China. However, the mutual impacts between the concentrated solar power plants and their surrounding environments have not yet been addressed comprehensively in literature by the parties involved in these projects. In China, these projects are especially important as an increasing amount of low carbon electricity needs to be generated in order to maintain the current economic growth white simultaneously lessening pollution. In this study, the authors assess the potential environmental impacts of large-scale concentrated solar power plants. Specifically, the water use intensity, soil erosion and soil temperature are quantitatively examined. It was found that some of the impacts are favorable, while some impacts are negative in relation to traditional power generation techniques and some need further research before they can be reasonably appraised. In quantitative terms, concentrated solar power plants consume about 4000 L MW-1 h(-1) of water if wet cooling technology is used, and the collectors lead to the soil temperature changes of between 0.5 and 4 degrees C; however, it was found that the soil erosion is dramatically alleviated. The results of this study are helpful to decision-makers in concentrated solar power site selection and regional planning. Some conclusions of this study are also valid for large-scale photovoltaic plants.

TI Water and Cost Reduction from the Application of EDS to Facilitate Water
   Free Cleaning in Concentrated Solar Power
SO MRS ADVANCES
AB Soiling in solar power generation will be a significant obstacle to its growth if a water free method cannot be found. Demand for water in arid regions will increase as more solar power generation is built, requiring more water to clean the optical surface, in turn increasing the price of water. This will lead to increased operating costs for solar power generation, and potentially disputes in locations where water is scarce. The electrodynamic screen (EDS) can reduce soiling and contribute to restoring the optical surface without the use of water. Periodic cleaning will still be required, but at reduced frequency, leading to a significant reduction in the consumption of water. In this model, it was found that a 250 MW concentrated solar power plant would have a 74% reduction in water given current laboratory production uncertainties. This indicates that EDS technology could decrease both the operating cost and the water use for solar generation plants.

AB Concentrating solar power plant coupling with energy storage is a new and emerging technology, which can solve two issues, that is, low flux density and intermittent of solar energy. Heat transfer characteristics of the storage tank in this system have a key effect on the system's efficiency and cost. In this article, the heat transfer performance of a phase change thermal storage tank has been proposed, and the temperature distribution and liquid fraction of phase change material in the tank has numerically been investigated. The results show that the temperature increases with the increasing charge time. The results also show that there is a phase change process at the charge time of 200 min, and no phase change for the charge time of 250 and 300 min. The results of this article can provide a reference for future design and optimal operation of the storage tank in concentrating solar power plant.

This review discusses the current status of heat transfer fluid, which is one of the critical components for storing and transferring thermal energy in concentrating solar power systems. Various types of heat transfer fluids including air, water/steam, thermal oils, organic fluids, molten-salts and liquid metals are reviewed in detail, particularly regarding the melting temperature, thermal stability limit and corrosion issues. Stainless steels and nickel based alloys are the typical piping and container materials for heat transfer fluids. Stability of the stainless steels and alloys while in contact with heat transfer fluids is very important for the longevity of concentrating solar power systems. Corrosion properties of stainless steels and nickel based alloys in different heat transfer fluids are discussed in terms of corrosion rates. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) is one of the promising renewable energy technologies, several technical and economic challenges should be addressed. One of the major issues associated with Concentrated Solar Power technologies is the reliability limitation of the plant in the stand-alone configuration. Therefore, Concentrated Solar Power systems can be integrated with either thermal energy storage (ILS) or a fossil-fuelled power assist FFPA). However, initial and maintenance costs and emission production are the main challenges for the developing countries. Integrating biofuel/biogas with CSP increases the renewability while solar irradiation is in absent. The paper main objective is to perform a feasibility study of integrating a biofuel based gas turbine power units in a Concentrated Solar Power plant for electricity and water cogeneration. The study includes the thermodynamics analysis and assessment of three biofuels, namely, Jatropha oil, castor oil, and palm oil. In addition, a cost lifecycle, sensitivity, and Monte Carlo analyses were performed. The results showed that Castor oil had a better performance in terms of efficiency and carbon dioxide emissions with a maximum daily freshwater production of 181,000 m(3) /day. The proposed integration resulted in a levelized cost of water that is lower than the water tariff in the UAE by $1.39/m(3) with a payback period of 5 years.

TI Techno-economic assessment of performance-enhanced parabolic trough
   receiver in concentrated solar power plants
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB Solar-to-thermal conversion efficiency of the parabolic trough collector significantly degrades at high operating temperatures, which exerts seriously negative effects on the development of parabolic trough collectors. To solve this knotty problem, based on the theory of the negative thermal-flux region, a novel parabolic trough solar receiver with a radiation shield was proposed, manufactured, and tested. In this framework, the proposed solar receiver is employed in the concentrated solar power plants using solar salt as the heat transfer fluid to analyze its feasibility in real solar power plants. In this study, the mathematical models of heat collection and economic assessment are established, and the simulation results yield a good agreement with the experimental data. The techno-economic performances of the solar power plants installing the proposed solar receivers in three typical areas under different installed capacities and thermal storage capacities are comprehensively investigated. The results demonstrate that the proposed solar receiver has a great potential for significant enhancement of the techno-economic performance of the solar power plant. The solar power plant with the proposed solar receivers located in Dunhuang can effectively improve the annual net electrical energy production by 9.77%, reduce the levelized cost of energy by 8.67%.

AB Solar energy is one of the main alternatives to carbon-intensive sources of energy. However, limited attention has been devoted to small-scale (<10 kW) concentrated solar power systems, which are capable to provide high-temperature heat to buildings or industrial processes. In this work, we describe the concentrated solar power system (7.4 kW thermal power) with dual axis solar tracker installed at Politecnico di Torino. The solar concentrator system is coupled to a sensible heat storage by a plate heat exchanger. Here, we provide preliminary data on the system efficiency and compare it to typical values obtained by flat plates or evacuated tubes collectors. The generated high-temperature thermal power is suitable for both domestic hot water, heating and cooling, and industrial purposes. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The paper discusses the design options for a concentrated solar power plant in Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia. The specific conditions, in terms of weather and sun irradiance, are considered, including sand and dust, humidity, temperature and proximity to the sea. Different real-world experiences are then considered, to understand the best design to adapt to the specific conditions. Concentrated solar power solar tower with thermal energy storage such as Crescent Dunes, or concentrated solar power solar tower without thermal energy storage but boost by natural gas combustion such as Ivanpah are disregarded for the higher costs, the performances well below the design, and the extra difficulties for the specific location such as temperatures, humidity and sand/dust that suggest the use of an enclosed trough. Concentrated solar power parabolic trough without thermal energy storage such as Genesis or Mojave, of drastically reduced cost and much better performances, do not provide however the added value of thermal energy storage and dispatchability that can make interesting Concentrated solar power vs. alternatives such as wind and solar photovoltaic. Thus, the concentrated solar power parabolic trough with thermal energy storage of Solana, of intermediate costs and best performances, albeit slightly lower than the design values, is selected. This design will have to be modified to enclosed trough and adopt a Seawater, Once-trough condenser. Being the development peculiar, a small scale pilot plant is suggested before a full-scale development.

TI The potential of concentrating solar power in South Africa
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB In this paper all provinces of South Africa with a good potential for the implementation of large-scale concentrating solar power plants are identified using geographic information systems. The areas are assumed suitable if they get sufficient sunshine, are close enough to transmission lines, are flat enough, their respective vegetation is not under threat and they have a suitable land use profile. Various maps are created showing the solar resource, the slope, areas with "least threatened" vegetation, proximity to transmission lines and areas suitable for the installation of large concentrating solar power plants. Assuming the installation of parabolic trough plants, it is found that the identified suitable areas could accommodate plants with a nominal capacity of 510.3 GW in the Northern Cape, 25.3 GW in the Free State, 10.5GW in the Western Cape and 1.6GW in the Eastern Cape, which gives a total potential nominal capacity of 547.6 GW for the whole country.

AB This study seeks to assess the potential of utilizing Concentrated Solar Power for electricity generation in Zimbabwe. Data from 26 meteorological stations which are widely distributed around the country was used to map the distribution of solar radiation. Geographic information systems were employed to locate sites with potential for installing concentrating solar power plants. Areas with good potential were identified by using the following assessment factors: direct normal irradiance (DNI), proximity to transmission lines and water bodies, flatness of the area and the vulnerability of vegetation and wild life. After considering all the assessment factors, a total area of 250000 km(2) was found to be suitable. If only 10% of the suitable land area is used and the technology with the least efficiency (8-10%) is adopted, about 71.4 GW Can be generated. The projected power generation is about thirty times the current power demand of the country. (C) 2014 International Energy Initiative. Published by Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

When comparing conventional solar electric generators with this system, we have the advantage that it is compact and lightweight and can be easily assembled and used as low-cost power generation equipment. For this system, we perform I(V) measurements and use fit models to accurately extract the model parameters. This is all in a standalone, robust, and simultaneous fit of three equations, through the global optimization method called Cross-Entropy. This is a robust method that had never been applied to extract parameters in a thermoelectric generation.

SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS
AB A global transition towards more sustainable production and consumption systems is underway. This transition processes particularly visible in energy systems, where modern renewables, majorly solar photovoltaic and wind power, accounted for around 10 %iof global power production in 2020. In this context, concentrated solar power technologies are seen to be one of the most promising ways to generate electric power in coming decades. However, due to unstable and intermittent nature of solar energy availability, one of the key factors that determine the development of concentrated solar power technology is the integration of efficient and cost-effective heat transfer fluid and thermal energy storage systems. The current commercial concentrated solar power plants are based Rankine Cycle using steam turbines for converting solar thermal energy into electrical energy. The operating temperature of the steam turbine is limited by the solar salt heat transfer fluid ati565 degrees C, resulting in a net design point efficiency of 42-45 %. So one of the main challenges for the next-Gen concentrated solar power technologies is the development of alternative heat transfer fluid and thermal energy storage ma-terials with lower costs that could Work at temperatures higher than 565 degrees C of the current nitrate-based molten salt mixtures. In this context, over the past ten years, interest in solid particle receivers have been proposed to overcome current working temperature limits, since the particle media can be stable for temperatures close to 1000 degrees C. This paper presents a comprehensive review on solid particle solar receiver technologies for concen-trated solar power application and an update of the latest developments of different technologies of particle receiver systems that are commercially available or under investigation. It intends to understand and explain the foundations of the innovative concepts, future research directions and strategies developed over the past 10 years to tune the engineering and thermal sciences of particle receiver systems. Insight into classes of solar particle receiver system with details like their geometrical configurations, design parameters, physical properties, operational issues, cost, technology readiness level, suitability to concentrated solar power application is provided.

AB With the improvement of energy structure, large scale grid connection of renewable energy, as a new technology for absorbing solar energy, concentrating solar power generation uses a thermal storage system to make it a schedulable resource without increasing the uncertainty of the system. This paper considers the energy transfer process and the thermal energy conversion efficiency among the concentrating solar modules, and constructs their basic operation models respectively. Through the design of different operating modes, the examples are simulated. The values of key parameters are taken into account to optimize the operation results. The impact of the analysis shows that concentrating solar power plants have certain advantages in dealing with solar energy uncertainty, prolonging production cycles, improving the utilization efficiency of heat storage tanks, and economic efficiency.

TI Dynamic corrosion testing of metals in solar salt for concentrated solar
   power
SO SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS
AB Potassium nitrate and sodium nitrate in mixing proportion of KNO3-NaNO3 40-60 wt% (also called solar salt) has been successfully used for over a decade as heat storage medium for concentrated solar power parabolic-trough collector plants at temperatures up to 400 degrees C. At temperatures of 560 degrees C, reached in state-of-the-art solar tower systems, corrosion of metallic components in contact with solar salt can become an issue and has caused leaks and plant shut-downs in recently built tower projects. While the corrosion rates of several materials have been determined for different temperatures in static molten salt immersion experiments, there is a lack of corrosion data for dynamic in-service conditions. In this work, a dynamic corrosion test has been conducted on 19 different material types including protective coatings, mimicking flow-rate, temperature gradient and draining of inservice operation of a receiver in a concentrated solar power tower. The measured corrosion rates are presented and compared to static corrosion tests reported in literature.

TI Enhancing Sustainable Development and Regional Integration through
   Electrification by Solar Power: The Case of Six East African States
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The need to enhance energy access has led to the growing recognition of renewable energy sources in sustainable regional development. However, solar power, one of the less polluting renewable energy sources, continues to receive little attention in some developing countries seeking balanced development. Through a review of the literature, this paper examines the need for regional electrification by solar power and suggests measures to integrate regional energy policies and processes for balanced development. The authors find that there are many social, economic, and environmental benefits associated with using solar power. For instance, solar energy creates employment opportunities, reduces a country's foreign dependence, improves freedom of choice, improves a country's gross domestic product (GDP) and human development index (HDI), and is associated with improved environmental conservation. The region of East Africa is keen to reap these sustainable development gains through solar power electrification. The establishment of the East African Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency constitutes an important melting pot for diverse renewable energy policies, in addition to confirming a commitment to solar power deployment. Moreover, some East African Community (EAC) states appear to be progressing faster towards regional solar power projects, while other states are lagging due to complex contextual challenges. However, the overall contribution of solar power to sustainable development remains low, as individual states appear to be focused on developing their national solar power projects. Nonetheless, there is great hope for regional development through shared solar power development if EAC states implement a number of regulatory and voluntary interventions.

TI Incorporating Concentrating Solar Power into High Renewables Penetrated
   Power System: A Chance-Constrained Stochastic Unit Commitment Analysis
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB High renewables penetrated power systems would be greatly influenced by the uncertainty of variable renewable energy such as wind power and photovoltaic power. Unlike wind and photovoltaic plant, concentrating solar power with thermal energy storage has similar dispatchable characteristics as conventional thermal unit. Besides, thermal energy storage could support the coordinated operation of concentrating solar power with an electrical heater, which can be employed to convert surplus electricity in the grid into thermal power stored in thermal energy storage for further utilization. In this paper, concentrating solar power is incorporated into a chance-constrained two-stage stochastic unit commitment model. The model considers the energy and reserve services of concentrating solar power and the uncertainty of renewables. The proposed method is employed to assess the role of a concentrating solar power station with thermal energy storage and an electrical heater to provide grid flexibility in high renewables penetrated power systems. Numerical studies are performed on a modified IEEE 24-bus system to validate the viability of the proposed method for the day-ahead stochastic scheduling. The results demonstrate the economic and reliable value of concentrating solar power station to the improvement of unit commitment schedule, to the mitigation of wind uncertainty and photovoltaic uncertainty, and to the reduction of traditional unit reserve requirement. It is concluded that concentrating solar power with thermal energy storage and an electrical heater is effective in promoting the further penetration of renewables.

TI Pilot Low-Cost Concentrating Solar Power Systems Deployment in
   Sub-Saharan Africa: A Case Study of Implementation Challenges
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Electricity is one of the most crucial resources that drives any given nation's growth and development. The latest Sustainable Development Goals report indicates Africa still has a high deficit in electricity generation. Concentrating solar power seems to be a potential option to fill the deficit. That is because most of the components of concentrating solar power plants are readily available on the African market at affordable prices, and there are qualified local persons to build the plants. Pilot micro-concentrating solar power plants have been implemented in Sub-Saharan Africa and have shown promising results that could be expanded and leveraged for large-scale electricity generation. An assessment of a pilot concentrating solar power plant in the sub-region noticed one noteworthy obstacle that is the failure of the tracking system to reduce the operating energy cost of running the tracking control system and improve the multifaceted heliostat focusing behavior. This paper highlights the energy situation and the current development in concentrating solar power technology research in Africa. The paper also presents a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art solar tracking systems for central receiver systems to illustrate the current direction of research regarding the design of low-cost tracking systems in terms of computational complexity, energy consumption, and heliostat alignment accuracy.

TI Techno-environ-economic assessment of photovoltaic and CSP with storage
   systems in China and Egypt under various climatic conditions
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB The goal of this research is to conduct a techno-environ-economic assessment of the two primary electrical energy generation technologies-photovoltaic and concentrating solar power with the storage system. The comparative technical analysis is based on solar to electrical efficiency, electrical output, capacity utilization factor, and land use factor, whereas the financial comparison considers factors like net present value, net capital cost, levelized cost of electricity, payback period, and greenhouse gas emission. The present simulation is carried out utilizing System Advisor Model software. The findings show that while installing photovoltaic power plants in China is the ideal option, establishing concentrating solar power plants in Egyptian meteorological conditions is the optimum alternative. Moreover, the results indicate that by comparing the best scenario for a photovoltaic plant with the best scenario for a concentrated solar power plant, the latter generates 33.34% more electricity. The findings also demonstrate that concentrated solar power plants use 48.7% of their capacity utilization factor, as opposed to photovoltaic plants, which only use 29.2% of their capacity utilization factor. Furthermore, the results imply the ability of concentrated solar power and photovoltaic to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 98.1% and 95.8%, respectively.

TI Comparison of hybridizing options for solar heat, biomass and heat
   storage for electricity generation in Spain
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB Diurnal and seasonal variations of direct solar energy circumscribe locations suitable for sole use of concentrated solar power for electricity generation, whereas to generate electricity at night and during winter months, bio-mass systems can be used that incur fuel expenditures and may encounter fuel supply discontinuities. Combining solar heat, biomass conversion and heat storage in a hybrid electricity generation plant may overcome the limitations of sole use of any one of these energy sources in specific geographic and/or economic conditions. In this work standalone biomass, hybrid concentrated solar power-biomass and hybrid concentrated solar power-biomass-thermal energy storage power generation systems are simulated. With an 80% plant capacity factor for each power plant configuration, levelized cost of electricity is calculated using the simulated fuel consumption. In a comparative analysis, the hybrid concentrated solar power-biomass power plant is found to be an eco-nomically viable option having 25% lower levelized cost of electricity compared to a hybrid concentrated solar power-biomass-thermal energy storage power plant in a particular scenario considered.

TI Performance modeling and techno-economic analysis of a modular
   concentrated solar power tower with latent heat storage
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB In this paper, we present performance simulations and techno-economic analysis of a modular dispatchable solar power tower. Using a heliostat field and power block three orders of magnitude smaller than conventional solar power towers, our unique configuration locates thermal storage and a power block directly on a tower receiver. To make the system dispatchable, a valved thermosyphon controls heat flow from a latent heat thermal storage tank to a Stirling engine. The modular design results in minimal balance of system costs and enables high deployment rates with a rapid realization of economies of scale. In this new analysis, we combine performance simulations with techno-economic analysis to evaluate levelized cost of electricity, and find that the system has potential for cost-competitiveness with natural gas peaking plants and alternative dispatchable renewables.

TI Optimal offering strategy for a concentrating solar power plant
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB This paper provides a methodology to build offering curves for a concentrating solar power plant. This methodology takes into account the uncertainty in the thermal production from the solar field and the volatility of market prices. The solar plant owner is a price-taker producer that participates in a pool-based electricity market with the aim of maximizing its expected profit. To enhance the value of the concentrating solar power plant, a molten salt heat storage is considered, which allows producing electricity during periods without availability of the solar resource. To derive offering curves, a mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed, which is robust from the point of view of the uncertainty associated with the thermal production of the solar field and stochastic from the point of view of the uncertain market prices.

Three types of GIS-based studies, including those on solar radiation mapping, site evaluation, and potential assessment, were considered to elucidate the role of GISs as problem-solving tools in relation to photovoltaic and concentrated solar power systems for the conversion of solar energy into electricity. The review was performed by classifying previous GIS-based studies into several subtopics according to the complexity of the employed GIS-based methods, the type of solar power conversion technology, or the scale of the study area. Because GISs are appropriate for handling geospatial data related to solar resource and site suitability conditions on various scales, the applications of GIS-based methods in solar power system planning and design could be expanded further.

Results show that both hybrid systems may deliver significantly higher energy output over the conventional Concentrated Solar Power plant, provided that several key parameters are optimized. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the two hybrid strategies investigated to the operating conditions, and to the characteristics of the solar cells used, are analyzed. In the light of these results, the main scientific and technological issues one should address to ensure optimal operation of these compact hybrid plants are finally discussed.

TI Evaluating the enablers in solar power developments in the current
   scenario using fuzzy DEMATEL: An Indian perspective
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Determining solar power initiatives and developments for a country as large as India is difficult due to the involvement of different enablers. The decisions of these enablers will influence the formulation of strategies to encourage solar power development in India. The present research work critically analyzes Indian solar power developments to recognize and to evaluate key enablers that will encourage greater usage in India's current scenario. A literature review that explores the Indian solar power sector is included, with a focus on need potential, and an examination of the key enablers. This work identifies sixteen solar power enablers based on relevant literature and experts' inputs. To evaluate and to categorize the recognized solar power development key enablers, a fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) based methodology is utilized. The fuzzy DEMATEL approach is useful in dealing with the inherent ambiguity involved in studying interrelationships among the evaluated enablers. Research findings suggest that Initiatives taken at the state level (E7) and Power sector reforms (E12) have significant influence in adopting and encouraging India's solar power development. In this research, the enablers' causal relationships and their interactions are examined, and the findings are useful to encourage solar power development initiatives and decisions.

TI Mapping concentrated solar power site suitability in Algeria
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB The investment in solar thermal power technologies has become increasingly attractive, despite their still perceived high costs. Algeria presented an ambitious plan for increasing the participation of renewable energy sources (RES) in the power system, with significant investments foreseen for solar power technologies. To achieve this objective, it is necessary to identify optimal sites for the implementation of these plants, as well as others where implementation is highly inadvisable from the economic, social, or environmental points of view. The main goal of this study is to present and apply a methodology to identify adequate locations for the installation of solar power plants in Algeria. The study addressed the particular case of concentrated solar power (CSP) and proposed a hybrid approach combining multi criteria decision making and Geographic Information System. The approach allowed mapping and visualizing unfeasible areas and ranking the feasible sites. The results showed that more than 51% of the territory of the country is unfeasible for the implementation of CSP, mainly due to criteria related to topographic aspects, water availability, and distance to the grid. The results demonstrated that relying only on Direct Normal Irradiation (DNI) values may result in a reductionist vision for energy planning and thus other criteria can play a fundamental role in the decision process. The model allowed also to identify the best regions for CSP investment and opens routes for more detailed studies for the exact site selection. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The main challenge of solar power generation is its high cost compared to traditional power supply. Concentrating solar power generating is one of them direction for decreasing the cost and capital investment. Fresnel lenses show remarkable advance among various concentrators. Linear Fresnel lens is attractive because the concentrator uses less photovoltaic cells with one-dimension tracking system, thus decreases the cost of power generation. The prices of commercial Fresnel lenses are too high that resist the extensive use of Fresnel lenses in solar power concentrator. It is proved by experiments of various materials (such as PMMA, PC, PVC, silicon resin, glass-polymer) and processes (such as heat pressing, ultraviolet ray curing) that Fresnel lenses can be produced in large scale at low costs ranging from 10 yuan to hundreds yuan (RMB) per square meter. The usage of linear Fresnel lens in building is also discussed, such as natural lighting with/without solar power generation and the sunshading with concentrating solar power generation. The conclusion is that, low cost linear Fresnel lens can be used in modem building with the help of intelligent system to create a comfortable surrounding while generate low cost solar power. It is important that the design principle of building solar power generation should be complement of power at the peak demand periods rather than providing highest power supply of a year.

AB This study details a comprehensive storage-sizing methodology to allow a concentrating solar power plant to reliably integrate in the Cyprus power system which is classified as small and isolated. The need for providing a storage solution arises from the fact that large quantities of renewable energy sources may impose certain challenges on how isolated systems operate. Developing solutions to these challenges will enable higher penetrations of renewable generation sources on such systems and the future growth of renewable energy. To this extent, the methodology described in this study pertains to clear and explicit steps required to provide sufficient evidence toward the reliable integration of a large-scale solar-dependent plant through an appropriately sized battery energy storage system.

TI The value of concentrating solar power in ancillary services markets
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB Ancillary services, such as spinning reserves, can provide grid reliability and contribute to profitability of an energy resource. We exercise an existing dispatch optimization model to estimate the profitability of a concentrating solar power plant by incorporating the sale of spinning reserves in the ancillary service market using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's System Advisor Model to simulate operations within a 72-h rolling horizon framework. Assuming a price-taker approach with day-ahead energy and spinning reserve prices from both the California Independent System Operator and the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas, we find that selling spinning reserves in addition to electric energy increases plant profitability by up to 7% with perfect knowledge of day-ahead pricing and solar resource availability. This finding suggests that spinning reserve markets provide significant value streams to concentrating solar power plants that can leverage thermal energy storage to offer reliable production in the short-to-medium term.

SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Market reform, energy security and environmental protection are three primary energy policy goals of Turkish government. Although Turkey's abundant solar energy resources can directly address the government's energy policy goals, Turkey has not utilized solar power yet. Utilization of country's huge solar energy potential would decrease dependence on imported fossil fuels and contribute to fulfill environmental commitments. However, lack of regulatory and financial support for the development of solar power has considerably delayed the utilization of country's huge solar potential. The government has taken only modest steps to promote investment in solar power until the end of 2010 when a new feed-in tariff policy was adapted. Turkey's solar energy potential, PV technology status and prospect for concentrating solar power in Turkey have been explored in a number of studies; yet literature dealing with recent policy developments, associated investment environment and opportunities for solar power investors are limited. The aim of this paper is to set out the latest legal framework for investment in Turkey's emerging solar power market and to provide some guidelines to potential investors who appreciated country's huge solar energy potential.

TI Investigation into Off-Design Performance of a S-CO2 Turbine Based on
   Concentrated Solar Power
SO ENERGIES
AB Research on concentrated solar power (CSP) plants has been increasing in recent years. Supercritical carbon dioxide (S-CO2) has been applied to solar power plants due to its promising physical properties. S-CO2 has a relatively low critical temperature of 31.1 degrees C and owns high density in the supercritical region. Hence, it is a vital working fluid in the application of low temperature heat source and miniature power equipment. Due to the fact that solar power system has a constantly changing heat source according to season and weather, a satisfactory off-design performance is necessary for the turbine in a solar power system. In this work, a S-CO2 radial-inflow turbine based on CSP is designed. A thorough numerical analysis of the turbine is then performed. To investigate the off-design performance of this turbine, three types of nozzle profiles with different leading edge diameters are adopted. Mach number, temperature and pressure distribution are covered to present the off-design effect with different nozzle profiles. Moreover, the relation of output power, mass flow rate and efficiency with different leading edge diameter (LED) are analyzed. Results show that different LED has a vital influence on the aerodynamic characteristics and off-design performance of the S-CO2 turbine based on CSP. In addition, the designed turbine with LED = 4 mm can obtain the highest mass flow rate and output power. While the turbine with LED = 10 mm provides slightly better off-design efficiency for CSP plants.

AB This paper compares the evolution of Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) Plants. The study is based on a data of 240 CSP plants whose give us a roadmap of technical and economic characteristics of these systems. On the basis of this information collected from the literature, we benchmarked and analyzed the state of the CSP plants from 1982 to 2020. As statistical results show, 87% of CSP projects are located in Spain and USA, but other countries have invested in CSP since 2012. Solar technologies analyzed are Parabolic Trough collector (PTC), Solar Power Tower (SPT), Linear Fresnel Reflector (LFR), and Parabolic Dish Collector (PDC). As detailed data studies for Fresnel and Dish are hardly available, special attention was given to parabolic trough system. The progressive reduction in investment cost of PTC technology over time is presented, taking also into account the energy storage option. Our sensitivity analysis indicates that PTC with thermal oil and molten salt storage at 50 MW is the most mature system, but SPT plants are promising and might have the greatest potential by early 2018.

SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB Nowadays, solar energy is one of the most promising renewable energy sources that can effectively mitigate the current serious energy crisis and environmental pollution. To efficiently utilize solar energy and positively comply with the carbon neutrality policy, this research developed an efficient and environmentally-friendly improved He-CO2 cascade Brayton cycle for concentrated solar power, and then implemented a series of studies, including performance prediction, sensitivity analysis, and exergoeconomic optimization. After optimization, the most suitable condition was determined via a decision-making method, and the exergoeconomic performances of each subsystem and component were thoroughly investigated. Finally, the concentrated solar power system was comprehensively evaluated from the perspectives of thermodynamic and exergoeconomic performance. The numerical results imply that the system provides excellent thermodynamic and exergoeconomic performance with power, investment cost rate, and exergoeconomic factor of 697.75 kW, 33.09 $/h, and 77.48%, respectively, representing an exergy efficiency improvement of 3.51%-6.35% compared to similar concentrated solar power configurations. This research complies with the carbon neutrality policy, meets energy conservation and emission reduction requirements, and offers meaningful guidance for scientists who are committed to improving solar energy conversion and implementing exergoeconomic analysis.

AB Utilities currently require fast-responding natural gas turbines to stabilize the variability of renewable energy sources. Efficiency gains can be made by integrating these units into concentrated solar power plants that use air Brayton cycles. Operation of these hybrid power plants requires a combustor capable of accepting the high temperature air leaving the receiver. However, the next generation of solar receivers are expected to reach temperatures outside the capability of any existing combustion system. Autoignition and flashback risks complicate the use of conventional lean premixed injectors that are important for maintaining low NOx emissions. The challenge is particularly apparent when operating at part load conditions. A multibank micromix combustor is described that offers a potential solution to the high temperature challenges.

   POWER AND ENERGY
AB With the mass-manufacture and resulting low cost of silicon photovoltaics driven by Western government subsidy schemes and large-scale manufacturing, concentrated solar power for electricity generation is now at a turning point. The present cost of mirrors, lenses, support structure and plant for concentrated solar thermal power, and of the high-efficiency multi-junction cells, concentrating optics and two-axis tracking systems for concentrated photovoltaic power, has made operational concentrated solar power plants uncompetitive in most scenarios. This is changing the shape of optics as well as the materials from which they are constructed and the size of the components used. We aim to highlight the current research that is being carried out to reduce the cost of concentrated solar power and concentrate on the long-term potential for cost reduction of both concentrated solar power technologies. This review concentrates first on optical and thermodynamic fundamentals, and the technology choices imposed by real world materials. We then review the broad categories of optical concentrators. Developments in solar thermal power generation and heat and thermochemical storage are discussed before briefly describing recent research on thermoelectric generation. Recent trends in concentrated photovoltaics are summarised, and we conclude by considering the present situation for concentrated solar power in the context of mass-market silicon photovoltaics.

AB Hot corrosion by molten salts has detrimental effect on various industrial and infrastructural systems particularly on the Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants. To enhance durability of the CSP plants' components, while decreasing the production cost of electricity, the graphitization anticorrosion method for carbon steel in contact with molten binary nitrate salt is proposed in this work. To shed some light on the corrosion mechanisms and quantify corrosion rates a combination of advanced material characterization techniques like Focused Ion Beam, SEM, EDX, XPS depth profiling, XRD was applied. It has been demonstrated that the surface spray-coating by graphite reduces the corrosion rate at least by factor of 6 and stabilizes the corrosion scale by iron carbide crystals at 390 degrees C.

In this paper the ability of TES to improve the value of CSP plants is examined by production cost simulation (PCS) of the NEM using PLEXOS software. The impacts of variations in the size of solar field (i.e. solar multiple-SM) and the size of TES on the operation benefit of CSP plant are also examined.

   applications
SO SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS
AB Molten chloride mixtures are of great scientific and technical interest for sensible heat storage in solar power generation. In this work, the condensed phases in a LiCl-NaCl-KCl-ZnCl2 multicomponent system were critically evaluated and predicted via literature review and simulations of LiCl-KCl and KCl-ZnCl2 systems. Two innovative LiCl-NaCl-KCl-ZnCl2 quaternary chloride systems with low melting points were proposed and developed on the basis of a thermodynamic design. The thermal-physical properties of these two eutectic compositions, including melting point, mixing enthalpy, specific heat capacity, density, thermal conductivity, and mass loss, were then experimentally determined. The experimental results were consistent with the theoretical predictions. The novel quaternary eutectic chlorides with excellent thermophysical properties developed herein are potential candidates for thermal energy storage and transfer materials in concentrating solar power plants.

AB Solar generated power has long been considered a useful energy source only for low-energy density and non-mission critical use, such as providing electricity for residential applications. The success of Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) facilities, such as the 64 MW Nevada Solar 1 near Las Vegas, have demonstrated that solar does have application to high energy density industries such as materials and chemical production. This paper will discuss the current operating configuration of the Solar-1 facility and show how proposed modifications, such as addition of thermal storage and use of liquid salts as the working fluid, can further improve the efficiency and energy production of the plant.

AB Renewable Energy development can generate co-benefits, such as jobs, income, and economic output. Concentrated Solar Power technology is a key technology for the electric power sector decarbonization as it generates dispatchable electricity, while also creates direct, indirect and induced jobs. Using an innovative methodology, this study estimates the socioeconomic co-benefits of Concentrated Solar Power deployment in a developing country, where most of its potential is located in sites with low-income population. First, local content scenarios were defined based on the assessment of the installed and idle capacities of the country's industry (at the national and local levels) throughout the Concentrated Solar Power value chain. Then, these scenarios are applied to an interregional Input-Output model to estimate direct, indirect and induced jobs, income and economic output generated by the deployment of a 300 MW solar thermal programme. Findings refer to the regional and national levels, emphasizing that the analysis of Concentrated Solar Power impacts should focus on the mesoscale (regional level instead of national levels only). Depending on the local content scenario, findings show that the proposed Concentrated Solar Power development could generate between 45.40 and 61.21 jobs (direct, indirect and induced) per MW installed, and 0.94 to 1.29 million of United States Dollar (income) per MW installed.

AB China is the world leader in several areas of clean energy, but not in Concentrating Solar Power (CSP). Our analysis provides an interesting viewpoint to China's possible role in helping with the market breakthrough of CSP. We present a short overview of the state-of-the-art of CSP including the status in China. A blueprint for China's CSP development is elaborated based on China's 13th 5-year program, but also on China's previous success factors in PV and wind power. The results of this study suggest that China could play a more prominent global role in CSP, but this would require stronger efforts in several areas ranging from innovation to policies.

TI Reducing Generation Uncertainty by Integrating CSP With Wind Power: An
   Adaptive Robust Optimization-Based Analysis
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
AB The uncertainty of wind power generation brings problems in power system operation, such as requiring more reserves and possible frequency issues. In this paper, we propose an idea of combining concentrating solar power (CSP) plants with wind farms to reduce the overall uncertainty in the joint power output. Taking advantage of the dispatchability of CSP, the uncertainty of joint power generation is expected to decrease. Based on the operational model of CSP plants with thermal storage system, we search for the narrowest but robust bounds of the joint power output with a given uncertainty of the wind power output and solar power availability, and within operational constraints of CSP plants. The problem is formulated as an adaptive robust optimization (RO) problem, containing mixed-integer variables at the second stage. We introduce an algorithm that combines a nested column-and-constraint generation (C-CG) method and an outer approximation (OA) method to solve the problem. The case studies show that robust intervals for the joint power output can be obtained, and the obtained intervals can be significantly narrower than the original intervals of wind power.

AB The rapid growth of solar power plants, integrated into United Power System of Russia (UPS), keeps stable over the last several years. The high percentage of solar power plants in the power system inevitably leads to significant increase of power generation output uncertainty, affecting the high-voltage power network. The reserve capacities, which are allocated on conventional power plants to cover the active power imbalance, should be as less as possible to improve economic efficiency of solar power plants implementation. For this reason, solar power plant operation forecasting becomes an urgent issue in power system and electric energy markets operation. The authors present the structure and mathematical description of the model of solar power plant operation short-term forecasting, which will give the possibility to assess the mean hourly value of solar power plant generation capacity. All the calculations are made for real solar power plant.

AB Development of Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) systems has started about 40 years ago. A first commercial implementation was performed between 1985 and 1991 in California. However, a drop in gas prices caused a longer period without further deployment. It was overcome in 2007 when new incentive schemes for renewables in Spain and the US enabled a commercial restart. In 2017, almost 100 commercial CSP plants with more than 5GW are installed worldwide. This paper describes the physical background of CSP technology, its technical characteristics and concepts. Furthermore, it discusses system performances, cost structures and the expected advancement.

AB The alternative for fossil fuel generated energy is energy from solar plants. A solar power tower system, which is a type of concentrating solar power (CSP), is simulated with the SAM (System Advisor Model) to help in decision-making on whether or not to include a storage system in it. Addition of thermal storage in a solar power tower system brings sustainability and dispatch ability of the power produced. Since solar power tower systems require high investment costs to be established, the percentage contribution of Thermal energy Storage (TES) on the installation costs are found. In this paper, different locations are chosen from India, Germany and Mediterranean countries to simulate a solar power plant of 100 MWe capacities. Initially, the excel sheet with pre-built functions of SAM are custom modified. Then the parameters related to the direct costs and installation costs are determined, which are then used as input in the SAM software to do a parametric simulation. The dependence of the following are estimated with the help of SAM and customizing the SAM excel model:
   Dependence of turbine gross output on total installed costs
   Dependence of thermal energy storage hours of two tank storage system on total installed costs

AB A hybrid power cycle is designed based on the Allam cycle configuration. The system utilizes solar power as its primary heat source and natural gas oxy-combustion as a complementing heat source. The purpose of the complimenting heat source is continual production when the sun is not available and to ensure the reliability, responsiveness, and availability of the cycle for power generation with minimal adverse effects on the environment. This study is divided into three major steps. The first and second are energy and exergy analyses. The third step is exergoeconomic analysis to obtain the cost contribution of cycle components relative to its final product. Both configurations brought similar power output and second law efficiency. However, the energy efficiency was higher for the oxy-combustion configuration. The total product cost ($/GJ) for the oxy-combustion configuration was 50% less for the concentrated solar power configuration. The unit cost of electricity in (Cent/kWh) for the concentrated solar power configuration is approximately 60% higher than for the oxy-combustion configuration. The results showed potential reduction and cost-saving for both configurations; reducing exergy destruction in the main heat exchanger and the recuperator (concentrated solar power) or replacing the air separation unit (oxycombustion configuration).(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The price of concentrated solar power (CSP) has significantly dropped in the last five years, making it a viable option for the industrial sector in Jordan. Many studies investigated the best renewable techniques available in Jordan and concluded that CSP is considered the second option after the PV utility plants. In this study, a prototype of a concentrated solar power tower system (PT) was designed to produce electricity that meets the energy demand at Al-Hussein Bin Talal University (AHU), Jordan, with an energy capacity of 3 MWe. The theory section presents the design methodology to calculate the components of solar power tower plants. In addition, SolarPILOT package was used to design, characterize, and optimize the concentrating solar power tower. This shows good agreement with the calculated model. The simulation results predict that the heliostats system and tower height size play a significant role in the optimization process.

TI Development of thermodynamic cycles for concentrated solar power plants
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
AB Solar thermal power is a promising 'green' technology that could contribute significantly - in countries where it may be applicable due to available resources - towards meeting the 2020 and 2050 targets for the free energy production of emissions [Viebahn, P., Lechon, Y., and Trieb, F., 2011. The potential role of concentrated solar power (CSP) in Africa and Europe -a dynamic assessment of technology development, cost development and life cycle inventories until 2050. Energy Policy, 39 (8), 4420-4430]. Especially for the regions where solar radiation is significant, the technology of concentrated solar power (CSP) plants seems to have a great potential, once cost-related issues are resolved. The thermodynamic process, on which the component design of the plant is based, plays a significant role in the optimisation of the efficiency of the derived configuration. This paper aims to present a route for the design of thermodynamic cycles for a CSP, starting from the simplest processes and heading towards more complicated ones. For a reference output capacity, the obtained efficiencies are presented, illustrating the technical benefits of shifting to more advanced thermodynamic processes.

AB This paper contains an extensive review of life cycle assessment (LCA) studies on greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from different material-based photovoltaic (PV) and working mechanism-based concentrating solar power (CSP) electricity generation systems. Statistical evaluation of the life cycle GHG emissions is conducted to assess the role of different PVs and CSPs in reducing GHG emissions. The widely-used parabolic trough and central receiver CSP electricity generation systems emitted approximately 50% more GHGs than the paraboloidal dish, solar chimney, and solar pond CSP electricity generation systems. The cadmium telluride PVs and solar pond CSPs contributed to minimum life cycle GHGs. Thin-film PVs are also suitable for wider implementation, due to their lower Energy Pay-Back Time (EPBT) periods, in addition to lower GHG emission, in comparison with c-Si PVs.

In this paper, we present an analysis aiming at assessing the feasibility and economic performance of a solar-powered street lighting system for a 1 km road. The present study introduces the architecture of a classical solar-powered LED street lighting system and estimates the total investment cost for a 1 km highway with 2 lanes. The cost comparison of solar-powered LED lighting and sodium lamps using grid was carried out. The calculations show that the energy saving effect of solar-powered LED lighting systems is obvious but the initial investment of solar-powered LED systems is more than sodium lighting systems using grid. The investment cycle is about 2.2 years under the current conditions.

TI Thermoeconomic optimization of a Kalina cycle for a central receiver
   concentrating solar power plant
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB Concentrating solar power plants use a number of reflecting mirrors to focus and convert the incident solar energy to heat, and a power cycle to convert this heat into electricity. This paper evaluates the use of a high temperature Kalina cycle for a central receiver concentrating solar power plant with direct vapour generation and-without storage. The use of the ammonia-water mixture as the power cycle working fluid with non-isothermal evaporation and condensation presents the potential to improve the overall performance of the plant. This however comes at a price of requiring larger heat exchangers because of lower thermal pinch and heat transfer degradation for mixtures as compared with using a pure fluid in a conventional steam Rankine cycle, and the necessity to use a complex cycle arrangement. Most of the previous studies on the Kalina cycle focused solely on the thermodynamic aspects of the cycle, thereby comparing cycles which require different investment costs. In this study, the economic aspect and the part-load performance are also considered for a thorough evaluation of the Kalina cycle. A thermoeconomic optimization was performed by minimizing the levelized cost of electricity. The different Kalina cycle simulations resulted in the levelized costs of electricity between 212.2 $ MWh(-1) and 218.9 $ MWh(-1). For a plant of same rated capacity, the state-of-the-art steam Rankine cycle has a levelized cost of electricity of 181.0 $ MWh(-1). Therefore, when considering both the thermodynamic and the economic perspectives, the results suggest that it is not beneficial to use the Kalina cycle for high temperature concentrating solar power plants.

TI Steam generation system operation optimization in parabolic trough
   concentrating solar power plants under cloudy conditions
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB Parabolic trough concentrating solar power with indirect thermal energy storage, as a promising application of solar energy, has been widely used in concentrating solar power plants. The exergy efficiency of thermal energy storage system and plant parasitic power consumption could change under cloudy conditions when the thermal oil distribution was adjusted to the live steam branch and reheat steam branch. However, the operating condition optimization of steam generation system has received insufficient attention. This study designed a detailed fixed-power-supply model of parabolic trough concentrating solar power plants to optimize the operation strategies under various conditions. The parametric constraints, which worked on the optimization, were investigated under various direct normal irradiation values. Simulation results indicated that the low reheat steam temperature, thermal oil mass flow rate of the live steam branch, and live steam pressure reduced the molten salt temperature at the discharging exchangers and plant parasitic power consumption. The distribution mode of preferentially satisfactory distribution of reheat steam branch demand had low molten salt consumption and high exergy efficiency of thermal energy storage. The molten salt consumptions under optimal conditions were 0.98%-13.68% lower than the consumption under original conditions with the decreasing direct normal irradiation from 300 W/m(2) to 210 W/m(2).

SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB The value of day-ahead solar power forecasting improvements was analyzed by simulating the operation of the Independent System Operator - New England (ISO-NE) power system under a range of scenarios with varying solar power penetrations and solar power forecasting improvements. The results showed how the integration of solar power decreased operational electricity generation costs, by decreasing fuel and variable operation and maintenance costs, while decreasing start and shutdown costs of fossil fueled conventional generators. Solar power forecasting improvements changed the impacts that the uncertainty of solar power has on bulk power system operations; electricity generation from the fast start and lower efficiency power plants, ramping of all generators, start and shutdown costs, and solar power curtailment were all reduced. These impacts led to a reduction in overall operational electricity generation costs in the system that translates into an annual economic value for improving solar power forecasting.

TI Hybridisation optimization of concentrating solar thermal and biomass
   power generation facilities
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB Recently, the first concentrating solar power-biomass hybrid power plant commenced operation in Spain and the combination of both energy sources is promising to lower plant investment. This assessment investigates 17 different concentrating solar power-biomass hybrid configurations in regards their technical, economic and environmental performance. The integration of molten salt thermal storage is considered for the best performing hybrid configuration. While thermal storage can increase plant output significantly even 7 h full-load thermal storage plants would generate the majority of the electricity, 70%, from the biomass resource.
   Only mature technologies with references >5 MWe are considered in this assessment to ensure that the scenarios are bankable. The concentrating solar power technologies selected are parabolic trough, Fresnel and solar tower while the biomass systems include grate, fluidised bed and gasification with producer gas use in a boiler.
   A case study approach based on the annual availability of 100,000 t of wood biomass is taken to compare the different plant configurations but the results are transferable to other locations when updating site and cost conditions. Results show that solar tower biomass hybrids reach the highest net cycle efficiency, 32.9%, but that Fresnel-biomass hybrids have the lowest specific investment, AU$ 4.5 m/MWe. The investment difference between the 17 scenarios is with up to 31% significant. Based on the annual electricity generation CSP-biomass hybrids have an up to 69% lower investment compared to standalone concentrating solar power systems. The scenario with the best technical performance, being solar tower and gasification, is at this point in time not necessarily the best commercial choice, being Fresnel and fluidised bed, as the lower Fresnel investment outweighs the additional electricity generation potential solar towers offer. However, other scenarios with different benefits rank closely. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Value generation of future CSP projects in North Africa
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB This paper discusses the value generation potential for local and international industry in different development scenarios of the concentrating solar power (CSP) market in North Africa until 2030. It analyzes the economic impact resulting from the participation of North African and European companies during construction and operation of CSP plants. The assessment is based on a self-developed solar technologies market development model (STMD) that includes economic and technical requirements and constraints for the creation of a local CSP market. In-depth interviews with industry stakeholders provide specific input, validate the calculations and complement the quantitative model results and conclusions. Long-term potential for locally generated revenues from CSP plant construction are modeled and lead to a share of local revenues of up to 60%. Potential market size of solar power plants in North Africa could reach total revenues of 120 Billion euros and thus demand for components and services contribute to national gross domestic products significantly. Recommendations are given for regional industry cooperation and policy actions for the support of local and international CSP industry in North Africa in order to improve the investment environment and growth of renewable energies in the region.

TI Siting guidelines for concentrating solar power plants in the Sahel:
   Case study of Burkina Faso
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB Selecting a site that meets the technical requirements for a concentrating solar power plant (CSP) is a very critical exercise. This paper points out crucial factors and provides guidelines regarding the selection of suitable sites. It especially focuses on Sahelian countries which have their own climatic peculiarities. These countries, characterized by low access to electricity, are well endowed in solar resources. They are potentially good locations for concentrating solar power plants since their mean daily solar radiation exceeds 5.5 kWh/m(2). CSP presents therefore, a good opportunity for them to increase in a sustainable manner, their energy supply. The guidelines developed in this paper are applied to Burkina Faso as a case study.

AB As an emerging form of renewable energy generation, concentrating solar power (CSP) plant has the inertia and dispatchability like conventional power supply, and its flexible operation mode has significant advantages in promoting the accommodation of renewables. However, insufficient flexibility might cause massive solar energy curtailment. Therefore, a mixed integer linear programming scheduling model in this paper is established to coordinate the joint optimal operation of CSP and other generation resources, i.e., wind, thermal and hydropower, aiming at minimizing the total operation costs. Case studies demonstrate that the operation cost of CSP plant can be significantly reduced, which is 4.62% lower than the natural output, and the equivalent load variance of CSP is 36.65% lower than the natural output. We also discover that the optimal operation of CSP plant can mitigate the emission of air pollutants, and meanwhile enhance the consumption level of clean energy, which is conducive to the low-carbon development of future power systems.

Three fluids are used: water in the Rankine cycle, water with molten salts in the storage circuit and oil through the solar field, which is a parabolic trough type. The results reveal a good response of the system in the discharge phase, due to the switching-off of the least efficient component (the solar field), as the overall exergy efficiency rises from 68% to 72% and the exergoeconomic factor from 58% to 61% Like in similar studies, the least efficient component appears to be the solar field, and this is the reason why the exergy destruction is lower in the discharging phase.

TI WSe2 nanowires-based nanofluids for concentrating solar power
SO MATERIALS TODAY CHEMISTRY
AB Tungsten selenide belongs to the family of inorganic compounds denominated transition metal dichal-cogenides (TMDCs). There is emerging interest in these compounds in the field of optoelectronics, catalysis, sensing or energy storage, among others. Most works focus on the use of these materials in their 2D form but there is scarce research on the study of TMDCs nanomaterials with one-dimensional morphology. In this work, we explore the thermophysical properties of nanofluids based on 1D-WSe2 nanostructures with the aim of studying the feasibility of these nanofluids as heat transfer fluids in concentrating solar power plants. In this respect, nanofluids with a high heat transfer rate could increase the thermal efficiency of solar power plants, which would reduce the energy dependence on fossil fuels. Nanofluids of 0.02 wt%, 0.05 wt% , 0.10 wt% WSe2 concentrations have been prepared by the two-step method considering a thermal fluid used in solar power plants as the base fluid. The results of extinction coefficient evolution, z potential and particle size in suspension show a high colloidal stability over time of the prepared nanofluids mainly because of the high aspect ratio of the 1D-WSe2 nanomaterial. Additionally, the one-dimensionality and length of the synthesized nanowires favors the transport of heat in controlled directions, obtaining increases in thermal conductivity with respect to the base fluid of up to 16.8% in the highest concentration nanofluid. Improvements in isobaric specific heat of up to 15.7% and heat transfer of up to 20.8% compared to the base fluid have also been found. The results of this paper provide evidence that the presence of WSe2 nanowires induces increases in the thermal properties of the fluid commonly used in concentrating solar power plants without inducing agglomeration or sedimentation problems. Therefore, the nanofluids based on 1D-WSe2 nanostructures prepared in this work have a high potential to be used as heat transfer fluids in concentrating solar power plants based on parabolic trough collectors.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The projected increase in energy demand in Chile, along with the need of more sustainable energy solutions are increasing the use of renewable energies in Chile. Among currently used renewables, solar power represents one of the most promising options, given the high irradiance levels available in the Atacama desert. Solar power can be implemented as photovoltaic (PV) and concentrating solar power (CSP) systems, being the first alternative the most popular nowadays. In order for CSP to become a sustainable alternativa for power generation in Chile, economic and environmental impacts need to be considered. This work presents a comparative analysis between the economic and environmental impacts of CSP and PV systems in Chile. The study employs the levelized cost of energy and life-cycle analysis to evaluate hypothetical systems, under conditions currently available in the north of Chile. Results obtained show that economic cost of PV remain lower than CSP, however CSP can achieve lower environmental impacts and supply power continuously. These results suggest both the need for more applied studies in solar plants in Chile, along with improved regulations which consider LCA analysis to truly assess the impacts of solar power and choose the more effective and sustainable energy solutions.

TI Joint Optimal Scheduling of Renewable Energy Regional Power Grid With

SO FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH
AB Under the path of global low-carbon development, increasing the proportion of renewable energy in the power grid will become the main goal in the future. But, it will also aggravate the problem of wind and solar curtailment. A joint optimal scheduling model of a renewable energy regional power grid with an energy storage system and concentrated solar power plant is proposed in this study. The proposed model takes the lowest comprehensive operation cost of the power grid as the optimization goal and considers various constraints of concentrated solar power plants, energy storage systems, thermal power units, wind power, and photovoltaic power generation. Finally, a modified IEEE 9-bus system is used to verify the validity. The results show that the model can effectively improve the system node voltage, promote the accommodation of wind and solar power, and alleviate the peak shaving of thermal power units under the premise of optimal economy pressure.

AB The long term success of the concentrating solar power (CSP) industry depends on having accurate and reliable measurements and predictions of performance. Agreed-upon standards for performance characterization are still lacking. This contrasts with more mature technologies such as gas turbine combined cycle power plants, where performance and testing specifications are well established in spite of system complexities. Lack of standardization inevitably results in extra cost and risk to market participants and the spread of misinformation through hidden "apples-to-oranges" comparisons. To cite just one example, there are multiple distinct metrics for characterizing heliostat tracking accuracy, and the differences can easily go unnoticed. Here we propose rigorous and accurate statistical approaches to two key performance analysis problems for tower CSP. We highlight their advantages over previous approaches, and analyze detailed operational data. Further, we demonstrate why they are sufficiently straightforward and general enough for adoption as industry standards. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Dynamic Modeling and Simulations of a Tethered Space Solar Power Station
SO JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING
AB The nonlinear dynamics of a tethered space solar power station are presented. Dynamic formulations are developed for a solar power station system that consists of two main parts: the bus system and the solar power panel. The orbital motions of the system, the rotation of the solar power panel, the deployment/retrieval of the tethers, and the vibration of the tethers are taken into account. The dynamic behavior of the tethered space solar power station is studied via numerical simulation. Without any initial state errors, the in-orbit movement of the tethered space solar power station is simulated. Then, a stability analysis is conducted for different types of initial state errors. The influences of the initial attitude errors of the solar power panel and the tether's longitudinal and transverse vibrations on the tethered solar power station are analyzed. The numerical results demonstrate that initial attitude errors in different directions have different influences on the system. Compared with axial vibrations, transverse vibrations in the tethers have more significant impacts on the system.

SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB A new integrated energy system (IES) framework is created in order to encourage the consumption of renewable energy, which is represented by wind and solar energy, and lower carbon emissions. The connection between the units in the composite system is examined in this research. In-depth analysis is done on how energy is transferred between electricity, heat, gas, and hydrogen. The system model and constraints are used to build an objective function with the lowest total oper-ating cost. The calculation of carbon trading includes the ladder carbon trading method. And set up 6 cases for analysis, which verifies the effectiveness of the participation of the concentrated solar power plant (CSPP) in the heat supply and power to hydrogen system (P2HS) in reducing the total operating cost of the system, reducing wind curtailment and light curtailment, and reducing carbon emissions. Under the model considered in this paper, reduces the total operating cost reduces by 27.04% when the concentrated solar power plant is involved in the supply of thermal load. And the carbon emission is reduced by 14.529%. Compared with the traditional power to gas, considers the power to hydrogen system in this paper, which reduces the total operating cost by 4.79%.(c) 2023 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/ licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).

SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB This paper highlights an evaluation of the potential level and nature of sustainability for large-scale photovoltaic (PV) solar power plants. This was achieved by applying a mathematical model of sustainability to the results of a qualitative-based environmental impact evaluation of the installation and operation of large-scale solar power plants.
   The results from the model application indicated that large-scale PV solar power plants were conducive to achieving strong sustainability. This was because of the significant environmental benefits derived from PV solar power plants in respect to its construction and operation, as well as the minimum impacts derived from anthropogenic sources. This paper however notes that PV solar technology requires significant improvements in the conversion of sunlight to electric energy. This paper concludes that PV solar power plants offer a potentially significant and sustainable source of energy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB High proportion of variable renewable energy has caused increasing peak shaving pressure and more flexibility demands in IOU% renewable energy systems. Concentrating solar power (CSP) and energy storage system (ESS) are competitive flexibility resources to solve the problems. This paper constructs an optimal configuration model for CSP and ESS in multi-energy power systems. The model considers the investment cost and operation cost in typical scenarios. Characteristics of different power sources are modeled and linearization method is applied to obtain a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. A case study based on real data shows that power systems benefit from the complementarity and coordination of CSP and ESS with other power sources. The configuration results are significantly affected by the penetration rate of variable renewable energy (VRE).

However, they depend on meteorological conditions, leading to uncertainty on the instantaneous energy supply. An interesting concept consists on the strategic combination. In this article, two 1-MWel concentrated solar power/biomass hybrid power plants are presented and evaluated. One is intended for power generation only, while the other delivers combined heat and power. Technical and economic performances were evaluated through numerical simulation and calculation of the levelized cost of electricity.

An interconnected fleet of CSP stations in the deserts of China and the US can supply fully dispatchable or baseload electricity for the demand centers, via long/distance HVDC lines. In China the solar power cost at the point of delivery is at or below 20 $c/kWh, if the CSP fleet utilizes the solar resources in Tibet. In the US regional weather patterns make it economically unfeasible, although technically possible, to generate fully dispatchable CSP. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Capacity credit of concentrating solar power
SO IET RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION
AB Concentrating solar power technology (CSP) will probably become increasingly present in power systems and will have to be included in generation adequacy studies. CSP has two special features which makes it different from other technologies: its daily and seasonal cycle and its possibility of storage. This study proposes a sequential Monte Carlo method, which includes series of possible trajectories of CSP production to find the capacity value of this technology. From the generated CSP production trajectories, values of loss of load probability, equivalent load carrying capacity and equivalent conventional power plant are calculated. Different hypotheses are considered, in order to study the effect of location of CSP plants, their storage capacity and demand profile on capacity credit. The study has a two fold objective: it intends to propose a way of including CSP in generation adequacy studies, and gives representative values of the contribution of this technology to overall power system reliability.

TI Potential of Renewable Energy Resources with an Emphasis on Solar Power
   in Iraq: An Outlook
SO RESOURCES-BASEL
AB This study presents an outlook on the renewable energies in Iraq, and the potential for deploying concentrated solar power technologies to support power generation in Iraq. Solar energy has not been sufficiently utilized at present in Iraq. However, this energy source can play an important role in energy production in Iraq, as the global solar radiation ranging from 2000 kWh/m(2) to a 2500 kWh/m(2) annual daily average. In addition, the study presents the limited current solar energy activities in Iraq. The attempts of the Iraqi government to utilize solar energy are also presented. Two approaches for utilizing concentrated solar power have been proposed, to support existing thermal power generation, with the possibility of being implemented as standalone plants or being integrated with thermal power plants. However, the cost analysis has shown that for 50 kW concentrated solar power in Iraq, the cost is around 0.23 US cent/kWh without integration with energy storage. Additionally, notable obstacles and barriers bounding the utilization of solar energy are also discussed. Finally, this study proposes initiatives that can be adopted by the Iraqi government to support the use of renewable energy resources in general, and solar energy in particular.

In this paper, the operation mechanism and operational constraints of the CSP plant are specified. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the solar energy received by the solar field is considered and a robust economic dispatch model with CSP plants and renewable energy resources is proposed, where uncertainty is adjusted by the automatic generation control (AGC) regulation in the day-ahead ancillary market, so that the system security is guaranteed under any realization of the uncertainty. Finally, the proposed robust economic dispatch has been studied on an improved IEEE 30-bus test system, and the results verify the proposed model.

AB The use of liquid metals in solar power systems is not new. The receiver tests with liquid sodium in the 1980s at the Plataforma Solar de Almeria (PSA) already proved the feasibility of liquid metals as heat transfer fluid. Despite the high efficiency achieved with that receiver, further investigation of liquid metals in solar power systems was stopped due to a sodium spray fire. Recently, the topic has become interesting again and the gained experience during the last 30 years of liquid metals handling is applied to the concentrated solar power community. In this paper, recent activities of the Helmholtz Alliance LIMTECH concerning liquid metals for solar power systems are presented. In addition to the components and system simulations also the experimental setup and results are included.

AB Various systems have been developed for converting solar radiation into heat. Conventional lenses, Fresnel lenses and parabolic trough collectors are used to concentrate solar power and increase the efficiency of heat generation systems. Solar energy is converted to thermal energy in systems where sunlight is concentrated onto a small area to drive electrical power generators. The present study analyzes the applicability of solar parabolic trough collectors for heating water in a four-person household in Poland in accordance with the relevant standards. The correlations between the length of the trough collector, solar irradiation, the number of sunshine hours and the values of absorption and emission coefficients were determined. Concentrated solar power can be used to heat household water on a seasonal or annual basis, to heat indoor and outdoor swimming pools, to heat farm water in the production of crops and livestock and water in food processing plants.

TI Land-Use competitiveness of photovoltaic and concentrated solar power
   technologies near the Tropic of Cancer
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB Solar radiation can be utilized for electricity generation through two main categories of solar power technologies: (1) photovoltaic (PV), and (2) concentrated solar power (CSP). In this study, three-dimensional computer models of electricity generation from 9 different solar power systems (4 PV and 5 CSP) using the simulation program Energy3D were used to establish a generic ranking of these systems in terms of the expected electric energy output during one year per unit land area. This performance metric is referred to as energy generation intensity (EGI), with 'energy' here referring to electric energy in particular. The analysis is aimed for low-latitude zones near the Tropic of Cancer. Solar power systems composed of long rows of connected PV modules, with single-horizontal-axis solar tracking (variable tilt), or with fixed optimized orientation were found to have the best EGI. On the other hand; heliostats with solar towers, PV units with single-vertical-axis solar tracking, and PV units with two-axis solar tracking were found to have the lowest EGI. Other four CSP systems: parabolic dishes, parabolic troughs, linear Fresnel reflectors (LFR), and compact linear Fresnel reflectors with two absorbers formed an intermediate group. Considering all of the 9 solar systems, the estimated EGI ranged from 113.1 kWh/year.m(2) to 227.2 kWh/year.m(2). The monthly contributions to EGI were contrasted; and daily and hourly energy generation intensities were examined on December 21 and June 21. Minor validation was performed using the simulation tool PVWatts Calculator for benchmarking, and using the web application PVGIS for PV systems calculation.

We propose and demonstrate a technique to use a solar cell as a simultaneous receiver of solar power and visible light communication (VLC) signals. First, we investigate the optic-to-electric conversion efficiency and the frequency response of a solar cell. Then, we demonstrate that a solar cell receiver can receive both solar power and VLC signals simultaneously. We also investigate the effect of solar power interference on the VLC performance. The results show that the VLC operation is successful even when the solar power is the maximum. (C) 2014 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI Improving the efficiency of the concentrating solar power plants using
   heat transfer nanofluids with gold nanoplates: An analysis from
   laboratory to industrial scale
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS
AB We report about the remarkable changes in the thermophysical properties of the heat transfer fluid used in concentrating solar power plants with parabolic-trough collectors (Dowtherm A, a mixture of diphenyl oxide and biphenyl) by addition of Au nanoplates in mass fractions around 10-2 wt%. The resulting nanofluids are stable for weeks, and their enhanced physical properties make them good candidates for the application. Particularly, with 4.8 center dot 10-2 wt% of Au nanoplates, specific heat increases by 12.0 +/- 1. 2 % at 523 K and thermal conductivity increases by 24.9 +/- 6.1 % at 373 K, with no measurable changes in density or dynamic viscosity. This set of physical properties allows to make a realistic estimation of the performance of a prototypical concentrating solar power plant using these nanofluids for solar-to-thermal energy conversion. We determine, using computational cost-free numerical models available in literature, that the performance of a concentrating solar power plant could increase up to 35.1 %, com-pared to the predicted 24.7 % with the conventional heat transfer fluid, with neither rheological penalties nor economically prohibitive structural changes. The findings here reported may contribute to encourage the application of heat transfer nanofluids in order to improve the efficiency of concentrating solar power plants, and to consolidate a working scheme that positively promotes the transition from laboratory scale to industrial scale.(c) 2023 The Authors.

TI Intensive Flux Analysis in Concentrative Solar Power Applications Using
   Commercial Camera
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT
AB Solar thermal power application is one of the most promising directions for renewable clean energy development. Typically, a large area of sun radiation needs to be collected, providing an extremely high temperature (intensive energy flux) source. Flux distribution analysis, as a way of verifying the quality of the thermal source and identifying potential hot spots that would potentially damage the attached thermal engine, is of crucial importance. In this paper, we propose an image processing-based method applied via commercial cameras to analyze the intensive flux distribution, targeting especially the difficulties in accurate measurement of flux profile in solar thermal power applications. Rather than linearly mapping the absorbed energy to pixel value, we extract realistic camera responding function with simple steps and use it to build an accurate flux distribution map. We then formulate quantitative parameters, such as peak flux intensity, quadrant balance, and compression ratio, to describe thermal source quality. An on-sun test with a 25-kW dish-Stirling solar system shows good consistency with the obtained parameters. The proposed method can be directly applied to other concentrative solar power industries, such as tower solar power and trough solar power.

TI Assessing the potential for concentrated solar power development in
   rural Australia
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB This paper identifies the potential for concentrated solar power (CSP) to generate electricity in a rural region of Western Australia. A review of policies designed to stimulate the contribution of renewable sources highlights the continued reliance upon fossil fuels to supply current and future electricity needs in Australia. Potential CSP sites are defined in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia through overlaying environmental variables and electricity infrastructure on a high resolution grid using widely available datasets and standard geographical information system (GIS) software. The analysis confirms that CSP facilities can be sited over large areas of the Wheatbelt which can be tailored to local patterns of supply and demand. The research underlines the necessity to develop a policy regime which actively supports and stimulates CSP in order to capitalize upon its potential to facilitate rural economic development while contributing towards greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.

TI Operation optimization of electrical-heating integrated energy system
   based on concentrating solar power plant hybridized with combined heat
   and power plant
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The integration of power and heating systems is a promising option to optimize unit operation and improve power system flexibility for reducing renewable energy sources curtailment. This study aims to excavate the potentiality of a concentrating solar power plant hybridized with a gas-fired combined heat and power plant to alleviate the effects of the uncertainty and variability of renewable energy sources. Firstly, in order to further utilize the scheduling ability of the concentrating solar power plant with a thermal energy storage (TES) system and improve the operational flexibility of the combined heat and power plant, a combined plant is proposed in this paper. Specifically, a concentrating solar power plant and a gas-fired combined heat and power unit are assembled together based on the temperature parameters of energy flow during operation. Secondly, taking the remaining state of charge (SOC) of TES in operating day into account, a three-stage multi-time scale stochastic unit commitment-economic dispatch model is formulated to optimize unit operation and reduce operating cost. Finally, in order to verify the operational flexibility and economic benefits of the proposed combined plant with multi-time scale stochastic unit commitment-economic dispatch model, several different energy supply modes are compared in the simulation. Results show that the proposed scheme has better economic benefits and development potential in the electrical-heating integrated energy system.

TI Monte-Carlo estimation of geometric sensitivities in Solar Power Tower
   systems of flat mirrors
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB Optical optimizations for a Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) system are currently limited largely to gradient -free methods, since the gradient is hard to obtain by using the existing numerical optics tools available in the community. This article aims to build new algorithms of the Monte-Carlo type, which numerically estimate the gradient of power impacting the receiver with respect to the geometric parameters that characterize the geometric status of the heliostats in the heliostats field, for a Solar Power Tower (SPT) system. Physical models will be built for the specific intensity and also for its derivatives to the geometric parameters of the heliostats, also called geometric sensitivities of intensity. Similar to the intensity but with their own models, they are regarded as physical quantities emitted, absorbed and reflected in the system. They carry the perturbations of intensity as information, corresponding to the relations between the geometric parameters and the physical events in the SPT system: blocking, spillage, shadowing, etc. These relations will be distinguished and discussed. Finally, not only the gradient but also the contributions of physical events (blocking, spillage, shadowing, etc.) to the gradient can be estimated for further sensitivity analysis and optimization processes.

TI In-situ MgO generation method: A new strategy for mitigating the
   corrosivity of molten chloride salt
SO CORROSION SCIENCE
AB Molten chloride salts are excellent heat transfer fluids (HTFs) and thermal energy storage (TES) media, and they have potential applications in concentrating solar power (CSP) plants. However, they have strong corrosivity to metal pipes or vessels in actual working conditions, which is an urgent problem that needs to be solved. In this paper, a new strategy for mitigating the corrosivity of molten NaCl-CaCl2-MgCl2 salt is proposed. The results showed that the formation of MgO particles in molten salt using the in-situ generation method is an effective method for mitigating the corrosivity of molten chloride salt.

TI Fluidized Bed Technology for Concentrating Solar Power With Thermal
   Energy Storage
SO JOURNAL OF SOLAR ENERGY ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
AB A generalized modeling method is introduced and used to evaluate thermal energy storage (TES) performance. The method describes TES performance metrics in terms of three efficiencies: first-law efficiency, second-law efficiency, and storage effectiveness. By capturing all efficiencies in a systematic way, various TES technologies can be compared on an equal footing before more detailed simulations of the components and concentrating solar power (CSP) system are performed. The generalized performance metrics are applied to the particle-TES concept in a novel CSP thermal system design. The CSP thermal system has an integrated particle receiver and fluidized-bed heat exchanger, which uses gas/solid two-phase flow as the heat-transfer fluid, and solid particles as the heat carrier and storage medium. The TES method can potentially achieve high temperatures (>800 degrees C) and high thermal efficiency economically.

AB Solar power ramp events (SPREs) significantly influence the integration of solar power on non-clear days and threaten the reliable and economic operation of power systems. Accurately extracting solar power ramps becomes more important with increasing levels of solar power penetrations in power systems. In this paper, we develop. an optimized swinging door algorithm (OpSDA) to enhance the state of the art in SPRE detection. First, the swinging door algorithm (SDA) is utilized to segregate measured solar power generation into consecutive segments in a piecewise linear fashion. Then we use a dynamic programming approach to combine adjacent segments into significant ramps when the decision thresholds are met. In addition, the expected SPREs occurring in clear-sky solar power conditions are removed. Measured solar power data from Tucson Electric Power is used to assess the performance of the proposed methodology. OpSDA is compared to two other ramp detection methods: the SDA and the L1-Ramp Detect with Sliding Window (L1-SW) method. The statistical results show the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method. OpSDA can significantly improve the performance of the SDA, and it can perform as well as or better than L1-SW with substantially less computation time.

TI Characteristics of Energy Flux Distribution of Concentrating Solar Power
   Systems
SO LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
AB As an important renewable energy technology, concentrating solar power (CSP) plays an important role in the development and utilization of solar resources, supply of energy, energy conservation, and emission reduction. The surface energy flux distribution of the receivers of four CSP systems including parabolic trough system, linear Fresnel reflector system, solar power tower, and solar dish system arc analyzed and reviewed. The challenges brought by the non-uniform flux distribution characteristics of the receiver surface and the corresponding solutions arc summarized. The non-uniform flux distribution on the surface of the receiver leads to a high local temperature, which has an adverse effect on the safe and efficient operation of the CSP system. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize and improve the concentrating collector system. For the four CSP methods, the main solution is to improve the concentrating performance and heat absorption performance to make the light-collecting match heat absorption.

TI ENVIRONMENT IMPACT OF A CONCENTRATED SOLAR POWER PLANT
SO TEHNICKI GLASNIK-TECHNICAL JOURNAL
AB More recently, there has been an increasing interest in the use of concentrated solar thermal energy for the production of electricity, but also for the use in cogeneration and trigeneration. In this sense, the increasing use of solar thermal energy in urban areas is expected, and its impact on the environment is inducing an increasing interest. The paper analyses the impact of concentrated solar power technology (linear Fresnel, parabolic trough, parabolic dish, and central tower) on the environment in terms of water consumption, land use, wasted heat, emissions of gases, emissions of pollutants that include the leakage of heat transfer fluid through pipelines and tanks, impact on flora and fauna, impact of noise and visual impact. The impact on the environment is different for different concentrated solar power technologies and depends on whether thermal energy storage is included in the plant. Water is mainly used for cooling the system, but also for cleaning the surface of the mirror. To reduce water consumption, other cooling technologies (e.g. air cooling) are being developed. The available data from the literature show large variances depending on the size of the plant, geographic location and applied technology.

For the first time, some essential thermophysical properties of this eutectic chloride molten salt needed for basic heat transfer and energy storage analysis in the application of concentrating solar power systems have been experimentally tested and provided as functions of temperature in the range from 450 degrees C to 700 degrees C. The studied properties include heat capacity, melting point, heat of fusion, viscosity, vapor pressure, density, and thermal conductivity. The property equations provide essential database for engineers to use to calculate convective heat transfer in concentrated solar receivers, heat exchangers, and thermal storage for concentrated solar power plants.

   mixture salt for concentrated solar power plants
SO SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS
AB This paper elaborates the compatibility of SS316L alloy with LiNaK carbonate for concentrated solar power plant applications. In this study, corrosion behavior and corrosion mechanism of SS316L in the eutectic LiNaK carbonate molten salt, at 600 degrees C and 700 degrees C, were investigated in detail. The results revealed that the corrosion process of stainless steel 316L in the LiNaK carbonate molten salt is mainly divided into four successive steps: (i) selective oxidation process of metals -> (ii) lithiation reaction of the oxide -> (iii) formation of a dual-structured corrosion scale -> (iv) separation and spatting of corrosion products. Moreover, increasing temperature to 700 degrees C results in a severe corrosion of SS316L in the molten carbonate salt. Therefore, it is imperative to explore a suitable protective coating for SS316L to use it as a structural material in concentrated solar power plant.

CSP plants are integrated with Thermal Energy Storage (TES) systems to resolve its intermittent nature and enhance its economic feasibility. TES systems also smoothen out the fluctuations in energy demands throughout the day. The efficient design of the thermal storage system has three major aspect i.e., selecting the suit -able heat storage material with high thermal conductivity, high energy storage density, and thermally stability. The paper presents an overview of all currently operational CSP plants and the technologies used by them. The paper also reviews the thermal characteristics of potential Sensible Heat Storage (SHS) materials as energy storage media in these plants and provides a critical assessment of each mate-rial.

AB In the scenario of the small scale 3-35 kWe concentrated solar power plant based on point receiver technologies; the dish-Stirling configuration is one of the most commonly adopted one. New and clean efficiency of these Stirling engines is typically of 30-40%. Yearly average efficiency, during the system operations, is significantly reduced to 10-15% due to the Stirling engines high maintenance costs and poor reliability issues. These drawbacks limit the small scale dish-Stirling engines market attractiveness. The adoption of cheap, reliable and widely available engines, such as micro gas turbines is a promising solution for substituting Stirling engines since it ensures constant performance over time. Since micro gas turbines for concentrated solar power plant: equipped with dish concentrator have not been widely deployed, the development of a plant simulator is helpful for predicting the overall concentrated solar power plant performance and for optimizing the plant operation: under different boundary conditions. The plant simulator is aimed to demonstrate the economic viability and the technical feasibility of dish - micro gas turbine systems.
   The paper includes the methods for developing a simulation tool for solar dish- micro gas turbine applications.. The solar concentrator, receiver/absorber, micro gas turbine, high speed generator and power electronic systems have been modelled and the plant simulator has been set-up by means of a quadratic programming technique. The simulator has been used to perform steady state simulations for predicting the performance and for ensuring a safe and reliable power plant operation when the direct normal irradiation changes. The results for a net generated power of about 6 kWe have shown a nominal peak efficiency of about 10%, making this micrc gas turbine solar plant layout market attractive.

TI Energy Provisioning and Operating Costs in Hybrid Solar-Powered
   Infrastructure
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
AB In this paper, we consider the operating and capital expenditure (CAPEX) costs of solar-powered additions to infrastructure that is operated from the power grid. The CAPEX costs are those associated with provisioning the solar power components, and are selected using an offline design optimization. Once the solar add-on is designed and deployed, the node incurs ongoing operating expenditure (OPEX) costs associated with the purchase of power grid energy. Lower bounds on cost are derived using a linear programming formulation, where the solar power components are sized using historical solar insolation traces and projected loading data. Different node add-on arrangements are considered, which result in various solar/battery and grid configurations. Three energy scheduling algorithms are then introduced to optimize online OPEX costs. A variety of results are presented that show the extent to which a solar-powered add-on can reduce the total cost. These results also show that the proposed algorithms give performance that is close to the lower bounds in many situations.

TI Enhanced thermal stability and spectral selectivity of SS/TiC-Y/Al2O3
   spectrally selective solar absorber by thermal annealing
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB Exploring a high performance spectrally selective solar absorber is one of the great challenges in the development of Concentrating Solar Power (CSP). Herein, a porous structure of SS/TiC-Y/Al2O3 solar absorber is developed by a facile and scalable method combined with a simple vacuum annealing process. The tandem SS/TiC-Y/Al2O3 solar absorber exhibits a high absorptance of 0.90 and a low emittance of 0.11 after vacuum annealed at 800 degrees C for 5 h. Long term thermal annealing result indicates that the SS/TiC-Y/Al2O3 solar absorber coating has a good thermal stability at 800 degrees C in vacuum for 100 h. Due to the addition of rare earth yttrium (Y) and post-annealing, the porous structure is formed, which makes contribution to the spectral selectivity. Benefiting from these advantageous features, the post annealed SS/TiC-Y/Al2O3 coating can be good candidate for the Concentrating Solar Power application. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Our project is based on Concentrated Solar Power where we use linear Fresnel lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight onto a small area. Lenses fabricated from different materials under various dimensions vary in thermodynamic efficiencies as each of them will produce different peak temperature. This heat energy obtained can be either directly used in steam power plant or stored as thermal storage medium in the form of molten salt.

TI Mining optimum models of generating solar power based on big data

SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB Recently in exploiting green energy, solar power generation is a must-be trend and approach, especially for the countries with nature resource shortage. However, how to build solar power plants with the best power generation efficiency in limited spaces is always a crucial issue. In this paper, the approach of finding the optimum models of generating solar power is proposed to build solar power plants for different environments in Taiwan. First, we collect all the data from existing solar power farms, including (1) design methods of power generation, (2) actual power generation, and (3) surrounding environments. Then, after a series of preprocessing steps and system analysis on them, the optimal models of generating solar power could be mined out. Finally, in the experiments, we evaluate the system from five aspects regarding to input and output parameters. As a result, we observe that using the majority voting strategy improves the system accuracy and helps engineers build solar power plants with the maximum power generation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Thermophysical and chemical analysis of gneiss rock as low cost

   power plants
SO SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS
AB A packed bed of rocks with air as heat transfer fluid can be considered as a cost effective storage system, as it enhances the dispatchability of the concentrated solar power plant at lower costs. However, the identification of suitable rocks to be used as a storage medium requires a prior experimental characterization, since the studies published about the behaviour of rocks at high temperatures are scarce in literature. This work aims to investigate the potential of gneiss rock as a candidate storage material in solar power plants. Thus, thermal stability of two varieties of gneiss rock has been studied at temperatures up to 1000 degrees C during heating and cooling by thermogravimetric and differential thermal analyzer (TO/DTA). The influence of temperature on specific heat capacity, thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity has been analyzed. Furthermore, the chemical composition and crystalline phases have been identified by X-ray fluorescence and X-ray diffraction, respectively. The obtained results proved the potential of this type of rocks in terms of high thermal capacities, high density and good thermal stability up to 550 degrees C. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI Dynamic simulation of integrated rock-bed thermocline storage for
   concentrated solar power
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB In contrast to wind and photovoltaic, concentrated solar power plants can be equipped with thermal energy storage in order to decouple intermittent energy supply and grid feed-in. The focus of this study is the technical evaluation of a cost-efficient storage concept for solar tower power plants. Consisting of a quartzite-rock bed that is charged with a hot air flow and discharged by cold air counter-flow, the storage essentially operates like a regenerator. For such systems, the discharge temperature typically declines with time. Furthermore, the use of a randomly packed bed results in considerable pressure loss. In order to describe the relevant flow and heat transfer mechanisms in rock beds used for thermal storage, a mathematical model written in the modelling language Modelica is developed and validated. Good agreement with experimental data from literature is obtained. With the aid of the validated model, a rock-bed thermal storage for application in a semi-industrial scale solar power plant (1.5 MWel) is designed and optimised with respect to electrical efficiency of the plant during the charge and discharge cycle. The storage capacity is equivalent to four hours of full-load operation. Results show that compressor work should be considered directly in the selection of packed-bed geometry in order to minimise the efficiency penalty of storage integration in the solar plant.

SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB Egypt is a sunbelt nation with plenty of solar resources and significant wasteland areas, particularly in its southern and western regions. Concentrating solar power technologies are tried-and-true renewable energy systems that use solar radiation to produce electricity in nearby nations. These technologies have the potential to reduce costs in the future. Comprehensive techno-economic research has not been conducted to assess the po-tential for the solar power tower technique in Egypt; instead, solar photovoltaic and parabolic trough systems are given the majority of the attention. The major goal of this article is to persuade the Egyptian government to pursue solar power tower technology and meet the accompanying difficulties. Using system advisor model software, six distinct locations were used to simulate a 100 MW plant for solar power tower technology. Based on a thorough technical solar power tower site evaluation research, these zones were examined. To achieve the lowest levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), thermal energy storage and solar field size optimization are carried out. The Benban location, with outputs of 521,228.8 MWh and 0.1130 $/kWh, respectively, has the greatest produced energy and the lowest levelized cost of electricity, according to the findings. The ideal design for the solar power tower plant was shown by the results to be a solar multiple of 2.8 with a thermal energy storage of 8 h. The solar power tower plant's lowest levelized cost of electricity might then be reduced, in accordance with the optimum configurations, to 0.1057 $/kWh.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AMBIENT ENERGY
AB Nowadays, solar energy is attempted being utilised extensively to generate electrical power. Solar energy can be employed independently or with fossil fuels to reduce CO2 emission and the Levelized cost of power generation. This paper reviews the advances in thermal power cycles concerning concentrating solar power (CSP) applications. Based on the studies, it is evident that the supercritical steam turbines are an appealing option at a larger scale when employing multiple solar towers combined with heat transfer fluid (HTF). The advancement of the supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle also provides the prospects of lower Levelized cost for getting higher cycle efficiency across a range of capacity at acceptable temperatures. CSP applications to advanced power cycle and heat energy storage provide a superior arrangement to the grid at lower stability cost and high reliability, which helps solar energy make rapid commercial progress; nevertheless, lower prices and higher efficiency are critical.

Due to the poor thermal conductivity of phase change materials and complex physical/chemical heat transfer process in the storage tank, geometrical configurations of the storage tank are vital for the system's performance, thus affect the large-scale application of concentrating solar power plant. This paper presents a review of geometrical configuration of thermal energy storage tank by summarizing a series of numerical, experimental and theoretical studies in the open literatures. A widespread discussion for thermal energy storage tank in future application has been proposed in the paper. The results can provide a good reference for designing, operating, and energy-saving of thermal energy storage system for concentrating solar power plants. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Solar power, state power, and the politics of energy transition in
   pre-Saharan Morocco
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE
AB In 2009, the Kingdom of Morocco embarked on the Solar Plan, an ambitious 10-year plan to become a leading solar power producer. This paper examines the genesis of the first project in the plan, a concentrated solar power plant near the pre-Saharan city of Ouarzazate, in order to explore the energy transition as a political as well as geographic project. I specifically address how the government's acquisition of land drew on colonial strategies for dispossession that were subsequently embraced by the post-colonial state. At the same time, bureaucratic processes for responding to community demands effectively narrowed popular opposition to a set of technocratic problems to be solved by development interventions. The official discourse of global environmental remediation obscured the socio-ecological relations at work in the project, constructing the land as marginal so as to facilitate investment and foreclosing resident's broader political claims. Attending to the political dynamics surrounding solar power challenges assumptions that an energy transition necessarily involves a transition away from an environmentally destructive carbon-based economyor from the forms of governmentality that support current energy regimes.

AB In this paper, a new system of solar-assisted combined cooling heating and power (CCHP) system equipped with energy storage is proposed. The model consists of most of the equipment which may be used in the distributed energy system, especially the concentrating solar power (CSP) plant which can store the solar power absorbed into large-capacity thermal storage device. Other energy storage devices are also taken into consideration in this system so as to store the surplus energy. Then a two-level optimization strategy for capacity design, which employs the group search optimizer (GSO) and CPLEX optimize, is constructed to improve the performance of this system in economy, energy and environment. The simulation results indicate that the proposed system is economic in investment and performs well in reducing pollutant emission as well as saving energy. Results also show that the photovoltaic has better performance in economy than CSP when large capacity energy storage equipment is needed.

AB Fluidization technology displays a long record of success stories, mostly related to applications to thermal and thermochemical processes, which is fostering extension to novel and relatively unexplored fields. Application of fluidized beds to collection and thermal storage of solar radiation in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) is one of the most promising, a field which poses challenging issues and great opportunities to fluidization scientists and technologists. The potential of this growing field calls for reconsideration of some of the typical design and operation guidelines and criteria, with the goal of exploiting the inherently good thermal performances of gas fluidized beds at their best. "Creative" and non-conventional design and operation of fluidized beds, like those based on uneven or unsteady (pulsed) fluidization, may be beneficial to the enhancement of thermal diffusivity and surface-to-bed heat transfer, improving the potential for application in the very demanding context of CSP with thermal energy storage.

TI Numerical simulation and experimental study of a novel hybrid system
   coupling photovoltaic and solar fuel for electricity generation
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB Development of solar power is a promising route to achieve the target of carbon neutrality. However, the cost-effective conversion of full spectrum solar energy is always a challenge because of the limitations of individual photovoltaics and solar thermal power. Here, a novel concentrated solar power system is proposed, which properly partitions incoming solar energy between the photovoltaics and thermochemistry, by the sunlight concentrating and spectral splitting method of parabolic trough collector. The partial visible and near-infrared sunlight is converted to electricity using the monocrystalline silicon photovoltaics, and the other sunlight drives methanol decomposition reaction to generate solar syngas, as a fuel in solid oxide fuel cell, providing flexible and stable electrical power. Mathematical model and finite element method are combined to calculate PV power and thermochemical power respectively. Furthermore, a solar power experimental platform is designed and experimentally tested. A solar power of 1532 W and a realistic solar power efficiency of 26.4% are achieved, with a maximum dispatchability exceeding 80%. Compared with the concentrated solar power systems existing, the proposed system shows a great competitiveness and potential both in conversion efficiency and electrical dispatchability for large-scale application. The novel solar power system can be considered an applicable and feasible approach to full spectrum solar conversion.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE ENERGY RESEARCH
AB Vietnam is an agricultural country with about 35% of the land devoted to agricultural production and has a solar energy source with average radiation of about 4-5 kWh/m(2)/day. A combination of agricultural production and solar power can ensure support for rural economic development. However, these projects have not been evaluated in detail by Vietnamese investors. In the paper, the economic efficiency of a typical solar power project on agricultural land in Gia Lai province, Central Region, Vietnam is analyzed by using RETScreen financial-economic efficiency analysis software. This study shows that the payback time of a typical solar power system on agricultural land in Gia Lai province is about 8 years. Moreover, the results also help investors understand more the benefits to encourage investment and develop the combination of agriculture and solar energy in Vietnam.

AB In order to realise the power quality stability control of solar power generation, this paper proposes a power quality stability control algorithm based on fuzzy feedback regulation. The iterative control parameter tracking model of the power quality stability control of solar power generation is established, and the error feedback tracking method is used for stable adjustment. The tracking error adaptive compensation method is used to improve the steady-state operation characteristics of the solar generator motor and the control parameters are optimised to achieve the power quality stability control of solar power generation. The results show that after t = 1.5 s, P converges gradually. It proved that the stability of power quality control of solar power generation is good, the self-adaptive regulation ability is strong, and the output quality of solar power generation improved.

AB A renewable energy-only grid must couple mutable energy supplies such as wind and solar photovoltaic and affordable energy storage by lithium-ion batteries to dispatchable energy supply such as Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) with thermal energy storage (TES) and Enhanced Geothermal Energy (EGS). EGS is centered on the exploitation of the substantial unconventional geothermal energy supplies in the crust of the Earth which is missing permeability and groundwater, with significant opportunities in western Saudi Arabia where the solar resource is also relevant. Regarding conventional geothermal energy, thermal efficiencies of the cycles can be increased to above 30% with EGS, and above 40% through the integration of EGS with CSP and TES, surpassing the 50% efficiency mark adopting advanced ultra-supercritical (AUSC) technologies.

AB Disaster in Fukushima nuclear power plant, environmental pollution due to carbon dioxide emission and global warming has motivated researchers to seek alternative green energy resources such as solar power. Terrestrial solar power (TSP) is not reliable as it is limited by weather condition and seasonal sun light illumination variations. Space solar power (SSP) is a solution to TSP limitations. The idea of harvesting solar power in space has been proposed several decades ago. However, technology restrictions have stalled its realization. This paper compares the harvesting performance of SSP and TSP based on current technologies. It also studies different orbit configurations such as LEO, MEO and GEO. Cost ($/kW), technical difficulties, and fundamental requirements for successful SSP implementation are discussed.

AB With the exponential increase in demand of power all over the world, the limited natural fuel resources are being stressed every hour. No matter the abundance, these resources are bound to deplete completely in far future. Humankind is now moving onto such methods for electricity generation which can meet our demand and preserve the nature's reserves simultaneously. Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) uses the heat from the Sun to produce mechanical thus electrical power. It was chosen a preexisting method (Euro Dish) and modified it to a level suitable for small-scale/personal use. This is an obstacle in the way of making this technology and method popular and usable on a mass scale, let alone on a personal scale. In this paper, stirling engine was used as a heat engine with concentrated solar power. It also shows the comparison between concentrated solar power (CSP) and photovoltaic (PV) system. The primary objective, to generate mechanical power from Stirling engine and converting it into electrical power through a dc generator of low r.p.m., was completed with minor inefficiencies and discrepancies.

AB The main objective of this paper is to perform data analysis of ground based measurement and review the state of the art of IIT Jodhpur Rooftop solar photovoltaic installed 101 kW system. Solar power forecasting is playing a key role in solar PV park installation, operation and accurate solar power dispatchability as well as scheduling. Solar Power varies with time and geographical locations and meteorological conditions such as ambient temperature, wind velocity, solar radiation and module temperature. The location of Solar PV system is the main reason of solar power variability. Solar variability totally depends on system losses (deterministic losses) and weather parameter (stochastic losses). In the case of solar power, deterministic losses can be found out accurately but stochastic losses are very uncertain and unpredicted in nature. The proposed soft computing technique will be suitable for solar power forecasting modeling. In this paper Fuzzy theory, Adaptive Neuro-fuzzy interface system, artificial neural network and generalized neural network are used as powerful tool of solar power Forecasting. This soft computing cum nature inspired techniques are able to accurately and fast forecasting compared to conventional methods of forecasting. This is done analyzing the operational data of 101 kW PV systems (43.30 kW located in Block 1 and 58.08 kW in Block 2), during the year 2011.

AB Concentrating power plant coupling with thermal energy storage system is a popular technology during the solar application process or solar power plant, and researches for the performance of thermal energy storage for concentrating solar power plant have performed over the past four decades and are ongoing. In this paper, temperature distribution and the effects of the parameters i.e., heat conductivity, heat transfer length, inlet velocity, and the diameter of the tube, on the charge time of the storage tank have been investigated based on numerical simulation. The results show that the charge time for the storage tank is about 23,600 s before changing the parameters of the model. The charge time of the storage tank increases with increasing the heat transfer length and decreasing the heat conductivity, inlet velocity, and the diameter of the tube. The results can provide a reference to the state-of-the-art design of solar storage system. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Evaluating potential effects of solar power facilities on wildlife from
   an animal behavior perspective
SO CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
AB Solar power is a renewable energy source with great potential to help meet increasing global energy demands and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. However, research is scarce on how solar facilities affect wildlife. With input from professionals in ecology, conservation, and energy, we conducted a research-prioritization process and identified key questions needed to better understand impacts of solar facilities on wildlife. We focused on animal behavior, which can be used to identify population responses before mortality or other fitness consequences are documented. Behavioral studies can also offer approaches to understand the mechanisms leading to negative interactions (e.g., collision, singeing, avoidance) and provide insight into mitigating effects. Here, we review how behavioral responses to solar facilities, including perception, movement, habitat use, and interspecific interactions are priority research areas. Addressing these themes will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of solar power on wildlife and guide future mitigation.

TI Technical Challenges and Their Solutions for Integration of Sensible
   Thermal Energy Storage with Concentrated Solar Power Applications-a
   Review
SO PROCESS INTEGRATION AND OPTIMIZATION FOR SUSTAINABILITY
AB Concentrated solar power (CSP) uses solar insolation to increase the temperature of heat transfer fluid (HTF), which can be used in a power block to produce power either by using a steam turbine or gas turbine. In CSP, the levelized cost of electricity is higher than conventional sources due to the intermittent nature of solar energy. The levelized cost of electricity can be reduced by integrating CSP with thermal energy storage (TES) system. This paper comprehensively reviews sensible thermal energy storage technologies for concentrated solar power applications. It includes a brief discussion of various sensible heat TES systems, i.e., two-tank molten salt TES system, single-media TES system, and dual-media TES systems. Recent advances in the TES system show that dual-media thermocline is economically more viable as compared to others. However, it has a few technical challenges like a mechanical failure due to thermal ratcheting and varying outlet temperature. Additionally, the review presented here is useful in thermodynamic modeling of the TES system using various heat transfer models.

AB Hybridization of solar energy together with another energy source is an option to provide heat and power reliably on demand. Hybridization allows decreasing combustion related fuel consumption and emissions, assuring stable grid connection and cutting costs of concentrated solar power technology due to shared power production equipment. The research project "Integration of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) and Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) Power Plants" (COMBO-CFB) has been carried out to investigate the technical possibilities and limitations of the concept. The main focus was on the effect of CSP integration on combustion dynamics and on the joint power cycle, and on the interactions of subsystems. The research provides new valuable experimental data and knowhow about dynamic behaviour of CFB combustion under boundary conditions of the hybrid system. Limiting factors for maximum solar share in different hybridization schemes and suggestions for enhancing the performance of the hybrid system are derived.

TI Life Cycle Assessment of a high temperature molten salt concentrated
   solar power plant
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB Realizing and installing renewable energy plants have an environmental "footprint" that has to be evaluated to quantify the real impact of renewable technologies on the environment. Nowadays, the most important tool to evaluate this impact of a product is the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).
   The aim of this work is to present a Life Cycle Assessment of an innovative solar technology, the molten salt concentrating solar power (CSP) plant combined with a biomass Back-Up Burner, developed by Italian Research Centre ENEA and able to produce clean electricity by using solar energy. The Life Cycle Assessment was carried out by means of the SimaPro7 software, one of the most used LCA software in the world.
   In the second part of the study the environmental performance of the CSP plant was compared with these of conventional oil and gas power plants. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes a solar energy power regulation system using solar power detectors. The system developed comprises a cubic solar power detector, DC DC converter, three-phase inverter, and a single-chip control module. The cubic solar power detector is composed of five facets installed with front, rear, left, right, and horizontal photo sensors. By detecting solar power coming from different orientations, the solar orientation and solar power can be optimized based on a geometric transformation principle, which evaluates the relationship between photo-power and solar orientation for each sensor. Because the output power of a solar cell can significantly affect the generating capacity of the cell, a solar energy power regulation system was developed to regulate the electricity generated. The solar generating power is monitored by a cubic solar power detector and regulated by a three-phase pulse width modulation inverter. This paper describes the realization and implementation of a solar power regulation system, and experiments have been carried out to validate the performance. Measurements reveal that the system is definitely effective in regulating solar power output and can successfully boost solar power generating capacity.

TI Concentrating Solar Thermal Power
SO WORLD SCIENTIFIC HANDBOOK OF ENERGY
SE Materials and Energy
AB In harnessing solar power, the power of the sun is concentrated to provide a source of heat to generate a hot fluid for a downstream energy conversion process. It can be used to generate electricity, produce solar fuels, or process heat for industry. The fundamental part of the technology is the solar collector, the most common types being parabolic trough, linear Fresnel, central receiver, and paraboloidal dishes. Approximately 1,800 MW of plants are presently operating commercially, and 10,000 MW of plants are presently at various stages of planning and approval. The majority of existing plants are parabolic troughs, using oil to generate steam for a steam turbine. However, there is presently a strong emerging interest in central receivers (power towers) due to their ability to produce much higher temperatures to suit higher efficiency power cycles, and ultimately lower cost. The key for concentrating solar power lies in its ability to incorporate thermal storage and thus provide dispatchable solar power, which will also benefit the penetration of other renewables such as photovoltaics and wind. It is likely that the future for concentrating solar power will involve high efficiency power cycles and high temperature storage for electricity generation, and solar fuels for transport and industry.

TI A comprehensive review of state-of-the-art concentrating solar power
   (CSP) technologies: Current status and research trends
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Concentrating solar power (CSP) has received significant attention among researchers, power-producing companies and state policymakers for its bulk electricity generation capability, overcoming the intermittency of solar resources. The parabolic trough collector (PTC) and solar power tower (SPT) are the two dominant CSP systems that are either operational or in the construction stage. The USA and Spain are global leaders in CSP electricity generation, whereas developing countries such as China and India are emerging by aggressive investment. Each year, hundreds of articles have been published on CSP. However, there is a need to observe the overall research development of this field which is missing in the current body of literature. To bridge this gap, this study 1) provides a most up-to-date overview of the CSP technologies implemented across the globe, 2) reviews previously published review articles on this issue to highlight major findings and 3) analyzes future research trends in the CSP research. Text mining approach is utilized to analyze and visualize the scientific landscape of the research. Thermal energy storage, solar collector and policy-level analysis are found as core topics of discussion in the previous studies. With a holistic analysis, it is found that direct steam generation (DSG) is a promising innovation which is reviewed in this study. This paper provides a comprehensive outlook on the CSP technologies and its research which offers practical help to the future researchers who start to research on this topic.

TI Inhibiting hot corrosion of molten Li2CO3-Na2CO3-K2CO3 salt through
   graphitization of construction materials for concentrated solar power
SO SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS
AB Next-generation concentrated solar power (CSP) plants are expected to work above the current temperature limit of 565 degrees C for the benefit of enhanced efficiency. This poses significant challenges in the construction materials, among others, in terms of corrosion. In this work, we investigate the spray-graphitization method to improve the compatibility of SS310 and SS347 with molten Li2CO3-Na2CO3-K2CO3 carbonate salt. Improved compatibility was observed due to the formation of protective carbonate or carbide layers on SS347 and SS310 surfaces, respectively. Detailed characterization of the corrosion products, including chemical reactions and wettability allowed the mechanism of anticorrosion protection to be proposed, which could be used for other construction materials in direct contact with high-temperature molten salts for next-generation CSP plants and beyond.

SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Concentrator Solar Power (CSP) system is one of renewable solar energy, that has a crucial place in the thermal production. The CSP is used for many different applications, as the turbine steam of electrical generator and cogeneration. These applications need thermal energy storage (TES) to allow the system to operate at nighttime. For this purpose, a new control system of CSP is proposed in this paper. The suggested system gives a new design of CSP where including a flexible collector and absorber. The proposed CSP does not control only the absorbed temperature but also aims to obtain the maximum CSP temperature under different illumination and improve the production of the plant. The CSP efficiency is discussed and the effects of including dynamic sensor and absorber in the proposed control system are highlighted and compared with SAM to show the technological advancement of the proposed design.

TI A copula-based Bayesian method for probabilistic solar power forecasting
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB With increased penetration of solar energy sources, solar power forecasting has become more crucial and challenging. This paper proposes a copula-based Bayesian approach to improve probabilistic solar power forecasting by capturing the joint distribution between solar power and ambient temperature. A prior forecast distribution is first obtained using different underlying point forecasting models. Parametric and empirical copulas of solar power and temperature are then developed to update the prior distribution to the posterior forecast distribution. A public solar power database is used to demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed method. Numerical results show that the copula-based Bayesian method outperforms the forecasting method that directly uses temperature as a feature. The Bayesian method is also compared with persistent models and show improved performance. This article includes supplementary material (data and code) for reproducibility.

In this work, we investigate how compact PV-CSP hybrid systems with integrated thermal energy storage could allow increasing the annual output energy and the capacity factor of solar power plants. The energy yield and the capacity factor are calculated for two hybrid PV-CSP strategies and compared to that of a conventional CSP plant with consideration of the same storage technology for all the systems. The impact of the electric load value and the storage duration on both the energy yield and the capacity factor are finally discussed.

SO DEVELOPMENT SOUTHERN AFRICA
AB The paper provides an overview of the attractiveness of the global concentrating solar power (CSP) industry, analyses South Africa's current capabilities in developing a CSP manufacturing capacity, and then makes recommendations regarding policy measures and an associated industry roadmap for developing a competitive CSP industry in South Africa. The analyses highlight that cost reduction is currently the most important stumbling block for the large-scale rollout of CSP. From a supply, or technology-push, perspective, changes such as cost-effective production methods, improved products through directed research and development, and reductions in operating and installation costs could be implemented. From a demand, or technology-pull, perspective, more ambitious targets need to be incorporated into the current South African policies with reliable support schemes to ensure long-term investment security for CSP systems. Recommendations are made accordingly. Specifically, South Africa should continue to promote strategic collaborations with potential CSP investors to access funding possibilities for projects.

Taking as our starting point the material and energy requirements of existing operating systems such as the Shams1 Concentrating Solar Power plant, we scale these up to generate the real resource demands of a renewable electrical energy system to supply the entire planet - and find these to be feasible, particularly if it is China that takes on the manufacturing challenge.

TI The Value of Concentrating Solar Power and Thermal Energy Storage
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
AB This paper examines the value of concentrating solar power (CSP) and thermal energy storage (TES) in a number of regions in the southwestern United States. Our analysis shows that TES can increase the value of CSP by allowing more thermal energy from a CSP plant's solar field to be used, allowing a CSP plant to accommodate a larger solar field, and by allowing CSP generation to be shifted to hours with higher energy prices. We analyze the sensitivity of this value to a number of factors, including the optimization period, price and solar forecasting, ancillary service sales, and dry cooling of the CSP plant, and also estimate the capacity value of a CSP plant with TES. We further discuss the value of CSP plants and TES net of capital costs.

   energy storage system: A dynamic simulation
SO APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING
AB One of the efficient solar energy harvesting technics is the parabolic trough concentrated solar power plant. However, if the concentrated solar power plant were not equipped with a storage system, the power plant capacity factor would be deficient. Latent thermal energy storage system using phase change material (PCM) is a high energy density storage system to provide durable energy with a constant temperature. In this study, first, a dynamic analysis is performed implementing TRNSYS software on the parabolic trough concentrated solar power plant located in Shiraz, Iran. Consequently, this system is assisted by the latent thermal energy storage system to improve its performance and capacity factor. Several high-temperature PCMs, namely H250, NaNO3, KNO3, and KOH, are examined in the latent thermal energy storage system. The simulation depicts that owing to the operational condition of Rankin cycle in this study, using NaNO3 in the latent thermal energy storage system is the best option with a higher solar fraction (34.14%) among other examined PCMs. In this case, the solar fraction has been enhanced by 90.5% in comparison with the solar power plant without the latent thermal energy storage system. The economic analysis illustrates that the payback period, IRR and NPV of the added LIES system are obtained as 11 years, 15.6% and, 617825$, respectively. The result of the sensitivity analysis on NPV revealed that the electricity price has the most effect on NPV and enhancing the electricity price has a positive impact on NPV.

AB Solar power generation, unlike conventional forms of electricity generation, has higher variability and uncertainty in its output, because solar plant output is strongly impacted by weather. As the penetration rate of solar capacity increases, grid operators are increasingly concerned about accommodating the increased variability and uncertainty that solar power provides. This paper illustrates the impacts of increasing solar power penetration on ramping of conventional electricity generators by simulating the operation of the Independent System Operator New England (ISO-NE) power system. A production cost model was used to simulate the power system under five different scenarios, one without solar power and four with increasing solar power penetrations up to 18%, in terms of annual energy. The impact of solar power is analyzed on six different temporal intervals, including hourly and multi-hourly (2- to 6-hour) ramping. The results show how the integration of solar power increases the 1- to 6-hour ramping events of the net load (electric load minus solar power). The study also analyzes the impact of solar power on the distribution of multi-hourly ramping events of fossil fueled generators, and shows increasing 1- to 6-hour ramping events for all different generators. Especially generators with higher ramp rates like gas and oil turbine and internal combustion engine generators increased their ramping events by 200% - 280%. For other generator types, including gas combined cycle generators, coal steam turbine generators, and gas and oil steam turbine generators, more and higher ramping events occurred as well for higher solar power penetration levels.

The American Society of Mechanical Engineers and others are currently developing standards for concentrated solar power plants that have not come to fruition yet. In this study, the long-duration performance acceptance test was carried out for the integrated solar combined cycle solar field of Kurymat, Egypt. The work included measurement of meteorological and operational data, calculation of the thermal energy output, and auxiliary energy consumption of parabolic trough (PT) solar field during consecutive 14 days with 88 total operating hours, to verify the predicted performance metrics under specified test conditions. The testing procedures, model formulation and measured data uncertainties of the solar field were conducted. The model predictions and measured results with their uncertainties were compared. The study can be potentially advantageous for the current developing international performance testing codes to validate the proposed acceptance test guidelines of PT solar field.

TI Thermal power forecasting of solar power tower system by combining
   mechanism modeling and deep learning method
SO ENERGY
AB Concentrating solar power systems are proliferating around the world. However, the non-schedulable characteristic of thermal output presents considerable challenges to safe utilization of solar heat. So, seasonable forecasting of thermal output is going to be essential to both power grid and plant. In this paper, a hybrid forecasting method based on mechanism modeling and deep learning method is proposed. By mechanism modeling, the major meteorological factors used for forecasting are identified accurately, avoiding the subjectivity of chosen of model input features. By convolutional neural network and long short-term memory network, the input features are reconstructed, and the spatial-temporal coupling characteristics between meteorological factors are fully explored. Finally, the thermal power is output by fully connected layers. As a case study, the thermal power of a Solar Two-like concentrating solar power plant based on meteorological conditions of Zhangbei is forecasted, and the mean values of root mean square error and mean absolute error are 5.061 MWt and 2.871 MWt on the whole year, respectively. The results show that the methods proposed in paper can be effectively used for thermal power forecasting of concentrating solar power system. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO ENERGY STRATEGY REVIEWS
AB Iran's experience for deployment of concentrated solar power (CSP) goes back to Shiraz and Yazd power plants which became operational in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Despite the successful operation of these plants, design or construction of new CSP plants have not been announced since then. In this regard, a lack of thorough feasibility studies is evident. This study offers a general potential assessment and feasibility analyses of deployment and promotion of CSP in Iran. To identify suitable regions, the status of direct normal irradiation (DNI) and other significant factors are evaluated. The study also discusses the possibility of hybridizing CSP plants with other energy sources. Furthermore, the drivers, barriers, and challenges to promote CSPs in Iran are explored and discussed.

AB Dish-Stirling concentrating solar power systems are an efficient and reliable source of renewable energy, indicating a potential for large-scale grid integration in upcoming years. Various technical and policy considerations must be accounted for in the grid integration of dish-Stirling solar power plants, particularly related to potential grid integration requirements set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regarding power factor correction and low voltage ride-through capability. This paper discusses potential grid integration requirements for dish-Stirling concentrating solar power systems, along with the technical challenges in meeting such requirements. A summary of the dynamic model of a dish-Stirling system and its control unit for power grid integration studies is provided. An additional over-speed control loop is proposed in this paper to enhance the system's grid fault ride-through capability. A linear model of the system is derived for controller parameter design. Simulation studies are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed over-speed control algorithm. The system's steady-steady performance and dynamic response during a grid fault are simulated to identify potential problems and solutions for successful grid integration.

TI Modeling and parametric study of molten salt receiver of concentrating
   solar power tower plant
SO ENERGY
AB Central receiver is a key part of concentrating solar power tower plants, as it is not only responsible for the highly effective absorption of incident energy from the heliostat field, but also for efficient energy conversion from light to heat. Its performance will directly affect the system efficiency and generating capacity of the whole plant. In this paper, a comprehensive model of molten salt receiver, which uses the mult-section lumped parameter method, is clearly developed based on a molten salt solar power tower plant. In order to improve the reliability as well as the prediction accuracy of the developed model, the dynamic characteristics of the molten salt receiver are fully investigated by a step disturbance of external parameters. Besides, in order to improve the design level of molten salt receiver, the influence of key parameters on the performance of receiver system is also extensively studied. The results show that the incident solar flux, wind speed and absorptivity of heat-absorbing tube can greatly affect the performance of molten salt receiver system. In order to verify the validity of proposed model, the simulation results are compared with the published experimental data, and the results show the model has a high accuracy. Conclusions of this paper are good references for the design, control and commissioning of molten salt receiver systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The microgrids and the distributed generation units are considered as the key elements of smart grids and intelligent networks of the future. The current network systems are mostly based on conventional grids where the integration studies are highly required to adopt new generation units and consumers. In this context, the studies for integration of a solar power plant to existing network is realized along with the dynamic loading sequences of electric vehicle parking lot. The parking lot which is equipped with roof mounted photovoltaic panels is designed and simulated with daytime solar power generation data and randomly selected electric vehicle charging sequences. The dynamic response of the grid is observed in accordance with simulated solar power plant data and electric vehicle charging sequence variation along with connection scenarios. The study represents the simulation results and grid response which varies during daytime in accordance with solar power generation and consumption considering altered connection point scenarios. Finally, the effect of different scenarios on power generation, consumption are presented along with different connection variations to operate the system with reduced power consumption in a reliable way.

TI The Future of Solar Power in the United Kingdom
SO ENERGIES
AB We used detailed industry data to analyse the impacts of expected further cost reductions on the competitiveness of solar power in Britain, and assess whether the solar market can survive without support in the near future. We investigated three solar power markets: large-scale, ground-mounted solar farms (defined in our analysis as larger than a 5000 kilowatt system); commercial roof-top (250 kW); and residential rooftop (3 kW). We found that all three would be economic without support in the next decade. Such an outcome assumes progressively falling support under a stable policy regime. We found that unsubsidised residential solar power may be cheaper with battery storage within the next five to 10 years. Unsupported domestic solar battery packs achieve payback periods of less than 10 years by 2025. That could create an inflexion point driving adoption of domestic solar systems. The variability of solar power will involve some grid integration costs at higher penetration levels, such as more frequent power market scheduling; more interconnector capacity; storage; and backup power. These costs and responses could be weighed against non-market benefits including the potential for grid balancing; lower carbon and particulate emissions; and energy security.

SO ENERGY STORAGE
AB Site-based changes in the yearly solar radiation affect the plant performance parameters like efficiency, output, and cost of generation of concentrated solar power (CSP). The risks involved in setting up the plant can be minimized by performing simulations for a proper understanding of performance parameters. The present work considers detailed techno-economic viability using simulations to weigh out the performance dissemblance of CSP plants with and without thermal storage using parabolic trough concentrator with that of a photovoltaic system. Jodhpur, India is chosen as a test site for an assessment, and the results are validated with coequal plant in Andasol, Spain. GREENIUS is used to create a model 50MW CSP plant. The simulation results are found to be in close conjunction, at error less than 8%. A detailed techno-economic study was also done to clinch the optimum solar field based on power generation costs. Each design condition has arrived at least the cost of power generation. The result shows that CSP plant with 7-hour storage is the choicest combination in terms of the techno-economic bargain.

SO SURFACES AND INTERFACES
AB In this work, nanostructural Ag thin films and SiO2-Ag-SiO2 thin films were successfully fabricated on glass substrates by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering for use in Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) reflectors. The XRD results showed that Ag thin films deposited under different powers had face-centered cubic structures with preferred orientation of (111). The Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) results indicated a significant difference in the morphologies of Ag thin films. Also, increasing of power led to a correspondingly larger grain sizes from 8 to 25 nm. Film thickness tests showed that deposition rate changed almost linearly with increasing of power. The reflectance curves revealed that an amazing reflectance of SiO2-Ag-SiO2 thin films in near-infrared band can be obtained and it can be up to 99.97%. Most importantly, it is found that when SiO2 layer served as a medium layer, it can improve the film adhesion to a great degree, while it can served as a good protection layer with increasing reflectance when sputtered on the surface of Ag thin film.

AB A set of mineral salts and their mixtures are investigated for their application as thermal storage media and heat transfer fluids at high temperature concentrated solar power systems. A thermal storage medium needs to have high heat capacity and thermal stability at its operating range to store the heat, and the inorganic salt is one of plausible candidates for such application. The salt may also directly transfer the heat to a heat sink in its molten state if the salt has a reasonably low melting point. In addition to the thermal properties, the cost of media is another crucial factor to be considered as it has significant influence on the economic feasibility of the whole thermal storage system. Candidate mineral salts derived from common anion and cation are evaluated based on their properties and costs. A eutectic mixture is suggested after following a screening and evaluation procedure. The selected salt mixture will be applied to a pilot thermal storage system. The results of this study will contribute to elevating the economics and thereby facilitating the commercialization of concentrated solar power systems.

TI Modelling the thermodynamic performance of a concentrated solar power
   plant with a novel modular air-cooled condenser
SO ENERGY
AB This paper aims at developing a novel air-cooled condenser for concentrated solar power plants. The condenser offers two significant advantages over the existing state-of-the-art. Firstly, it can be installed in a modular format where pre-assembled condenser modules reduce installation costs. Secondly, instead of using large fixed speed fans, smaller speed controlled fans are incorporated into the individual modules. This facility allows the operating point of the condenser to change and continuously maximise plant efficiency. A thorough experimental analysis was performed on a number of prototype condenser designs. This analysis investigated the validly and accuracy of correlations from literature in predicting the thermal and aerodynamic characteristics of different designs. These measurements were used to develop a thermodynamic model to predict the performance of a 50 MW CSP (Concentrated Solar Power) plant with various condenser designs installed. In order to compare different designs with respect to the specific plant capital cost, a techno-economic analysis was performed which identified the optimum size of each condenser. The results show that a single row plate finned tube design, a four row, and a two row circular finned tube design are all similar in terms of their techno-economic performance and offer significant savings over other designs.

AB We estimate the capacity value of concentrating solar power (CSP) plants with thermal energy storage (TES) in the southwestern U. S. Our results show that incorporating TES in CSP plants significantly increases their capacity value. While CSP plants without TES have capacity values ranging between 60% and 86% of maximum capacity, plants with TES can have capacity values between 79% and 92%. We demonstrate the effect of location and configuration on the operation and capacity value of CSP plants. We also show that using a capacity payment mechanism can increase the capacity value of CSP, since the capacity value of CSP is highly sensitive to operational decisions and energy prices are not a perfect indicator of scarcity of supply.

TI Copper-alloyed spinel black oxides and tandem-structured solar absorbing
   layers for high-temperature concentrating solar power systems
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB Although renewable solar power plants are rapidly proliferating, high cost and the intermittent availability of solar power are still significant barriers for its penetration into the energy grid system. Concentrating solar power (CSP) offers an attractive alternative due to its integration with cost-effective thermal energy storage systems. To further reduce the cost of CSP, it is imperative to operate the plants at higher temperatures for enhanced efficiency. One of the key components for next-generation high-temperature CSP is the solar absorbing coating materials. In this work, we have developed tandem-structured solar absorbing layers with CuFeMnO4 and CuCr2O4 black oxide nanoparticles (NPs). These tandem structures exhibited a remarkably high solar-to-thermal conversion efficiency, or figure of merit (FOM), of 0.903, under the condition of 750 degrees C operating temperature and a solar concentration ratio of 1000. More importantly, the coating showed unprecedented durability, as demonstrated from long-term isothermal annealing at 750 degrees C in air as well as rapid thermal cycling between room temperature and 750 degrees C. Our results suggest that the tandem black oxide coating is suitable to meet the stringent demand of next-generation high-temperature CSP systems. The coating materials synthesis, structures, optical as well as thermal properties will be discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A general method to analyze the thermal performance of multi-cavity
   concentrating solar power receivers
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB Concentrating solar power (CSP) with thermal energy storage has potential to provide grid-scale, on-demand, dispatchable renewable energy. As higher solar receiver output temperatures are necessary for higher thermal cycle efficiency, current CSP research is focused on high outlet temperature and high efficiency receivers. The objective of this study is to provide a simplified model to analyze the thermal efficiency of multi-cavity concentrating solar power receivers. The model calculates an optimal aperture flux that maximizes the local efficiency, constrained by a maximum receiver working temperature. Using this flux, the thermal efficiency, receiver temperature, and heat transfer fluid (HTF) temperature are calculated based upon an optimized flux distribution. The model also provides receiver design and HTF heat transfer requirements to achieve the necessary overall thermal efficiency. From the results, possible HTFs can be investigated to determine which ones are feasible. A case study was performed on a multi-cavity tube receiver design to demonstrate the use of the model. The case study receiver design had an effective absorptivity of 99.8%, and was modeled with conservative values for thermal constraints. It was found that a HTF with a minimum convection coefficient between 250 and 500 W m(-2) K-1, depending on the convective heat transfer to the environment, is necessary to achieve a thermal efficiency greater than 90% for the receiver. The general model can provide a design guideline for attainable thermal efficiencies of multi-cavity concentrating solar power receivers given thermal constraints and heat transfer conditions.

TI Stochastic optimal dispatch of integrating concentrating solar power
   plants with wind farms
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS
AB Power systems face many challenges since the large-scale application of uncertain renewable energy. Concentrating solar power (CSP) plants with thermal energy storage (TES) can make solar energy a schedulable resource without increasing system uncertainty. Therefore, we consider manage uncertainty locally to integrate CSP plants with wind farms, reduce the uncertainty of output, and improve overall regulation efficiency and reliability. First, based on the energy transfer process between the modules of the CSP plant, we establish a CSP plant model in detail. And then considering the influence of solar direct normal irradiance (DNI) and wind power uncertainty on the dispatching operation, a stochastic optimal dispatch model is established. At last, the validity of the model is verified through an example. The analysis shows the advantages of combining CSP plants and wind farms, in addition to this, the influence of different confidence levels of chance constrained programming (CCP) on the entire system economy and spinning reserve capacity is also well illustrated.

AB The development of society is strongly dependent on water and electricity. There is an increasing water and energy demand driven by population growth and rising industrial and agricultural production. The combination of concentrated solar power (CSP) and desalination processes has a huge potential for producing both energy and water in arid regions suffering from fresh water scarcity and facing the current energy challenge. One of the regions is Middle East and North Africa (MENA), where plans are currently under discussion to make possible large CSP plants developments. The integration of desalination (CSP+D) into solar power plants could make CSP technology even more attractive in such regions. The focus of this study is thermodynamic characterization and an economic evaluation of different configurations for coupling parabolic trough solar power plants and desalination facilities at a MENA location in Egypt chosen as reference for its Southern coast (Port Safaga). The desalination technologies considered for the combination with parabolic trough concentrating solar power plants (PT-CSP), are low temperature multi-effect distillation (LT-MED) and reverse osmosis (RO). Moreover, an additional concept of LT-MED has been evaluated: a LT-MED powered by the steam obtained from a thermal vapor compressor (TVC). In this case, unlike the conventional thermal vapor compression process (TVC-MED), the entrained vapor to be used in the ejector comes from the exhaust steam from the low pressure (LP) turbine instead of an effect of the MED unit. In order to optimize this latter concept (LT-MED-TVC), different configuration schemes have been studied. When thermodynamic efficiencies and costs are analyzed comparing the two more efficient configurations (PT-CSP/RO and PT-CSP/LTMED), considering 58 degrees C/0.18 bar of exhaust turbine steam conditions and 5.5kWh/m(3) of RO power requirements, initial results are very similar.

TI Dynamic modeling and behavior of parabolic trough concentrated solar
   power system under cloudy conditions
SO ENERGY
AB As a promising application of solar energy, parabolic trough concentrating solar power with indirect thermal energy storage has been widely used in concentrating solar power plants constructed in China. The dynamic modeling and behavior of the power plants were important for achieving fast start-up and shut down and to overcome weather disturbances. This study investigated the dynamic characteristics of a 50 MW parabolic trough concentrating solar power plant with indirect thermal energy storage. Simplified cloud disturbances were simulated to obtain the dynamic characteristics of a power block coupled with solar field and thermal energy storage. Simulation results indicated that the thermal inertia of solar field is an order of magnitude larger than that of power block and thermal energy storage subsystems, and the heat transfer fluid temperature at the solar field outlet fluctuates within a narrow range at rated value under the control scheme of solar field. The disturbances caused by heat transfer fluid temperature fluctuation were reduced by thermal energy storage operation. To minimize the generation load fluctuation under thick-cloud condition, the thermal energy stored in solar field could be used to moderate the fluctuation caused by the start-up of thermal energy storage discharging exchanger.

SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Solar thermal technologies for power generation have become cost-effective, efficient, flexible, and play a prominent role in achieving low-carbon energy systems. Concentrated solar power is the main solar technology for large-scale power generation and can offer thermal energy storage capacity, delivering power to the grid with high reliability, high capacity factor and low cost. However, their operation is constrained by the maximum temperature allowable for the heat transfer fluids used (up to 565 ? using molten salts). Continuous efforts are in progress to demonstrate the scalability, reliability, functionality, and performance of different concentrated solar thermal components and liquid heat transfer fluids for third-generation concentrated solar power plants. Third-generation concentrated solar power plants are characterized by: (a) operating at temperatures above 700 C and (b) increasing the capacity, reliability, efficiency and stability of the system network. To date, several authors have evaluated the performance of novel liquid, solid particles and gaseous/supercritical heat transfer fluids, triggering intense development of new receivers, enhanced heat exchangers, storage systems, new materials, and their aging tests, among others. The present study compiles the recent literature referred to the liquid-pathway of third-generation concentrated solar power plants, emphasizing the relevant lines of research and the issues to be resolved in the coming years on high-temperature receivers, heat transfer fluids and storage concepts, as well as suitable high-temperature thermodynamic cycles.

AB Numerous research studies have focused on the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of solar energy systems, and more concretely, within the last decade, on the environmental performance of parabolic trough solar power plants. Due to ever-increasing global energy demands, the optimization of energy solutions to reduce adverse environmental impacts has been attracting research efforts. The study presented herein reports on the environmental perspective of parabolic through concentrated solar power (CSP) plants, focusing on greenhouse gas emissions. Existing studies on the environmental impacts of parabolic trough CSP plants show significant differences regarding the scope and frontiers of the LCA, database employed, raw materials, lifetime of the CSP plant, and temporal assumptions. The convergences and divergences appearing in the most relevant papers are recompiled, disaggregated by system and LCA phase, identifying the parameters with higher impacts and calculating the influence on environmental issues. The scientific literature review carried out demonstrated a knowledge gap on inventory data for parabolic trough CSP plants. This study provides a framework for the establishment of energy policies and standards, along with data for the environmental optimization of parabolic trough CSP plants. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present work, an algorithm, which gives us the cosine efficiency distribution of preliminary design of rotating heliostat field of solar tower power plant in the northern hemisphere, is presented. A regular radial staggered configuration is used. The variable radial distance between consecutives rows is computed considering the blocking factor constant for the entire solar field. A comparative performance analysis is developed between the existing PS 10 solar power plant in Spain, and the reconfigured one using the technology of rotating solar field concept. The study includes the cosine efficiency and the tower shadowing effect. The reconfigured model of PS10 is believed to be more promising than of the original one, in case it is adapted to suit the same technology.

In addition, existing drives adopting different types of electric motors are systematically reviewed. Finally, a comparative study of different commercial drives reveals that the drive cost per unit area and its cost share of the entire heliostat will increase with heliostats going smaller, thereby indicating more potentials and opportunities to further optimize electric drives and cut down the cost for heliostats with a small mirror size and better exploit sunlight for the maximum energy yield for solar tracking control.

TI Optimal configurations and operations of concentrating solar power
   plants under new market trends
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB It is a challenge for investors to decide optimal configurations and operations of a concentrating solar power plant because of the new market trends, namely that the governments no longer offer secured and fixed tariff schemes regulated by Power Purchase Agreements, nor do they continue to provide subsidy over the power plant's entire life. The concentrating solar power plant must adjust configurations and operations to address market price variation and subsidy decrease. This study presents a non-linear optimization model that captures the critical component investment costs and operational flexibility in the plant configuration. We use it to analyze economies of scale, thermal energy storage, economic curtailment, and hybrid systems with wind plant, and to evaluate their impact on plant configuration decisions under the new market trends. First, we find that the economic performance of the concentrating solar power plant, despite market price variation and subsidy decrease, can be enhanced substantially by optimal configurations and operations flexibility, which improve the overall plant utilization. Second, compared to the traditional fixed tariff scheme, the market-price-based tariff scheme can yield substantially higher net present value for the plant investment, due to the optimal configurations and flexible operations. Finally, our sensitivity analyses show that the optimal plant configurations are significantly affected by market price variations and the constraints of transmission line capacity.

TI Building an internationally competitive concentrating solar power
   industry in China: lessons from wind power and photovoltaics
SO ENERGY SOURCES PART B-ECONOMICS PLANNING AND POLICY
AB This article draws lessons from experiences of developing the photovoltaic (PV) and onshore wind power sectors in China for the development of Chinese Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) into an internationally competitive industry. We analyze the sectoral development with a framework that expands on the concept of lead markets, identifying factors that determine whether domestic industrial development paths may or may not generate export success. We find that the Chinese CSP sector has good potential for becoming internationally competitive because of a strong Chinese knowledge base, a clear eye for product quality, standard-setting, and a focus on the high-efficiency and large-storage technological routes most likely to see growing demand in future international markets. Chinese solar towers are already cheaper than international competitors and so far, appear reliable. However, continued and stable deployment support for CSP, designed to reward dispatchable solar power generation, enabling continued domestic learning-by-doing and -interacting is likely required to realize this export potential. To date, Chinese CSP policy has done many things right and, if the domestic market is maintained through renewed support, has put the Chinese industry well on the path to international competitiveness.

TI Mapping suitability areas for concentrated solar power plants using
   remote sensing data
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
AB The political push to increase power generation from renewable sources, such as solar energy, requires knowing the best places to site new solar power plants with respect to the applicable regulatory, operational, engineering, environmental, and socioeconomic criteria. Therefore, we present applications of remote sensing data for mapping suitable areas for concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. Our approach uses satellite data from National Aeronautical and Space Administration's Global Energy and Water Cycle Surface Radiation Budget project at a resolution of 1 deg for estimating global solar radiation for the study area. Then we develop a computational model built on a geographic information system (GIS) platform that divides the study area into a grid of cells and estimates the site suitability value for each cell by computing a list of metrics based on applicable site requirements using GIS data. The computed metrics include population density, solar energy potential, federal lands, and hazardous facilities. Overall, some 30 GIS datasets are used to compute eight metrics. The site suitability value for each cell is computed as an algebraic sum of all metrics for the cell with the assumption that all metrics have equal weight. Finally, we color each cell according to its suitability value. We present results for CSP that drives a stream turbine and parabolic mirror connected to a Stirling engine. (C) The Authors.

TI Design and calculation of a new storage tank for concentrating solar
   power plant
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB Concentrating solar power plant coupling with thermal energy storage is a popular technology during the solar application process. A multitude of researches focus on improving heat transfer performance of the whole system for getting the higher efficiency and lower cost. In this paper, a new storage tank for concentrating solar power has been designed, and the mathematical model of one-dimensional unsteady state heat conduction in cylindrical coordinates has been established and validated. Also, the charge time and the temperature of the tank have been investigated in the designing conditions based on this model. The results show that the new storage tank has a superior performance for the system in the charge period. The charge time from unsteady state to steady state heat conduction for the tank is about 9923 s. It can be found that there is a relatively good agreement of about 18.9% for the charge time between the mathematical model and the reference. The curve of the temperature versus the charge time for different thermal properties of the materials based on the model of this paper has been investigated. The results can provide a good reference for designing, operating, and energy-saving of thermal energy storage for concentrating solar power plants. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Capacity value estimation of random solar power through associative
   searching in a k-d tree
SO INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL ENERGY SYSTEMS
AB The estimation of capacity values of unconventional sources like solar and wind is quite difficult due to their intermittent nature. Mainly reliability-based methods are generally followed to calculate the capacity values. Intermittent solar power cannot be clubbed directly in the process of reliability calculation. Solar power is generally taken as negative load in adequacy assessment and subtracted from the load on hourly basis. Random solar radiation creates redundant solar power generation. Bypassing multiple estimations of capacity values for the redundant solar power, an approach is made to construct a database considering the incremental added capacities with their resulting loss of load expectation. The database is portrayed in a multidimensional k-d tree to locate queried expected loss of load of solar power effectively using nearest neighbor search algorithm. The algorithm is providing the best match record as well as the associated information like the capacity values stored along with that record. A case study of 75 MW of conventional with 15 MW solar powers is considered for the validation of the proposed methodology. Capacity values corresponding to each reliability-based methods resulted from the database seem to be satisfactory in evaluating the capacity values of solar power. The applicability of the proposed method is extended through implementing on the IEEE RTS system.

TI Coupling supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle with spray-assisted
   dry cooling technology for concentrated solar power
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB Supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO(2)) based Brayton cycle integrated with concentrated solar power applications is a promising technology to exploit solar energy for electricity production. To reduce the energy cost of this solar power plant, spray-assisted dry cooling technology is developed, which makes electricity more affordable for isolated and arid regions. However, pure dry cooling technology suffers from low efficiency under high ambient conditions and a spray cooling system has been proposed to address this problem. Due to the high cost and great complexity, experimental test of a designed spray cooling system on a natural draft dry cooling tower is never reported. Here a spray cooling system consisted of multiple nozzles was tested on a 20 m high experimental tower. This is, to our knowledge, the world's first attempt to practice spray enhancement of NDDCT at full scale. It is found that the introduced spray cooling can effectively precool the inlet hot air and consequently reduce the circulating water exit temperature. The promising application of this new technology in solar power plants was firstly revealed by integrating the tower into a 1 MW concentrated solar thermal sCO(2) Brayton cycle. As spraying water flowrate increases, cooling tower dissipates more waste heat, lowering the compressor inlet temperature and consequently improving the efficiency of thermal cycle. Power cycle simulations also show that cycle efficiency can be higher than 40.5% at the optimal circulating water flow rate, i.e., 4-5 kg/s, depending on the sCO(2) flow rate.

TI Mitigation Strategy for Duck Curve in High Photovoltaic Penetration
   Power System Using Concentrating Solar Power Station
SO ENERGIES
AB Concentrating solar power (CSP) station is counted as a promising flexible power supply when the net load power curve is duck-shaped in high photovoltaic (PV) penetration power system, which may lead to the serious phenomenon of PV curtailment and a large-capacity power shortage. This paper presents a mitigation strategy that replaces thermal power station with CSP station to participate in the optimal operation of power system for solving the duck-shaped net load power curve problem. The proposed strategy utilizes the dispatchability of thermal storage system (TSS) and the fast output regulation of unit in the CSP station. Simultaneously, considering the operation constraints of CSP station and network security constraints of the system, an optimization model is developed to minimize the overall cost including operation and penalty. The results obtained by nonlinear optimization function demonstrate that the replacement of concentrating solar power (CSP) station contributes to reducing the PV curtailment and lost load, while increasing the available equivalent slope for power balance. Thus, the proposed mitigation strategy can promote the penetration of PV generation and improve the flexibility of power system.

TI Concentrating solar power plant investment and operation decisions under
   different price and support mechanisms
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB The dispatch opportunities provided by storage-enhanced Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants have direct implications on the investment decisions as not only nameplate capacity but also the storage capacity and the solar multiple play a crucial role for the viability of the plant investment. By integrating additional technical aspects and operation strategies, this paper extends the optimization model proposed by Madaeni et al., How Thermal Energy Storage Enhances the Economic Viability of Concentrating Solar Power. Using a mixed integer maximization approach the paper yields both the optimal layout decision and the operation of CSP plants.
   Subsequently, the economic value of CSP storage is analyzed via energy modeling of a Spanish plant location under the respective wholesale market prices as well as the local feed-in tariff. The analysis shows that investment incentives for CSP plants with storage need to appropriately account for the interdependency between the price incentives and the plant operating strategy. As the resulting revenue characteristics influence the optimal size of solar field and storage differing operating strategies also give rise to differing optimal plant layouts. Most noteworthy, the current Spanish support scheme offers only limited incentives for larger thermal storage capacity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Concentrating Solar Power Technologies
SO ENERGIES
AB Nowadays, the evolution of solar energy use has turned into a profound issue because of the implications of many points of view, such as technical, social, economic and environmental that impose major constraints for policy-makers in optimizing solar energy alternatives. The topographical constraints regarding the availability of inexhaustible solar energy is driving field development and highlights the need for increasingly more complex solar power systems. The solar energy is an inexhaustible source of CO2 emission-free energy at a global level. Solar thermal technologies may produce electric power when they are associated with thermal energy storage, and this may be used as a disposable source of limitless energy. Furthermore, it can also be used in industrial processes. Using these high-tech systems in a large area of practice emboldens progress at the performance level. This work compiles the latest literature in order to provide a timely review of the evolution and worldwide implementation of Concentrated Solar Power-CSP-mechanization. The objective of this analysis is to provide thematic documentation as a basis for approaching the concept of a polygeneration solar system and the implementation possibilities. It also aims to highlight the role of the CSP in the current and future world energy system.

TI Sustainable design of a thermosolar electricity generation power plant
   in Burkina Faso
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Research towards renewable energy sources is of great relevance in the pursue of environmental impact reduction and to decrease the dependency on fossil fuels. In high solar irradiation locations, the use of Concentrating Solar Power technologies might be a good alternative in front of other power sources.
   This study presents how multi-criteria methods such as the weighted technical analysis are useful to select the best heat transfer fluid to be used in a relatively small Concentration Solar Power plant in the Burkina Faso. To do so it analyzes three aspects, the technical performance of thermal fluids, their environmental impact and their price, giving them different weights to confer more or less relevance according to the idiosyncrasy of the region.
   To do the technical analysis, this study simulates the heat gain and temperature increase of four heat transfer fluids while passing through a solar parabolic trough. The environmental impact factor is evaluated following the life cycle assessment methodology and the economic factor compares their price in the market.
   Results show that Dowtherm A is the best choice for Burkina Faso and Marlotherm is the worst, but these results change considerably if the comparison is done in the USA, where the environmental factor gains relevance in contrast to the economic factor.

TI Power cycles integration in concentrated solar power plants with energy
   storage based on calcium looping
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB Efficient, low-cost and environmentally friendly storage of thermal energy stands as a main challenge for large scale deployment of solar energy. This work explores the integration into concentrated solar power plants of the calcium looping process based upon the reversible carbonation calcination of calcium oxide for thermochemical energy storage. An efficient concentrated solar power-calcium looping integration would allow storing energy in the long term by calcination of calcium carbonate thus overcoming the hurdle of variable power generation from solar. After calcination, the stored products of the reaction (calcium oxide and carbon, dioxide) are brought together in a carbonator reactor whereby the high temperature exothermic reaction releases the stored energy for efficient power production when needed. This work analyses several power cycle configurations with the main goal of optimizing the performance of the overall system integration. Possible integration schemes are proposed in which power production is carried out directly (using a closed carbon dioxide Brayton power cycle) or indirectly (by means of a steam reheat Rankine cycle or a supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle). The results obtained show that the highest plant efficiencies (up to 45-46%) are achievable using a closed carbon dioxide Brayton power cycle. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The potential of solar energy based on the National Energy Council reaches 4.8-kilowatt-hours per square meter per day (kWH/m(2)/day). Therefore, portable solar power plants using photovoltaic have high possibility to be used as electricity sources in remote areas or as alternative energy when earthquakes and tsunamis occur. In this paper, the development of portable solar power plant is proposed with the capability to be connected to internet of things (IoT). The design specification of proposed portable solar power plant will depend on the electricity power required by the equipments. The use of components for realizing the proposed portable solar power plant must support the portability aspect. The realized portable solar power plant equipped with IoT connectability has demonstrated the output AC voltage of 224V at the frequency of 49.9Hz satisfying the electricity needs in remote areas or disaster-prone areas.

AB In order to reduce the CO2 emission of electric power grid, renewable energy resources such as solar power has become an important source of energy in our daily life. When integrated into the power grid, both the randomness of solar power and the ramping capacity of the thermal generation units should be considered in order to provide a feasible and economic schedule. We consider this important problem in this paper, and make the following major contributions. First, we formulate the scheduling problem in the day-ahead market as a stochastic programming, which uses the weather forecasting as well as the ramping capability of the units. Second, we generate different scenarios for the weather and apply the scenario-tree method to approximately solve the problem. Third, we compare our method with existing methods. Numerical results show that our method can improve the integration of solar power while maintain the constraint on ramping capacity of thermal units.

AB The speedy escalation in demand for energy and the constrained reserves of fossil fuel along with the environmentally harmful effects encourages researchers to explore novel opportunities for renewable energy resources. Concentrating solar power (CSP) is amongst the utmost hopeful technologies in the area of power generation, but the capital cost of CSP plants is comparatively greater concerning the other renewable energy generation choices. To keep CSP plants further viable, various potentials to lessen down the capital costs of CSP plants have been explored like assimilation of CSP with LFRs, integration of CSP plant with conventional power plants, and some geometrical changes in CSP dish to collect the most possible solar power and also the use of Stirling engine with CSP can enhance the performance of CSP based solar power plant which directly generates electricity without steam generation.Copyright (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Thermocline thermal storage systems for concentrated solar power plants:
   One-dimensional numerical model and comparative analysis
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB Concentrated solar power plants have attracted increasing interest from researchers and governments all over the world in recent years. An important part of these plants is the storage system which improves dispatchability and makes the plant more reliable. In this paper, a one-dimensional transient mathematical model for a single-tank thermocline thermal energy storage system is presented. The model used temperature dependent correlations to obtain the thermophysical properties for the heat transfer fluid and considered heat loss through the tank wall. The effect of variation in important system parameters like the type of heat transfer fluid, the storage temperature difference and the cycle cut-off criterion on system performance was investigated. The results suggest that two important aspects for assessing the performance of the system are the cyclic behaviour of the system and the time required to attain equilibrium conditions. These aspects directly influence the discharge capacity and discharge power of the storage system, and therefore play an essential role in understanding the start-up characteristics of the system and provide an insight regarding the availability of storage when designing the power cycle for concentrated solar power applications. It was also observed that the cycle durations and the time required to attain cyclic conditions are highly sensitive to not only the storage temperature difference, but also the cut-off temperature difference.

AB Solar power inverter is one of the core components in the PLTS system in order to produce the power or energy needed by the load. Solar power inverter is utilized to convert from DC energy (Direct Current) to AC (Alternating Current) to load. In this research, a simulation of a solar power inverter system on a photovoltaic system will be designed. Simulation needs to be done using SIMULINK-MATLAB software. Solar power inverter is developed using a boost converter as a controller and a Full Bridge Inverter. Boost converter is designed from 12VDC - 17 VDC to 300 VDC. Full-Bridge Inverter produces AC voltage of 240 VAC with modulation index 0.8 and frequency 60 Hz. Total Harmonic Distortion is 46.07%. Power of Photovoltaic Solar panels generated at 3500 watts by 1000 watt/m2 irradiation conditions and temperature temperatures of 25 degrees Celsius.

TI Sensitivity analysis for thermocline thermal storage tank design
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB Concentrated solar power coupled with thermal energy storage is a promising approach for providing the world with clean, renewable, sustainable and cost-competitive power on a large scale. Thermocline thermal energy storage has been proposed as an efficient and cost-competitive alternative to the traditional two-tank design. The thermocline thickness is directly linked to the efficiency of the storage tank. Sensitivity analysis is thus applied to a model of the thermocline thickness to identify the parameters that influence it the most. Results indicate that the tank height along with the thermophysical properties of the solid filler material influence the tank efficiency the most, with fluid properties and having a secondary effect.

AB Recently with the introduction of IoT (Internet-of Things), embedded devices are used in many ways. Supporting such devices requires cost-effective power supply and maintenance methods, because the number of devices in such environment easily becomes enormous. The use of solar power and rechargeable batteries among various energy-harvesting techniques for power supply to the embedded devices is an attractive approach because solar power is virtually abundant. However, we need to manage how to reserve and use the solar energy effectively because the power from the sun is available only during a certain period of time, and the amount harvested cannot be controlled. We present a simulator implemented to analyze the power management schemes for solar-powered embedded systems. Using the simulator, we compared how the power management techniques work with given environment. The results show that QoS based power management scheme can achieve higher performance than an online greedy method.

TI Control-Oriented Concentrated Solar Power Plant Model
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY
AB We model the dynamics of solar thermal plants-the first model covering all processes between market demand through power output at millisecond resolution-for the purpose of control design. Our model integrates solar reflectors, power tower, salt tank, boiler, turbine, generator, piping, and pumps along with the flows of energy and information between them. We show how our detailed model permits control designs that can potentially enhance the life of the power tower, and thereby aid in reducing generation costs of solar power to a level competitive to current electricity price. Our modeling also opens up several problems of control and optimization of concentrated solar power (CSP) plants that can quickly bring the maturity of CSPs near that of traditional coal-fired plants and aid their integration with the other power sources. We show some of this potential via simulations.

TI Locating Large Solar Power Satellites in the Geosynchronous Laplace

SO JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS
AB Designs for geostationary solar power satellites are extremely large in scale, more than an order of magnitude larger than the International Space Station. A detailed study of solar power satellites' orbit dynamics is performed, obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the effect of perturbations on orbits of large solar power satellite structures over a time frame commensurate with proposed solar power satellites' lifetimes (30-40 years). Analytical equations derived by the process of averaging of the solar power satellites' equations of motion are used to determine the long-term orbital behavior. Previous solar power satellite studies have simply assumed geostationary Earth orbit, then designed control systems for maintaining it thus. It is found that an alternative solar power satellite orbital location, known as the geosynchronous Laplace plane, is superior to geostationary in many aspects. A solar power satellite in the geosynchronous Laplace plane requires virtually no fuel to maintain its orbit, minimizes the risk of debris creation at geosynchronous altitude, and is extremely operationally robust (i.e., loss of control is inconsequential). The geosynchronous Laplace plane solar power satellite saves on order of 105 kg per year in fuel compared with a geostationary solar power satellite for near-equivalent power delivery. It is also found that the microwave beam orbit perturbation, which is unique to the solar power satellites, contributes toward stabilization of the longitude of the solar power satellites.

Solar energy is developing at a rapid pace, while the solar power plants output depends on weather conditions. Solar power plant output short-term forecasting is an urgent issue. The future electricity generation qualitative forecasts allow electricity producers and network operators to actively manage the variable capacity of solar power plants, and thereby to optimally integrate the solar resources into the country's overall power system. The article presents one of the possible approaches to the solution of the short-term forecasting problem of a solar power plant output.

TI A temperature threshold evaluation for thermocline energy storage in
   concentrated solar power plants
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB Regarding energy storage in concentrated solar power plants, thermocline technology is considered to be a cost effective but less efficient solution than conventional two-tank. However, thermocline storage charge and discharge are usually stopped when the varying outlet temperature reaches an arbitrarily chosen value. It is shown here that the stop of the thermocline charge depends on the overheating risk in the solar collectors, while the stop of the discharge is defined by the steam generator requirements. As a consequence, the temperature thresholds that must be defined by the experimental constraints are dynamic. Using these dynamic thresholds on an experimental setup comprising a 230 kWh thermocline tank and a 150 kW(th) parabolic trough solar field led to a charge efficiency of 95.7% and a 93.5% discharge efficiency. Thus, the varying outlet temperature of a thermocline storage system is not an issue when integrated in a concentrated solar power plant.

AB A previously developed model of a concentrating solar power plant has been modified to accommodate doping the heat transfer fluid with nano particles. The model with its unalloyed heat transfer fluid has been validated with actual operating data beforehand. The thermo physical properties of the heat transfer fluid were modified to account for the nano particle doping. The nano particle content in the heat transfer fluid was then varied to evaluate its influence on solar power generation. The model was run to simulate plant operation on four different days representing the four different seasons. As the nano particle concentration was increased, heat losses were slightly reduced, transient warm up heat was increased, transient cool down heat was reduced, and the overall impact on power generation was trivial. Doping heat transfer fluids with nano particles does not seem promising for solar thermal power generation from a performance perspective. Moreover, doping heat transfer fluids with nano particles involves many other operational challenges such as sedimentation and abrasion.

We propose an ultralight, modular power station, having specific power in the range of 1-10 kW/kg for the photovoltaic (PV) collection subsystem. The building block of the power station is the 'tile,' a self-contained element that performs PV energy collection, conversion to radio frequency (RF), and transmission to earth. To minimize PV mass, we select a 1D, 10-20X parabolic trough concentrator geometry, which provides cooling and radiation shielding for the cells, and which folds flat for deployment. Here, we discuss the design, fabrication, and testing of the initial PV tile prototypes.

AB In a context of sustainable development, enthusiasm for concentrated solar power technologies is developing. So, the CSPIMP (Concentrated Solar Power efficiency IMProvement) project started in 2013 in order to achieve a better competitiveness for the CSP plants. Its main target is to develop new procedures to improve steam turbine start up cycles, maintenance activities and plant control. One challenge in the project is to better forecast the solar resource in order to optimize plants operation. The development of a clear sky model is therefore an essential step to forecast Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) because clear sky represents the nominal operating conditions of a concentrating solar power plant. This paper focuses on estimating DNI under clear-sky conditions using a knowledge model based on the coefficient of relative optical air mass, DNI and atmospheric turbidity fluctuations. The satisfactory results obtained validate the proposed methodology. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This work deals with the application of femtosecond-laser-inscribed fiber Bragg gratings (FsFBGs) for monitoring the internal high-temperature surface distribution (HTSD) in solar receivers of concentrating solar power (CSP) plants. The fiber-optic sensor system is composed of 12 FsFBGs measuring points distributed on an area of 0.4 m(2), which leads to obtain the temperature map at the receiver by means of two-dimensional interpolation. An analysis of the FsFBG performance in harsh environment was also conducted. It describes the influence of calibration functions in high-temperature measurements, determines a required 10 nm spectral interval for measuring temperatures in the range from 0 to 700 degrees C, and reveals wavelength peak tolerances in the FsFBG fabrication process. Results demonstrate the viability and reliability of this measuring technique, with temperature measurements up to 566 degrees C.

The first is parabolic solar dish systems powering a micro gas turbine by focusing solar energy to a focal area to heat the air in a Brayton cycle. The use of micro gas turbines can lead efficient, reliable and cost-effective technology. The second technology is small scale organic Rankine cycles (ORCs) that can be used to generate electricity from low grade heat, either generated as waste from industry processes and thermal plants, or from concentrated solar power. Although large scale ORCs have been successfully commercialised, there is still research and development required to achieve wide commercialisation at small scale, particularly regarding expanders.

TI The MED-CSD Project: Potential for Concentrating Solar Power
   Desalination Development in Mediterranean Countries
SO JOURNAL OF SOLAR ENERGY ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
AB Within the MED-CSD project, feasibility studies of integrated hybrid concentrating solar power (CSP) and seawater desalination (DES) plants were carried out in selected locations in Morocco, Italy, Cyprus, Egypt and Gaza/West Bank. After a review on CSP and desalination technologies, ten typical sites within the five partner countries have been selected. For each location, a CSP-DES plant was modeled. The model bases on hourly time series of solar irradiance, ambient temperature, as well as wind speed and includes local seasonal and hourly load curves for power and water. Surplus thermal energy from the solar field is fed into the energy storage, so that operation is possible at night and during cloud transients; gaps between demand and solar power production are covered by cofiring with fossil fuel. Different plant components (solar field collectors and desalination technologies) have been compared. A techno-economic model is applied in order to analyze the economic feasibility and the required financial framework conditions of the projects. Furthermore, an analysis of the market potential of concentrating solar power for sea water desalination in the Mediterranean Region and socio-economic and environmental impact analyses were implemented.

AB The Chinese power generation capacity is kept increasing to keep the pace with the rapidly growing economy, but the current coal-dominant power construction has resulted in serious environmental impacts as well as rapid depletion of the primary energy resources. The concentrating solar power (CSP) utilizes solar insolation to produce electric power, thus the non-renewable energy resources can be saved. CSP has already nearly 20 years' experiences of commercial-scale operation in the United States, but it is still in the initial stage in China. The Chinese government aims to promote this technology as part of the solution. This paper presents a feasibility study of CSP in China from the angles of solar radiation resource, geography and Infrastructure, etc.. For comparison, perspectives of the three kinds of CSP including parabolic, tower and dish, are studied respectively to evaluate their potential in China. Also in this paper an overview of the current policies and measures in China to support the development of concentrating solar power is performed. From the study it is concluded that some areas in North-West can be selected as candidate to build the CSP plant, and parabolic and tower are two technologies with potential in China.

TI Potential of concentrating solar power (CSP) technology in Tunisia and
   the possibility of interconnection with Europe
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB In this paper, the potentials of solar resources and the suitable factors for the deployment of concentrated solar power CSP in Tunisia were presented. This study was done in the framework of the enerMENA project which aims to prepare the ground towards a sustainable realization of CSP power plants in the North Africa and Middle-East countries. Moreover, the electrical interconnection between Tunisia and Italy and the opportunity of the exploitation of renewable energy sources such as CSP plants in North Africa by European countries, were discussed. In addition, solar radiations data and weather parameters values delivered by a specific network of solar radiation and weather data installed in the Tataouine region at the south of Tunisia, were discussed from the angle of fitting with CSP technology. Besides, simulations of 50 MW parabolic trough solar power plant based on the solar radiation and climatic data delivered by the installed station were performed. The energetic and economic performances of the Tunisian simulated plant were compared with a reference CSP plant Andasol in Spain. The results prove that Tunisia has very important solar resources suitable for the CSP deployment such as the direct solar radiation DNI. Even, the total annual production of electricity generated from the simulated field of Tataouine exceeds that of the plant of Andasol in Spain by an amount of 1793 MWhe. However, the total investment cost is more important in the case of Tataouine station in Tunisia. A concentrated solar power project becomes economically competitive in Tunisia when the majority of the plant components such the collectors structure, the mirrors and the storage system should be manufactured locally in Tunisia to minimize the transport fees and by the way create jobs and enhances the local industry to investigate in this field.

TI Characterization and mapping of photovoltaic solar power plants by
   Landsat imagery and random forest: A case study in Gansu Province, China
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Numbers and sizes of photovoltaic solar power plants have grown unprecedentedly over the last few years in China, which aims to achieve a carbon emission peak by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. Thus, timely and accurate monitoring of photovoltaic solar power plants is crucial to the design and management of renewable electricity systems in China. Random forest algorithm has been used to map photovoltaic solar power plants at multiple scales, however, it always causes several salt-and-pepper noises, limiting its application at larger spatial scales. Here we first develop a photovoltaic solar power plant mapping method through integrating time series Landsat imagery, random forest, and morphological characteristics. Then we apply this method in Gansu Province, which has abundant solar and wind energy resources and provide large amounts of potential lands for photovoltaic development, and generate the annual photovoltaic maps from 2015 to 2020. We further analyze the spatial-temporal dynamics of sizes and areas of photovoltaic solar power plants and major land cover conversion of expansive photovoltaic regions. Finally, we discuss the reliability, uncertainties, implications, and future development of our improved methods. We find our photovoltaic mapping method can remove most of salt-and-pepper noises effectively, and the resultant maps in Gansu for 2020 have very high accuracies with user's and producer's accuracies of 97.57% and 99.22%, respectively. There are 165.29 km2 photovoltaic solar power plants in Gansu for 2020, and most of which are located in the northwestern Gansu. In addition, the photovoltaic with patch size > 1 km2 and & LE; 2 km2 (53.4 km2, 32.3%) has largest patch number (39, 15.7%). The improved photovoltaic mapping methods and further analysis in this study provide critical information for accurate and automatic classification of photovoltaic solar power plants in the future, as well as the environmental and sustainable development of solar energy in China.

TI Optimizing vehicle fleet and assignment for concentrating solar power
   plant heliostat washing
SO IISE TRANSACTIONS
AB Concentrating solar power central-receiver plants use thousands of sun-tracking mirrors, i.e., heliostats, to reflect sunlight to a central receiver, which collects and uses the heat to generate electricity. Over time, soiling reduces the reflectivity of the heliostats and, therefore, the efficiency of the system. Current industry practice sends vehicles to wash heliostats in an ad hoc fashion. We present a mixed-integer nonlinear program that determines wash vehicle fleet size, mix, and assignment of wash crews to heliostats to minimize the sum of (i) the revenues lost due to heliostat soiling, (ii) the costs of hiring wash crews and operating the vehicles, and (iii) the costs of purchasing wash vehicles. We establish conditions for convexity of the objective function, and then propose a decomposition method that enables near-optimal solutions to the wash vehicle fleet sizing and assignment problem on the order of a couple of minutes. These solutions yield hundreds of thousands of dollars in savings per year over current industry practices.

TI Solar power generation intermittency and aggregation
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The inherent intermittency of solar power due to diurnal and seasonal cycles has usually resulted in the need for alternative generation sources thereby increasing system operation costs. However, when solar power is spread over a large geographical area with significant time differences, the intermittency can be significantly reduced and also the electricity market balancing cost. The aim of this article is to address the fundamental scientific question on how the intermittency of solar power generation is affected by aggregation, which is of great interest in the wider power and energy community and would have profound impacts on the solar energy integration into the energy supply and Net-Zero Implementation. This article goes beyond the typical regional analysis by investigating solar power intermittency at 5 aggregation levels from a global perspective based on global 7 year hourly meteorological re-analysis data with a fine spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees(similar to 28 km x 28 km). In the proposed assessment framework, a coefficient of variation (CV) is used to quantify solar power intermittency and hence characterize the potential benefits of wide area solar power aggregation. A duration curve is used to characterize the intermittency in terms of power availability and a probability density function is further employed to investigate the dispersion and scaling behavior of CV at different aggregation levels. The findings indicate that the CV of solar power generation of 'Inner Mongolia' in China drops from 129.65 to 105.65% in the level of 'Asia' (by 24% decrease), to 56.11% in 'Asia-North_America' (by 73.54% decrease) and to the smallest 43.50% in 'Global' (by 86.15% decrease), nearly 3.5 times of that in 'Asia'; (b) the availability of solar power generation increases from 52.17% in Germany, to 73.30% in 'Europe_EU_plus', to 77.82% in `Europe', to 98.59% in 'Europe-North_America' (80.60% in 'Europe-Africa', 96.90% in 'Europe-Asia'), to 100% in 'Global'. Finally, conclusions and recommendations are provided to support a Net-Zero strategy.

TI Concentrating solar power technologies for solar thermal grid
   electricity in Nigeria: A review
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Grid electricity generation in Nigeria has been unstable for a long time now. With respect to her continued dependence on oil and gas and seasonal variations on water level for hydropower, immediate reliable and steady electricity generation in the country is not guaranteed. Incorporating alternative source of energy like solar is a solution. Solar Chimney technology is not yet technically and economically mature, as investment on it is still low, thereby posing more financial risks at least at the megawatt capacity. Photovoltaic and Solar Thermal technologies are technically and economically more established, but they can only ensure 24-h power supply with the aid of energy storage systems. Solar thermal value addition is on its propensity for thermal energy storage and hybridization with liquid fuels at commercial capacity. Hence, due to technology advancement and the country's high direct normal irradiation potential, concentrating solar power is the more suitable solar power technology for commercial electricity generation in Nigeria. In this paper, concentrating solar power technologies are analysed under operational, environmental and social conditions in Nigeria using data from desktop survey to determine the most suitable technology for solar thermal electric power plant. It is observed that the technical maturity of parabolic trough concentrator distinguishes it for preference to all other technologies and would exert moderate pressure on land requirement even though, it is the most expensive and water demanding technology. In terms of unit cost of electricity and water usage capabilities, parabolic dish concentrator is least expensive and uses least water but lacks proven commercial application. Solar tower is technically simpler and possesses better thermodynamic properties than the rest but its low installed capacity increases its financing risk. Hence, the trough system is the most suitable for immediate and medium term projects given its proven technology maturity and flexible financing mechanism.

TI A New Solar Power Prediction Method Based on Feature Clustering and
   Hybrid-Classification-Regression Forecasting
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
AB Solar generation systems are globally extending in terms of scale and number, which highlights the increasing importance of solar power forecast. In this paper, a day-ahead solar power prediction method is proposed including 1) a novel feature selecting/clustering approach based on relevancy and redundancy criteria and 2) an innovative hybrid-classification-regression forecasting engine. The proposed feature selecting/clustering approach filters out irrelevant features and partitions relevant features to two separate subsets to decrease the redundancy of features. Each of these two subsets is separately trained by one forecasting engine and the final solar power prediction of the proposed method is obtained by a relevancy-based combination of these two forecasts. The proposed forecasting engine classifies the historical data based on the learnability of its constituent regression models and assigns each class of training samples to one regression model. Each regression model predicts the outputs of the test samples that belong to its class. The effectiveness of the proposed solar power prediction method is illustrated by testing on two real-world solar farms.

TI Weighting Factor Selection of the Ensemble Model for Improving Forecast
   Accuracy of Photovoltaic Generating Resources
SO ENERGIES
AB Among renewable energy sources, solar power is rapidly growing as a major power source for future power systems. However, solar power has uncertainty due to the effects of weather factors, and if the penetration rate of solar power in the future increases, it could reduce the reliability of the power system. A study of accurate solar power forecasting should be done to improve the stability of the power system operation. Using the empirical data from solar power plants in South Korea, the short-term forecasting of solar power outputs were carried out for 2016. We performed solar power forecasting with the support vector regression (SVR) model, the naive Bayes classifier (NBC), and the hourly regression model. We proposed the ensemble method including the selection of weighting factors for each model to improve forecasting accuracy. The forecasted solar power generation error was indicated using normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) compared to the plant capacity. For the ensemble method, the results of each forecasting model were weighted with the reciprocal of the standard deviation of the forecast error, thus improving the solar power outputs forecast accuracy.

AB The operation of solar energy systems is necessarily transient. Over the lifetime of a concentrating solar power plant, the system operates at design conditions only occasionally, with the bulk of operation occurring under part-load conditions depending on solar resource availability. Credible economic analyses of solar-electric systems requires versatile models capable of predicting system performance at both design and off-design conditions. This paper introduces new and adapted simulation tools for power tower systems including models for the heliostat field, central receiver, and the power cycle.
   The design process for solar power tower systems differs from that for other concentrating solar power (CSP) technologies such as the parabolic trough or parabolic dish systems that are nearly modular in their design. The design of an optimum power tower system requires a determination of the heliostat field layout and receiver geometry that results in the greatest long-term energy collection per unit cost. Research presented in this paper makes use of the DELSOL3 code (Kistler, 1986) which provides this capability. An interface program called PTGEN was developed to simplify the combined use of DELSOL3 and TRNSYS. The final product integrates the optimization tool with the detailed component models to provide a comprehensive modeling tool set for the power tower technology.

TI Effect of Stratospheric Aerosols on Direct Sunlight and Implications for
   Concentrating Solar Power
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Light scattering calculations and data show that stratospheric aerosols reduce direct sunlight by about 4 W for every watt reflected to outer space. The balance becomes diffuse sunlight. One consequence of deliberate enhancement of the stratospheric aerosol layer would be a significant reduction in the efficiency of solar power generation systems using parabolic or other concentrating optics. There also would be a reduction in the effectiveness of passive solar design.

AB Solar power is spreading all over the world due to energy policy. Increasing pollution and energy price force to improve solar energy rate in total energy. On the contrary, solar power has some drawbacks. Environmental conditions such as dust, shadow and heat directly affect the solar power cell capability. Especially shadow is one of the biggest problem may can cause broken the cell increasing internal heating of cell under load. Moreover, in case of the shadow position or angle any leg of solar power may collapse and other side of leg force the collapsed side to broke via reverse current flows. Generally, maximum power point tracking method is based on reducing power flows related to generated solar power and only could be adjusted current flows regarding instant cell capability. In this study, a hardware organization was created by microcontroller to obtain maximum power ability. Grouped all cells could be connected each other's. Created groups are paralleled to increase current capability.

TI Assessment of different configurations for combined parabolic-trough
   (PT) solar power and desalination plants in arid regions
SO ENERGY
AB The combination of desalination technology into concentrating solar power (CSP) plants needs to be considered for the planned installation of CSP plants in arid regions. There are interesting synergies between the two technologies, like the possibility of substituting the condenser of the power cycle for a thermal desalination unit. This paper presents a thermodynamic evaluation of different configurations for coupling parabolic-trough (PT) solar power plants and desalination facilities in a dry location representing the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The integration of a low-temperature multi-effect distillation (LT-MED) plant fed by the steam at the outlet of the turbine replacing the condenser of the power cycle has been simulated and compared with the combination of CSP with a reverse osmosis (RO) plant. Furthermore, an additional novel concept of concentrating solar power and desalination (CSP+D) has been evaluated: a LT-MED powered by the steam obtained from a thermal vapour compressor (TVC) using the exhaust steam of the CSP plant as entrained vapour and steam extracted from the turbine as the motive vapour of the ejector. This new concept (LT-MED-TVC) has been analyzed and compared with the others, evaluating its optimization for the integration into a CSP plant by considering different extractions of the turbine.

AB The utilization of solar power is one of the most effective approaches to achieve the goal of energy conservation and emission reduction for industrial areas. However, the temperature of the collected heat in a typical non-concentrating solar power collector is normally lower than 90 degrees Celsius, which indeed dissatisfies the demand of the heat required in this industry. Thus, in order to obtain an efficient source of heat, the condensed solar power heating technology will be put into practice in accordance with the features of low energy density and intermittence corresponding to solar power. In this paper, we firstly validate the correctness of the mathematical model of the efficient solar power heating system based on lenticular condensation. Thereafter, the practical design based on the verified mathematical model can be produced. Finally, the simulated results have been analyzed in detail and the assets of this design can thus be revealed.

TI Design Implication of a Distribution Transformer in Solar Power Plants
   Based on Its Harmonic Profile
SO ENERGIES
AB This article presents a comparative analysis for the design considerations for a solar power generation transformer. One of the main existing problems in transformer manufacturing is in the renewable energy field, specifically the solar power generation, where the transformer connected to the inverter is operated under a certain harmonic content and operating conditions. The operating conditions of the transformer connected to the inverter are particularly unknown for each solar power plant; thus, the transformer will be subject to a particular harmonic content, which is defined by the inverter of the solar power plant. First, the fundamental calculations for solar power plant transformer and the proposed methodology for the design calculation of the distribution pad-mounted three phase transformer are presented. Then, a design study case is described where a distribution transformer and an inverter of a particular solar power plant are used for the analysis. Next, the transformer under analysis is modeled using finite element analysis in ANSYS Maxwell(R) software, where the transformer will be designed for a non-harmonic and harmonic content application. Lastly, the main design parameters, flux density, the core losses and the winding excitation voltage of the transformer are calculated and presented in results and discussion section.

TI Electromagnetic and Thermodynamic Analysis to Predict the Serious
   Life-threatening Implications of Future Massive Solar Energy Application
SO ENERGY SOURCES PART A-RECOVERY UTILIZATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS
AB In this article, by an electromagnetic and thermodynamic analysis, it is finally predicted that future massive solar power application will pose a serious threat to life. To the eventual aim, it is first argued that life feeds on low entropy. Then, two physical theorems are proven, which clearly show the severe limitations in doing macroscopic work for future large-scale solar power use: First, low-density solar radiation limitation, and second, positive entropy generation limitation. These limitations force the observation that solar radiation must be extremely concentrated to produce a gigantic amount of work. Accordingly, some future practical implications of concentrated solar power use are considered. Combining these physical limitations with a discussion of the biophysical limit, some inferences are made leading to the final prediction above. In conclusion, for the preservation of life, it is proposed that present and future massive energy consumption must be strictly avoided.

TI An Empirical Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms for Solar Power
   Forecasting in a High Dimensional Uncertain Environment
SO IETE TECHNICAL REVIEW
AB In the fabric of energy generation, solar power is the most promising clean energy solution as an alternative to non-renewable energy sources. However, solar power's dependency on environmental factors adds uncertainty to energy production. In such a scenario, solar power forecasting provides an edge to mitigate this uncertainty and improves overall system stability. Recently, machine learning (ML) models have been extensively deployed for designing and forecasting solar power. However, data pre-processing, forecast horizon, and performance evaluation of ML algorithms have to be carefully evaluated to find an accurate model. This paper provides an empirical comparison of different generation ML models for solar power forecasting, which can help understand future research on which method to adopt, depending on the ML model's strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, an effective forecasting method is designated in aspects such as performance errors, convergence time, and computational complexity. So, this work rates different ML models on error performance metrics and convergence time. Moreover, cross-fold validations and hyperparameter are also examined for the top five performing models for a comprehensive evaluation and to give more intuitive and calibrated insight into various stakeholders working in the solar power plant modeling field.

TI China's energy efficiency improvement on account of the development of
   wind and solar power: Applying a dynamic non-radial directional distance
   function
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB China is developing wind energy and solar power as the main channels to deal with climate warming and has put forward the goal of achieving peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutralization by 2060. Previous studies evaluating the nation energy efficiency rarely consider the impact of wind and solar power. Thus, different from past literature, this research introduces Carbon Emission Reduction Capacity (CERC) by wind and solar power as a new output variable and applies a dynamic non-radial directional distance function to evaluate China's energy efficiency from 2011 to 2019. The empirical results show that northwest provinces with their high proportion of wind and solar power present better energy performance, while some eastern and central provinces with high efficiency as seen in previous study have greater room for improvement of wind and solar power. It is suggested that the China government formulate more flexible policies to support the sustainable development of wind and solar power, so as to reduce the consumption of fossil energy and cope with climate warming.

AB Photovoltaics (PV) is becoming a mainstream electricity provider and the need for PV cells will spike compared to current demand. Solar power is based on obtaining electricity from solar radiation by using either photovoltaic cells or concentrated solar power (CSP). Both systems have different requirement to the area and advantages. However, there are several common disadvantages, which are related to the initial cost and regulatory issues that prevent investors from starting up such projects. Based on these premises the utilization of the solar power was examined in this study by highlighting the world's sustainable energy potential and investment statistics. Therefore research analysis related to the solar energy potential is presented as well. Although, the sustainable energy is the future of the world and requires slightly less amount of expense after installation, compared to conventional energy sources, the installation costs are the predominant factor of the utilization of the sustainable energy technologies. Furthermore, this study makes an overview of the world's solar power capacity today and makes prediction for the future. This study presents comprehensive market data together with forecasts for the short-run, while the role of PV is discussed considering the demand of energy.

TI Solar power forecast for a residential smart microgrid based on
   numerical weather predictions using artificial intelligence methods
SO JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING
AB Solar power forecast is a much needed means for grid operators, particularly in residential micmgrids, to manage the produced energy in a dispatchable fashion. Deterministic methods are unable to accurately forecast the intermittent solar power generation since they depend on unique sets of inputs and outputs. Therefore, stochastic methods and artificially intelligent (AI) strategies are utilized for solar power forecast. In this work, a neural network (NN) -based numerical weather prediction (NWP) model is developed for a residential microgrid in San Diego, California considering all key weather parameters such as cloud coverage, dew point, solar zenith angle, precipitation, humidity, temperature, and pressure in the year 2016. The developed weather model is then used to predict the generated power in the residential smart micmgrid. To validate the accuracy of the model, the solar irradiance and generated solar power in the residential microgrid are predicted for the year 2017 using the obtained NN-based model. The results are compared with the actual solar irradiance and power in 2017 to evaluate and validate the accuracy of the developed model. Furthermore, to showcase the effectiveness of neural networks in forecasting solar power and the accuracy of the NN-based model, the results are compared with those of two other methods including multi-variable regression (MVR) and support vector machine (SVM) approaches using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and mean squared error (MSE) criteria.

TI Multicycle activity of natural CaCO3 minerals for thermochemical energy
   storage in Concentrated Solar Power plants
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB Thermochemical energy storage in Concentrated Solar Power plants by means of the Calcium-Looping process is a promising novel technology that would allow for a higher share of renewables. A main benefit of this technology is the use of widely available, non-toxic and environmentally friendly calcium carbonate minerals as raw materials to store energy. Efficient integration of the Calcium-Looping process into Concentrated Solar Power plants involves the endothermic calcination of CaCO3 in the solar receiver while the exothermic carbonation of CaO is carried out at high temperature under high CO2 partial pressure. The heat released by this reaction is carried out by the excess CO2 and employed for power generation by means of a closed CO2 cycle. This work explores the multicycle Calcium-Looping performance of naturally occurring CaCO3 minerals such as limestone, chalk and marble for thermochemical energy storage in Concentrated Solar Power plants. Despite their similar composition (almost pure CaCO3), these minerals exhibit a significant difference in their Calcium-Looping multicycle activity, which may be attributed to differences in particle size and microstructure. Pore plugging at the Calcium-Looping conditions for thermochemical energy storage tested in our work is a main limiting mechanism on the multicycle CaO carbonation activity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study aims to investigate comparative techno-economic benefits of biomass combustion and anaerobic digestion systems as retrofit to concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. In this regard, technical parameters of an existing CSP plant currently in operation in Ottana (Italy) have been adopted for analyses. The biomass combustion technology involves direct burning of solid biomass in a furnace, while the anaerobic digestion technology entails biogas production from fruit and vegetable wastes. For the two technologies, the biomass retrofit system was proposed to constantly supply 45% of the nominal thermal power demand of the power block. Results demonstrated the energetic and economic benefits arising from the hybridization of existing CSP plants, both in terms of enhancement of the plant capacity factor and reduction of the cost of energy. Preliminary economic analysis highlighted the direct combustion of solid biomass as a more cost-effective option, while anaerobic digestion biogas plant suffers from substantial installation costs.

TI Characterization of Solar-Aged Porous Silicon Carbide for Concentrated
   Solar Power Receivers
SO MATERIALS
AB Porous silicon carbide is a promising material for ceramic receivers in next-generation concentrated solar power receivers. To investigate its tolerance to thermal shock, accelerated ageing of large coupons (50 x 50 x 5 mm) was conducted in a solar furnace to investigate the effects of thermal cycling up to 1000 degrees C, with gradients of up to 22 degrees C/mm. Non-destructive characterization by computed X-ray tomography and ultrasonic inspection could detect cracking from thermal stresses, and this informed the preparation of valid specimens for thermophysical characterization. The effect of thermal ageing on transient thermal properties, as a function of temperature, was investigated by using the light-flash method. The thermophysical properties were affected by increasing the severity of the ageing conditions; thermal diffusivity decreased by up to 10% and specific heat by up to 5%.

AB The implementation of Concentrated Solar Power for industrial applications has become a topic of high interest both for CSP plants developers and potential client industries. The integration of CSP for industrial processes can be done follow various needs ranging from power generation to steam generation, drying, heating and even cooling applications. Although the interest for the latter "less common" applications has gained more importance for researchers over power generation, this options has still a lot of interest for industrials especially when this power generation can be more flexible and cheaper thanks to a good Thermal Storage System integration and to encouraging market conditions and availability of the solar resource.
   In this paper we studied the possibility for large industrial facilities to exploit small scale CSP plants as fossil fuel and grid saving mechanism considering the variable grid pricing and an appropriate TES integration.

SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB Li2CO3-K2CO3 and its nanofluids have been widely studied for thermal energy storage media in concentrated solar power due to their largely enhanced specific heat capacity values. On the other hand, Li2CO3-Na2CO3 and its nanofluids have not been explored although Li2CO3-Na2CO3 has a larger specific heat capacity than Li2CO3- K2CO3. Therefore, in this study, we synthesized Li2CO3-Na2CO3 and Li2CO3-K2CO3 pure salt eutectic mixtures and their nanofluids. These mixtures were then tested for three distinct thermophysical properties, specific heat capacity, viscosity, and thermal stability. The obtained experimental results of all four systems were evaluated for use as thermal energy storage media in concentrated solar power.

   Performance Analysis
SO ENERGIES
AB A comprehensive review of different thermal energy storage materials for concentrated solar power has been conducted. Fifteen candidates were selected due to their nature, thermophysical properties, and economic impact. Three key energy performance indicators were defined in order to evaluate the performance of the different molten salts, using Solar Salt as a reference for low and high temperatures. The analysis provided evidence that nitrate-based materials are the best choice for the former and chloride-based materials are best for the latter instead of fluoride and carbonate-based candidates, mainly due to their low cost.

TI Performance and Economic Analysis of Concentrated Solar Power Generation
   for Pakistan
SO PROCESSES
AB In Pakistan, the utilization of renewable energy sources is increasing in order to reduce the electricity supply and demand gap. However, concentrated solar power (CSP) generation has not been considered in the country even though it has gained considerable attention worldwide. This study, as such, investigates the potential, performance, and economic analyses of four CSP technologies for different locations in Pakistan. Initially, an assessment of CSP sites, including solar resource, land, and water availability, was undertaken. Then, performance simulations of CSP technologies for four different locations of Pakistan, namely Quetta, Hyderabad, Multan, and Peshawar, were examined. For all cases, highest energy production was achieved in summers and lowest in winters, and CSP plants with evaporative cooling were found to be efficient compared to air cooling. The results also revealed that the Quetta and Hyderabad regions were promising for CSP development while parabolic tough (PT) and solar power tower (SPT) were the suitable CSP technologies for these regions. Specifically, the SPT plant with air cooling could be a favorable option for energy production in Quetta. Lastly, economic analyses revealed the financial feasibility of CSP plants in Pakistan since the levelized cost of energy is found to be significantly low.

SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH & DESIGN
AB This study presents the design and analysis of a new integrated direct steam generation (DSG) concentrated solar power (CSP) plant with a decalin/naphthalene thermochemical storage system. Model simulations were performed in accordance with historical hourly solar radiation data over a year, using a combination of Aspen Plus v10, MATLAB 2016b, and Microsoft Excel VBA. It was found that the proposed plant feasibly stored and discharged energy, based on the solar radiation and chemical storage availability, to maintain base-load power productions (250 MWe or 120 MWe) with an overall efficiency of 14.6%. The effectiveness of the designed storage system was found to be comparable to a molten salt storage system which is currently used in existing CSP plants. The proposed integrated DSG CSP plant with a decalin/naphthalene thermochemical storage system shows promise for being an alternative to existing CSP plants.

The support vector machines generate the forecasts and the random forest acts as an ensemble learning method to combine the forecasts. The common ensemble technique in wind and solar power forecasting is the blending of meteorological data from several sources. In this study though, the present and the past solar power forecasts from several models, as well as the associated meteorological data, are incorporated into the random forest to combine and improve the accuracy of the day-ahead solar power forecasts. The performance of the combined model is evaluated over the entire year and compared with other combining techniques.

AB Mineral processing facilities are all strongly dependent on power. Remote facilities often depend on diesel for their power requirements. Given the high variability in the price of oil and subsequently the price of diesel, the future viability of projects may be uncertain. Concentrated solar power can be strategically applied to decouple the cost of power from the cost of oil thereby reducing the project's exposure to oil's highly volatile price. This paper explains the methodology used to select the solar technology and its application to a remote mineral processing facility with a 30 MWe load. Preliminary capital and operating costs are presented and used to determine a levelized cost of electricity and ultimately an equivalent price of diesel fuel for a breakeven point for concentrated solar power.

TI Feasibility Analysis of Nanostructured Planar Focusing Collectors for
   Concentrating Solar Power Applications
SO ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS
AB Concentrating solar power (CSP) technology is an attractive approach to harvesting solar energy. Unlike photovoltaic (PV) technology, thermal storage is used in lieu of batteries for electricity generation. However, the cost of current collection optics in a CSP plant hampers commercial competitiveness with PVs and natural gas. The use of a planar focusing collector (PFC) could help reduce cost of materials, installation, and maintenance. We present two candidate PFC designs, one based on metasurfaces and the other a Fresnel-like model. We feed each design through the entire system process (design, fabrication, scalability, and techno-economic feasibility) and discuss the challenges met at each stage. Two-photon and nanoimprint lithography are used to make PFC molds and replicas, respectively. We find that the annual optical efficiency for the Fresnel-based PFC is similar to 40%, higher than the current 30% target for natural gas, thereby suggesting potential economic advantages in the market of industrial process heat.

TI Techno-economic evaluation of concentrating solar power generation in
   India
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) of the recently announced National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) by the Government of India aims to promote the development and use of solar energy for power generation and other uses with the ultimate objective of making solar competitive with fossil-based energy options. The plan includes specific goals to (a) create an enabling policy framework for the deployment of 20,000 MW of solar power by 2022: (b) create favourable conditions for solar manufacturing capability, particularly solar thermal for indigenous production and market leadership; (c) promote programmes for off grid applications, reaching 1000 MW by 2017 and 2000 MW by 2022, (d) achieve 15 million m(2) solar thermal collector area by 2017 and 20 million by 2022, and (e) deploy 20 million solar lighting systems for rural areas by 2022. The installed capacity of grid interactive solar power projects were 6 MW until October 2009 that is far below from their respective potential.
   In this study, a preliminary attempt towards the technical and economic assessment of concentrating solar power (CSP) technologies in India has been made. To analyze the techno-economic feasibility of CSP technologies in Indian conditions two projects namely PS-10 (based on power tower technology) and ANDASOL-1 (based on parabolic trough collector technology) have been taken as reference cases for this study. These two systems have been simulated at several Indian locations. The preliminary results indicate that the use of CSP technologies in India make financial sense for the north-western part of the country (particularly in Rajasthan and Gujarat states). Moreover, internalization of secondary benefits of carbon trading under clean development mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol further improves the financial feasibility of CSP systems at other locations considered in this study. It may be noted that the locations blessed with annual direct solar radiation more than 1800 kWh/m(2) are best recommended for installation of CSP systems. The results obtained can be used as preliminary indicators for identifying niche areas for immediate/short-term utilization of solar energy for concentrating solar power generation in India.

AB Solar energy is emerging as a popular source of clean energy and represents a viable option to meet energy demands of Southwestern U.S., characterized with abundant sunshine. Technological advancements have made solar power efficient and economically competitive with the traditional thermoelectric power plants. Utility-scale solar plants may generate electricity by using the photovoltaic (PV) or concentrated solar power (CSP) systems. However, solar systems need water to wash the panels/mirrors to maintain their efficiency. Water use in CSP plants for wet or hybrid cooling processes is comparable to that in thermoelectric plants. Hence development of solar power may be curtailed in the semi-arid southwestern regions because of limited water resources and changing climate. This study used a system dynamics model to analyze water issues of the state of Nevada for development of solar power under the renewable portfolio standard (RPS). Water availability and use for different scenarios of PV and CSP were quantified to meet the RPS goals during the period 2010-2030. Land requirements and subsequent reduction in CO2 emissions due to solar power development were also evaluated. Results showed that transitioning to solar technology from coal led to substantial reductions in CO2 emissions during the period 2010-2030. CSP tower have the largest land requirements, whereas linear Fresnel have the smallest land requirements. Generating electricity using PV plants as well as using dry cooling methods for CSP plants was found to be better options for water stressed areas. This model can also be applied to other regions using appropriate datasets.

TI Forecasting Solar Power Using Long-Short Term Memory and Convolutional
   Neural Networks
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB As solar photovoltaic (PV) generation becomes cost-effective, solar power comes into its own as the alternative energy with the potential to make up a larger share of growing energy needs. Consequently, operations and maintenance cost now have a large impact on the profit of managing power modules, and the energy market participants need to estimate the solar power in short or long terms of future. In this paper, we propose a solar power forecasting technique by utilizing convolutional neural networks and long-shortterm memory networks recently developed for analyzing time series data in the deep learning communities. Considering that weather information may not be always available for the location where PV modules are installed and sensors are often damaged, we empirically confirm that the proposed method predicts the solar power well with roughly estimated weather data obtained from national weather centers as well as it works robustly without sophisticatedly preprocessed input to remove outliers.

TI A comprehensive review on solid particle receivers of concentrated solar
   power
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB The receiver is a key component of a concentrated solar thermal power generation system. At present, molten salt is typically used for both heat absorption and as a thermal energy storage medium in commercial tower solar power stations. However, molten salt may decompose and degrade when the temperature exceeds 600 degrees C, hence affecting the efficiency of the whole thermoelectric conversion system. The solid particle solar receiver can collect heat at very high temperatures (exceeding 1000 degrees C) and can also function as a thermal energy storage medium, thus providing a new way to improve solar power conversion efficiency and reduce the cost of solar power generation. The present review summarizes progress in research on solid particle receivers. The criteria for particles that can be used in solid particle receivers are discussed. The design and performance characteristics of each particle receiver type are also summarized. Particle receivers are classified according to their structures and operation characteristics. The present review discusses the performance characteristics, applications, and existing issues of solid particle receivers, and it introduces aspects of next-generation concentrated high-temperature particle receivers. This review thus serves as a useful reference for the theoretical research and practical application of photothermic power generation and thermochemical technologies.

TI Flight Path Planning for a Solar Powered UAV in Wind Fields Using Direct
   Collocation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS
AB Achieving the long-endurance of a solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicle is difficult under a limited amount of energy and specific meteorological environments. Therefore, it is essential to manage the energy used by a solar-powered UAV during a mission. In this paper, a framework for energy-based path planning for a solar-powered UAV is presented. In order to generate the optimal path in terms of energy in a specific meteorological environment, the energy model of a solar-powered UAV is considered with regard to wind field. Additionally, the optimal energy path is examined through the optimal control technique. The optimal path is then applied to some case studies regarding solar-powered UAVs, and evaluated in order to verify the feasibility of the proposed approach. The optimization results show that the resulting path is indeed the optimal path, which increases the endurance of a flight and takes weather conditions into accounts. The proposed approach is also expected to find optimal paths in accordance with real weather environments and/or various weather situations.

AB The article describes the modeling of a solar power plant control system based on colored Petri nets. With the help of hierarchical colored Petri nets, a simulation model of a solar power plant was built. The features of constructing models of individual components of a solar power plant are considered. Various modes of their operation have been investigated. To improve the efficiency of system control, an intelligent controller based on a neural network is used. It is proposed to use a neural network to track the maximum power point for more efficient charge control. The neural network drives controllers that control the process and provide an effective current boost only when the solar panel's output voltage exceeds the battery voltage. With the help of the constructed models, various operating modes of a solar power plant are investigated. The results of increasing the system efficiency are presented.

AB The electricity has a predominant importance in everyone's life: no one can do (live) without it. However, this involves the use of raw materials, which except for a few cases, come from nonrenewable fossil fuels. It becomes need therefore be able to take full advantage of the energy contained in the fuel, creating cycles that allow to use the energy released from oxidation and maintaining contained losses. The cogeneration starts as a solution to this problem, obtaining energy either in the form of electrical energy (or mechanical) either in the form of thermal energy, and then dispersing with the gas still hot at the end of the cycle only a minimal part of the calorific value of the fuel. In particular, the concentrated solar power technology, actually, presents advantages over other renewable source technologies from the point of view of its integration in to the grid and electricity markets. This methodology can be used both on large systems or on smaller modest, up to even the domestic cogeneration in the context of a Micro-grid favoring also the integration of variable renewable energy sources.
   In this paper, the attention is focus on the implementation of a simulation model in Matlab/Simulink environment of a concentrated solar power system with Stirling technology.

AB To resolve power crisis and reduce environmental effect of conventional generation, concentrated solar power (CSP) plant is a viable solution. This paper covers technical and financial details for setting up a parabolic trough CSP plant in Chittagong, Bangladesh. The simulation is carried out for 40 years with a 0.1% compound depreciation rate using a System Advisor Module (SAM). A thermal storage system is integrated with the power plant so that electricity can be generated during the absence of sun, and the Hitec solar salt is used as a heat transfer fluid. 218 GWh of energy can be generated annually from the design CSP plant, which will occupy 923 acres of land. The overall internal rate of return is 12.58%, and the levelized cost of electricity is 19.10 US cents/KWh.

TI Optimization of the hybrid solar power plants comprising photovoltaic
   and concentrating solar power using the butterfly algorithm
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB This study optimized grid intermittency and instability resulting from photovoltaic (PV) by adding concentrating solar power (CSP) equipped with thermal energy storage (TES), which can be used to form hybrid solar power for grid dispatching. The PV-CSP were optimized by using a hybrid butterfly algorithm to meet the power gener-ation demands and lowest system operation costs. Based on the optimal output and operating characteristics of hybrid power, the economics of peak-valley and fixed electricity prices were studied and compared. The optimal TES capacity was 6-h electricity generation. Hybrid power with optimal TES capacity could achieve a 4.2% increase for power production and 10.4% decrease for operation cost. The peak-valley price provided a better economic benefit than the fixed electricity price. A reasonable configuration of TES can ensure the flexibility and stability of hybrid plant. Hybrid power contributes to a flexible use of dispatch capabilities by equipped with TES, making PV power completely utilize, especially during the periods of high solar radiation. For power systems, hybrid power can be used to replace partly conventional thermal power to achieve highly economic and environmental benefits.

TI Will dispatchability be a main driver to the European Union cooperation
   mechanisms for concentrated solar power?
SO ENERGY SOURCES PART B-ECONOMICS PLANNING AND POLICY
AB The use of the European Union cooperation mechanisms for concentrated solar power (CSP) projects could kill two birds with one stone. First, CSP electricity can cover demand when variable renewables cannot generate. Second, CSP projects deployed under the cooperation mechanisms could contribute to a European-wide optimization of resource use and grid management. This paper analyzes whether the dispatchable nature of CSP is a main driver to the use of the cooperation mechanism for this technology. Based on an expert elicitation and a survey to different types of stakeholders, our results show that, indeed, dispatchability will be the main driver to the use of the cooperation mechanisms for CSP projects in the future. The findings suggest that two types of policy interventions will be required to encourage the use of these mechanisms for CSP. Some policy measures should be directed at the technology itself, whereas other policies should target the cooperation mechanisms.

TI Doping Solar Field Heat Transfer Fluid With Nanoparticles
SO JOURNAL OF SOLAR ENERGY ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
AB A previously developed model of a concentrating solar power plant has been modified to accommodate doping the heat transfer fluid (HTF) with nanoparticles. The model with its unalloyed HTF has been validated with actual operating data beforehand. The thermophysical properties of the HTF were modified to account for the nanoparticle doping. The nanoparticle content in the HTF was then varied to evaluate its influence on solar power generation. The model was run to simulate plant operation on four different days representing the four different seasons. As the nanoparticle concentration was increased, heat losses were slightly reduced, transient warm up heat was increased, transient cool down heat was reduced, and the overall impact on power generation was trivial. Doping HTFs with nanoparticles does not seem promising for solar thermal power generation from a performance perspective. Moreover, doping HTFs with nanoparticles involves many other operational challenges such as sedimentation and abrasion.

TI Is solar power renewable and carbon-neutral: Evidence from a pilot solar
   tower plant in China under a systems view
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Solar power has been widely treated as renewable and carbon-neutral for being free of fossil resource inputs and causing no carbon emissions. Recent studies, however, qualitatively challenged the traditional thinking derived under a local-realism-based perspective. In response to the recent concerns, this study as a continuation of a previous work offers a systems view into comprehending the 'renewable' and 'carbon-neutral' characters of solar power by the case of a Chinese pilot solar power plant. Under the systems view, a solar power plant is positioned as an organic system fed by 'nutrients' from the macro economy that relies on exogenous non-renewable energy resources as environmental support. A quantitative framework for evaluating the renewability and carbonneutrality of solar power systems is proposed. A package of indicators is also devised, together with a retrospect of the history of methodological development. The non-renewable energy cost is revealed to be in magnitude 1.6 times as much as the electricity produced and the carbon emissions induced are also shown to be remarkable, implying that solar power is not as renewable and carbon-neutral as generally perceived. In contrast to coal-based power, however, solar power still appears as a promising alternative: the non-renewable energy cost and carbon emission for per unit of electricity delivered are revealed as 55% and 64% of that by the reference coal-fired power generation system in China, respectively. The outcome of this work provides a well-adapted assessment framework and adds insights into the intuitive understanding of renewable-based electricity.

AB As an emerging form of renewable energy generation, concentrating solar power (CSP) has the inertia and dispatchability of conventional power sources, and its flexible operation mode has significant advantages in promoting renewable energy consumption and participating in grid peak shaving. Aiming at the operation strategy problem of the high proportion of new energy delivery systems containing CSP plants, a dispatching model of mixed integer linear programming for power system with CSP is proposed. The objective of the proposed model is to minimize the sum of system operation cost, peak shaving cost and renewable energy curtailment cost. The benefits of flexible operation of CSP plants are quantified from three perspectives: operational economy, peak shaving effect and green power benefits. Case study demonstrates that CSP can reduce system operating costs, increase the accommodation of renewable generation and contribute to the zero-carbon development of the power system.

TI Prospect of concentrating solar power in China-the sustainable future
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Limited fossil resources and severe environmental problems require new sustainable electricity generation options, which utilize renewable energies and are economical ill the meantime. Concentrating solar power (CSP) generation is a proven renewable energy technology and has the potential to become cost-effective in the future, for it produces electricity front the solar radiation. In China, the electricity demand is rapidly increasing, while the solar resources and large wasteland areas are widely available in the western and northern part of China. To change the energy-intensive and environment-burdensome economical development way, Chinese government supports the development of this technology strongly. These factors altogether make China a suitable country for utilizing CSP technology. In this paper, the potential of CSP in China was studied and strategies to promote development of this technology were given. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Over the past few years, solar power has significantly increased in popularity as a renewable energy. In the context of electricity generation, solar power offers clean and accessible energy, as it is not associated with global warming and pollution. The main challenge of solar power is its uncontrollable fluctuation since it is highly depending on other weather variables. Thus, forecasting energy generation is important for smart grid operators and solar electricity providers since they are required to ensure the power continuity in order to dispatch and properly prepare to store the energy. In this study, we propose an efficient comparison framework for forecasting the solar power that will be generated 36 h in advance from Yeongam solar power plant located in South Jeolla Province, South Korea. The results show a comparative analysis of the state-of-the-art techniques for solar power generation.

TI Thermodynamic and economic analyses of a parabolic trough concentrating
   solar power plant under off-design conditions
SO APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING
AB As concentrating solar power technologies progressively move to maturity, large-scale concentrating solar pow plants have elicited increasing attention. The thermodynamic simulation and economic analyses of a 50 M' parabolic trough concentrating solar power plant in northwest China were conducted in the present work. TI effects of meteorological conditions, including direct normal irradiance and ambient temperature, on the 01 design performances were investigated by simulation calculations. Furthermore, economic and sensitive an lyses were conducted based on the annual simulation. Results show that the back-pressure of air-cooled co denser fluctuated with both ambient temperature and power generation. The power generation of summer at autumn days would decrease by 0.53-1.38 MW for the rise of condenser back-pressure. The clouds mainly fected the molten salt level of hot tank in thermal energy storage. In the economic analysis, with the decrease the feed-in tariff from 16.6 C/kWh to 8.6 C/kWh, the maximum total net income dropped from 6.65 M$ 2.43 MS. The optimal design condenser back-pressure rose from 5.0 kPa to 5.5 kPa. Moreover, the optimal desil back-pressure of air-cooled condenser was not sensitive to the cloud effect in certain range, but the total n income had a sharp drop from 7.37 M$ to 4.95 M$.

TI Evaluating Green Technology Strategies for the Sustainable Development
   of Solar Power Projects: Evidence from Pakistan
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Energy is the main element for a modern lifestyle that must be considered in economically reliable and sustainable development dialogues. The financial performance of solar power projects has become the main issue, especially in developing countries such as Pakistan, where it has gained the special attention of government and regulatory authorities. The present study evaluates green technology strategies for the sustainable development of solar power projects in Pakistan. We examine the moderating role of cost and riskiness of the methods between the nexus of capital budgeting techniques and the financial performance of solar power projects. The analysis is performed on data collected from 44 respondents (chief financial officers and chief executive officers) by accompanying an inclusive questionnaire survey. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) is used to assess the formulated suppositions. The results reveal that green technology strategies positively impact the sustainable development of solar power projects. The profitability index is a good source of higher financial performance of the solar power projects. The results further demonstrate that the cost and riskiness of the methods significantly moderate the nexus of capital budgeting techniques and the financial performance of solar power projects. These findings provide a valuable manual for policymakers, government institutions, and regulators to select the appropriate green technology strategy to increase cleaner production and sustainable development of solar power projects.

AB This paper presents the design and hardware validation of a unique solar powered boiler for powering a desktop scale steam Rankine power cycle. The primary purpose of the desktop Rankine cycle is to improve engineering education through a hands-on laboratory learning approach. Within this context, we have designed and validated a novel, glass-enclosed boiling chamber that generates steam entirely from the sun. Using a solar concentrator, the sun's heat is focused onto an absorber plate that acts as a heating element. The absorber plate receives solar power via radiation and heats the working fluid through convection. Since this is a direct steam generation boiler, the entering fluid is water that stratifies upon boiling into two steady-state flow regions with both liquid and gaseous phases.
   A thermal model is developed to characterize the concentrated solar power (CSP), chamber geometry, and heat transfer to the working fluid. A complete solar-to-steam efficiency analysis is presented and validated with the hardware. The boiler's estimated efficiency is 27.7% for converting typical daily solar irradiance to steam. The solar water boiling process can clearly be observed and is an excellent educational tool for both concentrated solar power as well as Rankine cycle power systems.

TI Thermodynamic evaluation of liquid metals as heat transfer fluids in
   concentrated solar power plants
SO APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING
AB Concentrated solar power, and in particular central receiver systems, can play a major role as a renewable energy source with the inherent possibility of including a thermal energy storage subsystem for improving the plant dispatchability. While current commercial projects are dominated by direct steam generation and molten nitrate salt concepts, next-generation systems will require higher operating temperature and larger heat-flux densities in order to increase the efficiency and reduce costs.
   In that context, liquid metals are proposed in this work as advanced heat transfer fluids that can face those challenges. The main advantages, regarding higher temperature and improved heat transfer performance, are discussed and quantified using simplified models. Indirect thermal storage solutions are proposed for compensating their relatively small heat capacity. Overall, provided that some practical challenges can be overcome, liquid metals present large potential as efficient heat transfer fluids. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Negative thermal-flux phenomenon and regional solar absorbing coating
   improvement strategy for the next-generation solar power tower
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB Solar power tower (SPT) is regarded as the most promising technology for applications in concentrating solar power. However, a significant decrease in the solar-thermal conversion efficiency of the tower receiver in the SPT system occurs at high operating temperatures due to the massive radiation heat loss caused. In this work, a detailed heat transfer model of the tower receiver was established, and the negative thermal-flux phenomenon was discovered in the tower receiver based on the verified simulation results. In this context, a novel improvement strategy for regional solar absorbing coating on the tower receiver was proposed to enhance the thermal performance of the tower receiver in the next-generation SPT system. Two kinds of novel tower receivers by changing conventional solar absorbing coating into the silver-based coating (novel receiver I) and black chrome-based coating (novel receiver II) at negative thermal-flux regions were proposed, investigated, and compared with the prototype tower receiver without changes. The overall thermal performance of three kinds of tower receivers was numerically analyzed under different solar irradiances, solar hours throughout the day, and seasons. The results demonstrated that both the novel tower receivers achieved breakthrough enhancements on the thermal performance compared with the prototype receiver, showing great potential for practical application. The negative thermal-flux regions accounted for almost a quarter of the entire receiver surface. The annual average radiation heat losses from negative thermal-flux regions in the novel receivers I and II were effectively reduced by 93.00 and 53.14%. Accordingly, the annual average heat gains and receiver efficiencies were significantly enhanced by 6.54 and 6.03%, respectively.

TI Parametric analysis on optimized design of hybrid solar power plants
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB There is increasing interest in utility-scale solar power plants with storage which can flexibly dispatch renewable energy to the grid. However, plant design possesses many degrees of freedom and non-obvious trade-offs in performance. Software tools can estimate or optimize the performance of a specific plant configuration under market and weather conditions of interest; the associated cost parameters and operating assumptions strongly influence estimates of plant performance and decisions regarding optimal sizing. We employ the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Hybrid Optimization and Performance Platform, which incorporates optimal dispatch when evaluating plant performance, and investigate the sensitivity to weather and market conditions, operating limitations, and the presence of a capacity-based incentive. We demonstrate changes in plant performance and optimal sizing with respect to these inputs and discuss implications. Results show that PV-with-battery designs are more profitable under our assumptions, but that designs including a concentrated solar power (CSP) system produce significantly greater annual energy; and that CSP-with-thermal energy storage designs maximizing the benefit-to-cost ratio have an input-dependent linear relationship between the CSP field solar multiple and the hours of storage as the project budget varies.

TI Effect of Al2O3 ALD coating on thermal stability of silica aerogel
SO JOURNAL OF POROUS MATERIALS
AB An optically transparent and thermally insulating (OTTI) silica aerogel demonstrates promising results for various solar thermal applications, particularly concentrated solar power systems. Higher system efficiency can be achieved by integrating OTTI materials by reducing heat loss at higher receiver temperature. However, the thermal stability of OTTI aerogels has been one of the limiting factors. Here, we report that Al2O3 atomic layer deposition (ALD) enhances the thermal stability of silica aerogel. The more layers of Al2O3 ALD coating on silica aerogels, the higher the thermal stability. However, more layers of Al2O3 ALD coating compromises transmittance of silica aerogel due to increasing the size of scattering centers. Therefore, optimization of Al2O3 ALD coating needs to be performed to enhance performance for a solar thermal system. The demonstrated ALD-coated aerogel provides a potential pathway to further improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of state-of-the-art concentrating solar power (CSP) systems.

TI Cathodic Protection Using Aluminum Metal in Chloride Molten Salts as
   Thermal Energy Storage Material in Concentrating Solar Power Plants
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The new generation of concentrated solar power (CSP) plants to be developed presents a great challenge related to the increase in maximum operating temperature since molten salt CSP technologies require alternative salt chemistries such as chloride. The cathodic protection strategy involves the addition of a sacrificial metal to prevent corrosion of the alloy tested as container material in a CSP plant. In this paper, aluminum (Al) metal was analyzed as a corrosion inhibitor in OCT and HR224 alloys, obtaining corrosion rates of 4.37 and 0.27 mm/y, respectively. It has been confirmed that the use of Al metal can reduce the anodic current which is directly related to the corrosion rate. The formation of protective alumina scales (Al2O3) was assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), confirming the corrosion model results from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy monitoring tests.

TI Robotized Inspection of Vertical Structures of a Solar Power Plant Using
   NDT Techniques
SO ROBOTICS
AB Concentrated solar power (CSP) plants are expansive facilities that require substantial inspection and maintenance. A fully automated inspection robot increases the efficiency of maintenance work, reduces operating and maintenance costs, and improves safety and work conditions for service technicians. This paper describes a climbing robot that is capable of performing inspection and maintenance on vertical surfaces of solar power plants, e.g., the tubes of the receiver in a central tower CSP plant. Specifically, the service robot's climbing mechanism is explained and the results of the nondestructive inspection methods are reviewed. The robot moves on the panels of the receiver in the tower and aligns the sensors correctly for inspection. The vertical movement of the climbing kinematics is synchronized with the movement of the tower's crane. Various devices that detect surface defects and thickness losses inside the tube were integrated into the robot. Since the tubes are exposed to very high radiation, they need to be inspected regularly.

SO DISASTER MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS
AB Objectives: To determine if solar-powered battery systems could be successfully used for electricity-dependent medical devices by families during a power outage.
   Methods: We assessed the use of and satisfaction with solar-powered battery systems distributed to 15 families following Hurricane Maria in rural Puerto Rico. Interviews were conducted in July 2018, 3 mo following distribution of the systems.
   Results: The solar-powered battery systems powered refrigeration for medications and prescribed diets, asthma therapy, inflatable mattresses to prevent bedsores, and continuous positive airway pressure machines for sleep apnea. Despite some system problems, such as inadequate power, defective cables, and blown fuses, families successfully dealt with these issues with some outside help. Almost all families were pleased with the systems and a majority would recommend solar-powered battery systems to a neighbor.
   Conclusions: Families accepted and successfully used solar-powered battery systems to power medical devices. Solar-powered battery systems should be considered as alternatives to generators for power outages after hurricanes and other disasters. Additional research and analysis are needed to inform policy on increasing access to such systems.

SO CORROSION ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The main aim of the present research was to investigate the effects of a ternary nitrate salt (NaNO3-KNO3-LiNO3) on high-temperature corrosion behaviour of stainless steel 321 (SS 321) in a parabolic trough collector in a concentrating solar power system. The corrosion behaviour of SS - 321 was examined in a ternary salt (LiNO3 (25 wt-%)-NaNO3 (25 wt-%)-KNO3 (50 wt-%)) at 400 degrees C and 550 degrees C for 250 h, 500 h and 1000 h, and the obtained findings were then compared with the results of a solar salt ((NaNO3 (60 wt-%)-KNO3 (40 wt-%)). In order to determine the quantitative corrosion behaviour of SS - 321, the results of immersion tests and microstructural investigations obtained through scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis were also considered. It was found that the addition of lithium nitrate (LiNO3) to solar salt formed resistant oxide layers on the surface of SS 321 and subsequently, increased its corrosion resistance ability.

AB Storage of thermal energy using molten salt materials has been widely explored for concentrating solar power. Since these power plants use thermodynamic cycle, the overall system cycle efficiency significantly relies on the thermal energy storage temperature. Therefore, increasing the thermal energy storage temperature and decreasing the amount of material needed can result in reducing the cost of solar energy. Molten salts are stable up to 700 degrees C, relatively cheap, and safe to the environment. However, the heat capacity of the molten salts is typically low (similar to 1.5 J/gK) compared to other thermal storage materials. The low heat capacity of molten salts can be improved by dispersing nanoparticles. In this study, we synthesized molten salt nanomaterial by dispersing oxide nanoparticles into selected molten salts. Heat capacity measurements were performed using a modulated differential scanning calorimeter. Materials characterization studies were performed using a scanning electron microscopy. Hence, we evaluated the use of the molten salt nanomaterials as thermal energy storage media in concentrated solar power applications. Increase in the specific heat capacity of the molten salt is also demonstrated on addition with Nano materials of specific size and quantity.

TI Benefits of Colocating Concentrating Solar Power and Wind
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
AB We analyze the potential benefits of colocating wind and concentrating solar power (CSP) plants in the southwestern U.S. Using a location in western Texas as a case study, we demonstrate that such a deployment strategy can improve the capacity factor of the combined plant and the associated transmission investment. This is because of two synergies between wind and CSP: 1) the negative correlation between real-time wind and solar resource availability and 2) the use of low-cost high-efficiency thermal energy storage in CSP. The economic tradeoff between transmission and system performance is highly sensitive to CSP and transmission costs. We demonstrate that a number of deployment configurations, which include up to 67% CSP, yield a positive net return on investment.

TI Dust impact on concentrated solar power: A review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH
AB Many sites with high solar radiation face high dust loads that reduce energy generation by concentrated solar power plants. This review presents the attenuative impacts of atmospheric aerosols, as well as reflectivity losses due to soiling of solar reflectors, by covering both experimental investigations and numerical studies; along with presenting the theoretical background. The chemical nature of aerosols, and the physics of soiling and atmospheric extinction phenomena (scattering and absorption) are also reviewed. Suspended particles like aerosols result in atmospheric extinction of the solar radiation that reaches the concentrators, and the deposition of these particles on the solar reflectors provokes decreases up to 80% in their reflectivity, and thus enhances the cumulus of optical losses and the reduction of energy production. Even though dust affects both CSP and photovoltaics, CSP technologies suffer more losses. The impact of dust should be particularly considered during the planning phase of solar thermal plants, since its consequent reduction in energy output can be severe. While there have been multiple papers to review dust-related problems for PV, the present paper is the first literature review dedicated to the impact of soiling on concentrated solar power.

AB Morocco imports about 96% of its required energy needs. Solar energy, as one of the most abundant and valuable renewable energy alternatives in the country, offers interesting opportunities for Morocco. In order to minimize its strong foreign energy dependence, Morocco hosts actually the largest Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) using parabolic trough collectors (PTC) as a technology for converting solar irradiation into thermal energy for electricity generation. The purpose of this paper is to assess the thermal performance of this technology and the potential projects concerned by Moroccan Solar Plan. A physical model is developed to determine flow parameters and heat transfer applied to PTC technology. Annual simulations in six climatic regions in Morocco were carried out. Several suggestions were drawn with regards to the design and parametric studies effectuated under Ouarzazate CSP project. It is found that the location and the climate are determinant parameters on the global performance of the parabolic trough solar collectors.

AB Photovoltaic (PV) solar power is a kind of renewable energy source that is developing rapidly in modern power systems. PV solar power producers need to generate efficient trading strategies to participate in the competitive electricity markets. In this paper, a kind of pure financial instrument called virtual bidding, which is available in the U.S. electricity markets, is used to help PV solar power producers improve profits and manage risk. A stochastic optimization model is established to co-optimize the profits of solar power offering and virtual bidding, where seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model is used for scenario generation and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is used as risk measure. The proposed model is a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem which can be solved by existing commercial solvers to obtain the stepwise curves for solar power offering and virtual bidding simultaneously. Finally, case studies are carried out for a 62 MW distributed PV solar power plant to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and analyze the impact of virtual bidding on the profitability and risk management of the PV solar power producer.

TI Rooftop Solar Power Generation: An Opportunity to Reduce Greenhouse Gas
   Emissions
SO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS: CHALLENGES, TECHNOLOGIES AND SOLUTIONS
SE Energy Environment and Sustainability
AB Solar energy is being promoted in India as one of the main components of renewable energy as the country receives good solar radiation over 300 days a year. It has emerged as a potential green alternative to address climate change issues by reducing reliance on conventional fossil fuel-based energy. The government has taken many policy initiatives to promote solar power generation and aims to produce 100 GW of solar power by the year 2022, out of which 40 GW is planned from solar rooftops. The land requirement for solar power generation systems is large, and in urban areas, acts as a major constraint. Rooftop solar power generation systems are an option and opportunity under such circumstances. This chapter focusses on the opportunities available to adopt rooftop solar power generation in the residential sector. The constraints in adopting these systems and the factors influencing decision of the household for installation of such systems are discussed. The primary data for the study has been collected through interviews with the households and discussions with the stakeholders-policy makers, distribution companies, consultants and the households with access and ownership rights to rooftops. The secondary data analysed includes published as well as unpublished data. The analysis highlights that there are numerous opportunities available to adopt rooftop solar power generation systems. These are mainly in the form of favourable policy instruments leading to economic gains. The reduction in the energy bill is the most important factor influencing decision of the household to adopt rooftop solar power generation. The system becomes attractive if government subsidies are available. The positive recommendation from friends and family who have already installed these systems drive the final decision of the household. The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and carbon footprint from adoption of rooftop solar power generation systems have been discussed in the chapter. The findings lead to policy recommendations to promote rooftop solar power generation and making it more attractive.

TI High-temperature "ion baseball" for enhancing concentrated solar power
   efficiency
SO SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS
AB Recent guidelines for the third generation of solar absorber coatings have shown an unavoidable necessity for low thermal emittance coatings for concentrated solar power tower technology to decrease the thermal loss at the absorber surface. By tuning the pigment spinel crystal structure, density or roughness of a coating, improved optical properties for the coating can be achieved. In this study, a high solar-radiation absorbing pigment CuMn1.5Fe0.5O4 was calcined with 3 wt % Al, Fe, Ni, Mo and Cr to study the optical property improvement of the absorber coating, which could increase the efficiency of concentrated solar power plants. The modified pigment particles were investigated and compared to the non-modified pigment by XRD, TEM and elemental mapping, which showed that the pigment was successfully doped with Fe, Ni, and Cr. In contrast, no spinel doping was observed when Al and Mo were used. The most likely final position of the migrating Cr atoms was determined by comparing the experimental IR spectrum of the Cr-doped spinel structure with the spectra of various structures calculated based on first principles density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, the prepared coatings were thermally aged for 1300 h at 800 degrees C in air, followed by repetitive optical measurements. Outstanding results were achieved for the aged coating, which was made from a Cr-doped black pigment. Its solar absorptance ( > 95%) and epsilon(T)/alpha(s) ratio (0.94) after 1300 h of thermal ageing were better than that of a standard paint (epsilon(T)/alpha(s) = 1). We estimated that it may be possible to save up to 300,000 (sic)/year on a fully operating concentrated solar power (CSP) plant by replacing the standard absorber paint with the Cr-doped pigment due to its better absorption efficiency.

AB Climate change has caused growing concern in the international community. The Kyoto Protocol was signed by a majority of the world with the clear intention of reducing emissions. Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is a part of the Kyoto Protocol and allows industrialized countries to reduce their emission by making contribution to developing countries. In this study, several research papers related to sustainability and multi-criteria analysis of energy projects were reviewed and classified based on their focus, motivation and contribution to achieve a comprehensive summary. Additionally, this paper presents a review of multi criteria decision methods and sustainability indicators under five pillars: technical, economic, social, environmental, and risk. Moreover, sustainability analysis of worldwide CDM concentrated solar power (CSP) projects was performed by using MAUT method. The analysis was repeated based on several scenarios including different criteria and criteria weights. The purpose of this research is proposing a framework and providing an understanding for decision makers to evaluate the sustainability of CDM energy projects. This work can provide perceptions to future installations and further insights for the development of sustainable CDM energy projects around the world.

TI 2D MoSe2-based nanofluids prepared by liquid phase exfoliation for heat
   transfer applications in concentrating solar power
SO SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS
AB Concentrating solar power (CSP) is one of the most promising environmentally-friendly sources of energy for meeting global energy demands. One line of research intended to improve this kind of solar plants involves increasing the efficiency of the heat transfer fluid (HTF) used, one option being the use of nanofluids. Consequently, this study involves a methodology based on liquid phase exfoliation to prepare stable nanofluids based on 2D MoSe2. A surfactant was used to modify the ratio of the components of the fluid's surface tension in order to obtain a stable nanofluid. Five nanofluids were prepared based on MoSe2 nanosheets, Dowtherm A heat transfer fluid and the Triton X-100 surfactant. The stability of the nanofluids was analysed for a month. Lastly, their thermal properties were characterized. The best nanofluid presented improvements of 7% in isobaric specific heat, 4% in diffusivity and 11% in thermal conductivity. Therefore, these nanofluids would appear to provide a good starting point for creating an alternative to the conventional HTFs used in thermosolar plants. The study highlights the importance of optimizing the parameters of the ratio of the surface tension components, the kind of surfactant added and the methodology used to prepare the nanofluid.

AB Several forecasting models are combined together to mitigate the uncertainty associated with the solar power generation resource and improve the power generation forecasts. The common ensemble approach in wind and solar power forecasting is the blending of meteorological data from several sources. In this study, the present and the past solar power forecasts, as well as the associated meteorological data, are incorporated into an ensemble learning tool. Since forecasts based on numerical weather prediction systems are more valuable in horizons longer than 6 h, the proposed approach includes the simple persistence model of hour-ahead forecasts along with the different models of day-ahead forecasts so that the combined forecasts become hour-ahead solar power forecasts. In addition, the proposed approach combines the ramp rates of the forecasts to enhance the ensemble learning. Furthermore, the approach improves the ensemble learning by using two loss functions - the first function to minimise errors of the forecasts, and the second to minimise errors of the ramp rates of the forecasts. The performance of the combined forecasts is evaluated over the entire year and compared with other techniques.

AB Wind and solar power generation differ from conventional energy generation because of the variable and uncertain nature of their power output. This variability and uncertainty can have significant impacts on grid operations. Thus, short-term forecasting of wind and solar power generation is uniquely helpful for balancing supply and demand in an electric power system. This paper investigates the correlation between wind and solar power forecast errors. The forecast and the actual data were obtained from the Western Wind and Solar Integration Study. Both the day-ahead and 4-hour-ahead forecast errors for the Western Interconnection of the United States were analyzed. A joint distribution of wind and solar power forecast errors was estimated using a kernel density estimation method; the Pearson's correlation coefficient between wind and solar forecast errors was also evaluated. The results showed that wind and solar power forecast errors were weakly correlated. The absolute Pearson 's correlation coefficient between wind and solar power forecast errors increased with the size of the analyzed region. The study is also useful for assessing the ability of balancing areas to integrate wind and solar power generation.

AB As the earth, together with all of its countries and people enlarge its envelope of power options to meet burgeoning energy requirements and progressively rigorous environmental worries, solar power is cropping up as an alluring option. In evolving countries like India where over the population of 300 million still do not have access to electricity; this source of electricity procreation becomes more extensive. Like any other power plant, a solar power plant in operation demands maintenance as well. Also, as the solar power plant gets old, operation and maintenance (O&M) becomes more and more vital for enhancing or keeping up the performance of the plant. This paper has conferred the present scenario of solar power in India. This paper has also enlisted the components of solar system. Various issues that arise in the operation of solar power plant are deliberated. Maintenance strategies in order to overthrow these concerns have also been explained.

AB This paper presents results from measurements of solar-power production in the north of Scandinavia; studies of the impact on the grid when larger amounts of solar power are installed, and methods to mitigate this grid impact. It is shown that solar power has limited contribution to reducing the peak loading of the grid. Large amounts of solar power will even increase the peak loading. Curtailment is shown to be an appropriate way of allowing more solar energy to be injected into the grid without additional grid investment. It is important however to use the right control method ("soft curtailment") as otherwise production will decrease with increasing installed capacity. It is also shown in the paper that unacceptable voltage variations can occur when large installations are connected to weak parts of the grid. The availability of hourly metering data is an important contribution to integration studies.

AB Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) offers a number of advantages over photovoltaic at large scale power generation, such as lower cost and the option of thermal energy storage. However, the costs of a power tower plant are dominated by heliostats, which are usually 50% of the entire facility. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory was awarded funding by the DOE SunShot Initiative to develop a low-cost, rigid foam-based solar concentrator to meet installed cost goals of $75/m(2) versus current costs of S200-250/m(2). One of the key features of the newly developed design is the stand-alone power system based on PV-panels and a Li-Fe-battery, which reduces operation and installation costs. The approach was validated by building and testing of a small-scale (6m(2)) heliostat prototype. 'the design process and findings are described in detail.

TI Stochastic modelling of sandstorms affecting the optimal operation and
   cleaning scheduling of air coolers in concentrated solar power plants
SO ENERGY
AB The operation performance of air-coolers in concentrated solar power plants decays due to particulate deposition on heat transfer surfaces. The deposition process can be seen as a stochastic phenomenon. A modelling approach is proposed to capture the uncertainty and the effect of extreme events, such as sandstorms, affecting the performance of plants located in dry places through dust or sand deposition on the air coolers. A case study of a concentrated solar power plant located in Dubai is analysed. Sandstorms generate acute and drastic fouling of the air coolers, and this is modelled as a stochastic process using historical aerosol dispersion data. Ten scenarios are generated by sampling the probability distribution of sandstorms occurrence and intensity. The optimal operation (cleaning schedule and airflow profiles) of the air coolers is established using Benders decomposition to solve the resulting large-scale mixed integer non-linear programming problem. The results of the stochastic scenarios demonstrate that substantial savings of $ 0.6 M - $ 2.7 M per year are achieved by the optimal operation. Cost is minimized by a combined reactive and proactive cleaning policy which accounts for the frequency, intensity and seasonal variability of sandstorms, in addition to the variability on local radiation and weather conditions.

AB Concentrated solar power (CSP) is an emerging technology for electricity production that uses solar energy and allows storing energy in the form of heat, which makes the energy also available at night. This work assesses the impact of concentrated solar power tower plants with molten salt as heat transfer fluid and storage medium, considering all three pillars of sustainability: environment, economy and society. The quantitative methods applied for each pillar are life cycle assessment (LCA), life cycle costing (LCC) and life cycle working environment (LCWE). All these methods are applied within the GaBi is software and database system in a single and consistent model. The results show that a holistic quantitative sustainability assessment within a single framework is possible, as a first try, and further areas of research have been identified.

AB In 2011, the U.S. Depaitment of Energy (DOE) initiated a "SunShot Concentrating Solar Power R&D" program to develop technologies that have the potential for much higher efficiency, lower cost, and/or more reliable performance than existing CSP systems. The DOE seeks to develop highly disruptive Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) technologies that will meet 6(sic)/kWh cost targets by the end of the decade, and a high-efficiency, low-cost thermal power cycle is one of the important components to achieve the goal. Supercritical CO2 (s-CO2) operated in a closed-loop Brayton cycle offers the potential of equivalent or higher cycle efficiency versus superheated or supercritical steam cycles at temperatures relevant for CSP applications. Brayton-cycle systems using s-CO2 have a smaller weight and volume, lower thermal mass, and less complex power blocks versus Rankine cycles due to the higher density of the fluid and simpler cycle design. The simpler machinery and compact size of the s-CO2 process may also reduce the installation, maintenance and operation cost of the system.

AB Solar power is a kind of clean and renewable energy, which can be utilized in the industrial micro-grid as an effective approach to decrease energy costs and reduce the emission of greenhouse. However, the uncertainty of solar power together with the limit of thermal power units' adjustment ability will bring a great challenge to keeping balance of power demand and supply. In this paper, the storage is introduced to industrial micro-grid that aims at mitigating the fluctuation of gateway flow. Since uncertainty exists, how to minimize energy costs considering the uncertainty becomes a great problem. So an economic dispatch model of industrial micro-grid based on scenario tree is established. With the simulation data taken into the model in the paper, the results show that the energy cost decrease 4.79% with solar power and decrease 0.87% with storage, which indicate that the thermal power cost can be decreased largely by utilizing solar power and storage, and the fluctuation of solar power and load can be mitigated by generation and production schedule effectively.

AB This study presents the concept of flexible heat integration (FHI) applied to a concentrated solar power (CSP)-natural gas hybrid power plant and employing non-linear real-time optimization (RTO) to leverage the FHI concept. In a conventional CSP plant driven by a trough collector, solar energy is dispatched in series to heat sinks at decreasing temperature. FHI dispatches solar energy to the heat sinks within the power plant based upon ambient conditions, rather than always in series. During times of low solar activity, solar energy bypasses the steam generator and is dispatched directly to the preheater. A nonlinear optimization capitalizes on this flexible operation and establishes different collection temperature set points based upon the availability of solar power. This mechanism enables the plant to mitigate radiative heat losses of low-grade solar power, as observed when heat is only utilized at high temperature and in series. Applying FHI and RTO increases the solar fraction by 18.2% and the solar-to-electric efficiency by 15.5%. These results indicate the potential of significant improvement of solar power production in a hybrid plant by leveraging the benefits of RTO and FHI. Compared to a solar only power plant, the combination of the hybrid design, FHI, and RTO nearly doubles the amount of solar power produced.

The initial phase of feed-in tariff support for solar power in the form of "Adder" gave rise to the dominance of solar farms, contributing currently to 99% of Thailand's solar power capacity. Since 2013, the government has begun to give a more focused support to rooftop solar power investment in the form of fixed feed-in tariff. However, the response to the government's feed-in tariff support for residential rooftop solar has been slow. Among many reasons, this paper argues that the lack of feasibility of residential rooftop solar power investment remains a key barrier. Under current market conditions, such investment could potentially be stimulated with the presence of a tax incentive and more attractive financing options. (C) 2015 International Energy Initiative.

TI Solar Power Generation and Risk Transfer Systems
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS
AB This study analyzes the uncertainty in the amount of electricity supply in solar power generation because actual sunshine duration is unknown in advance. In particular, the study considers how risk transfer systems such as insurance and derivatives affect the prevalence of solar power generation. Furthermore, we investigate how the electricity price in the feed-in tariff (FIT) scheme introduced in Japan in July 2012 relates to the prevalence of solar power generation.
   If additional revenue is larger than additional cost due to the application of a risk transfer system, we derive the following results from our economic model analysis. First, an increase in electricity price in the FIT scheme and in the expected amount of electricity supply and a decrease in the cost of solar panels increases the availability of a risk transfer system. Second, promoting the availability of a risk transfer system leads to increased solar power generation.

AB This study also proposes a solar power-based adaptive node-selection protocol mechanism for a wireless sensor network to increase the monitor performance of wireless sensors. Using renewable energy, such as solar power, to improve the efficiency of sensors in wireless sensor networks has become a popular topic. Equipping the sensors with solar-powered equipment signifies that the sensors no longer have the limited battery life problem. This design can collect solar power to charge the sensor's battery. To solve node-selection problem, an adaptive node-selection mechanism (ANSM) scheme is proposed. The algorithm builds the energy-aware Steiner tree between sensors and sink. This scheme selects the least active node to reduce the overlapping of the sensor coverage but ensure constant coverage of the target area in solar-powered wireless sensor networks. This approach also considers the solar power consuming rate and humidity to solve the solar power problem in various environments.

TI Simulation of a 100-MW solar-powered thermo-chemical air separation
   system combined with an oxy-fuel power plant for bio-energy with carbon
   capture and storage (BECCS)
SO MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB The combination of concentrated solar power-chemical looping air separation (CSP-CLAS) with an oxy-fuel combustion process for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture is a novel system to generate electricity from solar power and biomass while being able to store solar power efficiently. In this study, the computer program Advanced System for Process Engineering Plus (ASPEN Plus) was used to develop models to assess the process performance of such a process with manganese (Mn)-based oxygen carriers on alumina (Al2O3) support for a location in the region of Seville in Spain, using real solar beam irradiance and electricity demand data. It was shown that the utilisation of olive tree prunings (Olea europaea) as the fuel-an agricultural residue produced locally-results in negative CO(2)emissions (a net removal of CO(2)from the atmosphere). Furthermore, it was found that the process with an annual average electricity output of 18 MW would utilise 2.43% of Andalusia's olive tree prunings, thereby capturing 260.5 k-tonnes of CO2, annually. Drawbacks of the system are its relatively high complexity, a significant energy penalty in the CLAS process associated with the steam requirements for the loop-seal fluidisation, and the gas storage requirements. Nevertheless, the utilisation of agricultural residues is highly promising, and given the large quantities produced globally (~ 4 billion tonnes/year), it is suggested that other novel processes tailored to these fuels should be investigated, under consideration of a future price on CO(2)emissions, integration potential with a likely electricity grid system, and based on the local conditions and real data.

TI Modeling and dynamic simulation of thermal energy storage system for
   concentrating solar power plant
SO ENERGY
AB Thermal energy storage system in concentrating solar power plants can guarantee sustainable and stable electricity output in case of highly unstable solar irradiation conditions. In this paper, the lumped parameter method is used to develop the models of different thermal energy storage systems. In order to improve the reliability as well as the prediction accuracy of developed models, the charging/discharging process is firstly simulated, and then the dynamic characteristics of thermal energy storage systems are fully tested by imposing 15% step disturbance of mass flow. The results show that the charging/discharging characteristics of the three different thermal energy storage systems are almost the same, which have little to do with the storage mediums used in the systems. Besides, for the representative 1MWe solar parabolic trough power plant, a 15% step up disturbance of oil mass flow will result in a small increase (1.8% and 1.3% respectively) on the outlet temperature of oil and molten salt. On the other side, a 15% step down disturbance of oil mass flow will lead a 2.7% and 2.2% decrease on the outlet temperature of oil and molten salt respectively. In order to verify the validity of the proposed models, the simulation results are compared with both the design points and representative experimental data from the 1MWe solar parabolic trough power plant. The results show that the maximum relative error is not more than 1% when comparing with the design points and the maximum relative error is not more than 12% when comparing with the representative experimental data. Conclusions of this paper are good references for system design, control and commissioning of concentrating solar power plants. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a novel method has been presented for the had data identification of the data recovery process from a solar power measurement data set. Due to failures in solar power measurement logging devices, a long period of solar power generation data might necessary to be recovered. In order to ensure that the recovered data is the correct one, the daily solar generation curve has to be investigated. Due to the high data amount, this control process has to be done automatically. It is observed that the daily solar generation curve is much similar to cosine wave. In this study, the recovered data is compared to reference cosine wave and it is aimed to identify the suspicious data group. In this context, this work is based on the normalized residuals test.

AB The operation of solar powered wireless sensor networks is associated with numerous challenges. One of the main challenges is the high variability of solar power input and battery capacity, due to factors such as weather, humidity, dust and temperature. In this article, we propose a set of tools that can be implemented onboard high power wireless sensor networks to estimate the battery condition and capacity as well as solar power availability. These parameters are very important to optimize sensing and communications operations and maximize the reliability of the complete system. Experimental results show that the performance of typical Lithium Ion batteries severely degrades outdoors in a matter of weeks or months, and that the availability of solar energy in an urban solar powered wireless sensor network is highly variable, which underlines the need for such power and energy estimation algorithms.

AB Concentrated solar power (CSP) is mainly encouraged to harness the solar energy for producing electricity. The CSP technologies are highly dependent on the efficient reflector and receiver designs, working medium and thermal storage technologies to produce intermittent electrical power with several options like hybrid peak load operations, co-generation, etcetera. The receivers have smaller aperture areas such that they operate under higher concentration ratios to produce high temperature at the focus. Construction materials of receiver and heat transfer mediums are vital to extracting more solar energy from the mirror fields or parabolic collectors. Phase change materials (PCM) are found to have numerous applications in the energy collection and storage systems. This article provides the recent developments in the concentrated solar receivers and the future direction in the receiver technology.

TI Thermionic energy conversion for concentrating solar power
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB Concentrating solar power (CSP) is a mainstream of solar energy utilization, and thermionic emission is a potential way to convert concentrated solar radiation into power with a theoretical efficiency of 50-70%, surpassing both Shockley-Queisser limit and photo-thermal limit. This literature attempts to provide a comprehensive understanding of and an insight into solar thermionic energy conversion. The fundamentals of electron emission from electrodes and electron transport in vacuum gap are presented, as well as the state of the art of solar thermionic energy conversion technologies, including heat-induced thermionics and photon-enhanced thermionics. The former is driven by thermal energy, whereas the latter takes advantage of both quantum photon energy and thermal energy. Burgeoning research indicates that photon-enhanced thermionic conversion is a promising technology for concentrating solar power due to the high efficiency and simple operating mode. Now, it is important to develop novel materials and coating technologies to facilitate electron emission and reduce space charge effect in interelectrode vacuum. Structural design of thermionic converters and top bottom configuration of solar-electricity systems are suggested for practical applications.

AB Due to advances in low power micro-sensor technology, energy harvesting techniques, we can now build large scale solar-powered sensor networks to support long-running operations. Solar powered sensors often harvest variable amounts of energy in different weather conditions. Then a primary requirement for an efficient and a long-running solar-powered sensor system is to adapt to changing environment conditions and resources, and to gather as much valuable data as possible. Sensing and collecting data at a constant rate, without taking into account energy availability or data deliverability, will either drain the battery or waste resources. In this work, we design and test a highly efficient and robust solar-powered system SmartMote; and we further present an energy and value of information (VoI) aware routing strategy, that balances the rates of sensing with packet delivery for SmartMote. SmartMote achieves fairness and near maximum utility across the network. We deploy SmartMote in a forest with 100 sensors in order to monitor the humidity, temperature and luminance intensity. Our experimental results corroborate our design.

The paper considers the problem of day-ahead solar power plant output forecasting, based on the meteorological data. The improvement of solar power plant output prediction will significantly simplify power system operation mode planning taking into market procedures and active power generation reserves allocation. As a case study the authors use meteorological data for a real operated solar power plant. As a results of regression modelling the statistical significance of the meteorological parameters was analyzed. The optimal mathematical formulation of regression model was provided. In addition, the paper gives the idea of empirical clasterization approach, providing significant improvement of prediction accuracy. The results of the verification on real data allow deciding on the applicability of the proposed methods in industrial operation.

TI Theoretical and technical potential evaluation of solar power generation
   in Iran
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB Nowadays, utilizing solar energy for power production at high efficiency and in a cost-effective status is a challenging issue for power plant engineers. This challenge would be answered by considering several affecting parameters such as technical, economic, and environmental criteria. In this investigation, in order to provide an assessment for implementing solar power plants in the southeast of Iran, Sistan and Baluchistan province, a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach is linked to a geographic information system (GIS). The MCDM approach is used to appraise the effective criteria for implementing solar power plants. The environment, orography, economic and climate are selected as the important criteria. Each criterion is assessed for the defined location of the investigation (Sistan and Baluchistan province) and in addition, GIS is employed to provide a geographical-graphical valuation to determine the most appropriate place for installing a large-scale solar power production plant. The solar systems considered in this study are photovoltaic (PV) collectors and concentrated solar power (CSP) generation plants (e.g. solar trough collectors). Technical and theoretical valuations are made to specify the amount of solar power which can be harnessed in Sistan and Baluchistan. In overall, it is demonstrated that this specific location in the southeast of Iran has the technical potential to provide 7,419 TWh/y and 8,758 TWh/y of solar electricity by installing CSP and PV technologies, respectively.

TI Polar solar power plants-Investigating the potential and the design
   challenges
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB The potential for power production and the climatic effects imposed on ground mounted solar power plants in Polar climates are scarcely documented and limit the use of solar power in Polar regions. The study investigates the potential and the design challenges of Polar solar power plants through field measurements of a small-scale solar power plant with modules facing both sky and ground in Adventdalen, Svalbard. The climate is characterized by significant horizontal redistribution of snow due to little shelter and strong winds, causing snowdrifts to develop in the aerodynamic shade of the PV arrays. In this study we show that snowdrifts pose a significant challenge for solar power plants in Polar climates as they can grow to cover the plant, resulting in reduced power production and an imposed mechanical load on the PV arrays. The snowdrifts produced by the PV arrays exhibit a similarity with that produced by porous snow fences and it is argued that snow fence theory can be applied to PV arrays to control the accumulation. The results from solar power production indicates that the module yield is enhanced by the low temperatures as a seasonal performance ratio of 92.5% in combination with below-STC backsheet temperatures are measured. The bifacial gain displays a strong seasonal variation due to the presence snow cover and averages 14.7% annually. The findings indicate that the Polar climate enhance the module performance and that an adaption of solar power plant design is necessary for the system to be resilient to snowdrift development.

AB Generated power of a solar panel is volatile and susceptible to environmental conditions. In this study, we have analyzed variables affecting the generated power of a 17.5 kW real-world solar power plant with respect to five independent variables over the generated power: irradiance, time of measurement, panel's temperature, ambient temperature and cloudiness of the weather at the time of measurement. After our analysis, we have trained three different models to predict intra-day solar power forecasts of the plant. Our models are able to predict future power output of the solar power plant with less than 10% RMSE without requiring additional sensor data, e.g. a camera to observe clouds. Based on our forecasting accuracy, our study promises: fast, scaleable and effective solutions to solar power plant maintainers and may facilitate grid safety on a large scale.

TI Conversion and Testing of a Solar Thermal Parabolic Trough Collector for
   CPV-T Application
SO ENERGIES
AB In the field of solar power generation, concentrator systems, such as concentrator photovoltaics (CPV) or concentrated solar power (CSP), are subject of intensive research activity, due to high efficiencies in electrical power generation compared to conventional photovoltaics (PV) and low-cost energy storage on the thermal side. Even though the idea of combining the thermal and electrical part in one absorber is obvious, very few hybrid systems (i.e., concentrator photovoltaics-thermal systems (CPV-T)) are either described in literature or commercially available. This paper features the conversion of a commercial thermal parabolic trough collector to a CPV-T hybrid system using multi-junction PV cells. The design process is described in detail starting with the selection of suitable PV cells, elaborating optical and mechanical system requirements, heat sink design and final assembly. Feasibility is proven by practical tests involving maximum power point tracking as well as empirical determination of heat generation and measurement results are presented.

TI Solar power generation system for reducing leakage current
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS
AB This paper proposes a transformer-less multi-level solar power generation system. This solar power generation system is composed of a solar cell array, a boost power converter, an isolation switch set and a full-bridge inverter. A unipolar pulse-width modulation (PWM) strategy is used in the full-bridge inverter to attenuate the output ripple current. Circuit isolation is accomplished by integrating the isolation switch set between the solar cell array and the utility, to suppress the leakage current. The isolation switch set also determines the DC bus voltage for the full-bridge inverter connecting to the solar cell array or the output of the boost power converter. Accordingly, the proposed transformer-less multi-level solar power generation system generates a five-level voltage, and the partial power of the solar cell array is also converted to AC power using only the full-bridge inverter, so the power efficiency is increased. A prototype is developed to validate the performance of the proposed transformer-less multi-level solar power generation system.

AB Hybrid solar power plants have the potential to combine advantages of two different technologies at the cost of increased complexity. The present paper shows the potential of the software greenius for the techno-economic evaluation of hybrid solar power plants and discusses two exemplary scenarios. Depreciated Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants based on trough technology can be retrofitted with solar towers in order to reach higher steam cycle temperatures and hence efficiencies. Compared to a newly built tower plant the hybridization of a depreciated trough plant causes about 30% lower LCOE reaching 104 $/MWh. The second hybrid scenario combines cost-efficient photovoltaics with dispatchable CSP technology. This hybrid plant offers very high capacity factors up to 69% based on 100% load from 8am to 11pm. The LCOE of the hybrid plant are only slightly lower (174 vs. 186 $/MWh) compared to the pure CSP plant because the capital expenditure for thermal storage and power block remains the same while the electricity output is much lower.

TI Hybrid Forecasting Methodology for Wind Power-Photovoltaic-Concentrating
   Solar Power Generation Clustered Renewable Energy Systems
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Forecasting of large-scale renewable energy clusters composed of wind power generation, photovoltaic and concentrating solar power (CSP) generation encounters complex uncertainties due to spatial scale dispersion and time scale random fluctuation. In response to this, a short-term forecasting method is proposed to improve the hybrid forecasting accuracy of multiple generation types in the same region. It is formed through training the long short-term memory (LSTM) network using spatial panel data. Historical power data and meteorological data for CSP plant, wind farm and photovoltaic (PV) plant are included in the dataset. Based on the data set, the correlation between these three types of power generation is proved by Pearson coefficient, and the feasibility of improving the forecasting ability through the hybrid renewable energy clusters is analyzed. Moreover, cases study indicates that the uncertainty of renewable energy cluster power tends to weaken due to partial controllability of CSP generation. Compared with the traditional prediction method, the hybrid prediction method has better prediction accuracy in the real case of renewable energy cluster in Northwest China.

SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB Thermal energy storage system, which can effectively store solar energy and make a solar power plant generate electricity in cloudy or rainy weather and nighttime, is a key part of a concentrating solar power plant, which makes solar power technology have unique advantages compared with other renewable energy power technology. Two-tank indirect thermal energy storage system with molten salt is most widely used and has been successfully commercialized in the field of solar power. In this passage, a universal dynamic simulation model of two-tank indirect thermal energy storage system with molten salt used for trough solar power plants based on the lumped parameter method is built, and the dynamic processes of thermal energy storage system charge and discharge, and the changes of heat transfer oil outlet temperature in the oil/salt heat exchanger, molten salt temperature and height in the molten salt tank when heat transfer oil mass flow rate has step disturbances are simulated on the STAR-90 simulation platform. The simulation results show that the model can simulate the charge and discharge dynamic characteristics of two-tank indirect thermal energy storage system with molten salt well, which can be good references for the system design, system control and system debugging.

AB Solar power plants have become common during last few years in the middle Europe, especially in Germany. On the other hand, solar power has not grown in the Nordic countries, in spite of Denmark after the favorable net-metering legislation in the year 2011. Finland is one of these countries that has low solar power capacity. Many Nordic countries, such as Finland, have relatively low electricity price that is supposed to cause challenges for the viability of solar power production without legislation or does it? In this paper, the potential for solar power production in Nordic conditions is studied, simulated, and measured. A large scale solar power plant is built to Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT).

   plants for site and technology selection in Egypt
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The objective of this research is to investigate the implementation of two concentrated solar power (CSP) technologies in the 28 devoted locations in Egypt, in order to select the optimum site-specific CSP technology. This may be achieved by a validated thermo-economic simulation of power plants using the Sam advisory model and an investigation of the two proposed CSP technologies' configurations to fulfill the power plant's thermal demand. Simulations take into consideration the environmental, technical, financial, and economic aspects of the projects. Among many simulated parameters, three are considered to compare the two proposed technologies' configurations in the 28 locations utilizing geographic information system aid. Those parameters are the annual power production, the levelized cost of energy, and water consumption. A comparative analysis indicated that the solar tower requires 25% more land than the parabolic trough. The additional collecting area raised the net capital cost of the solar tower system by 15% over the parabolic trough model. As a result, the solar tower arrangement reduces the levelized cost of energy while increasing the yearly power generated and water required by the power plant. Simulation results favored the proposed solar tower configuration over the parabolic trough and recommended the implementation of such concentrated solar power projects in the central and eastern locations of Egypt.

AB Concentrating solar power (CSP) plant coupling with thermal energy storage is a popular technology in the recent years. The storage technology is the wave of the future in solar utilization field. A lot of scholars focus on studying of heat transfer performance by the experimental or simulating method. In this paper, a novel heat transfer model of three-dimensional unsteady state heat conduction in cylindrical coordinate has been proposed based on the theoretical analysis. The most difficulty problem during the solution is the materials, which is molten salt based on some real cases, that is a phase change material (PCM) with the melting point of 494 K. The computer code of this model is written by C language in MATLAB software. The results show that the charge time is 25200 s (about 7 h). Also, the characteristic of melting progress of the PCM has been obtained based on this program. The aim of this paper is to develop a new heat transfer model and provide a good reference to utilize solar energy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Large scale integration of renewable energy requires extra reserves and ramp flexibilities due to the inherent intermittency and uncertainty, thus brings great challenges for the power system planning and operation. Concentrating solar power (CSP) plant, a rising technique to utilize renewable energy, has the flexibility to shift the production and offer reserves when equipped with thermal energy storage (TES) system. Hence, taking the advantage of the controllability of CSP, the coordination of wind power and CSP will be a competitive choice to accommodate renewable energy. In this paper, we explore the way of utilizing the flexibility of CSP to reduce the intermittencies and uncertainties of both wind power and solar radiation. The steady-state operation model of a CSP plant with TES is introduced. An interval optimization based model is proposed to optimize the operation strategies of wind farms and CSP plants with the target of simultaneously compensating the intermittency and reducing the uncertainty of their joint power outputs. The results of case study verify that the generation intermittency and uncertainty will be remarkably reduced through coordinating wind with CSP.

AB Electricity generation from concentrated solar power plant can be optimized on its storage system or its receiver system. This paper conducts a review of how to optimize the concentrated solar power plant by increasing the stored energy capacity or by stabilizing the absorptance and emittance in the solar absorber. The additional stages in the CSP may increase thermal efficiency. The stages consist of two oriented solar absorber to create superheated steam fed to the steam turbine and one regenerator to optimally regenerate heat for working fluid before pumped to solar absorber. A suitable treatment for superheated steam from solar absorber can optimally supply the turbine with a continually stable steam. The continuous stable steam can be controlled using steam accumulator right before the superheated steam fed into turbine. The thermal energy storage in the cycle can be optimally selected based on the stored energy capacity per kg of compared material used. The final modification was made using recently developed absorber material of hafnium molybdenum nitride to create four layer tandem absorber of HfMoN(H)/HfMoN(L)/HfON/Al2O3. The tandem absorber indicates a stable absorptance and emittance up until 600 degrees C (in vacuum) and 525 degrees C (in air). The final configuration believed to enhance the thermal stability for high temperature concentrated solar power plant application. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We develop a taxonomy of the micro-solar design space identifying key components, design choices, Interactions, challenges, and trade-offs. Based on this taxonomy, we provide an empirical and mathematical analysis of two prominent designs of micro-solar power systems (Heliomote and Trio), and interpret the results to propose design guidelines for micro-solar power systems.

AB With the increasing penetration of renewable sources, solar power generation systems, such as photovoltaic (PV) and concentrating solar power (CSP), play a crucial role among various energy utilization. Largely introducing PV may have positive economic benefits but also harmful impacts on stability meanwhile due to its intermittent characteristics. However, thermal energy storage (TES) exhibits great potential in solving the problem by smoothing the variable output despite its high costs; therefore, large-scale integrated plants are in line with the market trend and worth of in-depth study. In this paper, the configuration-dispatch scheme with security and economy evaluation of large-scale hybrid PV/CSP generation plants is proposed, aiming at comprehensive and reasonable capacity determination of plant planning. Firstly, the modelling of each solar subsystem is presented, as well as the operation schemes of DC transmission channel according to the demand of receiving side. Then, the configuration-dispatch optimization model is presented to maximum the techno-economic benefits of whole systems, including the object and operation constraints. Furthermore, an instructive and comprehensive evaluation index system is established concerning economy and security impacts. The validity of the proposed scheme is examined based on a large-scale hybrid solar generation base in northwest China.

AB The generation of solar power are known to be seriously influenced by many factors, such as temperature, humidity, et al. These factors cause the fluctuations of solar power system. This paper considers those fluctuations of different terms by using actual historical data and the different distribution method. From the analysis and simulations, we find the fluctuation data for different terms can fit different kinds of distribution functions, such Gaussian distribution, T Location-scale, Histogram distribution, and Logistic distribution. Finally, the simulation shows the method is effective and efficient.

AB Concentrated solar power (CSP) plants that include thermal energy storage (TES) are an emerging renewable energy source due their dispatch capabilities similar to fossil fuel power plants. As such, it can be of interest to introduce students to its work mechanism and particularities. A simulator for a CSP plant with TES has been built as a teaching tool in order to provide a clear picture of the system. The simulation is based on the model of a 50 MW parabolic trough collector-based CSP plant with molten-salt-based TES. The plant is modeled as a mixed-integer linear-program, with the software implementation in Matlab.

TI PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF SOLAR-POWERED AIR-CONDITIONER
SO ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING IN JAPAN
AB With present-day global environmental and energy problems, high expectations exist for solar power generation to reduce carbon dioxide generated by the consumption of fossil fuels.
   On the other hand, power consumption in residential homes is increasing every year. Among the many household appliances, the power demand for air conditioners increases dramatically during the summer, particularly in the afternoons. Since this pattern closely matches the output pattern of solar cells, it should be possible to combine a photovoltaic array with an air conditioner to decrease the energy consumption within the home.
   In this paper a residential solar-powered air conditioner is developed that operates through a combination of photovoltaic array and commercial power. Also, the configuration and specification of the solar-powered air conditioner are described, and its performance characteristics are examined by analysis of the characteristics of the solar cell.

The natural gas (methane) is decomposed in an endothermic reaction into hydrogen and carbon. The separated carbon is fed to a direct carbon fuel cell (DCFC) and converted with high efficiency to electric power. A model of the proposed concept is carried out in the flow sheet program Cycle-Tempo and the results of the simulations and the corresponding analysis are presented in this paper.

TI Implications of longitude and latitude on the size of solar-powered UAV
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB The implication of solar irradiance and daylight duration on the design of a small solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that is capable of operating perpetually in various cities around the world was investigated. Solar data in 2013 on 12 cities distributed around the world was collected. The effects of the available solar irradiance and daylight of the city on the maximum take-off weight and wing span of a small solar-powered UAV were studied. The analysis indicates that daylight duration is as important as the available solar irradiance to the performance of the solar-powered UAV. Longitudinal coordinates and elevation have a minor effect on the estimation of daylight duration. Areas considerably high in solar irradiance and daylight duration are more conducive to the effective performance of solar-powered UAVs than other areas. Therefore, cities closer to the equator have an advantage in utilizing solar-powered UAVs: where smaller and lighter solar-powered UAV can be designed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Estimated Cost-effectiveness of Solar-Powered Oxygen Delivery for
   Pneumonia in Young Children in Low-Resource Settings
SO JAMA NETWORK OPEN
AB IMPORTANCE Pneumonia is the leading cause of childhood mortality worldwide. Severe pneumonia associated with hypoxemia requires oxygen therapy; however, access remains unreliable in low- and middle-income countries. Solar-powered oxygen delivery (solar-powered O-2) has been shown to be a safe and effective technology for delivering medical oxygen. Examining the cost-effectiveness of this innovation is critical for guiding implementation in low-resource settings.
   OBJECTIVE To determine the cost-effectiveness of solar-powered O-2 for treating children in low-resource settings with severe pneumonia who require oxygen therapy.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS An economic evaluation study of solar-powered O-2 was conducted from January 12, 2020, to February 27, 2021, in compliance with the World Health Organization Choosing Interventions That Are Cost-Effective (WHO-CHOICE) guidelines. Using existing literature, plausible ranges for component costs of solar-powered O-2 were determined in order to calculate the expected total cost of implementation. The costs of implementing solar-powered O-2 at a single health facility in low- and middle-income countries was analyzed for pediatric patients younger than 5 years who required supplemental oxygen.
   EXPOSURES Treatment with solar-powered O-2.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of solar-powered O-2 was calculated as the additional cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) saved. Sensitivity of the ICER to uncertainties of input parameters was assessed through univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
   RESULTS The ICER of solar-powered O-2 was estimated to be $20 (US dollars) per DALY saved (95% CI, $2.83-$206) relative to the null case (no oxygen). Costs of solar-powered O-2 were alternatively quantified as $26 per patient treated and $542 per life saved. Univariate sensitivity analysis found that the ICER was most sensitive to the volume of pediatric pneumonia admissions and the case fatality rate. The ICER was insensitive to component costs of solar-powered O-2 systems. In secondary analyses, solar-powered O-2 was cost-effective relative to grid-powered concentrators (ICER $140 per DALY saved) and cost-saving relative to fuel generator-powered concentrators (cost saving of $7120).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results of this economic evaluation suggest that solar-powered O-2 is a cost-effective solution for treating hypoxemia in young children in low- and middle-income countries, relative to no oxygen. Future implementation should prioritize sites with high rates of pediatric pneumonia admissions and mortality. This study provides economic support for expansion of solar-powered O-2 and further assessment of its efficacy and mortality benefit.

TI Techno-economic feasibility of solar power plants considering PV/CSP
   with electrical/thermal energy storage system
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB Renewable-energy power generation can mitigate global climate change and contribute to achieving the goals of carbon peak and carbon neutralization. A solar power plant with flexible output and low power-generation cost is the desired goal; however, it is unclear which combination modes have superior economy and reliability in current economic scenarios or cost reduction scenarios. In this study, a solar power plant with many combinations, comprising a photovoltaic (PV) plant, inverter, concentrated solar power (CSP, including solar field, thermal storage system (TES), and power cycle), electric heater, and battery, is proposed. The levelized cost of energy and loss of power supply probability are selected as the evaluation criteria, and the capacities of each component are set as decision variables. In the current and cost-reduction scenarios, the feasibility analysis of the system is evaluated, and the optimal combinations and capacities of the components are acquired via multiobjective optimization. The obtained results are as follows. In the current scenarios, a system comprising TES has better economy and reliability than that comprising a battery, and the integration of CSP into the PV system can most economically improve the reliability. With the cost reduction of the energy storage, there is a strong competitive relationship between the battery and TES when the battery cost is reduced to approximately 160 USD/kWh. A solar power plant with integrated CSP is an effective method of enhancing generation reliability, although the battery cost is reduced to 60 USD/kWh. In cost-reduction scenarios, the advantages of the battery gradually become apparent, e.g., a PV plant with a battery has greater competitiveness than that with a TES. The integration of batteries into solar power plants is a promising future endeavor, while integrating CSP in a power plant would still be advantageous in current scenarios.

AB The main power resource of the isolated or regional grid in islands or remote areas probably depends on wind and/or solar power. For that, it is quite necessary for a certain capacity of Pumped Storage Station (PSS) to improve the operation safety, stability and economical efficiency of the grid. Taking an isolated island grid as the case, with the known predictive grid load curve and output curve of the wind and solar power, simulation and analysis were made on the operation states of several different capacity of PSS in this paper. And then, the determination method of the optimal installation capacity of PSS was developed. Finally, the technical and economic benefits of PSS for the isolated grid were approved. According to the results, the reasonable supplement of a certain installation capacity of PSS to an isolated grid dominated by wind and solar power, constructed a Wind-Solar-Pumped storage (WSP) hybrid system, can efficiently make up the technical defects of the wind and solar power system and reach the great technical and economic benefits.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
AB The role that emerging economies, and China in particular, play in the global energy transition appears to be transforming. Transition literature to date characterizes the formation of cleantech sectors in emerging economies as being heavily dependent on foreign inputs of knowledge and other key resources. This article argues that in the, currently unfolding, next phase of the global energy transition, Chinese actors may play a more central role in global niche development for high-tech industries, including in constructing innovative and effective socio-technical configurations. This argument is illustrated with a case study of the Chinese Concentrated Solar Power industry, which is found to have developed largely independently of foreign resources. The case is used to highlight a number of specificities of the Chinese environment that set it apart from niche formation environments in OECD countries, and may allow China to open up technological trajectories unlikely to develop in those OECD countries.

SE River Publishers Series in Renewable Energy
AB Concentrated Solar Power deployment could potentially play an important role in the sustainable development strategy of Chile, the country with the highest solar potential in the world. In this regards, besides electricity generation costs, it is also important to assess the socioeconomic, environmental and social implications of any energy investment project. In order to shed some light to this issue, this work contributes to enlarge the existing body of knowledge by conducting a sustainability assessment of the installation, operation, and maintenance of a 110-MW Concentrated Solar Power tower plant in Chile. Using an Input-Output methodology and based on plants costs data, this work estimates the socioeconomic and environmental direct and indirect effects of the project in terms of economic activity, job creation, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions. Additionally, using the Social Hotspot Database, a preliminary social risk analysis in those economic sectors most stimulated by the project in terms of employment is performed. Assuming domestic provision of all goods and services, results show that the associated total socioeconomic impacts during the whole lifetime of the plant would amount to 3,124 million US$, a multiplier effect of 2.2 and a ratio of indirect per direct job creation of 1.21. Additionally, results also show that direct and indirect economic activities required by the project would generate 64.36 g CO2 per kWh. Finally, the social assessment indicates the existence of a high unemployment risk in those sectors most stimulated, therefore, the project could decrease these unemployment risks.

TI Windows of opportunity for catching up in formative clean-tech sectors
   and the rise of China in concentrated solar power
SO ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
AB We analyse the potential for industry entry and catching up by latecomer countries or firms in formative sectors, by deriving a framework that builds on the concept of windows of opportunity for catching up. This framework highlights differences in technological, market, and institutional characteristics between formative and mature sectors, and elaborates how this may affect opportunities for catching up. We apply this framework to the global Concentrated Solar Power sector, in which China has rapidly narrowed the gap to the global forefront in terms of technological capabilities and market competitiveness. We find that the formative nature of the sector resulted in turbulent development of the technological, market, and institutional dimensions, making it more difficult for early leaders to retain leadership, and therefore easier for latecomer firms or countries to catch up. This signals an increased role in early-stage technology development in the next phase of the energy transition.

TI Brayton technology for Concentrated Solar Power plants: Comparative
   analysis of central tower plants and parabolic dish farms
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB Concentrated solar power plants intend to be key in the pool of renewable energy production technologies in the next future because of their versatility and high efficiency. In this work a comparative study between two promising technologies is developed. A central tower receiver surrounded by a heliostat field and a farm of parabolic dishes, both coupled to a hybrid Brayton cycle, are considered. Two power scales are surveyed (between 5 and 20 MW) at three different locations with quite different latitudes (between Sahara desert and medium European latitudes) and meteorological conditions. A modelling scheme developed by our group that allows to obtain the expected thermodynamic and thermo-economic plant records is applied. Key indicators like efficiency, net generated energy, levelized cost of electricity, and specific plant investment are calculated and analysed. Variability of natural gas prices and also land cost uncertainty are reflected on levelized cost of electricity range. Among the plants compared, minimum values are found within the interval [135-163] USD/MWh for central towers at the highest power considered and southern latitudes. In addition, the area needed for the installation of the plants and the influence of CO2 taxes is also analysed. Displayed cashflows show larger investment costs for central tower than for dish farms. Finally, those systems are put into the context of other concentrated solar power, other renewable, like wind or photovoltaic, and other conventional power plants.

AB Accurate solar energy prediction is required for the integration of solar power into the electricity grid, to ensure reliable electricity supply, while reducing pollution. In this paper we propose a new approach based on deep learning for the task of solar photovoltaic power forecasting for the next day. We firstly evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm using Australian solar photovoltaic data for two years. Next, we compare its performance with two other advanced methods for forecasting recently published in the literature. In particular, a forecasting algorithm based on similarity of sequences of patterns and a neural network as a reference method for solar power forecasting. Finally, the suitability of all methods to deal with big data time series is analyzed by means of a scalability study, showing the deep learning promising results for accurate solar power forecasting.

TI Potential for using Solar-Powered Water Pumping Technology for
   Irrigating Sugarcane in Sri Lanka
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
AB Purpose: Price hike of petroleum and the non-coverage of national electricity supply in plantation sites are some shortcomings against implementing lift irrigation projects in highland sugarcane plantations. Solar energy can be used as an alternative energy source for diesel or national electricity dependent water pumping technology. The present paper demonstrates the potential of using solar-powered water pumping technology for irrigating sugarcane in Sevanagala, Pelwatta, Hingurana, Kantale, and Kilinochchi, in Sri Lanka.Research Method: The study was conducted in Sevanagala, Pelwatta, Hingurana, Kantale, and Kilinochchi, sugarcane growing areas. Technical and economical evaluation was carried out to characterize the usability of solar powered water pumping technology respective to conventional furrow irrigation and drip irrigation under different water sources i.e., tube-wells, agro-wells, small water tanks, and runoff water harvesters. Solar irradiance (W.m-2) and cloud cover (%) in each location were used to estimate the solar energy variations. NASA-MERRA-2 data set (GMAO, 2015) was used to derive solar irradiance for the period of 10 years from 2010 - 2019.Findings: The solar irradiance and insolation in the sugarcane plantation sites are sufficient to operate solar-powered water pumping systems. The solar irradiance and insolation in study area ranged from 218.2 kW.m-2 to 225.4 kW.m-2 and 5.34 kW.h.m-2 to 5.48 kW.h.m-2 respectively. The solar technology will greatly reduce the operating costs of irrigation, despite the high initial costs. Kilinochchi and Kantale area showed the highest and lowest profitability in using solar powered irrigation respectively. Nevertheless, Sevanagala, Pelwatta and Hingurana show medium potential for implementing solar powered water pumping systems for irrigations. Research Limitation: Limited availability of data on temporal changers of cost incurred on the irrigation practices and the fluctuation of market price of the solar powered water pumping systems were significant constraints experienced during the study period.Originality/ Value: The results of this study are highly useful for decision makers in both plantation and national level in implementation of productivity improving programs in sugarcane plantation areas in Sri Lanka.

AB The investment in renewable energies like solar power became a priority in order to protect the world from an environmental crisis caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Over the past few decades, human activities like burning fossil fuels for energy have increased greenhouse emissions to an unprecedented level which warn to increase the global average temperature up to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. Such increase in global temperature would cause massive environmental damage and affect people's lives. Currently, around 65% of the total CO2 emissions are related to fossil fuel burning activities, thus it is necessary to find alternative sources of energy that are environmentally friendly. Renewable energy like solar power is considered one of the most reliable sources of energy as it covers a wide range of the earth's surface and is constantly available. Several research studies focused on concentrated solar power (CSP) which revealed its high performance in producing electric power. Thus, this paper aims to study the feasibility of constructing a100 MW CSP Linear Fresnel solar power in Riyadh city to support meeting the energy demand in Saudi Arabia and reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. In this study, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) System Advisor Model (SAM) was used to design, simulate, and analyze the system. The system was designed based on CSP LF technology, and it was tested with two types of thermal fluid namely molten salt and liquid sodium to examine the potential of each fluid to generate competitive energy at a lower cost. The thermal fluids serve as heat transfer fluids (HTF) and thermal energy storage (TES), where TES supplies the power cycle with needed energy during sunset time. The system simulation shows the capability to produce enough solar power throughout the year. The model achieved a high level of energy production with a capacity factor exceeding 90% during summer for both operating fluids. It was also found that liquid sodium yields higher energy as compared to molten salt with a capacity factor exceeding 0.5-1.2%. During the summertime, it was shown that Saudi Arabia has a high potential to adopt the CSP LF technology to produce sustainable solar power. (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB In recent years, countries have begun to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and replace them with renewable energy resources in order to mitigate the effects of fossil fuels on the environment and save money besides increasing energy security. This paper has investigated the suitability map for the large-scale projects in concentrated solar power (CSP) in United Arab Emirates (UAE) using GIS data and multi-criteria decision making technique (MCDM). The suitability map is composed of multi-maps (layers) of solar irradiation [Direct Normal irradiance (DNI) component], land slope, protected areas, land use, proximity to water bodies, power grid and the roads. Then, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is applied to identify the weights of ranking criteria. The paper has highlighted the most-suitable location as well as non-suitable location among UAE to install CSP projects. The study's results proved that UAE have multi-hotspot locations can be exploited for CSP projects.

TI Nanoparticles as a high-temperature anticorrosion additive to molten
   nitrate salts for concentrated solar power
SO SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS
AB Hot corrosion is profoundly detrimental to construction elements in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants affecting their lifetime, running costs and safety. In this work we have studied the anticorrosion effect of TiO2 nanoparticles additives on carbon steel using XRD, XPS with depth profiling, EDX and FIB/SEM techniques. The results revealed that the addition of 1 wt% of TiO2 nanoparticles to molten binary nitrate salt reduces the corrosion rate of carbon steel more than twice and stabilizes the corrosion scale at 390 degrees C. The anticorrosion effect of TiO2 nanoadditive was attributed to the formation of iron-titanium mixed oxide on the carbon steel surface. It was confirmed by XRD and TGA techniques that addition of TiO2 nanoparticles does not alter the stability of the salt. In view of presented results, the feasibility of molten salts based nanofluids in the CSPs can be reconsidered in terms of improved compatibility with construction materials.

AB To research the influences of the excitation and steam valve on the stability and the number of equilibrium of electrical system of concentrating solar power(CSP) generation, the bifurcation phenomenon and its influence on the stability are analyzed by the basic principle of bifurcation theory. In this paper, the differential algebraic equations(DAE) for describing the dynamic characters of CSP generation was established firstly. Then, the influence of single parameter and double parameter on the grid stability and stability margin of CSP generation are analyzed in the infinite system by bifurcation theory taking respectively the excitation and valve opening as control parameters. On this basis, a static feedback controller is designed to further improve the system stability. The research results show that the number of equilibrium points and stability will change along with the excitation and steam valve. Stability margin will be increased gradually with the increase of excitation voltage and will be reduced gradually with the increase of steam valve. Moreover, the static feedback can delay bifurcations in a certain range. Thus, the above mentioned researches provide a theoretical basis of the stable operation control of CSP generation.

SO MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
AB The shortage of electric power and high diesel cost have influenced the desires of irrigation systems. Instead of these types of pumping systems, the solar-powered water pump is respectable in socioeconomic and environmental points of view. Water scarcity during the dry season and traditional irrigation practice becomes a common challenge. The study was conducted in three districts of Hamer, Asaita and Afabo Woreda. The main objective of the study was to investigate and model a solar-powered pump drip irrigation system for establishing resilience livelihood in the water scarce and remote areas. The solar water pump systems are sized considering to irrigating one hectare of land with a maximum daily crop water requirement of 21.35 m(3)/day/0.5 ha (Keske) and 31.5m(3)/day/0.5 ha (Hinale and Humaydota) in 12-h irrigation and a total dynamic head of 14 m. The average solar power potential of Hamer is 0.72 kW/m(2)and 0.57 kW/m(2)in Asaita and Afabo areas. The major constraints of irrigation practices in the areas are water scarcity, market inaccessibility, inadequate technology, and agricultural imputes. Therefore, applying water-saving technology, supplying improved inputs, supporting Agro-pastoralists with training and extension services are required. Implementation of solar-powered pumps and drip irrigation technologies with reservoirs mainly in water-scarce and long dray season areas is necessary.

AB Investments in energy projects require careful consideration, since inappropriate decisions can lead investors towaste finances, time and other resources. This paper will present the position that decisions for energy projects should be made after considerable, thoughtful and appropriate decision research and analyses. Due to the different aspects related to investment decisions in energy projects, using multi-criteria decision-making approaches is deemed to be a sensible approach to better ensure an appropriate course of action. In this study, the decision regarding location of a solar power plant, a critical issue pertaining to solar energy investments, is considered. Since solar power plant location decisions consist of conflicting criteria and varying possible locations, the solar power plant location problem is considered in this study. The main aim of this study is to propose a decision-making approach for solar power plant location problem which is integrating "Analytic Hierarchy Process" and "Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution" methods under hesitant fuzzy environment. The applicability of the proposed approach is then tested on a case study. Besides the innovative contributions to industry literature, the results of the case study demonstrate that the proposed approach is applicable for the challenge of determining plant locations.

TI System-level performance optimization of molten-salt packed-bed thermal
   energy storage for concentrating solar power
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB Molten-salt packed-bed thermal energy storage using thermocline technology is more cost-competitive than the conventional two-tank thermal energy storage, due to its integrated design and the employment of a low-cost packed-bed. However, such a storage configuration suffers the main drawback of a low capacity factor when applied to concentrating solar power because of the adoption of conservative cut-off temperatures. The present work evaluates the feasibility of taking less conservative cut-off temperatures to improve the utilization of the packed-bed thermal energy storage from the perspectives of a system-level operation and storage economy. The investigations are carried out on two levels. The first-level investigation reveals the effects of both the charging and discharging cut-off temperature on the thermal performance of the packed-bed thermal energy storage under ideal operating conditions. Three typical packed-bed configurations are involved. The results show that the capacity factor of the packed-bed thermal energy storage increases as the charging cut-off temperature increases and the discharging cut-off temperature decreases, especially for the configurations using latent-heat when the adopted cut-off temperatures jump over the phase change points of the encapsulated phase change materials. The second-level investigation discusses the impacts of different levels of deep charges (using high charging cut-off temperatures) on the scale design of the packed-bed thermal energy storage, the daily operation of the low temperature molten-salt pump (LT-pump) and the central receiver of a 100 MWe conventional concentrating solar power tower plant. The results indicate that a deeper charge operation is always accompanied with a smaller required packed-bed size as well as a higher required delivery capacity and higher pressure head of the LT-pump and that it always results in a larger daily pumping consumption, a higher peak inlet temperature ramping rate and a higher receiver pressure drop. The maximum allowable charging cut-off temperature is identified to be 500 degrees C for each packed-bed configuration, according to the operating limitations on the pump and receiver. Moreover, a cost analysis is carried out to obtain the optimum charging cut-off temperature for each packed-bed configuration. The obtained results show that performing deep charges with the cost-optimized charging cut-off temperatures can effectively improve the cost competitiveness of the molten-salt packed-bed TES integrated into concentrating solar power plants.

Both technological and economic aspects are presented, with focus on the European energy sector and EU legislation. General characteristics for CSP plants, especially with molten salt storage, are discussed. Perspectives for their development, first of all in economic aspects, are considered.

TI Investigating photovoltaic solar power output forecasting using machine
   learning algorithms
SO ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF COMPUTATIONAL FLUID MECHANICS
AB Solar power integration in electrical grids is complicated due to dependence on volatile weather conditions. To address this issue, continuous research and development is required to determine the best machine learning (ML) algorithm for PV solar power output forecasting. Existing studies have established the superiority of the artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) algorithms in this field. However, more recent studies have demonstrated promising PV solar power output forecasting performances by the decision tree (DT), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms. Therefore, the present study aims to address a research gap in this field by determining the best performer among these 5 algorithms. A data set from the United States' National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) consisting of weather parameters and solar power output data for a monocrystalline silicon PV module in Cocoa, Florida was utilized. Comparisons of forecasting scores show that the ANN algorithm is superior as the ANN16 model produces the best mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R (2)) with values of 0.4693, 0.8816 W, and 0.9988, respectively. It is concluded that ANN is the most reliable and applicable algorithm for PV solar power output forecasting.

SO FRONTIERS IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING-SWITZERLAND
AB Bibliometric analysis is a key study in order to elucidate the relevance of a research field. This study will point out the main evolution of the research performed in a topic considering the significance of each sub-topic. This study aims to perform a bibliometric analysis in concentrating solar power (CSP) technology. CSP had a first commercial wave between 1984 and 1995. Between 1995 and 2005 there was a period of commercial inactivity. Nevertheless, since 2005 CSP commercial implementation has been accelerating. This topic accounts for almost 6,300 publications on relevant journals and conference proceedings. Regional analysis showed that China is becoming the most relevant country for CSP research. The European Union still leads the development and will continue that way at least in the short term. Authors' keyword evolution analysis has been useful as an indirect measure of technological maturity. It was found that conference proceedings have an important effect in the overall CSP publications and need to be consider when working within this field. However, the journal publications have more impact since they are more frequently cited. Funding analysis had shown a direct relationship between funding and research output. Finally, it was concluded that inside the CSP field, parabolic trough has shown to have great relevance in the research output.

TI Fresnel lens: A promising alternative of reflectors in concentrated
   solar power
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Modern solar energy harnessing technology demands high grade energy to achieve efficient power generation with compact plant size and least payback period. But readily available solar energy is low grade energy. Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) technology is capable to cater the demand. Reflector or mirror in CSP contributes 50% of total cost of installation, hence huge initial investment and high life cycle costs are the major challenges associated with such plants. Moreover due to adverse service conditions and environmental impacts, it gets degraded early, causing substantial drop in efficiency and consequently reduction in life cycle. Fresnel lens as solar concentrator in Photovoltaic/Thermal (PV/T) applications may prove to be a promising alternative due to its potential to overcome technocommercial constraints associated with conventional reflector based CSP. A critical review covering global CSP deployment, operational requirement and failure mechanism in mirrors/reflectors is being presented. As an alternative, design considerations of Fresnel lens and its effect on various efficiencies, reflectance, transmittance and associated losses are discussed. Learning from early research work, innovative and emerging trends, economics, challenges and advantages are also presented. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB For 2030, Spain has set ambitious targets for increasing intermittent renewable electricity generation. Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants have the capability of store solar energy during operation allowing a reduction of the external support to renewable generation to cover the demand. A model has been developed for the estimation of the impact of a CSP deployment by substituting the targeted solar photovoltaic generation in the country. The results indicate that biomass can play a role in the extension of energy storage in CSP plants and providing the residual external support needed to balance the demand.

AB In 2015, the Government, through a special allocation fund, has finished constructing an off-grid 15 KWp off-grid solar power plant in Paya Tampah Village, Aceh Tamiang district. The long-term reliability of solar power plants is highly reliant on on-site measurements because of the vagueness in some of the constantly-changing variables such as irradiation, drought rate, which possibly lead to cause significant power losses and which turn out to also affect the estimated cost of PV (kWh). With the aim of upgrading capabilities in off-grid solar power plant planning especially in the province of Aceh, this paper outlining detailed comparison of the results of calculating the performance of off-grid 15 KWp off-grid solar power among system performance measurement results after 2 years of operation. Performance calculations performed with the assistant of PVsyst software. The measurement results characterize the total power generated by the off-grid solar power plant is 15 kWp and used by 38 households. The result of this investigation is expected to be used by local governments to be a benchmark on the future planned off-grid solar power plant planning.

TI Viability of a concentrated solar power system in a low sun belt
   prefecture
SO FRONTIERS IN ENERGY
AB Concentrating solar power (CSP) is considered as a comparatively economical, more efficient, and large capacity type of renewable energy technology. However, CSP generation is found restricted only to high solar radiation belt and installed where high direct normal irradiance is available. This paper examines the viability of the adoption of the CSP system in a low sun belt region with a lower direct normal irradiance (DNI). Various critical analyses and plant economics have been evaluated with a lesser DNI state. The obtained results out of the designed system, subjected to low DNI are not found below par, but comparable to some extent with the performance results of such CSP plants at a higher DNI. The analysis indicates that incorporation of the thermal energy storage reduces the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and augments the plant capacity factor. The capacity factor, the plant efficiency, and the LCOE are found to be 32.50%, 17.56%, and 0.1952 $/kWh, respectively.

TI Optimized dispatch in a first-principles concentrating solar power
   production model
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB Concentrating solar power towers, which include a steam-Rankine cycle with molten salt thermal energy storage, is an emerging technology whose maximum effectiveness relies on an optimal operational and dispatch policy. Given parameters such as start-up and shut-down penalties, expected electricity price profiles, solar availability, and system interoperability requirements, this paper seeks a profit maximizing solution that determines start-up and shut-down times for the power cycle and solar receiver, and the times at which to dispatch stored and instantaneous quantities of energy over a 48-h horizon at hourly fidelity. The mixed-integer linear program (MIP) is subject to constraints including: (i) minimum and maximum rates of start-up and shut-down, (ii) energy balance, including energetic state of the system as a whole and its components, (iii) logical rules governing the operational modes of the power cycle and solar receiver, and (iv) operational consistency between time periods. The novelty in this work lies in the successful integration of a dispatch optimization model into a detailed techno-economic analysis tool, specifically, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's System Advisor Model (SAM). The MIP produces an optimized operating strategy, historically determined via a heuristic. Using several market electricity pricing profiles, we present comparative results for a system with and without dispatch optimization, indicating that dispatch optimization can improve plant profitability by 5-20% and thereby alter the economics of concentrating solar power technology. While we examine a molten salt power tower system, this analysis is equally applicable to the more mature concentrating solar parabolic trough system with thermal energy storage.

AB Many countries in the world investigate the role of concentrated solar power for the future electricity generation. The technology bears many advantages in comparison with other renewable energy sources, as it can be combined with thermal energy storage and can thus be used to supply peak electricity and provide a higher flexibility and dispatchability. Available concepts differ in terms of energy yield, degree of dispatchability and levelized cost of electricity generation. Moreover, the possible contribution of CSP plants to grid security remains often unclear.
   For the example of South Africa, a booming economy with ambitious climate protection targets, we demonstrate the applicability of an innovative method to analyse the future role of concentrated solar power with and without storage. Based on a calculation of energy yield and energy provision characteristics and a probabilistic reliability method we show that storage capacity substantially affects firm capacity. Results show that depending on the additional CSP capacity and storage configuration which is added to the energy system, capacity credits range from 22% to 34% for systems without storage, 47% to 69% for CSP plants with limited storage and 84% to 93% for configurations with an extended storage configuration.
   Using an integrated energy system optimization model, we identify that CSP with appropriate storage size is a suitable option to cost efficiently mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. In an ambitious GHG mitigation scenario for South Africa, CSP would be one of the most important mitigation measures, providing about one quarter of the total electricity in future. The results also show that it is crucial to consider the share of renewable firm capacity through the future procurement of CSP capacity with appropriate storage size in future energy planning.

TI Dependability Impact in the Smart Solar Power Systems: An Analysis of

SO ENERGIES
AB The Internet has been going through significant transformations and changing the world around us. We can also see the Internet to be used in many areas, for innumerable purposes, and, currently, it is even used by objects. This evolution leads to the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. This new concept can be defined as a system composed of storage resources, sensor devices, controllers, applications, and network infrastructure, in order to provide specific services to its users. Since IoT comprises heterogeneous components, the creation of these systems, the communication, and maintenance of their components became a complex task. In this paper, we present a dependability model to evaluate an IoT system. Amid different systems, we chose to assess availability in a smart building. The proposed models allow us to calculate estimations of other measures besides steady-state availability, such as reliability. Thus, it was possible to notice that there was no considerable gain of availability in the system when applying grid-tie solar power or off-grid solar power. The grid-tie solar power system is cheaper than the off-grid solar power system, even though it produces more energy. However, in our research, we were able to observe that the off-grid solar power system recovers the applied financial investment in smaller interval of time.

TI Potential of Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Power Cycles to Reduce the
   Levelised Cost of Electricity of Contemporary Concentrated Solar Power
   Plants
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB This paper provides an assessment of the expected Levelised Cost of Electricity enabled by Concentrated Solar Power plants based on Supercritical Carbon Dioxide (sCO2) technology. A global approach is presented, relying on previous results by the authors in order to ascertain whether these innovative power cycles have the potential to achieve the very low costs of electricity reported in the literature. From a previous thermodynamic analysis of sCO2cycles, three layouts are shortlisted and their installation costs are compared prior to assessing the corresponding cost of electricity. Amongst them, theTranscriticallayout is then discarded due to the virtually impossible implementation in locations with high ambient temperature. The remaining layouts, Allam and Partial Cooling are then modelled and their Levelised Cost of Electricity is calculated for a number of cases and two different locations in North America. Each case is characterised by a different dispatch control scheme and set of financial assumptions. A Concentrated Solar Power plant based on steam turbine technology is also added to the assessment for the sake of comparison. The analysis yields electricity costs varying in the range from 8 to over 11 cent/kWh, which is near but definitely not below the 6 cent/kWh target set forth by different administrations. Nevertheless, in spite of the results, a review of the conservative assumptions adopted in the analysis suggests that attaining costs substantially lower than this is very likely. In other words, the results presented in this paper can be taken as an upper limit of the economic performance attainable by Supercritical Carbon Dioxide in Concentrated Solar Power applications.

TI Soiling Comparison of Mirror Film and Glass Concentrating Solar Power
   Reflectors in Southwest Louisiana
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Soiling effects influence the output of solar thermal plants, significantly causing unwanted transmittance, reflectance, and absorbance losses. Research is needed to identify what type of reflective surfaces are best suited for semitropical climates, such as the southeastern United States. This paper initially presents a review of several concentrating solar power (CSP) reflector testbeds used to analyze the soiling effects of various reflective materials. A soiling testbed is developed for this study that comprised six sets of reflective surfaces mounted at a fixed tilt of 30 degrees: three sets of thin-film surfaces and three sets of glass types. Two generations of 3M solar mirror film (SMF), 3M SMF 1100 and 3M SMF 2020, were used along with Konica Minolta SMF, silvered Corning Willow Glass, a dichroic cold mirror, and a standard mirror. Results show that the 3M SMF 2020 and Konica Minolta SMF performed the best during regular cleaning intervals, whereas the silvered Corning Willow Glass gave the best performance if only cleaned naturally. The other glass types showed the least average loss due to soiling throughout this study but gave the lowest performance for specular reflection.

TI High efficiency concentrated solar power plant receivers using periodic
   microstructured absorbing layers
SO SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS
AB This study presents a rigorous modeling approach for 1D microstructured absorbing multi-layers for Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) receivers, taking into account both the absorption of the incident solar energy as well as the emissivity for the desired receiver temperature. Based on an optimized multilayer structure achieving high absorption, the authors demonstrate that 1D sub-wavelength period gratings can further increase the absorption and thus the efficiency of the CSP system. The C-method (Chandezon Method) is used to theoretically optimize the 1D grating profiles. An experimental demonstration of the combination of lithographic grating fabrication and absorptive layer deposition using standard silicon wafers as substrates is also presented. Experimental results show 96.5% absorption in the visible and UV range, representing an enhancement of almost 2% in comparison to non-structured coatings. Those results are promising for the design of future and competitive solar absorbers for CSP, especially since the microstructure fabrication approach can be applied to non-planar substrates such as tubes typically used as receivers in CSP plants.

AB The carbon efficiency of a methanol production process that utilises concentrated solar power has been determined using basic process synthesis tools. The relationship between the hydrogen and oxygen content of the carbonaceous feed material and the carbon efficiency as well as the energy requirements has been explored. The target carbon efficiency of gasification- based methanol production from carbonaceous materials can be increased by 10 -20 % by employing concentrated solar power (CSP) depending on the hydrogen and oxygen content of the feed material. Further improvement in carbon efficiency can be attained by considering process that may not be gasification- based, but rather employ a novel overall mass balance.

AB This work presents the design of a robust decentralized PI control system for a small scale, grid isolated concentrated solar power (CSP) biogas hybrid unit. The biogas is readily available in remote and rural areas in the developing countries and its hybridization with a CSP unit as a supplementary source of heat for enhanced power backup is an attractive option. The considered system utilizes an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) for power generation. The control system is designed to supply the user demanded power to the extent possible with appropriate override controllers to ensure safe and stable operation as the thermal energy storage (TES) approaches the high or low limits. These overrides encompass shutdown and start-up of the biogas burner firing and the ORC at low TES level as well as appropriate reduction in the captured solar flux at high TES level. Closed loop results demonstrate the robustness of the control system to very severe disturbance scenarios with the TES storage never breaching the full or empty limits. Results also show that the hybridization with biogas heating gives extra back-up varying from 1.1 h to 6 h depending on the power demand (C) 2020, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

TI An improved energy management strategy for the solar powered unmanned
   aerial vehicle at the extreme condition
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB Solar powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), achieving a long time flight, has been drawn attention. The energy management is a dominate role to determine the comprehensive performance of the solar powered UAV. In this work, a three dimensional numerical model is built to study the heat and mass transfer in the solar powered UAV at the extreme condition. The effects of flight velocity, flight attitude, day and light on the heat and mass transfer in the solar powered UAV are investigated in details. Then, an improved energy management strategy is proposed to improve the efficiency of the energy utilization for UAV. Results show that the temperature in the solar powered UAV is affected by the flight altitude. When the flight altitude varies from 11 km to 20 km, the temperature of the battery has approximately decreased by 5 K. The improved thermal management system can keep the battery temperature at about 220 K. The minimum temperature of the battery approximately increases by 50 K compared with the traditional structure. The heat transfer in the solar powered UAV is strengthened with the improved structure. Besides, the outer surfaces of the UAV are also influenced by the improved structure with the minimum temperature of the solar panel increased by 3 K. The data obtained from the analysis of the simulation results are helpful to the optimal design of global energy management.

TI Multi-objective unit commitment of jointly concentrating solar power
   plant and wind farm for providing peak-shaving considering operational
   risk
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS
AB The large-scale integration of intermittent and uncertain renewable energy poses challenges for power system scheduling, especially for peak-shaving. In this paper, a multi-objective unit commitment model of jointly concentrating solar power plant and wind farm for providing peak-shaving considering operational risk (RMUC) is proposed. A concentrating solar power (CSP) plant is employed to improve renewable energy consumption and compensate wind power fluctuations. Firstly, an operational risk model under renewable energy integration with intermittency is constructed to quantify risks of wind curtailment and load shedding. Then, a novel RMUC model is established by incorporating operational risk into the unit commitment (UC) model, which can optimally allocate operational flexibility of power systems over spatial and temporal domains to reduce operational risk. The proposed model can co-optimize the uncertainty level and the peak-shaving operation, which is able to obtain an optimal trade-off between peak-shaving effect and reliability. Finally, the proposed model is applied on an IEEE six-bus test system and on a simplified real power system for verification, and the cost-effectiveness of the CSP plant in reducing the operational risk and providing peak-shaving is quantified.

TI One technology, two pathways? Strategic Niche Management and the
   diverging diffusion of concentrated solar power in South Africa and the
   United States
SO ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB The transition towards a low carbon energy system requires significant deployment of renewable energy technologies. Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants could contribute to a low carbon energy system, with an estimated potential global capacity of over 600 GW by 2030. Despite this potential, however, the CSP industry lags behind other renewable technologies, with only about 4% of its estimated global potential expected to be realised in the next decade. This paper investigates the reasons for this by comparing CSP in the US, where 60% of worldwide capacity is currently located, with South Africa, where its development has been slow despite an abundance of natural solar-energy resources. Using strategic niche management analysis, we identify replicable success factors that could accelerate the uptake of CSP projects in developing countries. The results reveal that the main reason for the successful diffusion and adoption of CSP in the US is consistent policy support, which has made it possible to bridge the gap between research and development and emerge in the market. By contrast, the development of CSP in South Africa has been hindered by several technical and economic problems, including a lack of technological expertise, resources and funding.

TI Direct environmental impacts of solar power in two arid biomes: An
   initial investigation
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
AB According to recent national energy plans and policy documents, the number of renewable energy developments is expected to increase in South Africa, thus contributing to the diversification of the country's energy system. Consequently, numerous solar power developments are being deployed in the sunny arid interior - areas generally represented by the Nama-Karoo and Savanna Biomes. These developments come with a range of novel environmental impacts, providing opportunities for multidimensional exploratory research. Here, a mixed-method approach was used to identify and investigate possible environmental impacts associated with two types of solar power plants: concentrating solar power and photovoltaic. Structured interviews conducted with experts and experienced professionals, together with observations from site visits generated complementary findings. In addition to the risk of cumulative ecological impacts associated with individual solar plant developments, landscape impacts of multiple power plants and the direct impact on avifauna were found to be the most significant environmental impacts. These direct impacts appear to be most significant during the construction stage, which represents an intensive 10% of the total power plant lifespan. This investigation provides an early, broad and informative perspective on the experienced and expected impacts of solar power in South African arid regions as well as insights to possible future research areas.
   Significance:
   Solar power represents a large component of the needed diversification of South Africa's electricity system.
   Research on the environmental impacts of solar power developments in the arid biomes of South Africa still is relatively scarce.
   Increased energy developments in the arid biomes will require knowledge of the associated impacts for conservation planning.
   Identification of environmental impacts throughout solar power lifespans enables informed management.

MAX phases are promising materials for CSP applications due to their optical properties and resistance to thermal shocks. Herein, we report a solar absorptance & GE;0.5 and a thermal emittance of 0.17-0.31 between 600 and 1500 K for Cr2AlC, Ti2AlC, and Ti3AlC2. These compositions were also exposed to solar salt corrosion at 600 degrees C for up to 4 weeks. Cr2AlC exhibited superior corrosion resistance due to the formation of a protective nanometric layer.

TI Solar powered UAV model on MATLAB/Simulink using incremental conductance
   MPPT technique
SO AIRCRAFT ENGINEERING AND AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY
AB Purpose The aviation industry has started environment friendly and also conventional energy independent alternative energy dependent designs to reduce negative impacts on the nature and to maintain its future activities in a clear, renewable and sustainable way. One possible solution proposed is solar energy. Solar-powered aerial vehicles are seen as key solutions to reduce global warming effects. This study aims to simulate a mathematical model of a solar powered DC motor of an UAV on MATLAB/Simulink environment. Design/methodology/approach Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is a critical term in photovoltaic (PV) array systems to provide the maximum power output to the related systems under certain conditions. In this paper, one of the popular MPPT techniques, "Incremental Conductance", is simulated with solar-powered DC motor for an UAV design on MATLAB/Simulink. Findings The cascade structure (PV cell, MPPT, buck converter and DC motor models) is simulated and tested under various irradiance values, and results are compared to the DC motor technical data. As a result of that, mathematical model simulation results are overlapped with motor technical reference values in spite of irradiance changes. Originality/value Different from other solar-powered DC motor literature works, a solar-powered DC motor mathematical model of an UAV is designed and simulated on MATLAB/Simulink environment. To adjust the maximum power output at the solar cell, incremental conductance MPPT technique is preferred and a buck converter structure is connected between MPPT and DC motor mathematical model. It is suggested to be used in solar-powered UAV designs for future developments.

AB Solar power has been growing rapidly in recent years. Many countries have invested in solar energy technology, especially in Photovoltaic (PV) power generation. With the increased penetration level, solar power forecasting becomes more challenging. To cope with solar power uncertainties, probabilistic forecasting provides more information than traditional point forecasting. Moreover, multiple PV sites with spatial-temporal correlations need to be taken into account. To produce probabilistic forecasts, this paper applies quantile regression on top of time series models. Considering the coherency among multiple PV sites, a reconciliation is applied using a copula-based bottom-up method or proportion-based top-down method. Numerical results show that the proposed methods efficiently produce accurate and coherent probabilistic solar power forecasts.

AB This paper presents a dedicated ray-tracing program developed in Matlab and specifically designed for assessing the heliostat optical performance of concentrated solar power facilities, in particular concentrated solar tower. To evaluate the performance of our program, we carry out a detailed comparison with a commercially available ray-tracing software (TracePro (R)) under various simulation conditions. As a test-case, we use the layout of the concentrated solar tower facility located at IMDEA Energy in Mostles (Spain), although the program allows for simulations with different heliostat field layouts. We show that the simulations of flux distributions on the target given by our program agree very well with that of the commercial software, but the computation time is significantly reduced. In fact, much faster simulations are obtained not only for individual heliostats but also for the entire solar field, resulting in our program outperforming the commercial software in at least a factor of 10. It is also shown that in the case of using matrices of slope errors, with the aim to obtain more precise flux maps, our program is much more efficient than the commercial software. For instance, when the facet is divided into squares of 2.5 cm (matrix of slope errors with 4864 elements), our program is a factor of more than 5 orders of magnitude faster than the commercial software. To further validate our program, we show that the simulated flux maps of individual heliostats with both software show an excellent agreement with the corresponding experimental flux maps.

This article reviews the thermal energy storage (TES) for CSPs and focuses on detailing the latest advancement in materials for TES systems and advanced thermal fluids for high energy conversion efficiency. Problems of TES systems, such as high temperature corrosion with their proposed solutions, as well as successful implementations are reported.

TI Solar Powered Charge Stations for Electric Vehicles
SO ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
AB Every hour, the sun emits more energy onto the Earth's surface than our entire world population uses in one year (Green Fuel, 2013, ) Solar power provides us with the possibility of a cleaner and more renewable future. Global climate change as a result of greenhouse gases and the effects of low air quality caused by pollutants have become very substantial issues in our world today. The costs associated with greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions, and the effect they have on human lives and human health, are major and growing concerns. The development and installation of solar powered charging stations will reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere, future costs associated with climate change, and health issues. Thus, there is environmental, social, and economic value associated with the installation of solar powered charge stations. Solar powered charging stations have the potential of significantly reducing air pollutants and improving urban air quality. The electrification of transportation and the use of solar powered charging stations as an electricity source will improve people's quality of life.

TI Molten-Salt Power Towers: Newly Commercial Concentrating Solar Storage
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE
AB Molten-salt storage is already commercially available for concentrating solar power (CSP) plants, allowing solar power to be produced on demand and to "backup" variable renewable sources such as wind and photovoltaics. The first CSP plants to operate commercially with molten-salt storage utilized parabolic trough concentrators, for example, the Andasol-1 plant. A new type of storage plant has now reached commercial status, with the 19.9-MWe Torresol Gemasolar power tower, featuring 15 h of molten-salt storage, having come online in Spain in May 2011. Advantages of the power tower storage system include the elimination of heat transfer oil and associated heat exchangers, a lower salt requirement, higher steam cycle efficiency, better compatibility with air cooling, improved winter performance, and simplified piping schemes. Near-term advances in molten-salt power tower technology include planned up-scaling, with SolarReserve due to begin constructing a 110-MWe plant in Nevada by August 2011. Other advances include improvements to the thermal properties of molten salts and the development of storage solutions in a single tank. With these developments at hand, CSP will continue to provide dispatchable solar power, with the capacity to provide energy storage for 100% renewable electricity grids in sun-belt countries.

TI Concentrating solar power: Improving electricity cost and security of
   supply, and other economic benefits
SO DEVELOPMENT SOUTHERN AFRICA
AB The South African solar resource is vast. By utilising this resource effectively, concentrating solar power (CSP) offers the ability to efficiently store thermal energy until needed for electricity generation. This technology can therefore assist the total electricity system to link demand and supply. Nevertheless, CSP is still entering the commercialisation phase and, as the learning rate sets in, the cost is expected to decrease significantly; thus providing a dispatchable renewable energy option that is competitive with conventional options. A major dilemma needs to be overcome. Until sufficient CSP capacity is installed each year, the localisation potential, and the overall economic benefit for the country, will not materialise. This in turn could stall the technology. This paper presents a techno-economic scenario to show that a CSP industry can be established now that exceeds the threshold for setting up economies of scale, reduces the cost of electricity, and increases energy security.

TI Numerical simulation of the airflow at the world's largest concentrated
   solar power plant in a desert region
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB Concentrated solar power (CSP) plants in desert regions disturb the wind regime and blowing sand, thus altering surface erosion and accumulation processes. We investigated wind regimes around the largest central-tower CSP plant in the world in Dubai in a desert environment using computational fluid dynamics to simulate the flows for the entire area, the wind and sand barriers, the central tower, and the heliostats. Over the entire area, increased surface roughness caused by the heliostats reduced wind speed by 20%, but the wind gradually returned to its original speed and direction after the return-flow region. Wind and sand barriers significantly reduced wind speed within 100 m and up to 200 m after the barrier. The area downwind of these barriers showed obvious airflow disruptions, with wind speeds decreasing by more than 50% at a distance of 100 m. The heliostat array reduced wind speed by about 20% locally, but had no effect on the overall wind field. Upwind and downwind of the central tower, the pressure and wind changed greatly, resulting in upwind erosion and downwind sand accumulation. We provide several recommendations regarding the management and design of CSP plants in desert regions.

TI A multi-state reliability evaluation model of CSP plants considering
   partial function failure
SO ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH
AB This paper proposes a multi-state reliability evaluation model for the concentrated solar power (CSP) plant considering partial function failure. Firstly, the component functions and components' consequences of random failure of CSP plants are analyzed. Core components affecting the output of CSP plants are selected. The CSP plant is divided into three subsystems: the heat collection, the heat exchange, and the power generation subsystems, according to the component function. Each subsystem is equivalent to a two-state component. Thus, an 8-state Markov model of CSP plant is established. The CSP plant can be operated in a partial function failure state as thermal energy storage (TES) or generation, depending on the functions of solar-heat and heat-electricity conversion. On this basis, the 8-state model can be simplified to a 4-state model by combining the partial function failure states of the same effect. Finally, the 4-state model is applied to the sequential Monte Carlo simulation for the reliability evaluation of power systems containing CSP plants. Two TES strategies are considered in the simulation: One is based on solar field (SF) average output, another is designed to satisfy the load preferentially. The proposed model is tested on the modified RBTS/IEEE RTS systems to verify the effectiveness.

TI Assessment of four main representative flint facies as alternative
   storage materials for concentrated solar power plants
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB At present there is an intense research for developing alternative sensible heat storage materials, such as natural rocks and recycled ceramics, able to work in concentrated solar power plants at high temperatures. This work demonstrates the potential of flint rocks as an economic and efficient filler material to be used with air as heat transfer fluid in packed bed storage system. Four facies of flint rocks were collected from south of France. To predict the performance of the storage system, crystalline structure, thermo-physical and thermo-mechanical properties of the studied rocks have been identified. For this purpose, the candidate rocks were subjected to extensive experimental characterizations under a series of thermal cycles. XRD, SEM, DSC/TGA, pycnometer, LFA, dilatometer, high temperature ultrasonic testing and nano-indenter method have been used to analyze these samples. Consequently, the 400 degrees C was identified as ideal temperature for the heat treatment process of flint. The obtained results from the four analyzed samples have been compared together and with currently used storage materials. The results gathered from this paper prove the potential of flint in terms of high density, good specific heat capacity and good thermal stability up to 400 degrees C to be used as filler material in energy storage applications relevant for low and medium temperature solar power plants.

AB Solid particle solar receiver (SPSR) and solid particles-supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO(2)) heat exchanger (HX) are critical units for energy concentration and conversion in innovative concentrating solar power (CSP) plant, and their property will have great impact on the sCO(2)-CSP integrated system. The SPSR is receiving increasing attention owing to the higher operation temperature potentially to lower the cost of the integrated. The significance of solid particles-sCO(2) HX cannot be underestimated, since the energy conversation assimilated from solid particles of the SPSR can be transferred to sCO (2) rapidly and efficiently to directly impact the whole efficiency of the integrated system. In this paper, mathematical models of quartz tube bundles SPSR and fluidized bed solid particles-sCO(2) HX were established. Furthermore, based on the first solar power tower plant in Asia, on-sun experiments were carried out, the total operation time exceeded 103 h. The experimental results show that when 59 heliostats are used, the direct normal irradiance is 865 W/m(2), and the remaining time is 351 s, the maximum output temperature can reach 871.6 degrees C. In addition, by comparing the simulation results with the experimental values, it indicates the established models possess high degree of accuracy. The study extends to the dynamic simulation and control strategy, and puts forward suggestions for the system optimization and operation regulation of the sustainable power system on electrical engineering and green energy.

AB As more fuel-based vehicles are replaced by electric vehicles (EVs) for providing transportation services in cities, e.g., electric taxi or bus fleets, solar-powered charging stations have been progressively deployed in the cities to provide charging services for EV fleets. The emerging solar-powered charging stations bring opportunities for EV fleets to reduce charging ca s t and carbon footprint by utilizing cheap and environmentfriendly solar energy. The uncertainty and dynamics of solar power, however, raise challenges in making full use of solar power on time for EV fleets, e.g., e-taxis, while at the same time serving passengers efficiently. In this work, we design SOURCE, a solar-uncertainty-aware coordination algorithm for e-taxis under spatial-temporal dynamics of uncertain solar energy and passenger mobility. We evaluate our solution with a comprehensive dataset for an existing e-taxi system and charging infrastructures including 726 c-taxis, 7,228 regular fuel taxis. 37 working charging stations, and 62,100 collected taxi trips per day. Our data-driven evaluation shows that our solution significantly improves the usage rate of solar power by 17.6% with similar passenger waiting time compared to the solution that co-optimizes service quality and usage of solar power without considering the solar power uncertainty.

AB This article presents thermodynamic performance of a solar-power tower plant, DAHAN, which is constructed in Beijing as the first Chinese solar-power tower demonstration plant. Different from the existing solar-power tower plant, the DAHAN configuration includes a two stage thermal-energy storage system consisting of a high-temperature oil accumulator and a low-temperature steam accumulator. The sensible heat and latent heat of steam are stored in the high-and low-temperature accumulators, respectively. The new plant is designed in such a way that during the operation the receiver can be connected to a steam turbine or energy storage system. Software that simulates the performance of the plant has been developed and the thermodynamic performance of the plant was investigated. The results show that the annual thermal efficiency from solar to power of the plant can reach 8.35%. The annual efficiency of plant can be increased by 0.65 percentage points at the optimal condition. The results provide a better understanding for the design and operation of solar-power tower plant.

SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB Recent climate initiatives had initiated a wave of reducing CO2 emissions for power generation. Many countries have been striving to develop and deploy low carbon emission technologies for power generation through efficiency improvement and use of renewable energy. For the regions that gain sufficient amount of solar to make solar power attractive overall, the challenge of intermittency still poses an issue for the electricity grid. The complementary role of natural gas power for the incoming renewables will be reinforced in the near future, but emission of CO2 needs to be avoided through means such as carbon capture and storage. A novel solution of integrating the s-CO2 oxy-combustion system with the concentrated solar power (CSP) is devised. The suggested concept will provide direction to satisfy the growing electricity demand, yet with environmental sustainability. The evaluation of this system in several regions possible for CSP installation shows reduction of fuel consumption by 17-38% compared to conventionally separated systems.

AB Concentrating solar power (CSP) is a new form of solar power generation, and it has schedulability because it contains heat storage device. The capacity of the heat storage affects the operating characteristics of the CSP directly, and configuring the thermal storage capacity of CSP properly can achieve the best controllability and economical efficiency. In this paper such factors as thermal power unit cost, the benefit from environment and operation and maintenance cost of CSP, the cost of spinning reserve and other scheduling economic factors are synthetically considered, to solve the optimal heat storage capacity of the CSP in each scheduling day of one year. On this basis, the balance point between the configuration cost of the heat storage device and the scheduling cost is explored to determine the heat storage capacity configuration of the CSP. Finally, based on the data of CSP from SAM software and IEEE 30-bus system, the proposed model is solved by CPLEX, and the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are verified.

AB Control and automation forms an integral part in the design of solar power conversion systems for stand-alone village installations as well as for industrial scale grid-connected installations. Some control designs employ digital implementation platforms such as robust industrial standard Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC's) with remote control/access capabilities. The Siemens Simatic S7-1214C TIA platform was chosen as PLC platform to automate an easy-to-assemble stand-alone mechatronic solar concentrator platform for power generation in rural Africa. This paper describes issues around a CO2 impact optimization algorithm as control concept for the automation of the solar power generation and tracking system wherein a digital power budget principle forms the basis for artificially intelligent decision architecture to maximize CO2 impact of the solar power system. The proposed control strategy would be of value to both off-grid rural power generation systems and commercial solar farms where CO2 impact optimization eventually impacts directly on the carbon footprint of a solar farm.

AB Demand for high temperature storage is on a high rise, particularly with the advancement of circular economy as a solution to reduce global warming effects. Thermal energy storage can be used in concentrated solar power plants, waste heat recovery and conventional power plants to improve the thermal efficiency. Latent thermal energy storage systems using phase change materials are highly thought for such applications due to their high energy density as compared to their sensible heat counterparts. This review, therefore, gives a summary of major factors that need to be assessed before an integration of the latent thermal energy system is undertaken. In addition, challenges faced when constructing and experimenting with the storage systems are mentioned. Finally, an insight on the cost analysis and the general performance metrics of the latent thermal energy storage systems is provided before conclusions are drawn.

AB Concentrating solar power (CSP) generation units, which can generate electricity without any pollutant emissions, is one of the most attractive alternatives to fossil fuels. However, the main disadvantage of the CSP device is the high investment cost. In order to improve the economic feasibility, it is necessary to properly design the thermal energy storage (TES) device to optimize its economic benefits. In this paper, considering the operation requirements of power system, the optimal co-allocation model of solar energy field and TES device is established to weigh the investment cost and wind power reduction. Through a case study, the effectiveness of using energy storage to improve wind power consumption is verified on the basis of considering the constraints of the actual operation of the system, solar radiation and wind energy uncertainty.

TI 100 GW solar power in India by 2022-A critical review
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB This study evaluates techno-economic feasibility of adding 100 GW solar power in India by 2022. The study observes disproportionately high focus on SPV technologies and poor growth of CSP technologies in India. The study raises concerns on capacity addition targets based on large scale thin-film solar power plants, their economic feasibility and its repercussions on the grid and the environment. The study concludes that India's ambitious solar program based on imported cells, modules and other equipments would increase India's energy import dependence and, thereby, jeopardize its energy security. The current study, based on empirical evidences, advocates for revamping state-wise solar capacity addition targets based on solar energy potentials. It also advocates for greater emphasis on CSP technologies and de-centralized applications of solar power. India must create a robust domestic manufacturing base for solar cells, modules and other supporting equipments for self-reliance. The study finally campaigns for all supply and demand side options to bridge the burgeoning demand-supply gap of electricity.

SO 2005 International Conference on Future Power Systems (FPS)

CY NOV 16-18, 2005
CL Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS
AB Concentrating Solar Power is the technology that is applied in a solar thermal power station. Solar radiation is concentrated on the boiler of a conventional power station. A review is given on the six concentration methods. Following a stagnation period of 15 years several new CSP projects have been announced. The Direct Normal Irradiation (DNI) and the yield of CSP-stations are calculated for cloudless days in Southern Morocco and Northern Australia. A baseload CSP plant of 1 GWe requires 34 km(2) of mirrors. A portion of these mirrors can be operated by independent solar farmers. Storage of solar heat enables solar electricity production at night. In the future hydrogen and chemical energy storing materials like zinc metal will be produced using concentrated solar heat. CSP is already competitive in sunny countries currently using oil generated electricity. In the future the investment costs of CSP will be 3600 $/kW(e), making CSP electricity about just as expensive as nuclear electricity.

TI Prediction of the Share of Solar Power in China Based on FGM (1,1) Model
SO AXIOMS
AB In recent years, fossil energy reserves have decreased year by year, and the development and use of renewable energy has attracted great attention of governments all over the world. China continues to promote the high-quality development of renewable energy such as solar power generation. Accurate prediction of the share of solar power in China is beneficial to implementing the goals of carbon peaking and carbon neutralization. According to the website of China's National Bureau of statistics, the earliest annual data of China's solar power generation is 2017, which leads to there being very few data on the share of China's solar power generation. Therefore, the prediction accuracy of most prediction methods is low, and the advantages of the grey prediction model are shown. Based on the share of solar power in China from 2017 to 2020, this paper constructs an FGM (1,1) model, calculates r using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, and predicts the share of solar power in China in the next few years. r = 0.3858 and MAPE = 0.20% were obtained by calculation of the model. The prediction results show that the share of solar power generation in China will increase year by year, and it will reach about 4.2301% by 2030. In addition, it is found that the share of China's solar power generation in 2021 is 2.1520%, and the predicted value is 2.1906%. It can be seen that the prediction error is small. Finally, the limitations and future research directions are elucidated. The prediction results presented in this paper will help to guide the development of solar power generation in China, and are of great significance in speeding up the pace of energy structural adjustment, accelerating the construction of a clean, low-carbon, safe and efficient energy system, and promoting sustainable development.

AB Based on the background of large aspect ratio solar powered UAV, the mass and structural dynamics characteristics of solar powered UAV with different layouts and different structure forms in time and frequency domain are studied in this paper. Firstly, the thin-walled structure models of solar powered UAV with flying wing layout and diamond wing layout are established with the same solar panel laying area. The flutter characteristics are calculated by P-K method In frequency domain, and the response characteristics of the structure under dynamic loads are calculated in time domain. The dynamic characteristics and mass characteristics of solar powered UAV with large aspect ratio with different layouts are compared. Then, the rhombus grid structure Is applied to the wing structure, and the finite element model of the rhombus grid structure is established to study the structural dynamics and mass characteristics of the diamond wing layout solar powered UAV. The results show that the frequency domain and time domain methods can accurately obtain the structural dynamic characteristics. The flutter characteristics and gust response characteristics of the solar powered UAV with diamond wing layout are better than those with flying wing layout, but the mass of diamond wing layout solar powered UAV is too large. The rhombus grid structure diamond wing layout solar powered UAV has good structural stiffness and higher flutter speed, and Its structural mass is 21.5% lighter than that of the thin -walled diamond wing layout solar powered UAV.

   Nevertheless, several potential applications for Small-Scale CSP plants (< 1 MW) can be relevant in the industrial sector as well as for off-grid purposes (i.e. in rural contexts).
   This paper presents the technologies suitable for off-gid applications, for electricity or cogenerated production.

   technology providers
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB Several energy scenario studies consider concentrated solar power (CSP) plants as an important technology option to reduce the world's CO2 emissions to a level required for not letting the global average temperature exceed a threshold of 2-2.4 degrees C. A global ramp up of CSP technologies offers great economic opportunities for technology providers as CSP technologies include highly specialised components. This paper analyses possible value creation effects resulting from a global deployment of CSP until 2050 as projected in scenarios of the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Greenpeace International. The analysis focuses on the economic opportunities of German technology providers since companies such as Schott Solar, Flabeg or Solar Millennium are among the leading suppliers of CSP technologies on the global market.

TI Solid-gas thermochemical energy storage strategies for concentrating
   solar power: Optimization and system analysis
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB A system-level analysis is presented for concentrating solar power systems employing various solid-gas thermochemical energy storage strategies, that is, different combinations of chemical reactions and process configurations. Specifically, three representative types (carbonate, hydroxide, redox) of reactions are studied and six different process configurations are proposed. An optimization model is then developed for the design and operation of the plants considering seasonal solar variability. The proposed model is used to obtain the optimal design and system performance of nine thermochemical energy storage strategies. Results show that six out of the nine strategies have the potential to improve both energy efficiency and economic performance over two-tank molten salt storage. In particular, the strategy based on manganese (III) oxide/trimanganese tetraoxide reaction and a configuration with indirect heat transfer in fluidized-bed reactor and open-loop structure achieves about 10% reduction in levelized cost of electricity over the commercially developed concentrated solar power plants. Finally, the impacts of key reaction and process parameters are analyzed and general guidelines for reaction and configuration selections are developed.

TI A remote integrated energy system based on cogeneration of a
   concentrating solar power plant and buildings with phase change
   materials
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB Independent solar energy systems are an alternative solution for remote areas that are rich in solar resources but difficult to connect to large power grids. The scheduling ability of a concentrating solar power plant with a thermal storage system is better than that of a photovoltaic plant; however, the high investment limits its application compared with a photovoltaic plant. Therefore, an integrated energy system is proposed in this paper. A combined heat and power unit and a concentrating solar power plant are assembled together to improve the thermal energy utilization. Buildings integrated with phase change materials are designed for heating and cooling storage; they provide energy savings of indoor loads and facilitate the efficient operation of conventional units. In addition, the coordinated day-ahead scheduling of the integrated system is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming model given as the minimization of operation cost. The case studies compare several energy supply modes with different forms of electricity and heating supplies. Results are in favor of the coordinated approach that shows better cost-effectiveness and development potential of the proposed energy supply mode.

AB In today's scenario to combat with climate change effects, there are a lot of reasons why we all should use renewable energy sources instead of fossil fuels. Solar energy is one of the best options based on features like good for the environment, independent of electricity prices, underutilized land, grid security, sustainable growth, etc. This concept paper is oriented primarily focused on the use of Solar Energy for the crude oil heating purpose besides other many prospective industrial applications to reduce cost, carbon footprint and moving towards a sustainable and ecologically friendly Oil & Gas Industry. Concentrated Solar Power technology based prototype system is proposed to substitute the presently used system based on natural gas burning method. The hybrid system which utilizes the solar energy in the oil and gas industry would strengthen the overall field working conditions, safety measures and environmental ecology. 40% reduction on natural gas with this hybrid system is estimated. A positive implication for an environment, working conditions and safety precautions is the additive advantage. There could also decrease air venting of CO2, CH4 and N2O by an average of 30-35%.

First. the geographic and topographic information about Oman are presented The methodology of producing solar radiation maps using GIS tools is then discussed. The results obtained show very high potential of solar radiation over all the lands of Oman during the whole year. A slope analysis has allowed calculating the yearly electricity generation potential for different Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) technologies such as the parabolic trough, parabolic dish, tower, and concentrated PV. For instance if only 10% of the land of Oman with a slope less than 1% is considered an exploitable land for the parabolic trough CSP technology, then the total calculated potential of yearly electricity generation would be about 7.6 million GWh, which is many multiples of (680 times) the Current generation supply in Oman which was about 11,189 GWh in 2007 (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Optimal Dispatching of Power System by Introducing Concentrating Solar
   Power Station to Promote Large-scale Wind Power and Photovoltaic
   Accommodation
SO RECENT ADVANCES IN ELECTRICAL & ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING
AB Background: With respect to the problem of wind power and photovoltaic (PV) grid connected accommodation, a power system optimization dispatching method is proposed that introduces a concentrating solar power (CSP) station to promote wind power and PV accommodation, considering the dispatch-ability of the thermal storage system (TSS) and the accommodation capacity of the electric heating device (EHD) in the CSP station.
   Methods: The method analyzes an internal simplified model of a CSP station and a short-time scale identification method of wind and PV power ramping events based on a CSP-Wind-PV system structure. Furthermore, the operating characteristics and constraints of various units are considered with the goal of the lowest comprehensive system cost to establish a CSP-Wind-PV optimization model for dispatching power system.
   Results: The method is simulated and verified on the IEEE-RTS24 node system by using the MATLAB optimization toolbox.
   Conclusion: The results demonstrate that the participation of a CSP station can decrease the number of power ramping events and reduce the curtailment of wind and PV power while ensuring the economical operation of the power system.

SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Nowadays a sensible heat thermal energy storage system based on packed bed of rocks with air as a heat transfer fluid is considered a promising alternative and cost-effective solution for storage applications in concentrated solar power plants. Two varieties of basalt rocks collected from two different regions have been assessed for high-temperature packed-bed thermal energy storage. The most relevant thermo-physical and mechanical properties of the studied rocks as sensible heat storage materials were characterized. The influence of temperature on thermal expansion, density, specific heat capacity, thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity and Young's modulus has been analyzed, as well as the crystalline phases and chemical compositions have been identified. Compared to molten salts and other available storage materials, the obtained results proved the potential of fine-grained basalt rocks to be used as filler material in energy storage applications suitable for high temperature concentrated solar power plants (up to 700 degrees C). In addition to their availability at low cost with low environmental impact, basalt rocks showed high thermo-physical properties and good thermal stability in this range of temperature.

TI Effect of TiO2 nanoparticles on the thermal energy storage of HITEC salt
   for concentrated solar power applications
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB Thermal energy storage materials are substantial in concentrated solar power (CSP) plants as they absorb solar thermal energy and store it to be used for electricity production. Enhancing the thermophysical properties of these materials will positively affect the efficiency of the CSP plant system and lower electricity price. This research synthesized a novel composite of Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles and the ternary nitrate molten salt (HITEC) at different nanoparticle concentrations. The nano-enhanced molten salt (NEMS) samples were characterized for compatibility and nanostructure analysis. Also, the thermophysical properties and thermal cycling behaviour of the NEMS samples were evaluated. The results indicate that 0.1 wt% can enhance the specific heat capacity of HITEC by 5.5 %, latent heat by 78 %, and upper working temperature by 5 %. The morphological analysis of the 0.1 wt% NEMS sample revealed a good dispersion of nanoparticles in HITEC and the formation of nanostructures. The FT-IR analysis showed the chemical stability of the nanofluid with no presence of chemical reaction between its components. The thermal cycling test of the optimum sample showed the chemical stability of the nanocomposite and the thermal cycling stability of the enhanced thermophysical properties.

TI Theory and performance analysis of a new heat engine for concentrating
   solar power
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH
AB The objectives of this paper are to introduce a new heat engine and evaluate its performance. The new heat engine uses a gas, such as air, nitrogen, or argon, as the working fluid and extracts thermal energy from a heat source as the energy input. The new heat engine may find extensive applications in renewable energy industries, such as concentrating solar power (CSP). Additionally, the heat engine may be employed to recover energy from exhaust streams of internal combustion engines, gas turbine engines, and various industrial processes. It may also work as a thermal-to-mechanical conversion system in a nuclear power plant and function as an external combustion engine in which the heat source is the combustion gas from an external combustion chamber. The heat engine is to mimic the performance of an air-standard Otto cycle. This is achieved by drastically increasing the time duration of heat acquisition from the heat source in conjunction with the timing of the heat acquisition and a large heat transfer surface area. Performance simulations show that the new heat engine can potentially attain a thermal efficiency above 50% and a power output above 100kW under open-cycle operation. Additionally, the heat engine could significantly reduce CSP costs and operate in open cycles, effectively removing the difficulties of dry cooling requirement for CSP applications.

TI Technoeconomic Impacts of Storage System Design on the Viability of
   Concentrated Solar Power Plants
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB For future concentrating solar power (CSP) plants, a levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) of
   $0.06/kWhe is targeted, with their greatest value being their low-cost storage. However, low-cost storage is not the only factor that should be considered when selecting storage systems as this choice can significantly impact other parts of the CSP plant, potentially leading to a higher LCOE. Therefore, the current study aims to economically investigate the integration of various storage system designs into a sodium/sCO(2) CSP plant. Using component cost targets coupled with storage cost estimates, the impact of storage design conditions could be evaluated. From this analysis it was found that while a molten chloride two-tank system had the lowest storage cost, integration led to a higher or comparable LCOE to other studied designs. Therefore, it is important that future storage designs and studies account for the complete CSP system when system configurations and technologies are proposed.

AB Several thermal energy storage (TES) systems have been developed and tested to be integrated in concentrating solar power (CSP) systems. Recent studies show that concrete as storage media has the potential to become an interesting solution due to its properties such as relatively high specific heat and thermal conductivity, good mechanical properties, a thermal expansion coefficient similar to that of steel pipe and low cost of a material that is easy to obtain and process. This article outlines a new 100 kWth solar beam-down facility for testing high temperature concrete storage at 393 degrees C and the first project to use the facility for TES testing in collaboration with NEST. Initial concrete characterization and testing results which show promising thermal and mechanical performance, are also presented. The CSP hot oil-loop has been modified and instrumented to perform research and testing of TES systems in real solar radiation conditions. Experimental TES system testing at real scale with a total storage capacity of 1.0 MWhth is planned to begin operation early 2015.

TI A Co-Powered Biomass and Concentrated Solar Power Rankine Cycle Concept
   for Small Size Combined Heat and Power Generation
SO ENERGIES
AB The present work investigates the matching of an advanced small scale Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Rankine cycle plant with end-user thermal and electric load. The power plant consists of a concentrated solar power field co-powered by a biomass furnace to produce steam in a Rankine cycle, with a CHP configuration. A hotel was selected as the end user due to its high thermal to electric consumption ratio. The power plant design and its operation were modelled and investigated by adopting transient simulations with an hourly distribution. The study of the load matching of the proposed renewable power technology and the final user has been carried out by comparing two different load tracking scenarios, i.e., the thermal and the electric demands. As a result, the power output follows fairly well the given load curves, supplying, on a selected winter day, about 50 GJ/d of thermal energy and the 6 GJ/d of electric energy, with reduced energy dumps when matching the load.

AB Owing to critical role of photovoltaic (PV) power in oncoming energy market, an accurate PV power forecasting model is demanded. In this paper, an effective solar power prediction model composed of variational mode decomposition, information-theoretic feature selection, and forecasting engine with high learning capability is proposed. The feature selection method is based on information-theoretic criteria and an optimisation algorithm. The forecasting engine is multilayer perceptron neural network equipped with modified Levenberg-Marquardt learning algorithm. An evolutionary algorithm is also incorporated into the training mechanism of the forecasting engine to enhance its learning capability. Effectiveness of the proposed PV prediction model is illustrated on a Hungarian solar power plant.

AB Installed capacity of solar power in China is expected to ramp from 0.9 GW in 2010 to 160 GW in 2020. Understanding characteristics of this variable source of power and its potential impact on power system operation would be critical for its sustained development. This paper evaluates the resource availability of solar power and operational characteristic in Northwestern China, incorporating high resolution meteorological data and land use information. The regional power system is further modeled to analyze the potential impact of solar power on power grid. Unit commitment model is conducted on an hourly resolution for the entire year of 2020. Analysis has shown that Northwest China region could constitute to approximately 45% of China's total solar power potential, with an estimated annual average capacity factor ranging from 0.15-0.20. The results indicate that the growth of solar power in Gansu and Qinghai provinces in 13th Five Year Plan might be largely constrained by the grid integration, while this impact in other provinces in Northwest China (Shaanxi, Ningxia and Xinjiang) is relatively small.

AB Development of renewable energy power plant represents a strategic way to increase electrification ratio and to reduce CO2 emission. One of renewable energy potential resources in Indonesia is solar power since the country is located in the equator line. In 2014, there are 8,170 kWp community based solar power plant that has been built by the government in the rural area. However, advantages of community based solar power plant will depend on its sustainability. This study examines the sustainability of community based solar power plant based on an interview with local government. It also determines the potential of community based solar power plant reduces CO2 emission at the research location. The interview was conducted with Authorized Environmental Agency. The results show that sustainability of solar power plant in the research area is considered to be good. It is also known that CO2 emission reduction in research location during its lifetime is 316,302 kg. It is believed that this successful example can provide policy recommendation for government to develop a more solar power plant in another rural area.

TI Assessment of concentrated solar power (CSP) technologies based on a
   modified intuitionistic fuzzy topsis and trigonometric entropy weights
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB Concentrated solar power (CSP) technology has shown considerable long-term growth with varying levels of peak development and stall phases over the years. More and more countries are finding CSP technology attractive for the production of electricity and other applications. CSP offers a variety of applications where solar power can be used appropriately, although the debate about which CSP technology has a better future perspective is still ongoing. This technology sector has seen a multitude of advancements and technological innovations. These improvements are primarily concerned with the design of the collectors and the related materials they are made from, the heat transfer processes, and the production and accumulation of energy.
   In order to assess these CSP technologies, in this paper we propose a fuzzy multi-criteria method. Then, Solar tower (ST), Parabolic solar trough (PST), Compact linear Fresnel reflector (CLFR), and Dish Stirling (DS) are evaluated using a modified intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS with a trigonometric entropy vector weight.

TI Study on standby process of an air-based solid packed bed for flexible
   high-temperature heat storage: Experimental results and modelling
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB An air-based solid packed bed thermocline tank is a low-cost high-temperature thermal energy storage technology, which is especially suitable for concentrated solar power plants when combined with Brayton cycle. Standby process between charging and discharging is a practical operation concern to improve the flexibility and economy of a concentrated solar power plant, and it is one of the most frequent states of the heat storage tank and is often related to the destratification in the thermocline. Whereas, till date little attention has been paid on to this static process as well as its effects on the heat storage performance, thus this work aims at filling this gap and getting more insights into the standby stage of the air-based solid packed bed thermocline tank by means of both experiments and modelling. In the present study, 1-D two-phase transient models were developed for both the dynamic (charging and discharging) and static (standby) processes, and experiments were conducted on a pilot-scale air-based solid packed-bed thermal energy storage testing system. It was found that the thermal stratification of the testing system decays by 30% after a 6-h standby stage, indicating a largely deteriorated heat storage performance. It was also found that the numerically predicted temperatures agree pretty well with the experimentally measured data under both a charging-standby-discharging cycle and a charging-standby process. In addition, sensitivity analysis was conducted to better understand the heat transfer mechanisms during the standby stage, and contribution of each mechanism to the thermocline destratification was also studied. The results indicate that thermal diffusion and heat loss contribute more to the degradation of the thermocline during the standby stage than natural convection, all of which cannot be simply ignored in the modelling. Moreover, the developed models and the experimental data reported here are reliable and valuable for further extended studies on more systematic and complex problems of related industrial engineering applications.

TI Volumetric Risk Hedging Strategies and Basis Risk Premium for Solar
   Power
SO JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS
AB This article studies volumetric risk hedging strategies for solar power with a twofold proposal of temperature-based and solar power generation-based models for solar power derivatives. It discusses the basis risk arising from a solar power volumetric risk hedge with temperature. Using the two models, the author designs and prices call options written on the accumulated non-cooling-degree days and the accumulated low solar power generation days for hedging cool summer risk, respectively, under the good-deal bounds. Using empirical studies of Czech solar power generation and Prague temperature, the author estimates the models' parameters and numerically obtain basis risk premiums, that is, solar power generation-based call option prices minus temperature-based call option prices. Results show that premiums increase with temperature up to 25 degrees C and decrease with temperature when it is higher than 25 degrees C. This is consistent with the relationship between solar power generation and temperature. Above 25 degrees C, the relationship is close to linear because o f the offsetting effects of increased solar radiation and decreased solar panel efficiency.

TI Optimized design of Ca-based thermochemical heat storage materials for
   concentrated solar power
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB Ca-Looping concentrated solar power with direct radiation absorption mode is promising, provided that the low light absorption of CaCO3/CaO can be solved. In this work, Ca-based thermochemical materials (CTMs) doped with Fe and Mn elements were synthesized by the sol-gel method. The added Fe and Mn elements increase the absorption of CTMs, while also effectively improving cyclic stability. Calcination experiments show that Ca0.15Fe2.85O4 can be used as additional materials to improve the absorption of CaCO3/CaO, and in particular, the near IR region. Additional findings suggest that morphology and cyclic stability of the materials are closely related. The porosity and pore size of CaCO3/CaO was also controlled by adjusting the amount of citric acid used during processing.

TI Novel methodology to prepare homogenous ternary molten salts for
   concentrated solar power applications and their thermo-physical
   characterization
SO APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING
AB Homogeneous ternary molten salt mixtures have been synthesized using novel and robust preparation method. In a typical preparation method, the ternary molten salt compositions contain two salts in common (KNO3 and LiNO3) and one additional hydrated salt. Thermo-physical properties of various synthesized ternary molten salt mixtures were evaluated by using simultaneous TGA-DSC, Dynamic Shear Rheometer and Thermal conductivity analyzer. Thus prepared ternary molten salt mixtures exhibited improved thermo-physical properties in the form of low melting point, high thermal stability, high specific heat capacity, high thermal conductivity and low viscosity, which are essential for the high temperature heat transfer fluids in concentrated solar power (CSP) applications.

TI An attention-based Bayesian sequence to sequence model for short-term
   solar power generation prediction within decomposition-ensemble strategy
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The utilization of renewable energy has attracted much attention with the deterioration of the environment. Solar energy is widely distributed and has huge reserves. But, solar energy is also volatile and intermittent. This brings difficulties to the large-scale grid connection of solar energy and the distribution of power resources. The key to solve this problem is to provide accurate and stable short-term prediction for solar power generation. For this purpose, we present an attention-based Bayesian sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) model within decomposition-ensemble strategy. Firstly, an influential factors analysis is performed on the data about meteorological conditions, operation status of the photovoltaic panels and historical solar power generation sequences to obtain the optimal combination of the influential factors. Secondly, this paper proposes a novel decomposition-ensemble framework based on complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise and independent component analysis to mine the intrinsic modes of the solar power generation time series. Thirdly, this paper presents an attention-based Bayesian Seq2Seq method for modeling the relationships between solar power generation and influential factors. Using a real-world dataset from State Administration of Electricity Investment Science and Technology of China, a case study, comparative analysis and robustness checks are conducted, through which the contributions of the methods in the proposed model and the superior performance of the model are demonstrated.

TI Review of Reactors with Potential Use in Thermochemical Energy Storage
   in Concentrated Solar Power Plants
SO ENERGIES
AB The aim of this study is to perform a review of the state-of-the-art of the reactors available in the literature, which are used for solid-gas reactions or thermal decomposition processes around 1000 degrees C that could be further implemented for thermochemical energy storage in CSP (concentrated solar power) plants, specifically for SPT (solar power tower) technology. Both direct and indirect systems can be implemented, with direct and closed systems being the most studied ones. Among direct and closed systems, the most used configuration is the stacked bed reactor, with the fixed bed reactor being the most frequent option. Out of all of the reactors studied, almost 70% are used for solid-gas chemical reactions. Few data are available regarding solar efficiency in most of the processes, and the available information indicates relatively low values. Chemical reaction efficiencies show better values, especially in the case of a fluidized bed reactor for solid-gas chemical reactions, and fixed bed and rotary reactors for thermal decompositions.

   energy storage (LAES) and high-temperature concentrated solar power
   (CSP): Energy, exergy, economic, and environmental (4E) assessments,
   along with a case study for San Diego, US
SO SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB Liquid air energy storage, a recently introduced grid-scale energy storage technology, has attracted attention in recent years due to its unique characteristics: geographic location independence, high energy density, broad storage capacities, and fast response time. A green hybrid concept based on a combination of liquid air energy storage with concentrated solar power technology is evaluated through simulations to quantify the improvements in the environmental and operational performance of the system. In lieu of a conventional combustion chamber, a concentrated solar power combined with the heliostat field, cavity receiver, high-temperature molten salt, and thermal energy storage is used. During peak demand times, the system produces about 53.9 MW of power and 55 kg/s domestic hot water. The round-trip energy and exergy efficiencies of the system are 54.05% and 46.51%, respectively. Applying the proposed concept for the case of San Diego with the real hourly data, results in an annual green power generation of around 25 GWh, prevents the release of over 5100 tons of CO2, meaning an annual environmental cost reduction by over 122,000 $. The economic analysis show that the payback period and overall profit of the proposed system in this city are 2.42 years and 137.4 $M, respectively.

TI Coordinated Operation of Concentrating Solar Power Plant and Wind Farm
   for Frequency Regulation
SO JOURNAL OF MODERN POWER SYSTEMS AND CLEAN ENERGY
AB As a dispatchable renewable energy technology, the fast ramping capability of concentrating solar power (CSP) can be exploited to provide regulation services. However, frequent adjustments in real-time power output of CSP, which stems out of strategies offered by ill-designed market, may affect the durability and the profitability of the CSP plant, especially when it provides fast regulation services in a real-time operation. We propose the coordinated operation of a CSP plant and wind farm by exploiting their complementarity in accuracy and durability for providing frequency regulation. The coordinated operation can respond to regulation signals effectively and achieve a better performance than conventional thermal generators. We further propose an optimal bidding strategy for both energy and frequency regulations for the coordinated operation of CSP plant and wind farm in day-ahead market (DAM). The validity of the coordinated operation model and the proposed bidding strategy is verified by a case study including a base case and sensitivity analyses on several impacting factors in electricity markets.

TI Development of a Simple Methodology Using Meteorological Data to
   Evaluate Concentrating Solar Power Production Capacity
SO ENERGIES
AB Evaluation of the Concentrating Solar Power capacity factor is critical to support decision making on possible regional energy investments. For such evaluations, the System Advisor Model is used to perform capacity factor assessments. Among the required data, information concerning direct normal irradiance is fundamental. In this context, the Engerer model is used to estimate direct normal irradiance hourly values out of global horizontal irradiance ground measurements and other observed meteorological variables. Model parameters were calibrated for direct normal irradiance measurements in Evora (Southern Portugal), being then applied to a network of 90 stations, part of the Portuguese Meteorological Service. From the modelled direct normal irradiance, and for stations that comprise 20 years of data, typical meteorological years were determined. Finally, to identify locations of interest for possible installations of Concentrating Solar Power systems, annual direct normal irradiance availabilities and the respective capacity factor, for a predefined power plant using the System Advisor Model, were produced. Results show annual direct normal irradiance availabilities and capacity factors of up to similar to 2310 kWh/m(2) and similar to 36.2% in Castro Marim and in Faro, respectively. Moreover, this study supports energy policies that would promote Concentrating Solar Power investments in Southern Portugal (Alentejo and Algarve regions) and eastern centre Portugal (Beira Interior region), which have capacity factors above 30%.

AB Nowadays, with the rapid development of related technologies, the solar power become an important component of the whole energy system. At present, there are two main forms of solar power generation: photovoltaics (PV) and concentrated solar power (CSP). Among them, PV is much cheaper, but more susceptible to resource conditions, while CSP is more controllable based on the thermal storage section, but still expensive. To integrate the advantages of these two kinds of technologies, the hybrid solar power system is proposed by many researchers. Some single objective optimization algorithms are used in the process of design such systems. However, it is still a dilemma to deal with the cost and stability in the hybrid system. In this paper, we try to propose an Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MO_PSO) algorithm to solve this problem, which can consider the performance and cost of the project at the same time. The experimental result based on the real data shown that this algorithm can provide a feasible solution of the hybrid power system with stable output and acceptable cost. Furthermore, this method based on artificial intelligence can be used in other hybrid systems optimization in the smart grid.

TI Deep learning-based probabilistic anomaly detection for solar
   forecasting under cyberattacks
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS
AB Recently, cyberattacks on solar power forecasting emerge with the increase of solar penetration, which may lead to substantial economic losses and power system reliability issues. This paper presents a novel probabilistic anomaly detection framework to effectively and accurately detect cyberattacks in solar power forecasting, which consists of three major components. First, a convolutional neural network is used to extract spatial correlations among solar farms at the bottom of the model. Second, a long short-term memory network is used to capture the temporal dependencies within solar power data and generate deterministic solar power forecasts, which is then converted to probabilistic forecasts through pinball loss optimization. Finally, the probabilistic solar power forecasts are used for anomaly detection. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated by using 16 solar farms with a variety of data integrity attacks. Numerical results of case studies show that the developed probabilistic anomaly detection methodology could effectively detect data integrity attacks in solar power forecasting with a relatively high accuracy.

AB Electric bicycles (e-bikes) are considered a sustainable alternative to automobile transportation today. The electric bike includes all the benefits that conventional bicycles offer, plus faster, more comfortable and longer trips, as well as less effort for the user. In this paper, we specifically focus on a new type of e-bike, the so-called solar-powered e-bike'. Therefore, this review paper explores existing literature findings for the use of solar energy in transportation, and more specifically in e-bikes. This paper aims to capture the status of and experiences with the use of e-bikes; more specifically, with solar-powered e-bikes. It presents research conducted so far on e-bikes and solar-powered e-bikes, as well as the main technical features of the solar e-bike. Finally, it analyzes a sample of e-bikes' and solar-powered e-bikes' users, based on Dutch National Travel Survey data and an experimental field study conducted in 2017. Data showed that the main target group of (solar) e-bikes are commuters in the age group between 40 and 60 years old, commuting distances longer than 6 km, with a gross income higher than Euro2500. Solar-powered e-bikes are concluded to have potential as a sustainable way of transportation in urban areas and cities, potentially replacing the conventional means of transport.

AB We propose a new approach for time series forecasting, called PSNN, which combines pattern sequences with neural networks. It is a general approach that can be used with different pattern sequence extraction algorithms. The main idea is to build a separate prediction model for each pattern sequence type. PSNN is applicable to multiple related time series. We demonstrate its effectiveness for predicting the solar power output for the next day using Australian data from three data sources - solar power, weather and weather forecast. In our case study, we show three instantiations of PSNN by employing the pattern sequence extraction algorithms PSF, PSF1 and PSF2. The results show that PSNN achieved the most accurate results.

TI Life-time integration using Monte Carlo Methods when optimizing the
   design of concentrated solar power plants
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB Rapidity and accuracy of algorithms evaluating yearly collected energy are an important issue in the context of optimizing concentrated solar power plants (CSP). These last ten years, several research groups have concentrated their efforts on the development of such sophisticated tools: approximations are required to decrease the CPU time, closely checking that the corresponding loss in accuracy remains acceptable. Here we present an alternative approach using the Monte Carlo Methods (MCM). The approximation effort is replaced by an integral formulation work leading to an algorithm providing the exact yearly-integrated solution, with computation requirements similar to that of a single date simulation. The corresponding theoretical framework is fully presented and is then applied to the simulation of PS10. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Photovoltaic power has become one of the most popular energy due to environmental factors. However, solar power generation has brought many challenges for power system operations. To optimize safety and reduce costs of power system operations, an accurate and reliable solar power forecasting model is significance. This study proposes a deep learning method to improve the performance of short-term solar power forecasting, which includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, Kernel Principal Component Analysis, Gated Recurrent Unit Network training mode based on time of the day classification, and post processing with error correction. Both historical solar power, solar irradiance, and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) data, such as temperature, irradiance, rainfall, wind speed, air pressure, humidity, are considered as input dataset in this work. As a case study, the measured solar power data from ten solar sites in Taiwan are forecasted for the next day PV power outputs with one-hour resolution. The error index such as Normalized Root Mean Squared Error (NRMSE), Normalized Mean Absolute Percent Error (NMAPE) are chosen to evaluate the performance of forecasting models. Compared with other benchmark models including ANN, LSTM, XGBoost, and single GRU, the experimental results by the proposed forecasting model show its high performance. Furthermore, the proposed model also demonstrates the importance of data preprocessing and post processing based on error correction.

TI Hybridizing a geothermal power plant with concentrating solar power and
   thermal storage to increase power generation and dispatchability
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB Geothermal power plants often deploy less than their full power capacity due to declining geothermal resources. Integrating heat from a concentrating solar power (CSP) collector field increases the power output at low cost. This article considers five methods of solar heat addition in a double-flash geothermal plant. The most promising solution converts solar heat into electrical work with an efficiency of 24.3%. The economic feasibility and optimal sizing of the solar field and thermal stores are evaluated. A hybrid plant that increases power generation from 22 to 24 MWe has a Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) of 0.07 +/- 0.01 $/kWh(e). Adding three hours of storage increases the LCOE to 0.08 +/- 0.01 $/kWh(e). Photovoltaic systems are considered to be a low-cost renewable technology, but an equivalent photovoltaic system with battery storage costs 0.15 +/- 0.07 $/kWh(e) due to the high cost and replacement rate of batteries compared to thermal storage. The hybrid plant also has a lower LCOE than a conventional CSP plant. If the dispatchability that thermal storage provides is rewarded with higher electricity prices, calculations indicate storage becomes an attractive investment when discharged power receives 1.75 times the typical price of electricity.

AB This paper presents the design of a solar-powered water pumping system that would be used for irrigation in Sukkur, Pakistan. A dependable model of the pumping system as well as the solar system is designed in PVsyst and HOMER softwares to establish the practical and economic viability of solar-powered water pumping system at the site. The proposed system consists of a submersible centrifugal multistage deep well pump and sixty 480 W solar modules. For the purpose of evaluating the backup system's viability, a battery backup system is also connected to the system. The obtained results show that the proposed solar-powered water pumping system is a potential candidate and a viable option for employment at the selected site and at other sites that have the same conditions for water pumping and irrigation. Moreover, when compared to the cost of using nonrenewable resources, operating and maintenance costs for renewable energy systems are more manageable.

AB The extending market of concentrated solar power plants requires high-temperature materials for solar surface receivers that would ideally heat an air coolant beyond 1300 K. This work presents investigation on high-temperature alloys with ceramic coatings (AlN or SiC/AlN stacking) to combine the properties of the substrate (creep resistance, machinability) and coating (slow oxidation kinetics, high solar absorptivity). The first results showed that high-temperature oxidation resistance and optical properties of metallic alloys were improved by the different coatings. However, the fast thermal shocks led to high stress levels not compatible due to the differences in thermal expansion coefficients.

In this article transient heat transfer performance and operational characteristics of sensible TES systems (made of liquid solar salt) and latent TES systems (made of sodium nitrate undergoing liquid-solid phase change), all enclosed in vertical annuli, are numerically simulated. The results show that the latent TES systems can operate with a much higher energy density than the sensible TES systems, and that compact latent TES systems are capable of offering both high energy density and a satisfactory charging/discharging rate.

TI Enhanced thermophysical properties in spinel CuFe2O4-based nanofluids
   for concentrated solar power
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH
AB Concentrating solar power (CSP) technology has been recognized as a technology with high potential to reduce greenhouse gas emission and to transform the electric generation system towards zero emissions. But, the energy conversion between solar to electric energy should be improved, and for this, the use of higher efficient heat transfer fluid (HTF) is one of the main challenges to reach. Then, a promising strategy is the use of nanofluids as HTF in CSP plants. Thus, in this work, CuFe2O4-based nanofluids have been tested in the main properties, such as long-term stability, and rheological and thermal properties. The results showed that the nanofluids reached the physical and chemical stability. Additionally, at 363 K, the relative thermal conductivity of the nanofluids was improved by up to 68.5% in the case of the nanofluid with the highest concentration of both nanoparticles and surfactant. Finally, the efficiency of these nanofluids was analysed considering the possible application in CSP plants. An enhancement of up to 35% in efficiency was found.

AB In the operation and maintenance of concentrating solar power plants, high operational flexibility is required in order to withstand the variability from the inherent solar fluctuations. However, during the development phases of a solar thermal plant, this important objective is overlooked as a relevant factor for cost reduction in the long term. This paper will show the value of including flexibility aspects in the design of a concentrating solar power plant by breaking down their potential favorable impact on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) calculations. For this, three scenarios to include flexibility as a design objective are analyzed and their potential impact on the LCOE is quantified. The scenarios were modeled and analyzed using a techno-economic model of a direct steam generation solar tower power plant. Sensitivity studies were carried out for each scenario, in which the level of improvement due to each scenario was compared to the base case. Then, the results obtained for each scenario were compared for similar levels of LCOE and flexibility improvements. In general, all scenarios were beneficial on power plant performance. Improvements on the LCOE in the range of 3-4% were obtained with different distributions of costs and annual electricity for each case.

TI Design and optimization of CSP power plants for Pakistan: a comparative
   study
SO CLEAN ENERGY
AB The pros and cons of different concentrated solar power technologies at various locations in Pakistan are analysed using the System Advisor Model. Two locations are selected for modelling multiple scenarios of 100-MW plants using central receiver systems, parabolic trough collectors and linear Fresnel reflectors.
   Despite having very high solar irradiance, Pakistan still does not have any installed concentrated solar power (CSP) plant. Several studies have shown that multiple locations within the country are suitable for CSP plants, but there is limited availability of comprehensive comparative studies. Therefore, this article presents a comparative analysis of different CSP technologies in Pakistan, focusing on their potential to address the country's energy crisis. The study evaluates the pros and cons of different CSP technologies at various locations through site assessment, modelling, optimization and economic analysis using the System Advisor Model. Quetta and Nawabshah were selected as the locations for modelling multiple scenarios of 100-MW plants, using central receiver systems, parabolic trough collectors and linear Fresnel reflectors. The plants were integrated with thermal energy storage and the storage capacity was optimized using parametric analysis. The results showed that a central receiver system for the location of Quetta was the most favourable option, with an annual energy yield of 622 GWh at 7.44 cents/kWh, followed by a central receiver system for Nawabshah (608 GWh, 9.03 cents/kWh). This study is the first to show that switching between line-concentrated and point-concentrated CSP technologies can open new opportunities for sites in Pakistan with relatively high solar resources, resulting in a 21.3% reduction in the levelized cost.

TI Entropy generation and Carnot efficiency comparisons of high temperature
   heat transfer fluid candidates for CSP plants
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Heat transfer fluid is a critical component in a concentrating solar power plant. A large quantity of heat transfer fluid is required to transfer heat between the solar collector and the power block, thus it is crucial to select the most appropriate heat transfer fluid in order to maximize the system performance. The present study compared the performances of five molten-salt eutectic mixtures in regarding with the entropy generation rate and the Carnot efficiency of using them as heat transfer fluids. All the five molten-salt eutectic mixtures have thermal stability temperatures above 600 degrees C. Effects of the tube lengths in the steam generation heat exchanger and the receiver heat exchanger as well as the heat transfer fluid flow rate on both the entropy generation rate and the Carnot cycle efficiency were investigated. The results indicate that the carbonate salts has the worst performances compared to the other eutectic mixtures. The three chloride salts have slightly higher entropy generation rate and 5% higher Carnot efficiency than the Solar Salt. Therefore the three chloride salts are suggested to be used in advanced concentrating solar power tower plants as potential high temperature heat transfer fluids.

TI Design of small hand-launched solar-powered UAVs: From concept study to
   amulti-dayworld endurance record flight
SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS
AB We present the development process behind AtlantikSolar, a small 6.9 kg hand-launchable lowaltitude solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that recently completed an 81-hour continuous flight and thereby established a new flight endurance world record for all aircraft below 50 kg mass. The goal of our work is to increase the usability of such solar-powered robotic aircraft bymaximizing their perpetual flight robustness to meteorological deteriorations such as clouds or winds. We present energetic system models and a design methodology, implement them in our publicly available conceptual design framework for perpetual flight-capable solar-powered UAVs, and finally apply the framework to the AtlantikSolar UAV. We present the detailed AtlantikSolar characteristics as a practical design example. Airframe, avionics, hardware, state estimation, and control method development for autonomous flight operations are described. Flight data are used to validate the conceptual design framework. Flight results from the continuous 81-hour and 2,338 km covered ground distance flight show that AtlantikSolar achieves 39% minimum state-ofcharge, 6.8 h excess time and 6.2 h charge margin. These performance metrics are a significant improvement over previous solar-powered UAVs. A performance outlook shows that AtlantikSolar allows perpetual flight in a 6-month window around June 21 at mid-European latitudes, and that multi-day flights with small optical-or infrared-camera payloads are possible for the first time. The demonstrated performance represents the current state-of-the-art in solar-powered low-altitude perpetual flight performance. We conclude with lessons learned from the three-year AtlantikSolar UAV development process and with a sensitivity analysis that identifies the most promising technological areas for future solar-powered UAV performance improvements.

TI Streamlining the Power Generation Profile of Concentrating Solar Power
   Plants
SO JOURNAL OF SOLAR ENERGY ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
AB A scheme to streamline the electric power generation profile of concentrating solar power (CSP) plants of the parabolic trough collector (PTC) type is suggested. The scheme seeks to even out heat transfer rates from the solar field (SF) to the power block (PB) by splitting the typical heat transfer fluid (HTF) loop into two loops using an extra vessel and an extra pump. In the first loop, cold HTF is pumped by the cold pump from the cold vessel to the SF to collect heat before accumulating in the newly introduced hot vessel. In the second loop, hot HTF is pumped by the hot pump from the hot vessel to a heat exchanger train (HXT) to supply the PB with its heat load before accumulating in the cold vessel. The new scheme moderately decouples heat supply from heat sink allowing for more control of heat delivery rates thereby evening out power generation.

AB The integration of thermal energy storage systems in concentrating solar thermal power plants allows power production to be shifted from times where there is low demand to periods where electricity prices are higher. Although increasing the total investment, thermal energy storage can therefore enhance profitability of the solar power plant. The present study presents optimum power plant configurations for a given location considering different price-based grid integration strategies. Such optimum plant configurations were determined using a thermo-economic optimization approach to compare the profitability of generating electricity assuming an instant-dispatch strategy with respect to a selective operating strategy where electricity is produced only during peak price hours of the day. For each of these price-operating strategies, optimum plant configurations were found by varying two solar-related design parameters, namely the solar multiple and the storage size, whilst simultaneously evaluating the economic performance of each design. Results show that for the case of smaller storage units and solar field size a peaking approach will yield more revenues at the end of the project, thus highlighting the importance of the availability of reliable predictable demand and meteorological data for the plant operators. Moreover, results confirm that for the location considered, the best plant configurations encompass large storage units and solar field sizes, for which the gain of a peaking operation strategy becomes negligible since the plants start behaving similar to a baseload power generation station. Finally, it is performed a sensitivity analysis with respect to the available price data and the influence of renewable electricity incentives, particularly the investment tax credit treasury cash grant, showing the positive impact that such measurements could have in augmenting the economic viability of concentrating solar power and thus serve as a driving force for technology deployment.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES
AB In order to solve the problem of insufficient adaptive optimisation ability and insufficient evaluation accuracy when faced with a large number of calculations of existing solar power loss evaluation methods, a power loss evaluation model based on fuzzy information fusion is proposed. Through the comprehensive power quality index parameters, the output characteristic value of the power loss evaluation in solar power generation is obtained, and the power loss fuzzy control is performed. The power loss evaluation relationship in energy generation is extracted, and the power loss quality information fusion in solar energy generation is completed. Combined with the association rule constraint reconstruction, the power loss evaluation model of solar power generation is constructed. The simulation results show that the accuracy of power loss assessment is high, and the degree of information fusion is good, which improves the quality of solar power generation.

SO ENERGIES
AB People are increasingly using clean energy sources, contributing to environmental protection according to the general trend of the world. In the form of renewable energy, solar energy has contributed to solving current pressing problems, such as environmental pollution and air pollution, improving people's quality of life. The design of solar power projects in Vietnam is mainly based on meteorological data sources from Meteonorm and NASA. However, the accuracy assessment of two data sources compared to the actual solar power data in Vietnam is not available, so there is no basis to determine better meteorological data source quality to serve the design of rooftop solar power projects. The content of this paper analyzes the simulation results of a typical rooftop solar power station at the Electric Power University, Hanoi city based on meteorological data sources from Meteonorm and NASA. After that, the simulation results will be compared with the actual operating data of a rooftop solar power station near the Electric Power University and other real PV systems in the world. The study results showed that the amount of electricity production using the Meteonorm meteorological data was closer to the actual data than the NASA data source. Therefore, solar power projects in Vietnam should use Meteonorm data source for the design process to determine the best economic and technical efficiency for investors.

TI Multielectrode array sensors to enable long-duration corrosion
   monitoring and control of concentrating solar power systems
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Molten mixtures of MgCl2-KCl-NaCl are promising heat transfer fluid (HTF) candidates for the next generation of concentrating solar power systems (Gen3 CSP), because of their low cost, high decomposition temperature, and favorable heat transfer characteristics. However, if the chemistry of the salts is not properly controlled, molten chlorides can cause corrosion of high-temperature metal alloys, such as Inconel (R), in CSP systems. Here we demonstrate a corrosion monitoring system that can be used to monitor the health of the structural alloys over long durations. The monitoring system includes a multielectrode array voltammetry sensor that measures the redox potential of molten MgCl2-KCl-NaCl mixture as well as the presence of corrosion products and impurities. The sensors have been successfully operated in static molten salt environments for long durations, and are capable of detecting corrosion products, such as Cr2+ and Fe2+, quantitatively at low concentrations (i.e., approximately 100 ppm) with less than 4% error.

TI Optimal integrated demand response scheduling in regional integrated
   energy system with concentrating solar power
SO APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING
AB The Regional Integrated Energy System Concentrating Solar Power (RIES-CSP) can realize the energy conversion between solar energy, thermal energy and electric energy, which provides an effective way to solve the problem of solar power generation. In this paper, a concentrating solar power station is introduced in the integrated energy system of combined thermal and power supply to assist the system operation, and a typical system structure architecture is constructed by combining energy conversion equipment such as wind power station, energy storage device and electric heater. Moreover, the electricity price and the thermal price are used as signals to guide the system to participate in the Integrated Demand Response program (IDR), and the Demand Response model of electric load and thermal load is established based on the price elasticity matrix. On this basis, considering the uncertainty of renewable energy, ladder carbon emission and the DR benefit, the system operation optimization model is established with the goal of minimizing the operation cost of integrated energy system. The model presented could reduce the cost of system without causing a significant amount of environmental pollutions, and improve the energy efficiency of the system operation efficiently. Finally, a RIES-CSP was used for simulation analysis. The simulation results show that the system participates in the IDR program and exchanges energy with the energy market, which makes the DR effect more obvious, and the total operation cost is 7.85% lower than the traditional operation mode.

Specific parametric coefficients for the Dubinin-Radushkevich structural equation were obtained. The experimental dependence of the daily cycle of solar-powered thermotransformers working with the pair AC-ammonia was presented and proved the positive effect of the work.

Promising materials for the construction of secondary reflectors for a solar furnace were tested, examining endurance at the working power density and verifying if an achievable damage threshold exists. The field test consisted in exposing the samples to sunlight by using a dual-axis solar tracker and a suitable Fresnel lens. The materials were glass mirrors and a multilayer mirror based on an aluminum substrate. The measured quantities were: systematic reflectance control; temperature of the sample back side; concentrated solar power density; exposure time. The samples showed no appreciable decays in reflectance during the whole exposure period.

TI Combining forecasts of day-ahead solar power
SO ENERGY
AB Solar power forecasting is important for the reliable and economic operation of power systems with high penetration of solar energy. The solar power forecasts for the day-ahead time horizon are more erroneous than the hour-ahead time horizon. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) variables such as irradiance, cloud cover, precipitation etc. are used as input to day-ahead forecasting models. The uncertainty in NWP varies with weather conditions. Different forecasting algorithms based on a single method are available in the literature. Combination of individual forecasting algorithms increases the accuracy of the forecasts. However, the combined-forecast has yet not been analysed much in the area of day-ahead solar power forecasting. This paper thus explores different combined-forecast methods such as mean, median, linear regression and non-linear regressions using supervised machine learning algorithms. The number of models required for day-ahead solar power forecasts is studied. One for all hour (same) or separate models for each hour of the day are possible. The effects of retraining frequency on the performance of the forecasting models, which is important for the computational burden of the system, are also studied. Forecasting algorithms are applied to three solar plants in Australia. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Methodology to Assess Potential Glint and Glare Hazards From

SO JOURNAL OF SOLAR ENERGY ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
AB With a growing number of concentrating solar power systems being designed and developed, the potential impact of glint and glare from concentrating solar collectors and receivers is receiving increased attention as a potential hazard or as a distraction for motorists, pilots, and pedestrians. This paper provides analytical methods to evaluate the irradiance originating from specularly and diffusely reflecting sources as a function of distance and characteristics of the source. Sample problems are provided for both specular and diffuse sources, and validation of the models is performed via testing. In addition, a summary of safety metrics is compiled from the literature to evaluate the potential hazards of calculated irradiances from glint and glare for short-term exposures. Previous safety metrics have focused on prevention of permanent eye damage ( e. g., retinal burn). New metrics used in this paper account for temporary after-image, which can occur at irradiance values several orders of magnitude lower than the irradiance values required for irreversible eye damage.

TI Seasonal optimal mix of wind and solar power in a future, highly

SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB The renewable power generation aggregated across Europe exhibits strong seasonal behaviors. Wind power generation is much stronger in winter than in summer. The opposite is true for solar power generation. In a future Europe with a very high share of renewable power generation those two opposite behaviors are able to counterbalance each other to a certain extent to follow the seasonal load curve. The best point of counterbalancing represents the seasonal optimal mix between wind and solar power generation. It leads to a pronounced minimum in required stored energy. For a 100% renewable Europe the seasonal optimal mix becomes 55% wind and 45% solar power generation. For less than 100% renewable scenarios the fraction of wind power generation increases and that of solar power generation decreases. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The success of wireless sensor networks and their pervasive use is constrained by the energy supply which, generally is provided by batteries, a finite resource. Energy harvesting must hence be taken into account to grant a long time operational life, solar energy being the most interesting one in outdoor deployments due to its relatively high power density. Moreover, WSNs are often designed to be deployed in adverse and non-accessible areas without fixed infrastructure. Therefore, the energy conservation and optimum energy management, as well as suitable energy sources play a crucial role for these networks. Solar-power can provide a much needed energy source for WSN, which are remotely deployed and limited by the short battery lifetime. A challenge in solar-powered WSN is that solar power is an un-predictable and fluctuating phenomenon.

TI A brief review of liquid heat transfer materials used in concentrated
   solar power systems and thermal energy storage devices of concentrated
   solar power systems
SO ENGINEERING REPORTS
AB Solar power generation is an effective approach to promote the achievement of carbon neutrality. Heat transfer materials (HTMs) are important for concentrated solar power (CSP) systems and their accessary thermal energy storage (TES) devices. The performances of HTMs can influence the operation behaviors of CSP systems and TES devices. On the whole, the HTMs can be divided into three categories according to their physical states, which are the liquid, gaseous, and solid HTMs, respectively. This article presents a brief review of research works on liquid HTMs used in CSP systems and TES devices of CSP systems, mainly including different kinds of molten salts, heat transfer oils, nanofluids, liquid metals, and water. Some typical practical applications, experimental and simulation studies on different kinds of liquid HTMs used in CSP and TES systems are introduced, and the advantages, disadvantages, and further research and development work prospects of different kinds of HTMs are briefly summarized. This article aims to providing a reference for researchers in solar thermal power field.

AB This paper presents methods for forecasting solar power generation by a solar plant. Solar power generation depends primarily on relative position of sun and some extrinsic as well as intrinsic factors. Extrinsic factors such as cloud cover, temperature, wind speed, rainfall and humidity have been used with intrinsic ones such as degradation of solar panels as inputs for proposed techniques for generation forecasting. The authors have used multiple linear regression, logarithmic regression, polynomial regression and artificial neural network method on the data of past one year (January 2014-December 2014) for creation of forecasting models. These forecasting models are then compared on the basis of their accuracy to forecast the solar generation.

AB Concentrating solar power systems coupled to energy storage schemes, e.g. storage of sensible energy in a heat transfer fluid, are attractive options to reduce the transient effects of clouding on solar power output and to provide power after sunset and before sunrise. Common heat transfer fluids used to capture heat in a solar receiver include steam, oil, molten salt, and air. These high temperature fluids can be stored so that electric power can be produced on demand, limited primarily by the size of the capacity and the energy density of the storage mechanism. Phase changing fluids can increase the amount of stored energy relative to non-phase changing fluids due to the heat of vaporization or the heat of fusion. Reversible chemical reactions can also store heat; an endothermic reaction captures the heat, the chemical products are stored, and an exothermic reaction later releases the heat and returns the chemical compound to its initial state. Ongoing research is investigating the scientific and commercial potential of such reaction cycles with, for example, reduction (endothermic) and re-oxidation (exothermic) of metal oxide particles. This study includes thermodynamic analyses and considerations for component sizing of concentrating solar power towers with redox active metal oxide based thermochemical storage to reach target electrical output capacities of 0.1 MW to 100 MW. System-wide analyses here use one-dimensional energy and mass balances for the solar field, solar receiver reduction reactor, hot reduced particle storage, re-oxidizer reactor, power block, cold particle storage, and other components pertinent to the design. This work is part of a US Department of Energy (DOE) SunShot project entitled High Performance Reduction Oxidation of Metal Oxides for Thermochemical Energy Storage (PROMOTES).

AB The continued extreme use of fossil fuels to meet world energy needs is putting the Earth at risk for significant climate change. In an uncontrolled experiment, the buildup of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is apparently affecting the Earth's climate. The global climate is warming and severe storms such as hurricanes and tornadoes seem to be getting worse. Alternatives to fossil fuels may reduce the addition of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Space Solar Power, from orbiting satellites, provides an option for clean, renewable energy that will reduce the pressure on the Earth's environmental system. Uncertainty in the cost of commercial power from space has been the principal issue inhibiting investment support by the power companies. The Thunderstorm Solar Power Satellite (TSPS) is a concept for interacting with thunderstorms to prevent formation of tornadoes. The TSPS can develop and demonstrate the technology and operations critical to understanding the cost of space solar power. TSPS benefits are saving lives and reducing property. These benefits are not as sensitive to the system economics as the commercial solar power satellite and can be used to justify government investment in space solar power. Consequently, there is no direct competition with fossil fuel based power supplies until SSP technology and operations have been demonstrated. Before weather modification can be safely attempted, the fine structure of thunderstorms must be simulated and related to tornadogenesis.

SO JOURNAL OF THE CHINESE INSTITUTE OF ENGINEERS
AB This paper summarizes the design of a solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Two major achievements, aerodynamic performance design of a solar-powered aircraft and its solar power management system design, are presented. For aerodynamic performance design, the mass of the aircraft is parameterized as a function of two performance parameters: wing reference area and cruise speed. With the parameterization results, a fitness function that links the optimization problem and the genetic algorithm is established. The genetic algorithm searches for the optimal results for minimum energy operation. A solar-powered UAV is then built based on the optimization results. A solar power management system is designed to obtain electric energy from the solar system to support the required power for the aircraft propulsion system and on-board electronic systems. The system includes solar cell panels, maximum power point tracker, and power conversion. An auto-ranging non-inverting synchronous buck-boost dc-to-dc power converter is designed to perform the maximum power point tracking, power conversion, and battery charging functions. The proposed design methodologies for solar-powered UAV and solar power management system are verified through successful ground and flight test. This is the Taiwan's first ever solar-powered UAV.

TI Preliminary design and assessment of concentrated solar power plant
   using supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycles
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB In pursuit of efficient renewable electricity generation at a utility scale, concentrating solar power using receiver tower and heliostat field is one of the most prominent technologies due to its high achievable temperatures and environmental impact reduction. To increase the operating performance of this technology, innovative approaches have been focused on the heliostat field, thermal energy storage, and the integrated power cycle. Brayton cycles using supercritical carbon dioxide have emerged as an alternative to the traditional Rankine cycle for their compactness and superior performance even at extreme climate temperatures. In this work, a suite of code is developed to calculate expressively influencing parameters of the central receiver system, such as the exhaustive design of heliostat field pattern, characteristics angles, optical efficiency, and thermal energy storage, coupled with two Brayton cycle configurations. The seasonal effect on the performance of solar power plants is presented at different climatic conditions in terms of net power generation and cycle efficiency using the daily meteorological data. The year-round performance is assessed by statistically distributing the historical air temperature data into four categories. The proposed systems operate continually for 24 h with heat transfer fluid following a sinusoidal curved movement between the solar receiver and storage tanks. The findings demonstrate that the efficiency of the coupled system is higher with recompression cycle configuration while the fluctuation range is 39% to 45%. The computed mean net power output is 37.17 MW and 39.04 MW using regenerative and recompression cycles, respectively. The developed exhaustive methodology and computed results are of significance for future employment of supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle for concentrated solar power plants.

AB Energy crisis and environmental pollution are becoming increasingly serious. Increasing the penetration rate of renewable energy, in the power system can effectively solve this problem. Wind power and photovoltaic power generation are fluctuating power sources, and their large-scale interconnection will increase the difficulty of grid scheduling. Therefore, based on the regulation characteristics of concentrating solar power station, this paper proposes a green power dispatching strategy far power system with full renewable energy. The purpose of this strategy, is to promote the consumption of renewable energy. The cost of power generation of each unit of the system and the security operation constraints of the grid are considered comprehensively. Finally, CPLEX optimization software was used to solve the model. The results verify the feasibility and validity of the proposed model.

TI Metal hydride based thermal energy storage system requirements for high

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB High temperature concentrating solar power plants require suitable thermal energy storage systems to produce electric power efficiently. Thermochemical energy storage based on metal hydrides represents a very appealing prospect for low cost and high efficient solar storage systems. The objective of the paper is to assess the properties required by the metal hydride systems to achieve the U.S. Department of Energy's SunShot techno-economic targets. A simplified model has been developed to evaluate the cost and the exergetic efficiency of hydride-based storage systems. Results demonstrate that metal hydride materials, operating at temperatures higher than 650 degrees C, with reaction enthalpy on the order of 95-110 kJ/molH(2), raw material cost on the order of 1.4-2 $/kg, weight capacities on the order of 3-4% and operating pressures on the order of tens of bars have the potential to closely approach the targets. Selected sensitivity analyses have also been carried out showing that the raw material cost, the material weight capacity and the metal hydride reaction enthalpy are the properties that strongly affect the performance of the storage system.

AB Heat storage in concentrated solar power plants is required to compensate for variable availability of solar radiation. The energy density achievable with thermochemical heat storage is higher than for molten salt which represents the state of the art technology. The efficiency of different reversible hydrogenation reactions as thermochemical heat storage systems have been examined, since they can be operated at appropriate temperatures. Thermal efficiency of reversible hydrogenation based thermal energy storage can reach values up to 65.9% and an overall efficiency of up to 23.1% compared to 25.7% without heat storage.

This paper studies the design and construction of a small solar-powered aircraft near the size range of current mu UAVs. A number of aspects of their design were analysed, including structural, aerodynamic and propulsion system considerations. The effect of small-scale, low Reynolds number aerodynamics was investigated, and the performance of a range of candidate aerofoils was compared. The integration of a solar power source into the aircraft system was considered a key design issue. Consequently, a number of aircraft configurations were examined, with the intention of optimizing the application of solar power in a miniature aircraft. Investigation of improved system components suggests that a practical solar-powered aircraft in the size range below 500 mm maximum linear dimension should be viable given modest technological improvements.

The finite difference method based on the Cranks-Nicolson scheme was used to realize the model solution. The wind flow equation established a linear relationship between tropospheric height and wind speed, between tropospheric height and the percentage of solar power gain. It is evident that an infinitesimal percentage of solar power gain (approximate to 2.5%) corresponded to 1000 m above ground level; the tropospheric height of 8100 m recorded 23% of solar power gain. Furthermore, wind speeds of 0 to 33 ms-1/distance (1000 m) correspond to ground level and tropospheric height of about 8100 m respectively. However, there is a prospect of achieving more percentage of solar power gain by applying high-altitude platforms. The results obtained apply to other study areas having elevations close to 1100 m, it serves as a guide in the estimation of the percentage of solar power gain by the virtue of tropospheric height and wind speed.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Due to its economical and environmental benefits to society and industry, integrating solar power is continuously growing in many utilities and Independent System Operators (ISOs). However, the intermittent nature of the renewable energy brings new challenges to the system operators. One key to resolve this problem is to have a ubiquitously efficient solar power output forecasting system, so as to help enhance system reliability, improve power quality, achieve better generation scheduling and formulate superior bidding strategies in market. This paper proposes an ensemble learning method to forecast solar power output, combining the state-of-art statistical learning methods. The performance of the model is evaluated through comparing with a benchmark with different metrics, and the numerical results validate the effectiveness of the model.

AB Electrical energy is currently one of the most important needs of the community and as the most important economic resource needed in various activities. The need for electrical energy every year continues to increase. However, the rapid development of electricity consumption is not matched by the growth of power generation. To overcome these problems, alternative energy sources are needed as a substitute for coal. One of the renewable natural resources is solar energy. To harvest this energy, a device called a solar panel or photovoltaic is needed. This study discusses the design of solar power plant in PPPI Al-Ittihad using technical and economic analysis. This solar power generation system is designed to supply electricity needs to help with daily activities. The design of this solar power plant requires 10 solar modules with a capacity of 120 wp, 1 inverter with a capacity of 5 kW, and 4 units of 12 V/200 Ah batteries. The initial investment cost for this solar power generation system is Rp22,398,435. Analysis of the feasibility of investing in a solar power plant system shows a positive Net Present Value (NPV) value of Rp32,208,93095, Internal Rate of Return (IRR) 10.0171% and Profitability Index (PI) 1.001437999. The NPV, IRR, and PI values show positive values, so the investment for this solar power generation system project can be said to be feasible. As for the payback period, it is achieved in the 9th year of the project's operating period.

TI Effects of Particle Size and Concentration of Magnesium Oxide on the
   Lubricating Performance of a Chloride Molten Salt for Concentrating
   Solar Power
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB One engineering challenge for the next-generation concentrating solar power (CSP) is to identify appropriate heat transfer and thermal energy storage media. A chloride salt mixture (20 wt % NaCl + 40 wt % MgCl2 + 40 wt % KCl) in a molten phase is proposed as a potential fluid for carrying the heat as well as lubricating the CSP pump bearings. Due to the hygroscopic nature of MgCl2, the presence of magnesium oxide (MgO) particles is inevitable. In order to understand the impact of MgO particles, this study investigated the tribological behavior of the molten chloride salt mixture containing MgO of various particle sizes and concentrations. Tests were conducted at 750 degrees C in a dry Ar environment using a zirconia ball sliding against a Haynes 244 alloy disc lubricated by the molten salt. There was a clear trend of the increased friction coefficient and wear loss for a larger particle size and/or a higher concentration of MgO. Distinct wear mechanisms were identified for the ceramic ball and alloy disc. Results provide fundamental insights for this new research avenue of molten salt lubrication for CSP.

TI High-performance and low-cost macroporous calcium oxide based materials
   for thermochemical energy storage in concentrated solar power plants
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB High energy density, cycling stability, low cost and scalability are the main features required for thermochemical energy storage systems to achieve a feasible integration in Concentrating Solar Power plants (CSP). While no system has been found to fully satisfy all these requirements, the reversible CaO/CaCO3 carbonation reaction (CaL) is one of the most promising since CaO natural precursors are affordable and earth-abundant. However, CaO particles progressively deactivate due to sintering-induced morphological changes during repeated carbonation and calcinations cycles. In this work, we have prepared acicular calcium and magnesium acetate precursors using a simple, cost-effective and easily scalable technique that requires just the natural minerals and acetic acid, thereby avoiding expensive reactants and environmentally unfriendly solvents. Upon thermal decomposition, these precursors yield a stable porous structure comprised of well dispersed MgO nanoparticles coating the CaO/CaCO3 grains that is resistant to pore-plugging and sintering while at the same time exhibits high long term effective conversion. Process simulations show that the employment of these materials could significantly improve the overall CSP-CaL efficiency at the industrial level.

TI Concentrating solar power plants versus groundwater resources in
   Mediterranean areas of Spain: The environmental dilemma
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Concentrating solar power plants (CSPPs) are considered to be particularly respectful of the environment but under Mediterranean climate where surface water scarcity is a key issue, these types of electrical plants usually require groundwater for their cooling towers and use the same aquifers to discharge their salinized effluents. This study analyses de Spanish case, where fifteen out of the fifty active CSPPs use groundwater directly, four discharge their effluents to infiltration ponds and forty-three to surface watercourses most of which recharge underlying aquifers. The volume of water withdrawn and discharged varies greatly among similar plants. The salinity of the effluent exceeds 2.5 times that of the withdrawn water in half of the plants and it may alter the current or potential use of the water turning it unsuitable for drinking or even for irrigation. There is a risk that the impact on groundwater can be extended to related ecosystems such as wetlands. This can become a serious environmental problem, but specific impacts on groundwater are often overlooked in environmental impact assessments of CSPPs and no research on the matter has been reported so far. Other legal and political implications of CSPPs are further discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Potential and future of concentrating solar power in Namibia
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY IN SOUTHERN AFRICA
AB The Namibian electricity sector has mainly relied on electricity imports from the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP) over the last decade. However, a growth in electricity demand and scarce import options could cause energy shortages. Therefore, new power plants ought to be commissioned in the near future to avoid the forecasted energy crisis. In this context, Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) generation is regarded as an appropriate alternative to conventional energy technologies, particularly for the excellent solar regime available in Namibia. The study presents a GIS analysis that identifies suitable areas for CSP establishment. A broad range of geographical parameters such as solar radiation, topography, hydrology or land use are examined. The calculations show that the CSP ceiling generation in Namibia is equivalent to 70% of the worldwide electricity production. Moreover, the study offers a scenario analysis where concrete CSP alternatives are compared to coal-fired plant projects developed by the national power utility. Meteonorm and System Advisor Model (SAM) are used to design CSP alternatives located in the area offering the best combination between high solar irradiation and short distances to the infrastructures. Despite the affordability concern which has to be addressed with sound financial instruments, CSP represents a seminal opportunity for the energy sector in Namibia.

SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB Although studies on the levelized cost of energy (LCoE) of concentrating solar power (CSP) plants were published in recent years, these studies were not related to the environmental impact generated. To fill this literature gap, this study compares the environmental impacts generated by four tower solar thermal plants with different storage capacities, 3, 6, 9, and 17.5 equivalent hours in nominal conditions were considered, being the plant of 17.5 h, a plant in operation. Results show that the environmental impacts generated throughout its useful life decrease when storage capacity increases. But when the storage capacity goes from 9 h to 17.5 h, the impacts generated are practically the same. Of the four plants analyzed, the most environmentally efficient plant is the one with a storage capacity of 9 h.

SO MATERIALS
AB Seeding nanoparticles in molten salts has been shown recently as a promising way to improve their thermo-physical properties. The prospect of such technology is of interest to both academic and industrial sectors in order to enhance the specific heat capacity of molten salt. The latter is used in concentrated solar power plants as both heat transfer fluid and sensible storage. This work explores the feasibility of producing and dispersing nanoparticles with a novel one pot synthesis method. Using such a method, CuO nanoparticles were produced in situ via the decomposition of copper sulphate pentahydrate in a KNO3-NaNO3 binary salt. Analyses of the results suggested preferential disposition of atoms around produced nanoparticles in the molten salt. Thermal characterization of the produced nano-salt suspension indicated the dependence of the specific heat enhancement on particle morphology and distribution within the salts.

TI Predicting the Long-Term Behavior of a Micro-Solar Power System
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS
AB Micro-solar power system design is challenging because it must address long-term system behavior under highly variable solar energy conditions and consider a large space of design options. Several micro-solar power systems and models have been made, validating particular points in the whole design space. We provide a general architecture of micro-solar power systems-comprising key components and interconnections among the components-and formalize each component in an analytical or empirical model of its behavior. To model the variability of solar energy, we provide three solar radiation models, depending on the degree of information available: an astronomical model for ideal conditions, an obstructed astronomical model for estimating solar radiation under the presence of shadows and obstructions, and a weather-effect model for estimating solar radiation under weather variation. Our solar radiation models are validated with a concrete design, the HydroWatch node, thus achieving small deviation from the long-term measurement. They can be used in combination with other micro-solar system models to improve the utility of the load and estimate the behavior of micro-solar power systems more accurately. Thus, our solar radiation models provide more accurate estimations of solar radiation and close the loop for micro-solar power system modeling.

TI Buck-Boost/Flyback Hybrid Converter for Solar Power System Applications
SO ELECTRONICS
AB This paper proposes a hybrid converter to supply power from solar power source to load. Since power is generated by solar power, which depends on the intensity of solar power, the power generated by the solar power does not keep at a constant power. Therefore, the proposed system needs a battery to balance power between solar power and load. When the proposed one uses the battery to balance powers, the proposed circuit requires a charger and discharger. To simplify the proposed converter, a buck-boost converter and flyback converter can be combined to implement the battery charging and discharging functions. With this approach, the proposed converter can be operated with zero-voltage switching (ZVS) at turn-on transition to reduce switching loss of switch when the proposed one is operated in the discharging mode. In addition, the proposed hybrid converter has several merits, which are less component counts, lighter weight, smaller size and higher conversion efficiency. As compared with the conventional counterparts with hard-switching circuit, the proposed one can increase conversion efficiency of 4% and achieve efficiency of 85% under full load condition when the proposed one is operated in the discharging mode. Experimental results which are obtained from a prototype with output voltage of 10 V and maximum output power 20 W have been implemented to verify its feasibility. It is suitable for an electronic sign indicating LED within 200 W, which is used in the night time.

TI Solar electric propulsion by a solar power sail for small spacecraft
   missions to the outer solar system
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
AB Outer solar system exploration by a small spacecraft using a solar power sail is investigated. A solar power sail is an extended form of a solar sail that has thin-film solar cells attached over its surface. This concept makes it possible to generate a large amount of power with less weight resources than conventional means. Thereby, even a small spacecraft, which has a strong constraint on available resources, can drive high-power ion thrusters to obtain large Delta V. Combining electric propulsion with gravity assists allows the spacecraft to reach the outer solar system using less propellant. The spacecraft can not only survive by means of solar power in the outer solar system, but also drive electric thrusters there to perform challenging missions such as asteroid or comet rendezvous. In this paper, a framework for exploring the outer solar system using a 50-kg-class small spacecraft is presented. The characteristics of solar electric propulsion under the solar power sail model are disclosed, and a design scheme for missions to the outer planets and beyond are addressed. Providing the specific design of the 50-kg-class solar power sail-craft, Centaur rendezvous mission design is performed as a feasibility study.

TI Modelling and analysis of an 80-MW parabolic trough concentrated solar
   power plant in Sudan
SO CLEAN ENERGY
AB Concentrated solar power plants can play a significant role in alleviating Sudan's energy crisis. These plants can be established and implemented in Sudan, as their potential is considerably high due to the climate conditions in Sudan. This study investigates the design of a parabolic trough concentrated solar power plant in Sudan and analyzes its technical and economic feasibility. The simulation of the plant's model used System Advisor Model (SAM) software. To determine the best location for the construction of the plant, data from 15 cities in Sudan were compared with each other based on their solar radiation and land properties. Wadi Halfa, a city in the northern region of Sudan, was chosen as the location due to its good topographical properties and climate conditions. The results show that the proposed plant can generate 281.145 GWh of electricity annually with a capacity factor of 40.1% and an overall efficiency of 15%. Additionally, a simple cost analysis of the plant indicates a levelized cost of electricity of 0.155 $/kWh. As the study results are consistent with the characteristics of similar plants, the proposed plant is considered technically and economically feasible under the conditions at its location.
   This work explores the possible design of a parabolic trough-based solar thermal power plant under the climate conditions of Sudan. The analysis used the System Advisor Model software.

TI On the Multicycle Activity of Natural Limestone/Dolomite for
   Thermochemical Energy Storage of Concentrated Solar Power
SO ENERGY TECHNOLOGY
AB Cheap, efficient, and non-toxic energy storage technologies are urgently needed to handle the rapidly increasing penetration of intermittent renewable energies into the grid. This work explores the use of limestone and dolomite for energy storage in concentrated solar power (CSP) plants by means of the calcium looping (CaL) process based on the multicycle carbonation/calcination of CaO. An efficient integration of the CaL process into CSP plants involves high temperature carbonation and calcination at moderate temperatures in a close CO2 cycle for power generation. These conditions differ from those of the CaL process for CO2 capture, which lead to CaO deactivation as extensively reported in recent years. In contrast, we show that limestone- and dolomite-derived CaO give rise to a high residual conversion at CaL-CSP conditions and in short residence times, which would facilitate the development of a competitive and clean CSP technology with permanent energy storage.

TI Calcium-Looping performance of steel and blast furnace slags for
   thermochemical energy storage in concentrated solar power plants
SO JOURNAL OF CO2 UTILIZATION
AB The Calcium Looping (CaL) process, based on the carbonation/calcination of CaO, has been proposed as a feasible technology for Thermochemical Energy Storage (TCES) in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants. The CaL process usually employs limestone as CaO precursor for its very low cost, non-toxicity, abundance and wide geographical distribution. However, the multicycle activity of limestone derived CaO under relevant CaL conditions for TCES in CSP plants can be severely limited by pore plugging. In this work, the alternative use of calcium-rich steel and blast furnace slags after treatment with acetic acid is investigated. A main observation is that the calcination temperature to regenerate the CaO is significantly reduced as compared to limestone. Furthermore, the multicycle activity of some of the slags tested at relevant CaL conditions for TCES remains high and stable if the treated samples are subjected to filtration. This process serves to remove silica grains, which helps decrease the porosity of the CaO resulting from calcination in the mesoporous range thus mitigating pore plugging.

TI Costs of reducing water use of concentrating solar power to sustainable
   levels: Scenarios for North Africa
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB Concentrating solar power (CSP) has the potential to become a leading sustainable energy technology for the European electricity system. In order to reach a substantial share in the energy mix, European investment in CSP appears most profitable in North Africa, where solar potential is significantly higher than in southern Europe. As well as sufficient solar irradiance, however, the majority of today's CSP plants also require a considerable amount of water, primarily for cooling purposes. In this paper we examine water usage associated with CSP in North Africa, and the cost penalties associated with technologies that could reduce those needs. We inspect four representative sites to compare the ecological and economical drawbacks from conventional and alternative cooling systems, depending on the local environment, and including an outlook with climate change to the mid-century. Scaling our results up to a regional level indicates that the use of wet cooling technologies would likely be unsustainable. Dry cooling systems, as well as sourcing of alternative water supplies, would allow for sustainable operation. Their cost penalty would be minor compared to the variance in CSP costs due to different average solar irradiance values. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Fuzzy predictive control of a solar power plant
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS
AB This paper presents the application of fuzzy predictive control to a solar power plant. The proposed predictive controller uses fuzzy characterization of goals and constraints, based on the fuzzy optimization framework for multi-objective satisfaction problems. This approach enhances model based predictive control (MBPC) allowing the specification of more complex requirements. A brief description of the solar power plant and its simulator is given. Basic concepts of predictive control and fuzzy predictive control are introduced. Two fuzzy predictive controllers using different membership functions are designed for a solar power plant, and they are compared with a classical predictive controller. The simulation results show that the fuzzy MBPC formulation, based on a well proven successful algorithm, gives a greater flexibility to characterize the goals and constraints than classical control.

TI Exploring Key Weather Factors From Analytical Modeling Toward Improved
   Solar Power Forecasting
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID
AB Accurate solar power forecasting plays a critical role in ensuring the reliable and economic operation of power grids. Most of existing literature directly uses available weather conditions as input features, which might ignore some key weather factors and the coupling among weather conditions. Therefore, a novel solar power forecasting approach is proposed in this paper by exploring key weather factors from photovoltaic (PV) analytical modeling. The proposed approach is composed of three engines: 1) analytical modeling of PV systems; 2) machine learning methods for mapping weather features with solar power; and 3) a deviation analysis for solar power forecast adjustment. In contrast to the existing research that directly uses available weather conditions, this paper explores the physical knowledge from PV models. Different irradiance components and PV cell temperatures are derived from PV analytical modeling. These weather features are used to reformulate the input of machine learning methods, which helps achieve a better forecasting performance. Moreover, based on the historical forecasting deviations, a compensation term is presented to adjust the solar power forecast. Case studies based on measured datasets from PV systems in Australia demonstrate that the forecasting performance can be highly improved by taking advantage of the key weather features derived from PV models.

TI Design and Analysis of a Solar-Power Mini-UAV for Extended Endurance at
   Low Altitude
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AERONAUTICAL AND SPACE SCIENCES
AB A solar-powered mini-UAV has been designed for long-endurance performance at low altitude, reflecting practical constraints from preceding experience of authors. The parametric analysis of the solar-power propulsion system is the primary interest of the present study, along with the power requirement estimation of the aircraft design. To cope with the wide range of flight speed, low-Reynolds number airfoils are selected, which possesses low drag characteristics at wide range of angle of attack. Aerodynamic design studies point out that maintaining Reynolds number above 100,000 is a requisite for extended flight operations of the solar-powered mini-UAV. The itemized drag prediction of the UAV design is performed based on the Xflr5 analysis of the UAV configuration. The solar modules and battery systems of the UAV design are represented as equivalent electric models, for the performance simulation of the solar-power propulsion system. Rigorous analyses on the seasonal solar radiation indicate that the capacity of the battery pack should be increased over 50% of the current design to provide continuous operation of the mini-UAV up to 60days.

Solar desalination is defined as a plant that obtains solar energy from a closed system. This is done to focus the investigation on desalination technologies, rather than the efficacy of replacing conventional energy sources with renewables in an integrated electricity grid. The results suggest that current options for solar-powered desalination are not cost-competitive compared to incumbent technologies in Saudi Arabia. The article offers insight into where costs must decrease before solar technologies are economically competitive in the country.

TI A control based on a knapsack problem for solar hydrogen production
SO OPTIMAL CONTROL APPLICATIONS & METHODS
AB The Hydrosol pilot plant was installed in the small solar power systems solar tower at CIEMAT-Plataforma Solar de Almeria (PSA), Spain, for producing solar hydrogen from water using a ferrite-based redox technology. It consists of two reactors where hydrogen and oxygen production cycles are alternated for quasi-continuous hydrogen production. In the first step (water splitting), an exothermic reaction takes place at an operating temperature of 800?. The second step (thermal reduction) is an endothermic reaction, which requires an operating temperature of 1200?. Recently, an adaptive control strategy for controlling these operating temperatures in the solar hydrogen reactor has been proposed and implemented, using the number of heliostats focused as the control signal. The algorithm chooses which heliostats have to be focused estimating the concentrated solar power contribution of each heliostat. Then, the heliostats are focused, starting from those which provide lower power. This paper is based on this control strategy, but considering a new algorithm to choose the heliostats. Using the concentrated solar power contributions, a knapsack problem is defined to obtain a local optimal solution, which provides a set of heliostats that minimizes the error between the setpoint and the reactor concentrated solar power. In order to evaluate the performance of this method, simulation and experimental results are shown and discussed. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In this paper, the performance of a photovoltaic system equipped with solar power optimizers, as one of the distributed generation units of a test microgrid has been investigated. The power sharing in the test DC microgrid is controlled through droop method. Since droop method leads to output voltage deviations in distributed generation units, there is a possibility that this voltage deviation eclipses the operation of solar power optimizers. To address this point of uncertainty, a simulated DC microgrid has been tested in MATLAB/Simulink environment, which confirms that solar power optimizers continue to operate properly.

TI Economic feasibility of solar-powered led roadway lighting
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
CT World Renewable Energy Conference 2007
CY OCT 29-NOV 01, 2007
CL Taipei, TAIWAN
AB The optical efficacy of light emitting diode (LED) has exceeded 72 lm/W in 2006. This implies that energy can be saved about 75%, as compared to mercury lamps widely used in roadway lighting. In some remote areas where the grid power cannot reach, independent solar-powered lighting using high-power LED provides a promising solution. However, the cost of solar photovoltaic device may cause the application of solar-powered LED roadway lighting to be not economically feasible.
   The present study investigates the design of the solar-powered LED roadway lighting using high-power LED luminaire (100 W) and estimates the installation cost for a 10 km highway with 2 lanes. LED luminaries are installed on both side of the road with staggered arrangement. The pole distance is 30 m. The cost comparison of LED lighting using grid and solar power with the conventional mercury lamps was carried out. It shows that the installation cost is 22 million USD for LED powered by grid power and 26 million USD for solar-powered. The total installation cost of conventional mercury lighting is 18 million USD. The excess cost of LED mainly comes from the cost of LED lamp and solar PV. But, the cost of power generation and electrical transmission line can be greatly reduced since about 75% energy was saved for LED. This permits the use of smaller copper wire and shorter line length for solar-powered system which in turn saves installation cost. The payback time for the excess investment of LED is 2.2 years for LED using grid power and 3.3 years for LED using solar power. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO ENERGIES
AB Insular power systems are a special case of infrastructure for power production due to their particular land morphology with extensive hills and ridges. For a higher renewable energy share in the power production, a dedicated design according to local constraints is required. The high wind and solar resources of such cases can be utilized with offshore wind turbines and concentrating solar power, respectively. In addition, pumped-hydro storage is a mature and suitable technology for such terrain. A case study is presented in the island of Rhodes to obtain a renewable energy penetration higher than 70%. The technical and financial requirements for this implementation support the design of this system, while the introduction of concentrating solar power enables significant energy savings during the periods of peak demand of the island. An annual RES penetration close to 80% can be achieved with the combined operation of both plants. The economic viability of the required investment can be ensured with selling prices of the produced electricity in the range of 0.20 EUR/kWh.

AB The present paper compares the performance of different Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants. The first plant configuration is a regenerative Steam Rankine Cycle (SRC) rated 50 MW, with 8-hour full-load Thermal Energy Storage (TES) system. The alternative solution is an Integrated Solar Combined Cycle (ISCC), where the steam generated by the solar section is joined to the one produced in the Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) and is expanded in the steam turbine, producing 20 MW of extra power. As far as the solar field is concerned, for each plant configuration two different technologies are considered: Parabolic Trough Collectors (PTC) and Central Receiver System (CRS), using respectively thermal oil and molten salt mixture as heat transfer fluid (HTF).
   Commercial software and in-house computer codes are combined together to predict the CSP plant performance both on design and off-design conditions. Plants are supposed to be located in the Riyadh region (KSA). Results of yearly simulations on hourly basis are presented and discussed. Main outputs such as gross electricity production and cycle efficiency are reported. The goal of the paper is to evaluate the power production and the efficiency for the considered CSP technologies in real operating conditions.

AB Unmanned solar powered aircraft offer a unique set of advanced capabilities and have set general aviation records for longest continuous flight and greatest sustained altitude. However, the application of solar powered flight to small scale solar powered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has seen sparse research activity and is only partially explored. The use of solar power as an energy resource allows small scale UAVs to carry heavier, more powerful sensor payloads, and can extend flight times to over 24 hours, thereby achieving multi-day flight. This work focuses on recent developments by the Center for Distributed Robotics on a four meter wingspan solar UAV designed for low altitude aerial sensing applications. Highlighted in this paper are aspects of airframe, propulsion, and electronics hardware design as well as experiments that quantify the solar power system and airframe performance.

AB Thermal storage in Concentrating Solar Power plants (CSP) and battery storage are still relatively expensive options to support renewable energy generation, but may offer significant flexibility benefits. This paper discusses a new formulation for embedding all three typical sub-components of a CSP plant (namely, solar field, storage, and power block in a solar tower configuration) in a long-term expansion planning model so that these are co-optimized. The proposed formulation can be accommodated in standard linear/mixed-integer linear programming (LP/MIP) models. A set of two illustrative case studies is used to demonstrate how selection of CSP capacity may be optimized using the proposed formulation, and how it may be influenced by factors such as: its ability to provide spinning reserve, presence of competing options such as a combination of PV and battery storage, and policy targets on renewables.

TI Natural Magnetite for thermal energy storage: Excellent thermophysical
   properties, reversible latent heat transition and controlled thermal
   conductivity
SO SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS
AB Thermal energy storage (TES) has gained growing interest in the area of renewable energy due to its great potential for increasing the efficiency of concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. One of the central issues is the development of a working body with desirable properties, namely, thermal conductivity; heat capacity; density; price; availability; and eco-friendliness. This study reports the thermophysical characterization and proposes a reliable and industrial appropriate treatment route for natural Magnetite to obtain a material possessing not only a combination of the above properties, but also the possibility of easy control (programming) of thermal conductivity in a wide range of values. The combination of such properties is exceptional and crucially advantageous for TES applications like packed-bed heat storage systems.

AB This paper analyzed the changes of operation characteristics and peak regulation capability about cogeneration unit before and after heating by concentrating solar power(CSP). Discussed the operation mechanism of wind power accommodation by CSP based on cogeneration operation mode. The optimization model of peak shaving is established, which include CSP, wind power, condensing unit and cogeneration unit. Compared with the traditional model, the new model increased the thermal balance constraints of the system, thermoelectric coupling constraints of cogeneration unit, and the operation constraints of CSP. Case study verifies that the proposed model is valid. The CSP plant based on cogeneration operation mode can effectively improve the wind power accommodation level of power grid and avoid the condensing unit frequently adjust its power, which greatly improved the economy of the system.

TI The value of dispatchability of CSP plants in the electricity systems of
   Morocco and Algeria
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB This paper examines the effects of an increased integration of concentrated solar power (CSP) into the conventional electricity systems of Morocco and Algeria. A cost-minimizing linear optimization tool was used to calculate the best CSP plant configuration for Morocco's coal-dominated power system as well as for Algeria, where flexible gas-fired power plants prevail. The results demonstrate that in both North African countries, storage-based CSP plants offer significant economic advantages over non-storage, low-dispatchable CSP configurations. However, in a generalized renewable integration scenario, where CSP has to compete with other renewable generation technologies, like wind or photovoltaic (PV) power, it was found that the cost advantages of dispatchability only justify CSP investments when a relatively high renewable penetration is targeted in the electricity mix.

TI Effect of Steam Injection during Carbonation on the Multicyclic
   Performance of Limestone (CaCO3) under Different Calcium Looping
   Conditions: A Comparative Study
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB This study explores the effect of steam addition during carbonation on the multicyclic performance of limestone under calcium looping conditions compatible with (i) CO2 capture from postcombustion gases (CCS) and with (ii) thermochemical energy storage (TCES). Steam injection has been proposed to improve the CO2 uptake capacity of CaO-based sorbents when the calcination and carbonation loops are carried out in CCS conditions: at moderate carbonation temperatures (similar to 650 degrees C) under low CO2 concentration (typically 15% at atmospheric pressure). However, the recent proposal of calcium-looping as a TCES system for integration into concentrated solar power (CSP) plants has aroused interest in higher carbonation temperatures (similar to 800-850 degrees C) in pure CO2. Here, we show that steam benefits the multicyclic behavior in the milder conditions required for CCS. However, at the more aggressive conditions required in TCES, steam essentially has a neutral net effect as the CO2 uptake promoted by the reduced CO2 partial pressure but also is offset by the substantial steam-promoted mineralization in the high temperature range. Finally, we also demonstrate that the carbonation rate depends exclusively on the partial pressure of CO2, regardless of the diluting gas employed.

TI Probabilistic clearing of the reactive power market in the presence of

SO ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH
AB With the advent of renewable energy plants, new sources have been created to provide reactive power. This paper first explores the importance of renewable energy sources growth, especially solar power plants, then it examined the participation of solar power plants in the reactive power market. Various cost components of the solar power plant have been investigated and a general cost function model has been proposed for all reactive power suppliers that help the independent system operator (ISO) to better manage the system. Considering the probabilistic nature of energy generation from solar power plants, solar irradiance variations are considered in the reactive market and a probabilistic structure is proposed. To simulate and to consider the probabilistic nature of solar irradiance, the Monte Carlo method is used in simulations. The proposed method has been tested on the IEEE 24 buses system and two definitive and probabilistic markets are compared. As stated in the results, the proposed algorithm has satisfactory results.

TI Assessment of thermal energy storage options in a sodium-based CSP plant
SO APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING
AB Sodium has proven to be an efficient heat transport fluid in a central receiver system in the IEA-SSPS facility in Almeria in the 1980s with a 5 MWh(th) direct two tank storage system. In recent years the interest in liquid metals, particularly sodium, as heat transfer fluids for concentrating solar power has reawakened. However, an assessment of thermal energy storage options in a liquid metal-based concentrating solar power system has not been performed yet. In this paper sensible, latent and thermochemical systems, described in the literature and potentially suitable for a solar power plant using sodium, are investigated. As sensible systems, direct sodium two tank and one tank thermocline storage systems with filler are considered, as well as indirect molten salt systems. Latent systems include configurations with finned tubes, packed beds of phase change material capsules and active screw type systems. In addition, metal hydride dehydrogenation, ammonia dissociation and hydroxide dehydration are considered as thermochemical storage systems. The presented storage systems are discussed and compared on the basis of the following criteria: Storage medium cost, storage density, cycling behaviour, maturity level and suitability for sodium as heat transfer fluid. As a result, the direct sodium thermocline one tank storage with filler material represents a promising direct storage option. It could be further enhanced by a cascaded arrangement of phase change capsules. Moreover, the thermochemical storage systems based on ammonia dissociation or hydroxide dehydration are identified as best indirect storage options. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A growing interest in the commercial development of space and a recognized need for noncarbon energy sources are spurring a reexamination of the prospects for generating large amounts of electricity from space-based solar power systems. Technological advances over the past 20 years are casting a more favorable light on the technical and economic feasibility of large-scale space solar power, and continued progress is anticipated. But keeping the effort moving forward for the next several decades will require international public-private cooperation and investment by both the government and commercial sectors. Scientists and engineers have identified a variety of potential applications for solar power in space that could become interim markets for developing and deploying the technology on the way toward an ultimate realization of beaming solar electricity to Earth.

To date, reliable tools for forecasting the generation of solar power stations are required. This paper considers the methodology of operational forecasting of solar power stations output based on the mathematical apparatus of cubic exponential smoothing with trend and seasonal components. The presented methodology was tested based on the measuring data of a real solar power station. The average forecast error was not more than 10% for days with variable clouds and not more than 3% for clear days, which indicates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Variable renewable energy integration poses a challenge to the secure operation of the power system, especially for frequency security. How to provide frequency response to maintain satisfactory frequency performance is still an open question. Concentrating solar power, with renewable energy characteristics and synchronous units, is a potential solution to the frequency response problem. This paper discusses how concentrating solar power plants can be employed to ensure frequency security and proposes its dynamic frequency control strategy accordingly. The proposed strategy is contained in a novel unit commitment model with a primary frequency response and a secondary frequency response to co-optimize the energy reserve. The validity of the unit commitment model and proposed control strategy is verified by two case studies including a modified 6-bus and RTS-79 system.

TI Study on Performance of Rooftop Solar Power Generation Combined with
   Battery Storage at Office Building in Northeast Region, Vietnam
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB At present, renewable energy sources are considered to ensure energy security and combat climate change. Vietnam has a high potential for solar power development, especially in the central region and the southern region. However, the northeast region has the lowest solar radiation value, so it can cause difficulty for rooftop solar power investment. In this paper, the study results analyze the financial efficiency of the grid-tied rooftop solar power system with battery storage and compared it to the grid-tied rooftop solar power system without battery storage. The experimental data of a grid-tied solar power system with battery storage at an office building in the northeast region of Vietnam is collected to evaluate the system's operation performance in real conditions. The study results present that the financial efficiency of rooftop grid-tied power project with and without storage is viable since the benefit-cost ratio (B-C) is larger than one, and internal rate of return (IRR) and net present value (NPV) are positive. However, the grid-tied rooftop solar power system with storage is not quite feasible in case of changing the electricity selling price and investment cost even though the grid-tied solar power system using the storage device can operate more flexibly. The payback period of the grid-tied solar power system with storage is 6.2 years longer and the total profit is nearly 1.9 times lower than the solar power system without battery storage due to the difference in the price of the inverters and the battery. In contrast, the grid-tied solar power system without battery storage shows better financial efficiency but strongly depends on the operation of the utility grid.

Energetic and economic analyses are carried out for a particular type of CSP plants and the investigation is concentrated on a 50MW(e) parabolic-trough plant. Taking into consideration the Libyan territory, the Tripoli region is selected as the specific location of the CSP plant based on its high solar irradiation, consumer proximity and density, and condenser cooling water availability. In the Tripoli region prevails a large-scale Mediterranean climate, where the average annual levels of irradiation are very favorable to practical applications. In addition, the maximum and minimum annual solar days at noon hour for the CSP plant location, as indicated by the present study, are very appealing. Moreover, the annual analysis on an hourly basis also indicates very good potential. The paper presents a brief review of the current cost of energy and the potential for reducing the cost of energy from parabolic trough solar power plant technology. The main technological finding of the present study for the CSP selected is its higher perfoimance and lower levelized cost of electricity (LCE) as compared to a similar plant in Southern Europe.

AB Concentrating solar power (CSP) plants with thermal energy storage (TES) are emerging renewable technologies with the advantage that TES decreases the uncertainty in the generation of CSP plants. This study introduces a stochastic mixed integer linear programming model, where the objective function is the maximization of the expected profit that can be obtained by selling the energy generated by the CSP plant in the day-ahead electricity market. The proposed model considers three main blocks of constraints, namely, renewable generator constraints, TES constraints, and electricity market constraints. The last category of constraints considers the penalties incurred due to positive or negative imbalances in the balancing market. A case study using data from the Spanish electricity market is introduced, described and analyzed in terms of trading of the CSP plant generation. The conclusions highlight the influence of TES capacity on the energy trading profile, the expected profits and the volatility (risk) in the trading decisions.

SO ENERGY TECHNOLOGY
AB A near-perfect black solar absorber made of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) prepared by a low-cost wet-deposition method on a reflective metal surface for mid-temperature non-evacuated concentrated solar power (CSP) applications is demonstrated. The dispersed CNTs in an alumina-silica matrix exhibit an absorptance of 0.985 in the entire solar spectrum and emittance of 0.90 in the infrared (IR) region. The coating shows high durability and is super-hydrophilic (0 degrees contact angle) after plasma treatment, without affecting the solar absorptance and excellent coating adhesion. The efficiency of the coating is evaluated by analytical models, which implies that it has higher efficiency at low temperature and at a high solar concentration ratio than that of previously reported selective coatings.

AB Parabolic Dish (PD) is one of Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) technologies that convert sunlight to electricity. PD has shown the highest efficiency by converting nearly 31.25% of solar radiation into electricity and PD has emerged as one of reliable and efficient Renewable Energy (RE) technology. However, the evaluation for the PD system performance by using experimental approach is costly and time consuming. Therefore, a model has become necessary to predict the system performance under several of operating conditions. Nevertheless, current literature on PD modelling is scattered, focusing on individual components and rarely organised in one cohesive report. This paper is to study on the impact of the Direct Solar Irradiance (DNI), collector and receiver to the value of heat transfer to the receiver; solar power intercept by a receiver as well as the receiver loses in 25kW PD system. This study is using a simulation approach and Matlab Simulink was used as the simulation tool. The irradiation data were downloaded from the Meteonorm 7 Software and George Town, Penang in Malaysia has been selected as the location for simulation. Meanwhile, the aluminium and silver was used as the reflective material and the intercepted factor used for the simulation is in the range of 0.9 to 1.0. As a conclussion, the simulation result has shown that variations of the solar irradiation on the site, reflective material and the intercept factors influence the value of the value of the rate of heat transfer to the receiver; solar power intercept by a receiver as well as the receiver loses.

TI Critical Factors Affecting Rooftop Solar System Investment: An Empirical
   Study in Vietnam
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB The economic development of most countries in the world has negatively impacted fossil energy resources. Fossil energy sources such as petroleum and coal are increasingly depleted. When energy sources are exhausted, renewable energy sources are growing strongly. Renewable energy development can help to replace diminishing fossil fuels. Furthermore, the usage of renewable energy can contribute to a green economy and sustainable development by protecting the environment. Solar power on the roof is one of the many renewable energy sources available. But at present, the investment in roof voltage systems has not developed strongly in Vietnam. This paper uses the SEM model to evaluate the factors affecting investment in rooftop solar power in some provinces of Vietnam. The article uses the household interview method. The article has given 8 factors affecting the decision to invest in rooftop solar power for households. Research results show that most of the factor variables have a positive impact on the decision to invest in rooftop solar power. Based on assessing the factors affecting the decision to invest in rooftop solar power, the article will provide conclusions and policy suggestions to increase investment in rooftop solar power in Vietnam.

AB Due to the high amount of installed solar power systems in Germany, the low-voltage distribution grids reach their maximum capacities in periods of high insolation. In order to ensure a proper integration of today's and especially the prospective solar energy, grid reinforcement is a common method to increase the transmission capacity. As an alternative to this costly and intricate approach, local battery storage systems can be used to store the surplus generation and limit the feed-in power of the solar power systems. In this paper, two different operational strategies for battery storage systems together with solar power systems for self-consumption are presented and evaluated. Results show that the feed-in power can be distinctly reduced without generating significant losses for the system-owner. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The recent historic drop in photovoltaic panel prices has encouraged the opinion that CSP, with its higher levelized cost of energy, has poor prospects outside of niche deployments. We review evidence for the contrary view, supported by the International Energy Agency and others, that CSP's market prospects are in fact bright.

AB Concentrating solar power (CSP) is an emerging renewable generation technology and attracts widespread attention. Besides generating electricity only, CSP can be easily reformed to be a solar combined heat and power (SCHP) plant through extracting part of intermediate solar thermal energy to serve heat demand. Thus, SCHP can be modeled as an energy hub to realize the coordination of electric system and heat system, which is regarded as the multi-energy integration value (MEI value) of SCHP. In this paper, we describe the configuration of the SCHP plant and analyze its operation flexibility on the integration of electricity and heat power generation. A SCHP dispatch model is proposed to quantify the MEI value. The results of case study indicate the remarkable benefit of SCHP through multi-energy integration, compared with CSP.

TI Exergy Analysis of Concentrated Solar Power Plants with Thermochemical
   Energy Storage Based on Calcium Looping
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB It is important and urgent to overcome the intermittent nature of solar energy as a green substitute for fossil-based electricity. Concentrated solar power plants with thermochemical energy storage are considered as a potential option for cost-effective electricity generation and dispatchability. This study aims to propose a novel concentrated solar power plant that uses thermochemical energy storage based on calcium looping with a flexible operation sequence to eliminate the dependence of power generation on the carbonation reaction under sunshine. The flexible operation involves two successive phases: energy charging in the sunshine mode and discharging in the night mode. A comprehensive exergy analysis was used to characterize the system performance based on its storage and power efficiencies. The results, which demonstrated a global storage exergy efficiency of more than 37% and a global power efficiency of around 48%, are comparable to those of the state-of-the-art systems. Moreover, it was also observed that the highest exergy loss is caused by the compressor and cooling process under the sunshine and night modes, respectively. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the thermodynamic laws of our system. The results indicated a technical contradiction between the storage and power efficiencies (net power) under sunshine mode, while no such contradiction was observed under night mode. Overall, the main contribution of this study is the design of a novel system with competitive performance, which is expected to serve as a useful guideline for the future development of efficient and flexible concentrated solar power plants.

SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB Using additive manufacturing techniques, a ceramic heat exchanger was optimized for a concentrating solar power (CSP) electric power plant with a corrosive molten salt at atmospheric pressure as the solar field heat transfer fluid and supercritical carbon dioxide at 200 bar as the power block fluid. Temperatures ranged from 750 degrees C to 540 degrees C. The plant heat exchanger was optimized for heat transfer and stress using 1 m(3) modules arranged in parallel. Heat transfer was optimized using COMSOL Multiphysics software resulting in a unique semi-elliptical cross section for the fluid flow channels in a counter-flow configuration. Counter-flow was made possible through additive manufacturing of the fluid headers as part of each modular heat exchanger thus producing the entire module as a single piece and minimizing cost. Using reasonable parametric values, a heat exchanger module was optimized to 0.5 MW/m(3), and a section of it was manufactured including the fluid headers. Parametric studies showed the potential for a module to reach 3.5 MW/m(3). (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Spectrally selective coatings (SSCs) are a critical component that enables high-temperature and high-efficiency operation of concentrating solar power (CSP) systems. In this Letter, we describe a novel design for a high-performance SSC based on multi-scaled nanostructures. Optimal design of the new structure for high optical performance of the SSC is predicted by the effective medium theory. To demonstrate the feasibility of the design, we fabricate the SSCs using fractal nanostructures with characteristic sizes ranging from similar to 10 nm to similar to 10 mu m. Optical measurements on these structures show unprecedentedly high performance with similar to 90-95% solar absorptivity and <30% infrared emissivity near the peak of 500 degrees C black body radiation. The newly developed concept of SSC could be utilized to design solar absorbers with high thermal efficiency for future high temperature CSP systems. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Floating solar power has a higher power generation efficiency than existing solar power generation methods. It is easier to secure in an installation area as well as to connect to other renewable energy sources. Floating solar power is considered an essential component for achieving carbon neutrality because it compensates for the shortcomings of existing solar power systems and maximizes their advantages. In this study, a performance comparison was conducted between pivotless tracking-type and fixed-type solar power systems. These systems were installed at the Irwol Reservoir in Suwon, South Korea, and monitored for comparison between May 2019 and June 2020. The tracking-type system generated approximately 14% more energy than the fixed-type system; the performance was maximized in May, which showed 25.63% more output power, and the performance was minimized in winter, with 3% more generated power. Owing to its pivotless structure, this system can be used in the solar industry.

SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Concentrating solar power plant will be a key component of the future energy systems in which the share of renewable energy is extremely high. A major challenge of this technology is, however, its intermittent power output, slowing down its rate of implementation in the global energy matrix. As such, waste incineration is a popular technology in the developed countries as a smart measure for the disposal of municipal waste and generating free energy. In this study, a hybrid configuration of a concentrating solar power plant accompanied with a waste incineration unit is proposed. In the proposed system, the waste incinerator offers a variable heating duty in order to regulate the power output of the concentrating solar power plant. The hybrid plant is designed for a case study in Denmark and is thermodynamically analyzed. The results of the simulations are presented and discussed. It is shown that the hybrid system can pave the bed for increasing the share of solar thermal power and bringing more waste incinerators to the electricity market. A 10 MWe hybrid power plant may prevent up to 8000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emission per month. The overall efficiency of the hybrid system is expected to be 24%. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Determining the Cost Benefit of High-Temperature Coatings for
   Concentrating Solar Power Thermal Storage Using Probabilistic Cost
   Analysis
SO JOURNAL OF SOLAR ENERGY ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
AB Probabilistic cost analysis determined the cost benefit for applying a protective coating to the wetted surfaces of stainless steel tank walls for concentrating solar power (CSP) thermal storage applications. The model estimated the total material cost of coated 347 or 310 stainless steel (347/310) and the cost of uncoated Inconel 625, which served as the reference tank wall cost. Model results showed that the cost of the coated 347/310 stainless steel was always statistically less than the cost of the bare Inconel 625 when these materials are used for tank walls at representative tank diameters and temperatures for CSP storage applications.

TI Economic assessment of concentrated solar power technologies: A review
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB This paper surveys economic assessments of concentrated solar power (CSP) technologies and finds two dominant assessment methods. A majority of studies reported in the literature are based on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), while a small subset of studies consider time-varying meteorological and electricity market conditions. Several studies argue that LCOE undervalues dynamic flexibility provided by thermal energy storage and does not consider revenue opportunities provided by electricity markets at different time scales. As a result, some studies find that both LCOE and revenue can in fact be conflicting metrics for certain designs and market conditions. This review finds strong variations in LCOE and revenue estimates in the literature. As comparisons between CSP and other generation technologies (e.g., fossil, wind, and photovoltaic) are dictated by the chosen economic metric, it is imperative that policy and investment decisions should carefully consider time-varying effects and flexibility. Finally, research directions are proposed to increasing the fidelity of economic assessments and to mitigate discrepancies.

AB Solar-powered embedded systems are challenged by variations and uncertainties in energy availability due to seasonal changes and weather conditions. Such systems need to deploy various schemes to adapt their energy consumption in order to achieve energy sustainability. We target solar-powered real-time systems with adaptive QoS model. A holistic middleware framework for energy management that orchestrates DVFS and application QoS in solar-powered real-time systems is proposed. Extensive experiments are carried out to show the effectiveness and the robustness of our technique on two case studies on a solar-powered smart camera system. Simulation results show an improvement of 19%-50% in terms of total QoS compared to a DVFS framework with fixed QoS model for real time embedded systems.

TI Techno-Economic Assessment of Concentrating Solar Power and Wind
   Hybridization in Jordan
SO JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB The variable renewable wind and solar resources have experienced a significant growth on its rate of deployment as a clean and competitive alternative for conventional power sources in Jordan. However, the variability of these sources have brought many technical challenges to grids. This paper presents a hybrid system that provides a firma capacity and improves dispatchability with an interesting financial perspective. This hybrid system includes a wind farm and a concentrated solar power plant with thermal energy storage. The performance analysis was conducted in terms of final yield and capacity factor, while the economic analysis investigated the levelized cost of electricity LCOE. The hybrid plant was simulated and optimized using TRNSYS 17 energy simulation software, minimizing the LCOE and considering a capacity factor higher than 65% as a constraint. Solar multiple and storage size were considered as decision variables. A strong complementarity between wind and direct normal solar radiation was observed in the selected location in Jordan, which emphasizes the attractiveness of the selected hybrid system. The optimal configuration of the CSP-wind hybrid system was obtained with a solar field of a 2.6 solar multiple and a 5 hours energy storage. The achieved capacity factor was 94 %, and the LCOE is lower than those resulted for standalone CSP plants.

TI Nanosilica to improve the flowability of fine limestone powders in
   thermochemical storage units
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Fine powders are the cornerstone of new energy storage solutions to assist concentrated solar power plants. Though, their ability to behave like fluid can be seriously affected at high temperatures. This work investigates the use of nanosilica in fine limestone (calcium carbonate, CaCO3) powders to mitigate the promotion of cohesion forces at high temperatures. Experiments were conducted over limestone powder samples with particle sizes around 45 mu m. The analysis was performed monitoring the tensile yield strength as the samples were subjected to different temperatures and consolidation stresses while varying the nanosilica content up until 0.82 wt%. Temperatures reached a maximum of 500 degrees C (close to the Tamman temperature in limestone), whereas consolidation stresses were increased up to 2 kPa. Results show that nanosilica coating is an efficient solution to inhibit the enhancement of powder cohesiveness at high temperatures and consolidations. A solution that offers better control to smooth the granular flow regimes in production environments.

TI Slurry aluminizing: A solution for molten nitrate salt corrosion in
   concentrated solar power plants
SO SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS
AB Molten nitrate salts (KNO3-NaNO3) are used extensively as heat transfer fluids in concentrated solar power (CSP) applications. The oxidative character of nitrate salts at high temperature conditions leads to challenges in the corrosion protection of CSP installations in contact with molten salts. This work reports efforts to protect low-cost ferritic-martensitic P91 (Cr9-Mo1) and austenitic stainless steel 304SS materials against molten salt corrosion using slurry aluminizing. The gravimetric results show a significant improvement for aluminized alloys up to 1700 h immersion in molten nitrate salt at 600 degrees C. The extent of protection in P91 becomes comparable with the most competitive resistant materials e.g. Inconel 625. Metallographic investigations and scanning electron micrographs reveal no sign of corrosion in the substrates beneath the aluminide coatings during the immersion test. Electron probe microanalysis results reveal Na(Fe,Al)O-2 as the protective corrosion product forming on the surface of both aluminized steels. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Attitude control of LTA platform for generation of a non-oscillatory
   solar power
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB The applicability of solar energy depends either on the utilization of most efficient PV panels or on the experimental precision achieved while utilizing the existing highest efficient PV panels during implementation. Interestingly, in the present scenario, Solar Powered Lighter Than Air Platforms have been proved suitable for wide applications in defense and civil areas. Geographical mapping of the earth's surface and aerial surveillance can be performed by onboard sensors with long endurance and reliability. The airborne solar power may be affected by external wind disturbances causing oscillations in the aerial platform. In the present research, an emphasis has been laid on finding the impact of wind disturbance on the airborne solar power and later rectifying it by designing a suitable optimal controller in the feedback path of the system. The designed controller stabilizes the platform in a reasonably small time as compared to the uncontrolled system, resulting in the generation of a non-oscillatory solar power. The wind-induced attitude destabilization and subsequently the incurring power fluctuations in the harvested solar energy have been reduced by a factor of 3.46 in the closed loop system. The novelty of the work lies in implementing a tuned optimal controller for an effective orientation control with an application to harvest solar energy using Photo-Voltaic (PV) modules integrated on airborne platforms. The harvested solar energy with significantly reduced power oscillations can be used in many crucial applications against the unregulated oscillatory solar power.

TI Analysis of barriers to implement solar power installations in India
   using interpretive structural modeling technique
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB India is fast emerging economy in Asia and world. India's manufacturing sector is growing faster and domestic demand is also increasing. India has a severe electricity shortage. It needs massive additions in capacity to meet the demand of its rapidly growing economy. To maintain the pace of economic growth with reduction in emission of greenhouse gases, India must reduce its dependency on fossil fuels for electrification. Hence the requirement of solar power installations in India has increased. In this context, this study aims to develop a structural model of the barriers to implement solar power installations in India. Thirteen relevant barriers to implement solar power installations have been identified from the literature and subsequent discussions with experts from academia and industry. Contextual relationships among these barriers have been identified and interpretive structural modeling (ISM) technique based, a structural model of barriers to implement solar power installations in India has been developed. MICMAC analysis has also been used to carry out the classification of barriers based on dependence and driving power. One barrier has been identified as top level barrier and six bottom level barriers. This paper also suggests the different ways of removal of these barriers. Better understanding of these barriers would help organizations and government bodies to prioritize and manage their resources in an effective and efficient way so that maximum number of solar power projects can be installed in India.

TI Solar Power Generation Prediction Using Machine Learning and Study of
   Power Generation Using Solar Tracking Panels
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE KOREAN SOCIETY OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS B
AB As the importance of renewable energy is growing worldwide, Republic of Korea aims to increase the proportion of renewable energy generation to 30.2% by 2030. Solar power plays an important role, accounting for more than 80% of domestic renewable energy generation. However, since the amount of solar power generation varies greatly depending on weather factors, it is necessary to respond to the instability of solar power generation and increase the generation amount in order to secure stable energy. Therefore, in this paper, we learn a machine learning model based on weather data to predict the amount of solar power generation, calculate the solar altitude and azimuth that change according to seasons and time, and increase the amount of solar power generation by controlling the solar power panel. As a result of the experiment, the power generation was predicted to be within 0.208 mean square error, and it was confirmed that the difference in power generation before and after sun tracking was 23.4%.

TI Site Selection of Solar Power Plants Using Hybrid MCDM Models: A Case
   Study in Indonesia
SO ENERGIES
AB Among developing countries in Asia, Indonesia has realized the importance of transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources such as solar power. Careful consideration must be given to the strategic placement of solar power installations to fully leverage the benefits of solar energy. This study proposes a methodology to optimize the site selection of solar power plants in Indonesia by integrating Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (F-AHP), and Fuzzy Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to Compromise Solution (F-MARCOS) models. The proposed methodology considers quantitative and qualitative criteria to evaluate potential locations for solar power plants. In the first stage, DEA is used to identify the most efficient locations based on quantitative measures such as solar radiation, land availability, and grid connectivity. In the second stage, qualitative factors such as technological, economic, environmental, and socio-political aspects are evaluated using F-AHP to prioritize the most important criteria for site selection. Finally, F-MARCOS ranks potential locations based on the selected criteria. The methodology was tested using data from Indonesia as a case study. The results show that the proposed hybrid model optimizes Indonesia's solar power plant site selection. The optimal locations can contribute to a cost-effective long-term renewable energy supply nationwide. The findings from this study are relevant to policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers interested in renewable energy development and site selection. However, to promote sustainable solar energy development, governments and local authorities must also enact supportive policies and mechanisms that encourage the adoption and growth of renewable energy technologies in Indonesia.

TI Design of header and coil steam generators for concentrating solar power
   applications accounting for low-cycle fatigue requirements
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB Concentrating solar power plants are experiencing an increasing share in the renewable energy generation market. Among them, parabolic trough plants are the most commercially mature technology. These plants still experience many challenges, one of which is the cyclic daily start-up and shut-down procedures. These pose new challenges to industrially mature components like the steam generator system, as frequent load changes might decrease their lifetime considerably due to cyclic thermo-mechanical stress loads. In this context, the header and coil design is a promising configuration to minimize the stresses.
   This paper presents a method to design the header and coil heat exchangers of the steam generator, taking into account low-cycle fatigue requirements, by defining minimum allowable heating rates for the evaporator and superheater. Optimal designs were obtained by minimizing the total water pressure drops and purchase equipment costs. A comparison with a sizing routine without accounting for low-cycle fatigue constraints was also conducted.
   The model was validated against the component data of a 55 MWe power plant, with a maximum deviation on the total area estimation of +2.5%. The results suggest that including the heating rate constraints in the design routine substantially affects the optimal design configuration, with a 41% cost increase for a 1 bar pressure drop. The optimal design for maximizing the lifetime of the components uses tube outer diameters of 38 mm and 50 mm and a low number of tubes per layer (4-10) for the superheater.

   The neural model is first trained off-line, being further improved by means of an on-line learning strategy using the Lyapunov and nonlinear observation theories.
   The regulation problem is solved by an iterative strategy, formulated as an eigenvalue assignment problem, ensuring the convergence of the regulation equations.

TI The Locality of Mega Solar Businesses after the introduction of Feed-in
   Tariff
SO JOURNAL OF THE JAPAN INSTITUTE OF ENERGY
AB In contrast to other renewable energy resources, solar power facilities have increased rapidly in Japan after the introduction of Feed-in Tariff in 2012. This paper examines the present structure of mega solar power businesses in Japan. Only less than a quarter of enterprises managing mega solar power facilities have headquarters in the same prefectures as the facilities. These enterprises have mainly been established by private companies, but less so by local governments, cooperatives and foundations. The types of the parent companies basing in the same prefectures differ from those in other prefectures. This indicates that the profits of mega solar power facilities have seldom returned to local communities but rather drained to big cities. This paper concludes that mega solar power facilities have much less effect on local economy than expected.

AB This paper presents the dimension selection of the reflective mirror and the mechanical support structure design of heliostats in concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. To start with, a flowchart for designing a heliostat is presented, followed by a detailed wind load analysis to determine its mirror dimension and electric drive ratings. Specifically, the validity of the employed analytical equations developed by the Sandia National Lab are verified with a computational fluid dynamics simulation of wind pressure on the mirror surface. In addition, three mechanical support structures, with two selected from the recent literature and one proposed in this paper, are presented to assess their mechanical robustness and perform a cost comparison. The result demonstrates all of the mechanical designs are able to withstand the expected maximum wind load during solar tracking, and the rim drive is the most cost-effective structure of the three under the same comparison guidelines and principles.

AB Correlations between the electricity generated by concentrating solar thermal power (CSP) plants, as well as doss-correlations between CSP, wind power and electricity demand, have significant impacts on decisions for how much and where to build utility-scale CSP capacity, the optimal amount of thermal storage in the CSP plants, reserve capacity needed to back-up the system, as well as the expected levels of curtailed renewable power. Accurately estimating these correlations is vital to performing detailed analyses of high renewable penetration scenarios This study quantifies the degree of correlation between geographically dispersed CSP, as well as the correlation between CSP and wind power, and CSP and electricity demand in 356 discrete regions in the contiguous US Correlations are calculated using hourly data on an annual basis. Maps of the correlations will be presented to illustrate the degree of correlation between solar power and the demand it is serving, as well as the synergies between the negatively-correlated wind power and solar power serving the same region

AB Falling particle receivers are an emerging technology for use in concentrating solar power systems. In this work, quartz tubes cut in half to form tube shells (referred to as quartz half-shells) are investigated for use as a full or partial aperture cover to reduce radiative and advective losses from the receiver. A receiver subdomain and surrounding air volume are modeled using ANSYS (R) Fluent (R). The model is used to simulate fluid dynamics and heat transfer for the following cases: (1) open aperture, (2) aperture fully covered by quartz half-shells, and (3) aperture partially covered by quartz half-shells. We compare the percentage of total incident solar power lost due to conduction through the receiver walls, advective losses through the aperture, and radiation exiting out of the aperture. Contrary to expected outcomes, simulation results using the simplified receiver subdomain show that quartz aperture covers can increase radiative losses and, in the partially covered case, also increase advective losses. These increased heat losses are driven by elevated quartz half-shell temperatures and have the potential to be mitigated by active cooling and/or material selection.

TI MONTE-CARLO probabilistic valuation of concentrated solar power systems
   in Spain under the 2014 retroactive regulatory framework
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB The current Royal Decree 413/2014 legal-economic framework for concentrating solar power plants in Spain has been analysed from a probabilistic perspective. Due to the high inherent risk in most of the parameters defining this economic regime, the use of a probabilistic model is proposed to perform the economic valuation of these facilities. A methodology composed of different steps has been developed and applied to a representative concentrating solar power plant type with thermal energy storage. This method has proven useful for distinguishing the input parameters to be considered as stochastic by using a sensitivity analysis, and also for performing the probabilistic valuation by using the discounted cash flow-Monte Carlo analysis. The results have revealed a great variability in the several output economic indicators considered. In general terms, substantial reductions in the profitability of these facilities have been evidenced with respect to the deterministic analysis under the current reality of the sector.

TI States prediction for solar power and wind speed using BBA-SVM
SO IET RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION
AB For solar power and wind speed prediction, the uncertainty and randomness of prediction model or parameters make it a challenging task to optimise the accurate output. This study presents a novel backward bat algorithm (BBA) for the parameter tuning of the support vector machine (SVM). Then, the BBA-SVM approach is used to predict the solar power and wind speed output in different situations. The salient feather of the novel BBA-SVM is that an improved flying principle is developed by adopting the backward flying mechanism, which enhances the randomly searching ability and thus avoids the local optimum effectively. Compared to traditional SVM methods, the BBA-SVM gains higher training accuracy, shorter training time, and better prediction performance. Take the solar power output in a sunny day as the validation case, the real data sets from Australia are adopted for comparative simulations, demonstrating the priority of the BBA-SVM against some other SVMs like the grid searching SVM, bat algorithm SVM, and generic algorithm aided BBA-SVM.

AB The rapid increase in solar power plant installation creating considerable difficulties for power system operation and control, due to the highly stochastic nature of solar energy. To ensure a smooth solar panel output, an accurate short-time forecast plays a crucial role in grid energy management. In this paper, a problem of hours ahead solar plant power prediction and forecasting is considered. This accurate prediction can significantly improve the electricity cost by planning the extra power generation for supplying loads. For a case study, a meteorological dataset for a real operated solar power plant is used to develop and verify the forecasting model. A detailed time series analysis of the solar power output (per second data) has been used for model development and validation. Additionally, after investigating different techniques, a Glosten-Jagannathan-Runkle Generalized Auto Regressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GJR-GARCH) based forecasting has been proposed. The developed model predicts solar power with high accuracy with a confidence interval of 99%. The results and verification with a real data set prove the capability of applying this method in industrial applications. These predicted models are utilized to generate battery control signals ensuring a smooth power flow to the grid or directly send to the grid for ensuring peak energy savings.

TI An approach for estimating perpetual endurance of the stratospheric
   solar-powered platform
SO AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The high altitude solar-powered airships have been proposed for use as long endurance platforms, for a variety of military and civilian applications. The challenges of perpetual endurance flight require the airship to generate sufficient power over a wide range of operational latitudes so that the aerial vehicle can keep station through high wind events and maintain persistence. This paper provides a theoretical approach to analyzing the perpetual endurance performance of a high altitude solar-powered airship. According to the features of stratospheric airship and the theoretical model, a custom tool is developed using MATLAB computer program when the airship operates in the cruise condition. The effects of the operational latitudes, wind velocities and solar array areas on the energy ratio are numerically investigated in detail, and the required areas of solar array under the conditions of different minimum energy ratio were discussed. The results showed that the solar-powered airships faced severe operational limitations at high latitudes in the winter, especially in the high wind. In addition, a case study was analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach to predicting the perpetual endurance region. The results demonstrated that the theoretical approach suggested a pathway towards planning the flight date and location for an airship. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI A multi-scale solar receiver with peak receiver efficiency over 90% at
   720 degrees C for the next-generation solar power tower
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB To reduce the receiver's energy loss at high temperatures for the next-generation concentrating solar power plant, a novel multi-scale receiver is proposed by combing fin-like structures in the macroscale and light-trapping coatings in the nanoscale. The fin-like structure can reabsorb the reflected solar energy while the light-trapping nanostructured coating can increase solar absorption and reduce infrared emissivity. A multi-scale numerical model is developed to evaluate the receiver's optical and thermal performance. It is found that the multi-scale solar receiver can achieve a receiver efficiency of 0.904 at the solar time of 12:00 on spring equinox. Howev-er, it is also found that the maximum film temperature of the leading-edge tube will exceed 800 degrees C, which may decompose the current nitrate salt. To solve this problem, a white coating is used for leading-edge tubes to reduce the temperature by decreasing the maximum heat flux. The results show that this method can effectively regulate the overheating of the leading-edge tube. The maximum film temperature was successfully reduced to less than 800 degrees C at nearly no expenses of the absorbed solar energy. The study provides a new sight to achieve a receiver efficiency of more than 0.9 for the next generation concentrating solar power plants.

AB This work presents the optimization of the design and operation of a dry cooling system for concentrated solar power facilities. A two-step procedure is developed based on mathematical optimization to determine, first, the optimal geometry of the A-frame including sizing, number of fans and blade geometry, and unit parameters such as pipe length, configuration and number and second, the operation of the system over a year for minimum energy consumption. The geometry problem is formulated as a MINLP solved using a tailor-made branch and bound algorithm for proper initialization of the complex NLP problem. The second problem consists of a multi-period MINLP framework including a simplified unit model. The geometry suggested allows reducing the energy required by proper pipe configuration and number consuming around 4% of the energy produced by the CSP plant that serves. It is a promising result that can be affected by plant layout and ground availability.

TI Climate change impacts on renewable energy supply
SO NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
AB Renewable energy resources, which depend on climate, may be susceptible to future climate change. Here we use climate and integrated assessment models to estimate this effect on key renewables. Future potential and costs are quantified across two warming scenarios for eight technologies: utility-scale and rooftop photovoltaic, concentrated solar power, onshore and offshore wind energy, first-generation and lignocellulosic bioenergy, and hydropower. The generated cost-supply curves are then used to estimate energy system impacts. In a baseline warming scenario, the largest impact is increased availability of bioenergy, though this depends on the strength of CO2 fertilization. Impacts on hydropower and wind energy are uncertain, with declines in some regions and increases in others, and impacts on solar power are minor. In a future mitigation scenario, these impacts are smaller, but the energy system response is similar to that in the baseline scenario given a larger reliance of the mitigation scenario on renewables.

TI Supercritical carbon dioxide cycles with multi-heating in Concentrating
   Solar Power plants
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB This work analyses the features and performance of supercritical CO2 cycles with multi-heating (heat supplies at different temperature) in Concentrating Solar Power plants, including its internal coherent integration. The specific features of multi-heating cycles fit perfectly with the characteristics of concentrating solar energy. The integration requires the design of a new type of solar field to accommodate the solar radiation hitting the receiver to the multi-heating requirements. This new solar field has a similar configuration to the solar tower, but receiver and heliostats are divided into two sections, and each section meets different requirements in concentration ratio, fluid temperature, and absorbed heat flux. This new solar field, called multi-heating solar tower, achieves higher efficiencies than standard solar towers with softer thermal requirements. The flexibility of the multi-heating structure is very useful to solve efficiently the restrictions of supercritical CO2 cycles caused by the variations of specific heat close to the critical point. The resulting CSP plant with multi-heating achieves higher efficiency than plants with standard solar towers and supercritical CO2 cycle.

TI Hybridization of concentrated solar power with biomass gasification in
   Brazil's semiarid region
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB This study aims to propose and analyze different options for hybridizing Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) with biomass, through gasification for power generation. A hybrid CSP-biomass power plant through gasification is an innovative concept which allows the integration of combined cycle for power generation, sun-biomass hybridization and syngas storage. Therefore, this study addressed the proposition of the hybridization concept and the simulation of benchmark power plants for a suitable Brazilian site (high direct normal irradiation and low-cost biomass availability). Three power plant concepts are proposed and simulated in Aspentech Hysys and System Advisor Model (SAM): (i) Series design; (ii) Parallel design, and (iii) Steam Extraction design. For the same gasifier, the Series design holds the highest levelized cost, while the Parallel design presents the highest installed capacity, but the lowest capacity factor. Finally, the Steam Extraction design is placed between the other two proposed plants regarding the capacity factor and the annual energy generation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Thermal cycling test of solid particles to be used in concentrating
   solar power plants
SO SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS
AB Durability and reliability of solid particles to be used in concentrating solar power tower plants is crucial for the project viability. Solid particles materials to be implemented in concentrating solar power plants are thermal aged and thermal cycled in this study to evaluation of solid particles at high temperatures. A homemade device has been developed to perform accelerated-durability tests, that allows emulation of thermal cycling stress from days to years, and even evaluate the 11,000 cycles expected to be reached during 20 years' plant's lifetime in less than four months. A detailed description of the operation of this device is included in this paper. In addition, current solar absorptance, chemical composition, physical properties, thermal characteristics, and morphologic analysis of the samples before and after thermal treatments have been performed. The materials under the study are the most reliable solid particles reported in CSP field: silicon carbide (SiC) and CarboHSP (R) 30/60. Characterization results show that SiC is more affected on its durability by thermal cycling than by constant temperature aging treatment while CarboHSP (R) is affected by temperature aging rather than thermal cycling. SiC reacts with oxygen to form SiO2 on the surface, with a positive effect in its solar absorptance. Nevertheless, with thermal cycles, SiC particle surface becomes damaged and the reaction continues with more new exposed surface. Meanwhile, CarboHSP (R) reduces its solar absorptance with high temperature only due to changes in its surface chemical composition. However, thermal cycling shows no negative effect in CarboHSP (R) properties.

AB This paper presents a solar power generation prediction technique using artificial neural network. The predicted data is then applied to the adaptive power management strategy for Photovoltaic (PV) generation units in a standalone microgrid. The intermittent nature of solar power generation leads to major challenges in power system planning and load sharing. Prediction of solar power generation based on weather conditions and the proper use of this data in power management strategies improve the performance of existing standalone systems. This paper proposes an adaptive control strategy, which uses the predicted value of solar generation to determine the mode of operation. An ANN model is developed and trained using the dependency of solar power generation on weather parameters. The trained model is used to predict the expected solar power generation at any time. The applicability of the proposed adaptive control method is analyzed using Matlab/Simulink based simulation studies.

TI Projecting power: The security implications of space-based solar power
SO BULLETIN OF THE ATOMIC SCIENTISTS
AB Space-based solar power is a system for delivering a potentially limitless supply of clean energy to a world desperately searching for alternatives to fossil fuels. However, while the system offers the promise of unlimited, "green" electrical power, it also has immense potential as a geopolitical tool. For example, this new power source could be used to support troops, rebels, or international aid workers virtually anywhere in the world. Space solar power research has recently experienced something of a renaissance, but so far there has been very little discussion about the security implications of this potentially transformative technology. While it will be at least a decade, if not two, before the infrastructure for deploying a full-scale system exists, developing policies and norms-international and national-capable of effectively engaging such a technically and politically complex issue can itself require years of work. Policy makers and political scientists should begin debating the security impacts of space-based solar power now, lest technological development outpace the ability of governments and international institutions to meaningfully assimilate it.

TI Thermo-economic analysis of an integrated solar thermal cycle (ISTC)
   using thermal storage
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Solar integrated power plants are a combination of the concentrated solar power plant and thermal power plant. The thermal energy storage systems, when integrated with concentrated solar power based solar cycle, can address issues related to energy availability during non-solar hours.This study presents an integration of concentrated solar power technology based solar energy capture and storage with the 210 MW conventional Rankine cycle based thermal power plant in Dadri (India). The mathematical model of Integrated Solar Thermal Cycle (ISTC) has been developed which includes the modelling of the Linear Fresenel reflector solar system, steam power cycle, and two tank thermal storage method. Here, water and molten salt are chosen as heat transfer fiuid in the collector loops as a medium to transfer and store the solar thermal energy. A MATLAB code is used as a simulation tool to analyse the ISTC performance for different parametric variations such as temperature difference in the solar receiver, solar output, the mass flow rate of heat transfer fluids, fuel-saving ratio by varying direct normal irradiation. Based on the simulation, it is discussed that the integration of solar field with power cycle offers enhanced efficiency along with the reduction of emission of carbon dioxide. Integration of solar field with Thermal Energy Storage (TES) using two tank method with molten salt further improves the efficiency of the power cycle up to 40%. Based on results of simulations, it is discussed that ISTC using two tank method with molten salt results into the saving of large amount of fuel by replacement of one and two feed water heater(s) which ensures the recovery of the capital expenditure within approximately 10 years. Further, this improvisation contributes to environment and society by curtailing the emission of carbon dioxide drastically.

TI Dynamic output characteristics of a photovoltaic-wind-concentrating
   solar power hybrid system integrating an electric heating device
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB A large-scale renewable photovoltaic-wind-concentrating solar power hybrid system integrating an electric heating device is proposed to provide a sustainable power for a domestic region. The thermal energy storage and the electric heating device can be utilized to recover the power rejection from the photovoltaic and wind systems, and match the flexible load demand. In this research, a dynamic physical model is established to analyze the dynamic output characteristics based on the renewable resources and load demand in Zhangbei area, China. The results prove that the hybrid system can well match the load demand most of the time, and the power rejection can be recovered by about 20-35%. The Levelized Cost of Energy achieves its lowest level at the fixed capacities of photovoltaic and wind systems. Further, the recovery ratio is inversely proportional to the solar multiple and the capacities of the photovoltaic and wind systems, while it improves with the increase of the thermal energy storage capacity. The Levelized Cost of Energy of 0.2775 $/kWh and the recovery ratio of 30.87% are achieved when the hybrid system is composed of 900 MWe photovoltaic, 3600 MWe wind, and 1360 MWe concentrating solar power system at the solar multiple of 1.2 and the thermal energy storage capacity of 190 GWht, given the loss of power supply probability of 5%.

TI EFFECT OF EXTERNAL SOLAR RECEIVER INCLINATION ON THE THERMAL EFFICIENCY
SO JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Burning fossil fuel as an energy source faces a lot of problems. As a result, Researches and development studies rose to change this type of energy source to another clean source, a concentrating solar power technologies is one of the promises options. Improving external solar receiver thermal efficiency is the most important parameter in solar power tower (SPT) systems, as it is a major component in Concentrated Solar Power CSP systems, which is responsible to produce a high heat transfer fluid HTF temperature to use it with different applications. The novelty of this paper is to study the effect of external receiver inclination angle on the thermal efficiency. To meet this objective, the receiver inclination effect was investigated experimentally and numerically during May, June and July on an experimental rig located in Al-Nahrain University / Baghdad, Iraq with Latitude (33.3152 degrees N) and Longitude (44.3661 degrees E). A comparison of the outlet receiver temperatures and fluid bulk temperature distribution for different inclination angles and different months were studied, in the end, the enhancement in the receiver thermal efficiency between a vertical position configuration and the tilted angle of maximum efficiency is obtained. The results show that the maximum receiver thermal efficiency occurred at an inclination angle of (25 degrees) from the vertical position, with 77.6%, 83.8%, 88.5% average receiver thermal efficiency on May, June, and July respectively. Moreover, the average thermal efficiency of an inclined external solar receiver configuration tilted with (25 degrees) inclination angle had an improvement of 12.4%, 8.6%, and 5.12% for months May, June, and July respectively, compared with that of the vertical position configuration of traditional receivers in the selected location.

The objective of this paper is to deal with the technical and economical part of the investment in the construction of solar power plant and small hydro power plant. Based on reviewed literature no paper was found that compare technical and economical analysis between solar power plant and small hydro power plant. The advantages and disadvantages of each technology in terms of technical and economical part of the placement in an area are presented. On the basis of the investment and operating costs an analysis of the viability of investment at different purchase prices of electricity is implemented, with the help of acceptance indicators. This paper presents a new approach to multi-criteria single aim valuation giving the estimation of suitability for the construction of solar power plants and small hydro power plants as a result. Single aim multi-criteria evaluation gives us the basis for deciding which technology is appropriate for placement in an area. To achieve a 10-year payback period, a multi-criteria evaluation analysis showed that the reference price (41.94 E/kWh) for solar power plants was increased by 3.3 times and for small hydro power plants by 1.4 times.

TI A New Approach to Low-Cost, Solar Salt-Resistant Structural Materials
   for Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) and Thermal Energy Storage (TES)
SO METALS
AB "Concentrated solar power" (CSP) and thermal energy storage (TES) are promising renewable energy technologies, which have gained increasing interest and practical application in recent years. CSP and TES systems typically utilize molten salts such as the so-called "solar salt", a mixture of 60 wt.% NaNO3 and 40 wt.% KNO3, for heat transfer and storage. The overall efficiency of commercially operating CSP and TES systems is currently limited, because of solar salt thermal stability, which prevents process temperatures higher than 600 degrees C. Even at these temperatures, corrosion of the structural materials applied in salt guiding pipework, tubes and containers is a matter of concern in long-term operation, which necessitates careful material selection. This paper outlines the superior salt corrosion behavior of a novel low-cost, Al2O3-forming, ferritic, Laves phase-strengthened (i.e., structural) steel in NaNO3/KNO3 solar salt at 600 degrees C. Directions for the further development of the LB2230 trial steel towards improved structural properties are derived in comparison to its predecessor Crofer(R)22 H.

TI Policies to keep and expand the option of concentrating solar power for
   dispatchable renewable electricity
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB Concentrating solar power (CSP) is one of the few renewable electricity technologies that can offer dispatchable electricity at large scale. Thus, it may play an important role in the future, especially to balance fluctuating sources in increasingly renewables-based power systems. Today, its costs are higher than those of PV and wind power and, as most countries do not support CSP, deployment is slow. Unless the expansion gains pace and costs decrease, the industry may stagnate or collapse, and an important technology for climate change mitigation has been lost. Keeping CSP as a maturing technology for dispatchable renewable power thus requires measures to improve its short-term economic attractiveness and to continue reducing costs in the longer term. We suggest a set of three policy instruments - feed-in tariffs or auctions reflecting the value of dispatchable CSP, and not merely its cost; risk coverage support for innovative designs; and demonstration projects - to be deployed, in regions where CSP has a potentially large role to play. This could provide the CSP industry with a balance of attractive profits and competitive pressure, the incentive to expand CSP while also reducing its costs, making it ready for broad-scale deployment when it is needed.

TI Forecasting Solar Power Using Hybrid Firefly and Particle Swarm
   Optimization (HFPSO) for Optimizing the Parameters in a Wavelet
   Transform-Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (WT-ANFIS)
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Solar power generation deals with uncertainty and intermittency issues that lead to some difficulties in controlling the whole grid system due to imbalanced power production and power demand. The forecasting of solar power is an effort in securing the integration of renewable energy into the grid. This work proposes a forecasting model called WT-ANFIS-HFPSO which combines the wavelet transform (WT), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and hybrid firefly and particle swarm optimization algorithm (HFPSO). In the proposed work, the WT model is used to eliminate the noise in the meteorological data and solar power data whereby the ANFIS is functioning as the forecasting model of the hourly solar power data. The HFPSO is the hybridization of the firefly (FF) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, which is employed in optimizing the premise parameters of the ANFIS to increase the accuracy of the model. The results obtained from WT-ANFIS-HFPSO are then compared with several other forecasting strategies. From the comparative analysis, the WT-ANFIS-HFPSO showed superior performance in terms of statistical error analysis, confirming its reliability as an excellent forecaster of hourly solar power data.

TI The Role of Innovation in Industry Product Deployment: Developing
   Thermal Energy Storage for Concentrated Solar Power
SO ENERGIES
AB Industries with fast-developing technologies and knowledge-intensive business services rely on the development of scientific knowledge for their growth. This is also true in the renewable energy industry such as in concentrating solar power (CSP) plants, which have undergone intense development and expansion in the last two decades. Yet knowledge generation is not sufficient; its dissemination and internalization by the industry is indispensable for new product development. This paper contributes to providing empirical evidence on the known link between knowledge development and firm growth. In 10 years the cost of electricity produced through CSP has decreased five-fold. This decrease has only been possible due to innovation projects developed through a complex network of research and development (R&D) collaborations and intense investment, both public and (to a greater extent) private. The development and construction of pilot plants and demonstration facilities are shown to be key in maturing innovations for commercialization. This is an example of how the private sector is contributing to the decarbonisation of our energy system, contributing to the objectives of climate change mitigation.

AB High-temperature thermal storage in a packed bed of rocks is considered for air-based concentrated solar power plants. The unsteady 1D two-phase energy conservation equations are formulated for combined convection and conduction heat transfer, and solved numerically for charging/discharging cycles. Validation is accomplished in a pilot-scale experimental setup with a packed bed of crushed steatite (magnesium silicate rock) at 800 K. A parameter study of the packed bed dimensions, fluid flow rate, particle diameter, and solid phase material was carried out to evaluate the charging/discharging characteristics, daily cyclic operation, overall thermal efficiency and capacity ratio.

TI The need to strategically manage CSP fleet development and water
   resources: A structured review and way forward
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB The rapid global growth in the use of renewable energy to reduce GHG emissions and mitigate climate change, through the inclusion of large amounts of PV and wind in existing electricity grids, has high-lighted certain challenges. Most critically, their intermittent supply, necessitates flexible dispatchability from other generators in the grid. Currently, few renewable energy technologies offer this dispatchability, with only concentrating solar power (CSP) offering storage. CSP generates electricity from thermal heat, similar to fossil-driven thermal power plants, with the heat-source being inexhaustible concentrated solar irradiance. The thermal process, however, requires cooling, best achieved with a finite resource; water. CSP is ideally suited to areas of high solar irradiation, typically arid and water stressed. The need for water as a source of cooling is often neglected in the planning and development of CSP. This paper identifies water as a constraint to CSP deployment, and explores CSP's potential contribution to generation through the lens of the water-energy nexus. This aids our understanding of how water availability threatens expected CSP production capacity and places natural limits on its sustainable development. For strategic planning of CSP, we therefore propose the inclusion of integrated water resource management in CSP energy infrastructure planning. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI An Implementation of an optimized dual-axis solar tracking algorithm for
   concentrating solar power plants deployment
SO SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
AB A recent assessment of a pilot concentrating solar power plant in Ghana noticed the failure of the tracking system to accurately align the multifaceted heliostats toward the sun and focus the sunbeams onto the target. A further review of solar tracking systems revealed the limitation of concentrated solar power tracking systems to simultaneously improve accuracy and reduce operational cost. In this paper, a computer vision-based solar tracking system, comprising a vision controller, webcam, light sensor, Arduino microcontroller, two stepper motors, a stick, and a transparent plate, is proposed and implemented. The light sensor indicates the presence or absence of sunlight, the webcam captures the image of the stick's shadow on the plate and the vision controller reads this data from the webcam and processes it to extract the solar angles. The angles are sent to the microcontroller which uses them to orient the heliostat appropriately through the stepper motors. The proposed system is location independent and can be installed in each heliostat or a group of heliostats. the preliminary tests show it tracks the sun accurately and exhibits minimal operation cost.

TI Development of a Solar-Powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicle for Extended

SO DRONES
AB Having an exciting array of applications, the scope of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) application could be far wider one if its flight endurance can be prolonged. Solar-powered UAV, promising notable prolongation in flight endurance, is drawing increasing attention in the industries' recent research and development. This work arose from a Bachelor's degree capstone project at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The project aims to modify a 2-metre wingspan remote-controlled (RC) UAV available in the consumer market to be powered by a combination of solar and battery-stored power. The major objective is to greatly increase the flight endurance of the UAV by the power generated from the solar panels. The power system is first designed by selecting the suitable system architecture and then by selecting suitable components related to solar power. The flight control system is configured to conduct flight tests and validate the power system performance. Under fair experimental conditions with desirable weather conditions, the solar power system on the aircraft results in 22.5% savings in the use of battery-stored capacity. The decrease rate of battery voltage during the stable level flight of the solar-powered UAV built is also much slower than the same configuration without a solar-power system.

TI Dynamic simulation, control, and performance evaluation of a synergistic
   solar and natural gas hybrid power plant
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB Solar power is considered among the leading renewable energy technologies. Abundant supply, flexibility of installation, and decreasing cost makes it an interesting renewable energy resource. However, there are challenges associated with the reliability of solar power due to its intermittent nature. This work demonstrates the synergies that exist in integrated hybrid systems, where a dispatchable fuel is used in conjunction with concentrated solar power. In this simulation-based study, a parabolic trough solar concentrator is used to collect solar energy. The heat collected from the solar field is used to generate steam in a Rankine cycle. The system also utilizes natural gas combustion in the steam generator to provide supplemental steam when the solar intensity is reduced due to cloud cover or at night. Natural gas is also used for superheating the steam, which allows the system to produce higher temperatures and achieve increased thermodynamic cycle efficiencies. This flexible design produces 100 MW at nominal conditions, while it is capable of producing a maximum of 140 MW when sufficient solar energy is available. The novel contributions of this work include a complete, systems-level, dynamic model of a hybrid solar plant. The model is complete with a control system that smoothly transitions the plant from pure natural gas mode at night to solar hybrid mode during the day. It evaluates innovative design features such as flexible fuel operation, steam superheating to boost efficiency, and preheating by solar or waste heat. Furthermore, this work demonstrates that by hybridizing a solar system with a dispatchable energy source, both the reliability and efficiency of the solar power production are increased. The annual solar-to-electric efficiency increases from 15.2% to 26.13% with hybridization, which indicates that utilization of the solar energy is effectively increased.

AB Internet of Things (IoTs) concept has opened a window for forest to become a part of the technology connected ecosystem with power under the forest canopy as one of the primary concerns. A multitude of sensors can be deployed under the forest canopy for real time and periodic forest monitoring in the IoTs environment. In this research, the amount of solar power generation under a closed forest canopy is studied in detail. The key objective of this research is to provide an insight on power management for potential IoTs based forest monitoring devices. The minimum, maximum and average solar radiation received under the closed canopy is 1.87W/m<^> 2, 761.67W/m<^>2 and 74.50W/m<^>2 respectively. By further computation, the monthly minimum, maximum and average total solar radiation is 10184.24Wh/m<^>2, 45791.08Wh/m<^> 2 and 21087.47Wh/m<^>2 respectively. By modeling with a 12V 100W solar panel, the lowest and the highest solar power generated are 0.19W and 76.22W respectively. On the other hand, the monthly maximum and minimum total solar power generated is 4582.22Wh and 1019.12Wh respectively. A typical IoTs environmental sensing Node from Libelium consumes 503Wh per month which is lower than the minimum monthly total solar power generated. In overall, solar power generation is possible under a closed canopy to power an energy efficient IoTs device.

However, solar radiation is varies with time and geographical locations and meteorological conditions. In this paper, artificial neural network and generalized neural network are used as a powerful tool for Renewable Energy Forecasting. With the help of metrological data such as wind velocity, solar irradiation, and temperature as input to the model we can predict the changes in generated solar power, which is very useful for integration of solar power into grid. In this paper these soft computing techniques are able to prediction the solar power generation accurately and fast compare to conventional methods of forecasting.

AB High-altitude and long-endurance solar-powered UAV mostly uses the high-aspect-ratio wing. The tip of the wing is very deformed and the flutter velocity is low, which is easily affected by the gust load. The structural safety of UAV flying in the sky is a popular and difficult issue, but there is no design criterion for the structural design of the solar powered UAV. Therefore, in this paper, according to the structural characteristics of large aspect ratio solar powered UAV, the design criteria of structural safety are put forward, and the structure of solar powered UAV is studied respectively from static strength, stiffness and dynamic load. Numerical results show that under cruising condition, the maximum stress of solar powered UAV structure is much lower than the breaking strength of the material, but the sustained vibration caused by the flutter will cause a large overload, which will lead to fatigue and impact damage to the structure. Under the gust response, the structure response converges quickly, but after exceeding a certain flight speed, any gust will cause the structure to diverge and the structure to break down rapidly. At the same time, it can also be seen that the bending, twisting and horizontal waving of the large aspect ratio wing lead to structural flutter destruction.

TI Comparison between Concentrated Solar Power and Gas-Based Generation in
   Terms of Economic and Flexibility-Related Aspects in Chile
SO ENERGIES
AB The energy sector in Chile demands a significant increase in renewable energy sources in the near future, and concentrated solar power (CSP) technologies are becoming increasingly competitive as compared to natural gas plants. Motivated by this, this paper presents a comparison between solar technologies such as hybrid plants and natural gas-based thermal technologies, as both technologies share several characteristics that are comparable and beneficial for the power grid. This comparison is made from an economic point of view using the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) metric and in terms of the systemic benefits related to flexibility, which is very much required due to the current decarbonization scenario of Chile's energy matrix. The results show that the LCOE of the four hybrid plant models studied is lower than the LCOE of the gas plant. A solar hybrid plant configuration composed of a photovoltaic and solar tower plant (STP) with 13 h of storage and without generation restrictions has an LCOE 53 USD/MWh, while the natural gas technology evaluated with an 85% plant factor and a variable fuel cost of 2.0 USD/MMBtu has an LCOE of 86 USD/MWh. Thus, solar hybrid plants under a particular set of conditions are shown to be more cost-effective than their closest competitor for the Chilean grid while still providing significant dispatchability and flexibility.

TI Energy efficiency and accuracy of solar powered BLE beacons
SO COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS
AB In the last decade, there has been an exponential growth in the numbers of wireless devices which connect to the Internet. At the same time, the networks size have grown larger than ever before. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons are an attractive solution for a plethora of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, from micro localization to advertisement and transportation. BLE beacons are small, low cost devices that are capable of providing contextual and locational information to the users. In the fifth generation (5G) ecosystem, many BLE beacons are expected to be deployed among other devices. In 5G wireless networks era, sustainable and energy aware networks are vital to usability and performance. An appealing solution for energy efficiency is energy harvesting for wireless devices. To reduce the maintenance and increase the lifespan of networks that include such devices, solar powered beacons can be used. In this paper, the performance of solar powered BLE beacons is examined in terms of energy efficiency and accuracy. A comparison between the solar powered BLE beacon and battery powered beacon is also discussed. Experimental results shown that solar powered BLE beacon is a promising solution with minimum energy requirements and high accuracy.

To start with, the torque capabilities of the system is specified by identifying the moment of inertia and the maximum wind load of a benchmark heliostat, as well as properly defining the extreme motion profile. Secondly, the optimal gear ratio of the drivetrain system can be determined based on inertia matching theory, which can be used to select an off-the-shelf drivetrain with a gear ratio close to the optimal value. Simultaneously, the maximum torque requirement of the induction motor and its axial length can be optimized by using Maxwell's stress tensor. Finally, results from finite element analysis (FEA) for the induction motor are provided to verify the concepts developed in this paper.

SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB Thermal energy storage in packed beds is receiving increased attention as a necessary component for efficient implementation of concentrated solar power plants. A simplified, one-equation thermal model for the behavior of a packed bed is presented for a-alumina as solid storage material and air as the heat transfer fluid. The model successfully predicts the thermocline behavior over time. Two flow rates during storage are presented for alumina in a cylindrical packed bed. Temperature-dependent thermophysical properties are utilized to accurately model the systems. An additional study of air and alumina at high temperature (700 degrees C) is presented to further highlight the importance of variable thermophysical properties in real models. Explicit consideration is given to explain situations where the modeling approach is valid based on a Biot number analysis and the thermal capacities of the solid and fluid. (C) 2015 The Authors.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREEN ENERGY
AB As the scale and schedule of installing solar power generation equipment are accelerated by Taiwan's government to respond to the global climate policy, more effective policy measures are required by the Bureau of Energy to attract private funds to invest in solar power. In order to search for effective policy measures, this study developed a research scale to explore the determinants of Taiwan's institutions/ corporations investment in solar power generation equipment. The results of this study show that the benefits and costs in the market environment directly affect the behavioral intentions of the institutions/corporations regarding the installation of solar power generation equipment in Taiwan. "Land use," "equipment certification and inspection," and "an infrastructure of renewable energy" are three factors that indirectly affect the installation of solar power generation equipment through public trust, government satisfaction, and governmental policies.

TI Evaluating a concentrating solar power plant as an extended-duration
   peaking resource
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB We explore the ability of a concentrating solar power (CSP) plant with thermal energy storage (TES) to provide peaking capacity. We focus on future power systems, wherein net load patterns may be significantly different than they are today (e.g., due to higher renewable-energy penetrations). We examine 28 locations in the southwestern United States over an 18-year period. The hourly operation of the CSP plants are simulated to determine their potential to provide energy during an eight-hour peak-load window for each day up to 365 days per year. Our result shows that for the large majority of locations and years, CSP plants with certain configurations (i.e., in terms of solar field and TES sizes) can provide nearly 100% peak-load capacity. We examine also the amount of supplemental energy (e.g., by using natural gas as a supplemental thermal-energy source) that would be required to ensure that a CSP plant could serve the eight highest-load hours of every day of the year. We find that in most cases, a CSP plant supplemented with natural gas would require less than 5% of the fuel that is used by a natural-gas fired power plant providing the same level of reliable capacity. A series of sensitivity analyses show that these results are robust to the number of peak-load hours and days that are considered and the configuration of the CSP plant.

AB This paper explores the possibilities of sustainable biogas use for hybridisation of Concentrated Solar Power (HCSP) in Europe. The optimal system for the use of biogas from agricultural residues (manure and crop residues) in HCSP involves anaerobic digestion with upgrading of biogas to biomethane and injection into the gas grid for transport and storage. Using biogas from agricultural residues results in efficient reduction of non-renewable energy use and especially GHG emission, due to the avoidance of methane emission from manure storage. The net biomethane production from agricultural residues in EU-27 can potentially reach approximately 29,000 Mm3, sufficient to supply 320 CSP plants with a capacity of 100 MWe with HYSOL technology, producing 55% of the electricity from gas. The uncertainties concerning the production potential are large. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Among all concentrated solar power technologies, plants with parabolic trough collector and steam Rankine cycle are the most matured and established technology. Organic Rankine cycle is a promising option for modular scale power plants with low temperature heat sources. The decision of selection between steam Rankine and organic Rankine cycles is influenced by solar collector field characteristics and cost, steam Rankine cycle efficiency, and power block cost. In this paper, based on the condition of equality of the levelized cost of energy, a methodology for selecting working fluid through a novel graphical representation, called working fluid selection diagram, is proposed. The proposed methodology also includes selection between parabolic trough and linear Fresnel collector based plant, for a given working fluid of the Rankine cycle. Most of the methods, proposed in literature, require multiple simulations for selecting various design parameters and optimum configuration of the plant. The proposed working fluid and solar collector field selection diagrams can be used for quick suggestion about optimal configuration of a concentrated solar power plant, without any detailed simulations. Based on the thermodynamic and economic parameters, R113 and isohexane achieves levelized cost of energy close to the parabolic trough collector based plant with steam Rankine cycle. Effects of different parameters on selection of optimal configuration of a concentrating solar power plant are also studied. The analytical procedures developed for selecting solar collector field and working fluid of the power generating cycle are important during conceptual design of a concentrated solar power plant. These methodologies can be applied at the initial design stage to compare the alternative configurations and to reduce the search space related to various design parameters. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A concentrating solar power (CSP) system is considered a promising technology to harness solar energy, which is a clean and inexhaustible energy source. However, solar power is intermittent and dynamic by its nature. Therefore, the system suffers from operational and control issues affecting the performance of the electricity generation system. Recent studies suggest that small-scale CSP systems with organic Rankine cycles (ORC) have strong potential for off-grid power solution. Keys to successful implementation of this technology lie in optimizing the solar collectors for low-temperature thermal output (<200 degrees C) and employing automatic control to attenuate fluctuating thermal input as well as electricity demand. Thus, this work aims at developing dynamic models and implementing the simulation using a commercial simulator, DYNSIM. Besides, comparison and discussion of the two different types of thermal energy storage (TES) adopted in a CSP system including two-tank and packed-bed TES, was performed. Also, control structures for the systems with both types of TES were proposed and discussed. The two tank TES exhibited higher performances as the efficiency of solar collector and boiler is independent of the level of energy stored.

TI Perpetual Solar-Powered Flight across Regions around the World for a
   Year-Long Operation
SO AEROSPACE
AB This study aims to promote the conventional solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to be used as a satellite known as a pseudo-satellite (pseudolite). The applications of UAV as a satellite are still in the initial stages because these proposed UAVs are required to fly for long hours at a specified altitude. Any solar-powered system requires extensive mission operation planning to ensure sufficient power to sustain a level flight. This study simulates the optimal UAV configurations at various global locations, and determines the feasibility of a solar-powered UAV to sustain a continuous mission. This study is divided into two different phases. An all-year operation of the average UAV (AVUAV) is simulated in Phase One and is designed specifically for each of 12 cities, namely, Ottawa, Honolulu, Quito, Tahiti, Brasilia, London, Riyadh, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur, Accra, Port Louis, and Suva. Phase Two is a simulation of a solar-powered UAV design model known as 1UAV, applicable to any city around the world for a year-long flight. The findings state that a single UAV design is sufficient to operate continuously around the world if its detailed mission path planning has been defined.

TI Benchmarking analysis of a novel thermocline hybrid thermal energy
   storage system using steelmaking slag pebbles as packed-bed filler
   material for central receiver applications
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB The aim of this research is to provide the techno-economic and benchmarking analysis of a 100 MWe class molten salt central receiver system using a thermocline hybrid thermal energy storage (TES) system versus conventional two-tank storage. The techno-economic analysis used has been carried out by means of specifically developed transient simulation models to find out a robust comparison between technologies. Thermal energy from storage, annual net electricity production and Levelized Cost of Electricity are the concise and comprehensive figures of merit of this study. An exhaustive effort has been made in order to achieve a well-founded comparison between concentrated solar power plants with equivalent storage system designs in terms of capacity factor and performance. Finally, this research demonstrates that the thermocline hybrid TES system provides a reliable cost effective storage solution that achieves the same Levelized Cost of Electricity as state-of-the-art technology. This is achieved due to the competitive price of the steelmaking slag pebbles versus molten salts, a revalorized processed steel by-product waste from the metallurgical industry used as packed-bed solid filler material for thermocline tanks. The results of this research open an attractive potential for cost reduction in the concentrated solar power sector, a key competitive value for a new market opportunity.

TI Performance analysis of a thermal energy storage system based on paired
   metal hydrides for concentrating solar power plants
SO APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING
AB Concentrating solar power (CSP) plants require suitable thermal energy storage (TES) systems to enable power generation during the night and cloudy days. Metal hydrides (MH) are attractive options for such TES system and a novel design of an MH-TES system is proposed for CSP plants. A 2D mathematical model is developed to study heat and mass transfer inside this system in which a heat storage medium of high-temperature MH bed (Mg2FeH6) is coupled with a low-temperature MH bed (Na(3)AIH(6)). To simulate this model a numerical code in Fortran-90 is made. The main objective of this work is (i) to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the novel MH-TES system through the simulation of operating cycles, and (ii) to discuss the performance assessment of the proposed system. The process simulation demonstrated a consistent thermal and dynamic coupling between the paired MH beds. The performance analysis showed that the present MH-TES system can recover 96% of solar energy stored. Further, for the given operating conditions, the thermal energy storage density of this system is about 90 kWh(th)/m(3), which is more than 3.6 times the U.S. Department of Energy SunShot target of 25 kWh(th)/m(3).

TI Comprehensive regionalization and potential water crisis for solar power
   development in arid and semi-arid regions of northwest China
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Large-scale water scarcity and geo-environment disparity in arid and semiarid regions of northwest China may be the limitations of ambitious solar energy development. This study quantified water-energy conflict for photovoltaic (PV) and concentrated solar power (CSP) both in China and in this region, and assessed development suitability of solar power at municipal level. The results show that arid provinces faced intense water-energy conflict, 22.8 and 22.9 times higher than humid provinces for PV and CSP respectively. Enormous spatial differences in water-energy conflict existed in the region (PV, 1.5-655.5; CSP, 2.2-1099.0). Considering both waterenergy conflict and geo-environment, the region was divided into development zone (including water-surplus and water-deficit subzone) and limited zone. It is indicated that 58.6-66.4% of northwest China need to increase available water resources to meet demands for future solar energy development. This research perspective that solar power development should focus on water constraints in northwest China, together with zoning methodology outlined in this study, could provide a valuable reference for its development in arid regions or countries globally.

TI Optimal power peak shaving using hydropower to complement wind and solar
   power uncertainty
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB Booming renewable energy development, such as wind and solar power, with their intermittency and uncertainty characteristics, pose challenges for power grid dispatching, especially for power grid peak shaving. In this paper, coordinated operation of hydropower and renewable energy in a provincial power grid is explored to alleviate fluctuation and aid peak shaving. Considering their aggregate effect, this study aggregates wind power plants and solar power plants into a virtual wind power plant and a virtual solar power plant, respectively, and the forecasted error distribution of wind and solar power is analyzed with kernel density estimation. Then, based on the principles of using hydropower to compensate for fluctuating wind and solar power, a day ahead peak shaving model with the objective of minimizing residual load peak-valley difference is built, which introduces chance constraints for forecast errors and coordinate hydropower operation with wind and solar power. To simplify the solution, the proposed model is recast as a successive linear programming problem. Day-ahead scheduling case studies of a provincial power grid system indicate that the proposed model can conduct peak shaving effectively, hydropower can compensate wind and solar power fluctuation, improve the stability of combined output, and make better use of renewable energy. Therefore, this study provides an alternative approach for peak shaving operation of power system with hydropower and increasing integration of wind and solar power in China and other places worldwide.

AB Accurate solar power forecasting greatly influences the planning processes undertaken in operation centres of energy providers that relate to actual solar power generation, distribution, system maintenance and pricing. This paper compares the performance of three networks, namely single shrouded layer feed-forward neural network (SLFN), random weight single shrouded layer feed-forward neural network (RWSLFN) and random vector functional link (RVFL) network on the solar power data of Sydney, Australia, of the year 2015 for day and week ahead solar power forecasting. We show that the introduced scheme may adequately learn hidden patterns and accurately determine the solar power forecast by utilizing a range of heterogeneous sources of input that relate not necessarily with the measurement of solar power itself but also other parameters such as effects of temperature, humidity, time and wind speed. The effect of input-output connections is studied, and it is found out that RWSLFN with direct input-output connections also known as RVFL performs better than other RWSLFNs and SLFNs.

AB Increasing level of wind power integration imposes challenges on the power grid due to the variable and intermittent characteristics of the wind resources. Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plant with low-cost Thermal Energy Storage, is schedulable and controllable, and therefore is an ideal technology to hybridize with wind resources for generation smoothing. Furthermore, an Electric Heater, which converts redundant wind power into thermal energy, can be coupled with CSP plants to both reduce wind curtailment and provide more operational flexibility into power systems. Thus, this paper proposes a new hybrid power generation system integrating wind resources and CSP with an Electric Heater. A mixed-integer linear programming model is established to maximize the daily profit of the hybrid system. In this work, the effects of Electric Heater on the system considering different weather conditions are studied. The results show that the system proposed can effectively mitigate the wind power fluctuation, reduce the wind curtailment, and increase the power dispatchability of the hybrid system.

TI An Ensemble Neural Network Based on Variational Mode Decomposition and
   an Improved Sparrow Search Algorithm for Wind and Solar Power
   Forecasting
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Accurate forecasting methods for wind and solar power are important for power systems because of their potential to improve the economic and environmental performance. For this purpose, an ensemble neural network framework composed of LSTM, SVM, BP neural network, and ELM is proposed for wind and solar power forecasting in China. Three common methods for improving the prediction accuracy were adopted. First, unstable wind and solar power time series are decomposed into smooth subsequences by VMD, which reduces the undesirable effects caused by the volatility of the original series. Then, based on the decomposed subsequences, four basic models that are optimized based on the EOSSA algorithm are used to forecast wind and solar power. Finally, the prediction results of ENN were reconstructed by weighting the prediction results of the four models. The proposed ENN model was compared to nine state-of-the-art prediction models for wind and solar power forecasting. The results showed that the ENN model had the lowest MAPE, MAE, MSE, and RMSE for both wind and solar power forecasting. These comparison results also show that the ENN model not only has the best prediction accuracy, but also the most reliable prediction performance.

AB Solar energy holds the key for future electric power generation providing sustainable development to meet the requirement for long lasting demand in the future. As exhaustible sources are depleting constantly, we need to focus on non-exhaustible sources. The prediction of solar power output is critical to plan for the future operations and integrating the power grid with renewable sources. In this study, a dataset of climatic parameters that is, beam (direct) irradiance, diffuse irradiance, reflected irradiance, sun height, air temperature and wind speed for five years is used to predict the solar power output based on photovoltaic technology of Indore region (27.2046 degrees N, 77.4977 degrees E). The performance of the trained models is determined using statistical (mathematical) indicators. Amongst the machine learning algorithms, the best accuracy of 98% is achieved by random forest method for the prediction of solar power output for Indore region.

TI Probabilistic prediction of solar power supply to distribution networks,
   using forecasts of global horizontal irradiation
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB This paper presents a mathematical model for the prediction of the probabilities of reverse power flow exceeding predefined critical thresholds at feed-in points of a distribution network. The parametric prediction model is based on hourly forecasts of global horizontal irradiation and uses copulas, a tool for modeling the joint probability distribution of two or more strongly correlated random variables with non-Gaussian (marginal) distributions. The model is used for determining the joint distribution of forecasts of global horizontal irradiation and measured solar power supply at given feed-in points, where respective sample datasets were provided by Deutscher Wetterdienst and the N-ERGIE Netz GmbH. It is shown that the fitted model replicates important characteristics of the data such as the corresponding marginal densities. The validation results highlight strong performance of the proposed model. The copula-based model enables to predict the distribution of solar power supply conditioned on the forecasts of global horizontal irradiation, thus anticipating great fluctuations in the distribution network.

A multi-agent control strategy based on JADE development tools is designed in order to achieve energy management for independent DC micro-grid. The hybrid simulation studies, which are combined JADE with MATLAB/Simulink/Powersystem are carried out to verify the correctness of proposed control strategy. The results indicate that the control method by means of multi-agent can reasonably regulated energy flow at different weather conditions and load. Therefore, the suggested coordinated control method with multi-agent can ensure independent DC micro-grid with wind solar power optimizing operation.

TI Development of Molten Salt Heat Transfer Fluid With Low Melting Point
   and High Thermal Stability
SO JOURNAL OF SOLAR ENERGY ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
AB This paper describes an advanced heat transfer fluid (HTF) consisting of a novel mixture of inorganic salts with a low melting point and high thermal stability. These properties produce a broad operating range molten salt and enable effective thermal storage for parabolic trough concentrating solar power plants. Previous commercially available molten salt heat transfer fluids have a high melting point, typically 140 degrees C or higher, which limits their commercial use due to the risk of freezing. The advanced HTF embodies a novel composition of materials, consisting of a mixture of nitrate salts of lithium, sodium, potassium, cesium, and calcium. This unique mixture exploits eutectic behavior resulting in a low melting point of 65 degrees C and a thermal stability limit over 500 degrees C. The advanced HTF described in this work was developed using advanced experiment design and data analysis methods combined with a powerful high throughput experimental workflow. Over 5000 unique mixtures of inorganic salt were tested during the development process. Additional work is ongoing to fully characterize the relevant thermophysical properties of the HTF and to assess its long term performance in realistic operating conditions for concentrating solar power applications or other high temperature processes.

TI Contentious eye-catchers: Perceptions of landscapes changed by solar
   power plants in Slovenia
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB While renewable energy sources enjoy high public support, projects are rarely implemented without opposition. The term energy landscapes indicates that landscape change is amongst the most frequent issues. This study researched lay people's perceptions of landscapes changed by solar power plants. The first objective was to discover how likely solar power plants are to be noticed in the landscape. The second objective was to determine the associations observers make when spotting a solar power plant. The data was collected by participatory photography and focus groups. Participants visited six solar power plants. The results show that they are highly noticeable and contentious objects. Participants who understood the landscape as a rural idyll disapproved of solar power plants, while for those who perceived the landscape through a utilitarian narrative, the (mis)fit of the solar power plant depended on its relation to the surrounding landscape structure. Landscape degradation was contrasted with low-carbon energy and developmental benefits. The results provide evidence on the interdependence of visual and non-visual factors and suggest improvements in planning and design of solar power plants. While the method gives a rich in-depth insight into landscape perception, it is also context dependent and needs further research to obtain more generalisable results. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Impacts of different wind and solar power penetrations on cascade
   hydroplants operation
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB The changing energy mix under the integration of wind and solar power widens the load peak-valley difference of the power grid and poses great challenges in power grid operation, especially for peak shaving. Hydropower has a crucial role to play in enabling the integration of more variable renewables. To explore a reasonable approach for the changing roles of hydropower and the development of wind and solar power in response to energy transition, a long-term typical daily aggregate model is developed for hydro-wind-solar power with peak shaving operation. Scenarios of integrated wind and solar power proportions under increasing penetrations are simulated by incrementally increasing the installed wind and solar power capacity. The model is converted to a mixed integer linear programming formulation. Groups of numerical experiments divided by influencing factors are used to analyze the complementary influence and optimization mechanisms. The results demonstrate that (1) the proposed model decouples hydro-wind-solar sources at temporal scales and conducts peak shaving effectively. (2) Different scales of wind and solar power have notable impacts on both long-term and short-term hydropower operation. (3) Developing wind and solar power in reasonable proportions could effectively utilize the complementarity and reduce hydropower output fluctuations on different time scales. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The article provides a description of a simulation model of a solar power station with an automated dual-axis solar tracker, which was developed using MATLAB/Simulink. The presented development includes a random weather generator (intensity of solar radiation), automated load redundancy, and also simultaneous use of two types of solar cells such as monocrystalline and polycrystalline. This paper presents the results of modeling, which prove the effectiveness of the application of solar modules with a dual-axis solar tracker in comparison with statically located modules. In addition, on the basis of the conducted analysis of the modeling solar power station work in MATLAB/Simulink optimum operating conditions of a photovoltaic plant have been identified. The developed model will allow for researching the characteristics of a solar power plant and predicting the amount of energy generated by solar panels in a specific place.

TI Dynamic analysis of the German day-ahead electricity spot market
SO ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB This paper analyzes the dynamic behavior of day-ahead spot prices in the German electricity spot market due to positive structural shocks in wind and solar power. It uses a dynamic structural vector autoregressive model to estimate the related structural impulse response functions. The estimates suggest that wind power shocks have a more prolonged negative effect on spot prices than solar power shocks. Significant autocorrelations of wind power for larger lags indicate these results. The total negative merit order effect of a solar power shock is larger when using a reasonable model specification. One reason might be that solar power shocks coincide with demand peaks. However, results regarding the relation of the effects of wind and solar should be dealt with carefully because these results do not hold for all specifications. Past static estimates show differences in the total average negative merit order effects. These estimates might be overstated if wind and solar power dynamics are transferred to the merit order effects. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
AB Packed bed thermocline heat storage is a promising thermal energy storage alternative to molten salt storage in concentrating solar power plants. Such technology opens the way for using worldwide available materials such as natural rocks and some industrial residues. Packed bed thermocline is highly interesting for small scale plants using medium grade heat as well as for large heat consuming industries and has a potential of increasing the local content of future solar power projects in Morocco and other neighboring countries. In this paper, two packed bed thermocline storage systems are proposed based on the sensible and latent heat storage approaches. A numerical study of both systems is carried out to assess their performance in terms of storage capacity, output stability, and charge/discharge efficiency for a potential pilot application. The target facility is an experimental 1 MWe concentrating solar power with organic Rankine cycle plant at the research platform Green Energy Park in Morocco.

TI A Review on CSP and CPVT Technologies: Energy, Economic Analysis and
   Recycling towards Circular Economy
SO ECS JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Recently, there has been a shift towards renewable energy sources for electricity generation due to rapidly depleting non-renewable energy sources. Solar energy is generally the most promising renewable energy source to be harvested by concentrated solar power (CSP) and solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies. CSP technology can be further classified into a few categories, such as parabolic trough collector (PTC), solar power tower (SPT), linear Fresnel reflector (LFR), and solar parabolic dish (SPD). In contrast, solar PV can be further developed into concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) and concentrated photovoltaic thermal (CPVT) systems. The modifications (e.g. optical and thermal modifications) done on PTC and parabolic trough based CPVT systems on enhancing system performance were also discussed. Next, the economic analyses conducted for both systems were also discussed to compare the economic feasibility of the technologies employed in different countries. The appropriate recycling and CE approaches applied for PTC and PV technologies were also reviewed and classified based on the key material elements within this industry. Overall, this paper compared PTC and parabolic trough-based CPVT systems from the technical, economic, and environmental aspects to provide insight for the solar energy harvesting field researchers.

Recent growth in the use of photovoltaic (PV) technology has demonstrated the potential of solar power to deliver on a large scale. Whilst the dominant PV technology is based on crystalline silicon, a wide variety of alternative PV materials and device concepts have been explored in an attempt to decrease the cost of the photovoltaic electricity. This article explores the potential for such emerging technologies to deliver cost reductions, scalability of manufacture, rapid carbon mitigation and new science in order to accelerate the uptake of solar power technologies.

TI Deep Belief Network with Seasonal Decomposition for Solar Power Output
   Forecasting
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RELIABILITY QUALITY AND SAFETY ENGINEERING
AB Solar power is a type of renewable energy system that uses solar energy to produce electricity, and is regarded as one of the most important power sources in Taiwan. Since sunshine duration affects the amount of energy that can be generated by a solar power, the seasons of the year are important factors that should be considered for accurate solar power prediction. In the last decade, the use of artificial intelligence for forecasting systems have been quite popular, and the deep belief network (DBN) models started getting more attention. In this study, a seasonal deep belief network (SDBN) was developed to forecast monthly solar power output data. The SDBN was constructed by combining seasonal decomposition method and DBN. Further, this study used monthly solar power output data from the Taiwan Power Company. The results indicated that the proposed forecasting system demonstrated a superior performance in terms of forecasting accuracy. Also, the performance of autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), generalized regression neural network (GRNN), and DBN obtained from a separate study were compared to the performance of the proposed SDBN model and showed that the latter was better than the other three models. Thus, the SDBN model can be used as an alternative method for monthly solar power output data forecasting.

AB Nowadays, the solar power systems are quickly developing in many countries to replace the fossil power sources and mitigate the environment pollution. The working efficiency of the power conditioner system in the solar power system is not high because the energy supply from solar array depends on the weather. The utilization rate of the power conditioner system can be increased by supplementing the small wind turbine to the existent grid-tied solar power system with the support of the control system to imitate characteristic of the solar panel. In this research, we analyze the power converter circuit of the photovoltaic (PV) cell emulating system and present study results of operation of this system in series connection mode under the different levels of solar irradiation.

A field of parabolic collectors focus the solar radiation onto a tube where oil is pumped through in order to collect the solar power. The control problem is to keep the temperature of the oil leaving the field at its desired value by manipulating the oil pump flow rate. It is shown that gain-scheduling can effectively handle the plant nonlinearities, using high-order local linear ARX models that form the basis for the design of local linear controllers using pole placement.

SE Woodhead Publishing Series in Energy
AB The integration of thermal energy storage systems enables concentrating solar power (CSP) plants to provide dispatchable electricity. The adaptation of storage systems both to the solar energy receiver system and the power cycle of the plant is essential. Three different physical processes can be applied for energy storage: sensible heat storage in solid or liquid media, latent heat storage using phase change material and thermochemical energy storage. This chapter gives an overview of the various technical concepts developed for thermal energy storage in CSP plants and describes their states of development, their potentials for use and their performances.

TI Large-Scale Storage of Concentrated Solar Power from Industrial Waste
SO ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB Deep penetration of renewable energies into the grid relies on the development of large-scale energy storage technologies using cheap, abundant, and nontoxic materials. Concentrated solar power (CSP) is particularly suitable to massively store thermal energy for dispatchable electricity generation. This is currently accomplished in a few demonstration plants by using molten salts albeit in a not competitive way yet. Process simulation studies indicate that thermochemical energy storage of CSP by means of the calcium looping (CaL) technology would reduce the cost of storage and increase the flexibility of energy supply provided that widely available and cheap CaO precursors with high and stable multicycle activity are used. In this work, we investigate the behavior of calcium rich steel slag at CaL conditions that would expectedly maximize the efficiency of CSP energy storage and power production. When treated with acetic acid, this nontoxic widely abundant waste yields a CaO rich solid with stable conversion near 0.8 over successive carbonation/calcination cycles at these CaL conditions.

AB Solar Energy purvey a pure Environment-friendly, ample and everlasting energy resource to humanity. Electricity can be generated using solar energy by two different technologies namely photovoltaic (PV) and concentrated solar power (CSP) systems. By using thermal energy storage technologies, CSP systems can store energy to generate electric power on cloudy days or overnight as compared to PV systems which results in flexibility in power network. Most important issue in energy market is the competitive cost of energy. Energy price of PV plant is less as compared to CSP plants. Whereas, CSP systems with thermal Energy storage capabilities can be effectively used to overcome intermittency issues of PV systems to balance demand with the supply of Electric power within safe levels of reliability by optimizing the Energy produced. This paper try to figure out the possible ways to optimize power and energy produced by Solar Energy technologies to reduce Carbon footprint. In addition to that, Solar PV and CSP systems are compared at two locations of tropical country India and simulations has been done in System Advisor Model (SAM) and presented graphically.

TI Potential Map for the Installation of Concentrated Solar Power Towers in
   Chile
SO ENERGIES
AB This study aims to build a potential map for the installation of a central receiver concentrated solar power plant in Chile under the terms of the average net present cost of electricity generation during its lifetime. This is also called the levelized cost of electricity, which is a function of electricity production, capital costs, operational costs and financial parameters. The electricity production, capital and operational costs were defined as a function of the location through the Chilean territory. Solar resources and atmospheric conditions for each site were determined. A 130 MWe concentrated solar power plant was modeled to estimate annual electricity production for each site. The capital and operational costs were identified as a function of location. The electricity supplied by the power plant was tested, quantifying the potential of the solar resources, as well as technical and economic variables. The results reveal areas with great potential for the development of large-scale central receiver concentrated solar power plants, therefore accomplishing a low levelized cost of energy. The best zone is located among the Arica and Parinacota region and the northern part of the Coquimbo region, which shows an average cost of 89 USD/MWh, with a minimum of 76 USD/MWh near Copiapo.

AB A solar-powered unmanned seaplane is proposed as a new strategy to avoid the challenges faced in a long nonstop solar-powered flight, and is especially designed for sea surveillance mission, like resource exploration, environmental monitoring, and observation of animal migration. A preliminary design of the solar-powered unmanned seaplane is carried out while its flight performance is analyzed later. The conceptual design of a twin-tail boom with large aspect ratio wings and buoyancy system is put forward. Aerodynamic loading of the wings is analyzed and determined by computational fluid dynamics. The energy balance models of the proposed seaplane system are created for the periods that the seaplane moors on the sea to harvest solar energy and flies in the sky to perform the mission. The parameter effects, such as wing loading, takeoff time, weight, cruise speed, takeoff ground distance, takeoff ground time, flight envelope, and endurance are discussed. The energy balance models shows that the proposed solar-powered seaplane can perform the sea surveillance mission at an altitude of around 8 km for months and seasons between latitude 60 degrees N and 60 degrees S.

TI Is off-grid residential solar power inclusive? Solar power adoption,
   energy poverty, and social inequality in India
SO ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB With India's soaring energy demand and inadequate access to grid electricity in rural areas, off-grid solar power is a potential alternative for tackling India's energy poverty and inequality. However, little knowledge exists on: (1) the spatio-temporal pattern of solar power adoption by the residential sector in rural areas of India, (2) the extent to which solar power has alleviated (a) energy poverty, and (b) energy access inequality. Using panel data from approximately 9000 rural residents in six energy-poor Indian states, we compare the solar power adoption rate across states over time (2015 and 2018), examine the contribution of solar power for alleviating energy poverty, and identify socio-economic characteristics of adopters. The average solar energy adoption rate was nine percent in 2018, five percentage points higher than in 2015, with the highest adoption rate in Bihar, followed by Uttar Pradesh and Odisha. This growth was driven primarily by solar lantern uptake, with the use of solar home systems only growing by less than one percentage point. Solar energy adoption significantly contributed to energy poverty alleviation but was limited to improving illumination. Solar home system adoption improved the use of electronic appliances among adopters but did not significantly increase radio/television use. Solar power played a limited role in energy inequality alleviation. Lower caste, poor households, and day laborers are less likely to adopt solar power and less aware of the availability of solar power as a residential energy source than higher caste, non-poor households, and self-employed farmers, traders, and salaried employees.

TI Joint Probability Distribution and Correlation Analysis of Wind and
   Solar Power Forecast Errors in the Western Interconnection
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY ENGINEERING
AB Wind and solar power generation differ from conventional power generation because of the variable and uncertain nature of their power output. This can have significant impacts on grid operations. Short-term forecasting of wind and solar power generation is uniquely helpful for planning the balance of supply and demand in the electric power system because it allows for a reduction in the uncertainty associated with their output. As a step toward assessing the simultaneous integration of large amounts of wind and solar power, this article investigates the spatial and temporal correlation between wind and solar power forecast errors. The forecast and actual data analyzed are obtained from one of the world's largest regional variable generation integration studies to date. Multiple spatial and temporal scales (day ahead, 4h ahead, and 1h ahead) of forecast errors for the Western Interconnection in the United States are analyzed. A joint probability distribution of wind and solar power forecast errors is estimated using kernel density estimation. The Pearson's correlation coefficient and mutual information between wind and solar power forecast errors are also evaluated. The results show that wind and solar power forecast errors are inversely correlated, and the correlation between wind and solar power forecast errors becomes stronger as the geographic size of the analyzed region increases. The absolute value of the correlation coefficient is generally less than 0.1 in the case of small geographic regions, while it is generally between 0.15 and 0.6 in the case of large geographic regions. The forecast errors are less correlated on the day-ahead timescale, which influences economic operations more than reliability, and more correlated on the 4-h-ahead timescale, where reliability is more impacted by the forecasts. It is also found that the correlation between wind and solar power forecast errors in summer (July) is relatively stronger than in winter (January). The inverse correlation implies that in systems with high penetrations of both wind and solar power, reserves that are held to accommodate the variability of wind or solar power can be at least partially shared. In addition, interesting results are found through time and seasonal variation analyses of wind and solar power forecast errors, and these insights may be uniquely useful to operators who maintain the reliability of the electric power system.

TI Variability of wind and solar power An assessment of the current
   situation in the European Union based on the year 2014
SO ENERGY
AB The growth of wind and solar power in the EU (European Union) poses several challenges for its integration in the electricity system like short-term balancing, back-up power and overproduction. The present study quantifies the current variations and production characteristics of wind and solar power based on measured time series of the year 2014, collected from the EU transmission system operators. The data is covering 90.1% of wind power production and 86.0% of solar power production with a time resolution of 15 min in most cases. A significant smoothing effect due to geographical spreading is observed for wind power production in the EU with a base-load share of 4% of installed capacity and even 9% during winter season. Wind power shows high peak values of short-term variations on a national level while on an EU level, variations are below 3% of installed capacity per 15 min. The maximum coverage of load by wind and solar power was 32% for the EU while in Denmark overproduction already occurred with a temporal share of 119% of load. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Improving the accuracy of solar power forecasting is becoming important as the development of this type of energy tends to increase sharply in the coming years. Forecasting solar power, especially rooftop solar power still faces many difficulties due to its dependence on solar radiation and other weather parameters. To deal with this problem and increase the forecasting performance, in this paper, a hybrid model was developed for short-term rooftop solar power forecasting. The developed hybrid model firstly omitted the white noise time series from the original dataset using the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) method and the remainder of the dataset was the input of the forecasting model using Bidirectional Long short-term memory (BiLSTM). Then, particle swarm optimization (PSO) was employed to optimize kernel parameters and weighted coefficients in the forecasting model. To demonstrate the forecasting performance, the proposed method was applied to forecast the rooftop solar power in Ha Bao, Lam Dong city, Vietnam and compared with 3 other models. Four evaluation metrics namely RMSE, n-RMSE, sMAPE and MAE showed that the proposed model outperformed the compared models, thus, the proposed PSO-CEEMDAN-BiLSTM was an effective method for short-term rooftop solar power forecasting.

TI Optimal configuration and operation of the regional integrated energy
   system considering carbon emission and integrated demand response
SO FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH
AB Under the "carbon peaking and carbon neutrality" development strategy, in order to suppress load fluctuations and promote renewable energy consumptions in the regional integrated energy system involving concentrating solar power stations, a double-layer optimization model based on the improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is proposed. The upper layer completes the capacity configuration process based on multiple objectives to minimize the annual planning cost and the net emission of pollutants. The lower layer is designed to minimize the annual operating cost and optimize the output of the devices and the load curves through the participation of the integrated demand response process for flexible loads and the whole process of carbon emission including carbon capture, carbon utilization, and carbon trading mechanisms to obtain the best operating plan. The final results indicate that the participation of concentrating solar power stations can improve the level of coordinated optimization, and the improved NSGA-II is stronger than the conventional one in convergence ability. Besides, considering the whole process of carbon emission and integrated demand response is capable of decreasing the annual operating cost and net carbon emission to improve the economy and environmental protection of the system significantly.

TI Risk-constrained optimal scheduling with combining heat and power for
   concentrating solar power plants
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB Concentrating Solar Power (CSP), a schedulable renewable energy technology, realizes the conversion of "solar-heat-electric". The benefits from the thermal energy storage (TES) and its potential for heating need to be explored. In desert areas with low population density and relatively concentrated industrial loads, a CSP plant equipped with back-pressure turbines (BT) as generators can use waste heat from power generation to supply heat, which effectively improves the energy production efficiency of CSP plants. Thus, a combined heat and power scheduling model for CSP plants to participate in heating is established in this paper. In order to cope with the uncertain parameters of the model, the information gap decision theory (IGDT) is introduced to describe them. IGDT can draw on the risk-seeker strategy and risk-averse strategy to deal with the uncertainty, and thus provide a reasonable decision basis for the scheduling operation. In addition, we ensure that the storage cycling of CSP plants is energy neutral, which could allow the plant to optimize its output for multiple consecutive days to meet demands. Finally, the model is verified to ensure that the predefined profit level could be achieved and the corresponding scheduling strategy under different operational risk is obtained.

TI The impacts of generation efficiency and economic performance on the
   solar power generation and storage scale: An empirical analysis of 20
   countries
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS
AB The influence of renewable energy's generation efficiency and productivity changes on the economy has become an important topic. By reviewing previous literature, it can be found that there are rare discussions about renewable power in strategic emerging industries and the economic impact of renewable power generation. To fill the gap of the previous studies, this paper takes solar power generation as the research object and analyzes the influence of solar power generation efficiency on economy. This paper empirically collects data of 20 countries from 2010 to 2016 to discuss the influence of solar power generation efficiency and economic performance on the scale of solar power generation in each country. The empirical results show that when a country's solar power generation efficiency increases, the solar generation scale of the country will increase, indicate that the efficiency of solar power generation has a significant positive influence on the scale of solar power generation. Besides, it also concomitantly has the benefit of boosting the growth of solar power storage in the country. In other words, when the production efficiency of renewable energy is improved, it can effectively promote the development of energy storage and bring benefits for sustainable development.

TI Cross-border concentrated solar power projects-opportunity or dead end?
   A study into actor views in Europe
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB Cross-border renewable energy projects (in particular those based on concentrated solar power (CSP)) could play an important role in the future EU energy systems. Be it by contributing to enhanced energy security, improving the management of the energy system or meeting the EU renewable energy target in a cost-effective manner. However, despite the expected benefits associated with the use of cooperation mechanisms set up under the Renewable Energy Directive, several barriers and, possibly, lack of active support have prevented a wide use of these mechanisms among Member States. This paper explores whether social acceptance, or lack thereof, can explain some of this lag in development. Collecting actor views on CSP cooperation mechanisms between EU Member States forms the basis of this analysis. The empirical basis consists of 43 interviews from Spain as a potential host for and Germany and the Netherlands as potential consumers of renewable energy (off-taker countries). The data analysis outlines that overall CSP cooperation mechanisms are seen positively; however, the complexity of implementation, heterogeneity of actor views, as well as high costs for CSP are perceived as downsides. Thus, overall, a societal impetus is missing and interest in further development seems limited.

TI Concentrated solar power plants: A critical review of regional dynamics
   and operational parameters
SO ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB Paper presents a regionally segregated overview of the globally distributed operational Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants. A holistic approach was followed by dividing the global map into 5 different regions (Americas, Africa, Europe, Asia and Australia) by covering 112 currently operational CSP plants. The objective of the research methodology used is to enable concerned regional developers to study the local trend followed in brief and compare the same with the trend followed in other regions. Region 3 (Europe) generates 6338.33 GWh/yr of electricity and accommodates more than 50% of globally operational CSP plants. Parabolic trough/Thermal oil is the most preferred combination of CSP technology/Heat Transfer Fluid (HTF) and is used in 46 plants globally. Region 5 (Australia) produces the lowest annual electricity generation of 3900 MWh/yr but still holds great potential for numerous upcoming plants. Annual electricity generation of plants when plotted with area occupied displayed a linear trend for all the regions. Linear pattern observed also included 2-3 outliers indicating significant under or over performance of specific sites. Regional distribution enables a modular study and analysis, aiding future research and development in solar thermal energy. Accumulated information and data presented serve as a brief guide reducing the gap between social structures and latest technological advancements.

TI Electricity generation costs of concentrated solar power technologies in
   China based on operational plants
SO ENERGY
AB Recent years witnessed a sharp increase of CSP (concentrated solar power) plants around the world. CSP is currently at its early stage in China, with several demonstration and utility-scale plants underway. China's rising electricity demand, the severe environmental pollution from coal-fired power plants, and favorable renewable energy policies are expected to result in a large-scale CSP deployment in the next years. Detailed CSP studies for China are however hardly available. To fill this knowledge gap, this study collects plant-specific data in a national CSP database in collaboration with local CSP experts. On this basis, this study analyzes and benchmarks the costs of parabolic trough CSP, tower CSP, and dish CSP technologies in China by applying an LCOE (levelized cost of electricity) model. The current LCOE for the different CSP plants falls in a range of 1.2-2.7 RMB/kWh (0.19-0.43 US$/kWh). Among the three CSP technology variants discussed, our sensitivity analysis indicates that the tower CSP variant might have the greatest potential in China. We expect a future cost reduction potential of more than 50% in 2020 and a high share of local content manufacturing for tower CSP. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We propose EN-meta, a meta-learning ensemble of neural networks where the meta-learners are trained to predict the errors of the ensemble members for the new day, and these errors are used to dynamically weight the contribution of the ensemble members in the final prediction. We evaluate the performance of EN-meta on Australian solar data for two years and compare its accuracy with state-of-the-art single models, classical ensemble methods and EN-meta versions without the meta-learning component. The results showed that EN-meta was the most accurate method and thus highlight the potential benefit of using meta-learning for solar power forecasting.

TI The non-operating solar projects: Examining the impact of the feed-in
   tariff amendment in Japan
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB The non-operating solar power projects indicate a large gap between the operating and approved solar capacity in Japan. The country amended the feed-in tariff (FIT) law in 2017 to address this issue. This empirical study investigates the impact of the amended FIT policy on non-operating solar projects using municipality-level panel data from 2014 to 2019. We find that the amended policy improved the relationship between the approved capacity and operating capacity of solar power projects. The impacts are heterogeneous across different sizes of solar power projects: they are more substantial in large-and mega-scale solar power projects than in small-scale ones. To explore the determinants of non-operation, we also apply a cross-sectional analysis to identify municipal characteristics related to non-operating capacity. The results indicate that non-operating projects are located in municipalities with higher construction costs. These findings shed light on how the revisions of existing policies could effectively support renewable energy and provide lessons for other countries or regions on designing a better energy policy.

TI Thermo-mechanical parametric analysis of packed-bed thermocline energy
   storage tanks
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB A packed-bed thermocline tank represents a proved cheaper thermal energy storage for concentrated solar power plants compared with the commonly-built two-tank system. However, its implementation has been stopped mainly due to the vessel's thermal ratcheting concern, which would compromise its structural integrity. In order to have a better understanding of the commercial viability of thermocline approach, regarding energetic effectiveness and structural reliability, a new numerical simulation platform has been developed. The model dynamically solves and couples all the significant components of the subsystem, being able to evaluate its thermal and mechanical response over plant normal operation. The filler material is considered as a cohesionless bulk solid with thermal expansion. For the stresses on the tank wall the general thermoelastic theory is used. First, the numerical model is validated with the Solar One thermocline case, and then a parametric analysis is carried out by settling this storage technology in two real plants with a temperature rise of 100 degrees C and 275 degrees C. The numerical results show a better storage performance together with the lowest temperature difference, but both options achieve suitable structural factors of safety with a proper design.

TI MoS2-based nanofluids as heat transfer fluid in parabolic trough
   collector technology
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB Concentrating solar power is becoming one of options for producing energy to replace conventional polluting energy sources. However, improving the efficiency and reducing the cost of technologies based on this type of energy to make it more competitive is still a work in progress. This study proposes replacing the thermal oil used as the heat transfer fluid in the absorber tubes of parabolic trough solar collectors (PTCs) with nanofluids based on spherical molybdenum disulphide nanoparticles with the aim of improving the thermal efficiency of concentrating solar power plants. The colloidal stability of the nanofluids was verified by Ultraviolet-Visible spectroscopy, Zeta potential and Dynamic Light Scattering monitoring. The presence of spherical MoS2 nanoparticles resulted in an increase of up to 13% in specific isobaric heat and 6% in thermal conductivity compared to thermal oil. Finally, the efficiency of parabolic trough solar collectors was estimated to increase by 5%, which also favours the decrease of pumping power and the elimination of selective coatings on the absorber tube. To our knowledge, this is the first time that MoS2-based nanofluids are tested as heat transfer fluids in PTCs analysing its implementation in the solar energy application.

TI Concentrated solar power in India: current status, challenges and future
   outlook
SO CURRENT SCIENCE
AB India is blessed with good solar resources and many regions of the country receive above-average sunshine compared to other regions of the world. The primary technology used for harnessing and converting solar energy into electrical energy in India is based on photovoltaic (PV) cells. Concentrated solar power (CSP) has hardly contributed to the overall installed solar power capacity in the country. In this article, some of the challenges that have inhibited the growth of CSP are identified and possible solutions suggested. The critical challenges for CSP are related to the lack of reliable direct normal irradiance database, indigenous manufacturing and competition from PV. The results of a case study carried out to assess the impact of indigenous manufacturing and economies of scale on capital costs and levelized cost of electricity are presented. This study shows that even with indigenous manufacturing and considering economies of scale, the capital cost per MW (Megawatt) of installed capacity is higher than the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission benchmark costs. To initiate larger adoption of CSP in India, we may have to consider alternative configurations, such as coupling desalination or thermal cooling systems to a CSP power plant. The merits of such configurations, called poly-generation plants, are presented for the Indian scenario.

AB The large-scale introduction of natural energy being promoted worldwide in recent years leads to an increased impact of weather fluctuations on wholesale electricity prices. In markets where the introduction of solar power generation is rapidly progressing worldwide including Japan, hedging needs for revenue fluctuations in the solar power business have been expanding year by year. Therefore, this study proposes hedging strategies for the revenue of power generation companies that trade generated solar power through the wholesale electricity market, using a portfolio of derivatives whose underlying assets consist of fuel price, solar radiation, and temperature. We specifically propose a multilateral hedging method that applies multiple non-parametric regression methods such as tensor product spline function, ANOVA decomposition, and spline function with cross variable, and demonstrate the hedging effect using empirical data from the Japan Electric Power Exchange (JEPX).

SO SENSORS AND MATERIALS
AB In this study, five photodiode detectors are used to constitute a solar power sensor that can measure both the directly incident and undisciplined power of solar light. The solar power sensor is composed of four trapezoidal facets along with an upper rectangular facet formed on top to constitute a rectangular pyramid column sensor. On each facet, a photodiode sensor is implemented to collect solar light power coming from different orientations including the directly incident and undisciplined power. By applying a perpetual calendar to obtain the corresponding azimuth angle and elevation angle of sunlight, the collected power data of the five detectors are employed to estimate the maximum directly incident power and undisciplined power of solar light by simple geometric transformation. Therefore, the proposed rectangular pyramid column sensor can effectively provide the detailed solar power data including directly incident and undisciplined power.

The various power device components were highlighted, and the ones applicable to aircraft were analyzed, based on criteria as efficiency for photovoltaic cells; energy densities about rechargeable batteries; and maximum power point tracker on quick response to achieve maximum power point on I-V curve. Emerging technologies like photovoltaic cells, thin film cell, organic photovoltaic cell, multi-junction cell and silicon quantum dot cell, with the future potential of high efficiencies that can be used in solar-powered aircraft, were all examined. Regarding battery technology, Lithium-air battery (Li-air) was reported as having great opportunities for high energy densities capable of improving the efficiency of the solar-powered aircraft, for the greater prospect of the aviation industry. The design of efficient power device for solar-powered aircraft application is proposed. Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) solar cells were used because of its high energy conversion efficiency of 30 to 40%. A smart and intelligent MPPT Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is chosen because of its efficiency in partial shading and fast response and speed. The Li-air rechargeable battery is proposed because of its theoretical energy density of 11680 Wh/Kg.

AB With the advancements of photovoltaic panels Solar power plants extend their grip further in the power system every day. It is necessary that these new power plants work together with classic power plants. In this paper the simultaneous operation of a solar power plant with a steam power plant in a power system has been considered. The solar power plant operates with incremental conductance maximum power point tracking (IncCon MPPT) with direct control which is implemented through a boost converter. The inverter of solar power plant is manipulated to perform active power filtering in addition to converting DC power to AC. A d-q reference frame controller is used to perform the active power filtering. The steam power plant is also uses a PSS to stabilize the power system and damp power transients. A metaheuristic method called smart line search teaching learning based optimization (SLS-TLBO) is used to optimize the PSS parameter. In this paper, it is shown that the simultaneous operation of solar power plant can enhance the performance of the power system.

TI Is Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) a feasible option for Sub-Saharan
   Africa?: Investigating the techno-economic feasibility of CSP in
   Tanzania
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB There is a noticeable shortage of solar energy related information in Sub-Saharan Africa, especially about Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) technology. The Tanzanian official generation expansion plan till 2040 showed high dependency on coal and gas fired power plants and a negligible role of renewables other than large hydropower. This study investigates the techno-economic feasibility of CSP technology in Tanzania, through modelling Parabolic Trough and Solar Tower CSP technologies using the System Advisor Model developed by the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Under debt interest rate of 7%, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for the modelled Solar Tower plants ranges from 11.6 to 12.5 (sic)/kWh while for the modelled Parabolic Trough plants ranges from 13.0 to 14.4 (sic)/kWh. The LCOE increases significantly from 14.4 it /kWh (at 7% debt interest rate, for government-led projects) to 25.9 (sic)/kWh (at 18% debt interest rate, for private investors-led projects). The study concludes that the feasibility of CSP in Tanzania is strongly dependent on the financing conditions. Policy mechanisms to de risk CSP projects' investment through accessing lower debt interest rate are required to ensure the competitiveness of CSP projects in the country. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The ability to efficiently and cost-effectively incorporate thermal energy storage (TES) systems is an important advantage of concentrating solar power (CSP) in comparison to other intermittent forms of renewable energy, such as wind or photovoltaics. As such, TES allows CSP plants to continue to provide electricity to the grid even at times when the resource (the sun) is not available, such as cloud transients or at night. Advanced power cycle systems with supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) as the working fluid provide high power conversion efficiency because of high temperatures attained, and less compression work and are being explored for integration with concentrating solar power plants. Currently, there is no cost-effective way to store energy at high temperatures (>565 degree Celsius). The present work analyzes the thermal performance of a novel, cost-effective thermal storage system based on elemental sulfur as the storage media. The analysis is based on a detailed system-level computational modeling of the complex conjugate heat transfer and fluid flow phenomena at multiple scales to provide a scientific basis for engineering, designing and optimizing the novel thermal storage system for transient operation. The validation of the computational model based on data from experiments and full-scale plant operation is also reported. Our studies have shown sulfur-based TES to be a promising candidate for high temperature CSP.

TI De-risking concentrated solar power in emerging markets: The role of
   policies and international finance institutions
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB Concentrated solar power (CSP) is a promising technology for low-carbon energy systems, as combined with thermal storage it can store solar energy as heat, and deliver power more flexibly and when most needed by the grid. However, its high cost prevents its rapid deployment and affects its affordability in emerging economies. International financial institutions (IFIs) have emerged as key players to enable CSP in emerging economies, especially when cooperating with national policymakers. Through the analysis of two CSP plants in India and Morocco where IFIs provided the lion's share of finance, this paper aims to assess the effectiveness of their support and estimate the impact of IFIs financing on electricity production costs and mobilization of private investments. The two case studies show that public financial institutions can play a leading role in reducing the cost of CSP support on public budgets by providing concessional loans in countries where public and/or private finance would be too expensive, or extending maturities where commercial investors are present but poorly suited for project finance. Finally, we show that, combined with competitive tariff setting mechanism (tenders and auctions), public financial support can also be a cost-effective tool to engage private investors in CSP.

TI A novel competitive swarm optimized RBF neural network model for
   short-term solar power generation forecasting
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
AB Solar power is an important renewable energy resource and acts as a major contributor to replacing fossil fuel generators and reducing carbon emissions. However, the intermittent power output due to the uncertain solar irradiance significantly challenges the economic integrations of solar generation within the existing power system, which calls for effective forecasting methods to improve the solar prediction accuracy. In this paper, a novel improved radial basis function neural network model is proposed and applied in forecasting the short-term solar power generation. A recent proposed meta-heuristic approach named competitive swarm optimization is adopted to train the non-linear and linear parameters of the radial basis function neural network model. The proposed model has been validated in nonlinear benchmark functions and then employed in forecasting the solar power generation of a real-world case study in the Netherlands. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed competitive swarm optimized radial basis function neural network model could obtain higher accuracy compared to other counterparts and thus provides a useful tool for solar power forecasting.

TI The near- to mid-term outlook for concentrating solar power: mostly
   cloudy, chance of sun
SO ENERGY SOURCES PART B-ECONOMICS PLANNING AND POLICY
AB The history of concentrating solar power (CSP) is characterized by a boom-bust pattern caused by policy support changes. Following the 2014-2016 bust phase, the combination of Chinese support and several low-cost projects triggered a new boom phase. We investigate the near- to mid-term cost, industry, market and policy outlook for the global CSP sector and show that CSP costs have decreased strongly and approach cost-competitiveness with new conventional generation. Industry has been strengthened through the entry of numerous new companies. However, the project pipeline is thin: no project broke ground in 2019 and only four projects are under construction in 2020. The only remaining large support scheme, in China, has been canceled. Without additional support soon creating a new market, the value chain may collapse and recent cost and technological advances may be undone. If policy support is renewed, however, the global CSP sector is prepared for a bright future.

AB This is the preliminary calculation about the potential of solar power from second-floor(+) houses along Hung Vuong Street, Hue city. Research team organized field trips to inventory the houses and areas, number of floors, sunshine direction of the house in accordance with its adjacent houses. We calculated the number of solar panels needed to install and the potential of solar power can be generated from each house from the second floor and more. Research team has chosen photovoltaic solar cell technology (PV) to calculate the actual solar power achieved. The calculated results of solar power reserves are 3GWh/year with an investment of 57 billion VND (not including inverter). This reserves can help to reduce 4.17 million tons of CO2, 19.08 million tons of nitrogen oxide, 0.06 million tons of sulfur dioxide, 3.12 million tons dust, 1.14 million tons of ash, 9.12 million m(3) of water and 2.55 million tons of coal annually, if the lifetime of the solar system is 25 years, the emissions will decrease significantly. This research shows that the potential for solar power conversion is feasible to address the green growth needs of the economy and climate protection in Thua Thien Hue province.

   CONCEPTUAL ISSUES, EMPIRICAL FINDINGS, AND USE, IN ENERGY MODELING
AB Learning effects in concentrating solar power (CSP) technology have been limited in the past decade due to a low deployment of CSP plants. The technology development suffered mainly from the consequences of a financial and regulatory stagnation in locations with reasonable direct normal irradiance availability as well as from the fast decrease in cost of the competing solar photovoltaic technology. Nevertheless, a learning rate of about 10% can be assumed. The benefit of integrated thermal storage in CSP should be valued in a future fully renewable energy system.

SO ENERGY POLICY
AB The paper presents a strategy for the market introduction of concentrating solar power (CSP) plants in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) that will not require considerable subsidization and will not constitute a significant burden for electricity consumers in the region. In the first section, the paper explains the need of MENA countries for sustainable supply of electricity and calculates the cost of electricity for a model case country. In the second part, the cost development of concentrating solar power plants is calculated on the basis of expectations for the expansion of CSP on a global level. After that, the challenges for the market introduction of CSP in MENA are explained. Finally, we present a strategy for the market introduction of CSP in MENA, removing the main barriers for financing and starting market introduction in the peak load and the medium load segment of power supply. The paper explains why long-term power purchase agreements (PPA) for CSP should be calculated on the basis of avoided costs, starting in the peak load segment. Such PPA are not yet available, the paper aims to convince policy makers to introduce them. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Depending on the design, carbon dioxide emissions are reduced by around 9% and equivalent annual costs are reduced by 21% - 26%, as compared to a base polygeneration configuration where cooling services are provided centrally by an absorption chiller without integrating a solar micro gas-turbine. Compared to the system where electricity is used as the main energy carrier a reduction of equivalent annual costs of up to 20% and a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions of up to 33.5% was achieved.

TI Analysis of the performance of concentrated solar power facilities using
   different thermal fluids
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH & DESIGN
AB A systematic comparison of the performance and economics of concentrated solar power plants using various heat transfer fluids including molten salts and synthetic fluids (Dowtherm A, Syltherm, HELISOL, Malotherm and Therminol VP1) is carried out. First, a process systems approach is used to determine the yield of the thermodynamic cycle using different thermal fluids, their operating conditions and the water consumption. Next, an economic evaluation is performed. For reference Almeria, to the South of Spain, is the location selected because of the high solar irradiance. The efficiency of the regenerative Rankine cycle increases with the maximum operating temperature. The average power pro-duction increases from 16 MW using Malotherm to 25 MW using the molten salts, while the water consumption decreases from 3.6 L/kWh to 2.1 L/kWh. A higher efficiency results in more competitive electricity prices that decrease from 0.21 epsilon /kWh (Malotherm) to 0.12 epsilon /kWh (molten salts) with the maximum operating temperature. Furthermore, the effect of the maximum temperature on power and water consumption are computed towards a pre-evaluation of novel fluids under development.

TI Analysis and optimization of concentrated solar power plant for
   application in arid climate
SO ENERGY SCIENCE & ENGINEERING
AB In this research study, the concentrated solar power (CSP) technology is reviewed for designing and optimizing a CSP tower plant for arid climate regions such as Qatar. A database for all CSP projects around the world is created, and a spreadsheet model for calculating the available solar irradiance is developed. Two software packages are used for analyzing and optimizing the entire solar thermal plant and its cost, SolarPILOT, and System Advisor Model (SAM). Both packages are validated using data from a recent power tower project. A thorough iterative optimization process was developed and applied to optimize the solar field parameters of a suggested CSP plant including tower optical height; heliostat structure width and height; number of heliostats; horizontal and vertical panels; receiver height and diameter; water consumption; cleaning schedule; maintenance; and total cost. The results confirmed the feasibility of a CSP plant on 0.45 km(2) of a solar field area with 2736 heliostats that produce 8 MWe with 10 hours of thermal storage and hybrid steam condensing system. It has been found that the highest production of the plant is in July, which is 3 621 950 kWh and the highest excess of electrical energy is in March, which is 2 946 965 kWh.

TI Vibration control of space solar power station in complex environments
   using giant magnetostrictive actuator
SO ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
AB In this study, a new method of using giant magnetostrictive actuator (GMA) to control the structural vibration of a space solar power station (SSPS) in orbit is proposed. The coupling dynamic model of SSPS, which is simplified into an Euler-Bernoulli beam with both free ends, is established in a Hamilton system. A GMA, which has a large strain coefficient, fast response, and strong stability, is coupled to the surface of an SSPS for vibration control. This work particularly considers the coupling effect of vibration-attitude and the complex space environments, such as sunlight pressure and thermal shock, to improve the computation accuracy. Simulation results indicate that GMA has excellent performance in the vibration control of space solar power station. Moreover, GMA can also suppress the attitude changes due to the coupling effect. This study contributes to the stable operation and attitude calibration of the space solar power station, and provides a new reference for the research of dynamics and control of large flexible spacecraft in complex environments.

AB Photovoltaic (PV) power generation systems are usually accompanied by battery to bridge the gap between the generation and load demand. Solar tracking is also used to enhance the power stability and increase the amount of collected energy from the Sun. However, battery and tracking devices significantly increase the system cost, and they are subject to wear and tear, which makes maintenance-free installation challenging. In this work, we conduct the design optimization of a twofold three dimensional PV panel for solar-powered systems. With the proposed three dimensional arrangement, we extend the solar-powered time of the target application that is powered only with solar power. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture and control method extend the service time of the target system by up to 23% compared to a non-reconfigurable flat panel with the same PV panel area.

AB This paper presents solar irradiance forecasting in Mae Sariang, Mae Hongson Province, Thailand which has a solar power plant. This solar power plan is a photovoltaic (PV) with capacity power output at 4 MW. However, the adoption of solar irradiance as a power source on a global scale has not been uniform, due to by meteorological conditions, which cause the fluctuations and inconsistencies in PV power output. This paper has applied the Artificial Neural Network by Backpropagation algorithm to forecast solar irradiance. The model uses solar irradiance and meteorological data of previous 7-day period and relevant data for the training. The forecasting results predict solar irradiance in half hour increments in present day which were not used in the modeling. Simulation results have shown that the mean absolute percentage errors in the four example days of the forecasting are less than 6%.

TI Operation of an all-solar power system in Saudi Arabia
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS
AB This paper considers the operation of an all-solar electric energy system in Saudi Arabia, that is, a system which generation mix includes solely solar (PV and/or concentrated solar power (CSP)) and battery energy storage units (used to cover hours with no solar resource and hours beyond the CSP thermal storage capacity). We analyze the operation of this system using realistic data. These data pertain to the actual transmission system and the demand throughout the country in 2015. The Saudi Arabian power system exhibits a rather flat demand during both the summer and winter seasons (there are mostly two season in Saudi Arabia: winter and summer), being the peak demand for 2015 in these seasons 49 and 25 GW, respectively. Solar generation units and storage units are sized and sited using a fully-fledged capacity expansion model (not described in this paper). To comprehend the daily operation of such all-solar power system in Saudi Arabia throughout 2015, we analyze three cases in which the demand is served (i) using PV and storage units, (ii) using CSP and storage units, and (iii) using PV, CSP and storage units. We compare in detail the above three cases. We conclude that using an optimal combination of PV an CSP units results in minimum total (investment and operation) cost, minimum storage needs, and moderate solar energy spillage.

TI Effect of dynamic conditions on high-temperature corrosion of ternary
   carbonate salt for thermal energy storage applications
SO SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS
AB Li2CO3-Na2CO3-K2CO3 salt is one of the candidates for 3rd generation concentrated solar power (CSP) plants, aiming to increase the operational temperature. This rise of temperature significantly increases the corrosion issue of molten salts. However, there is a lack of studies focused on the effect of salt flow on the corrosion kinetic for this ternary carbonate salt. In this work, corrosion experiments under static and dynamic conditions are compared for SS310 subjected to ternary carbonate salt at 600 ?. A complete characterization of the corrosion layer, surface and cross-section, was carried out by means of SEM-EDX and XRD, while the molten salts after the corrosion tests were analysed by ICP-OES and XPS. The dynamic experiment exhibited an enlarged spallation of the corrosion layer, leading to a thinner and less homogeneous scale. This feature exposed the chromium containing phase and considerably increased the extent of its dissolution into the salt. The obtained results remark that the detrimental effect of dynamic conditions on the corrosivity of molten carbonate salt cannot be neglected and must be taken into account in the design of 3rd generation CSP plants.

TI Robust corrosion performance of cold sprayed aluminide coating in
   ternary molten carbonate salt for concentrated solar power plants
SO SOLAR ENERGY MATERIALS AND SOLAR CELLS
AB In concentrated solar power (CSP) technology, high temperature corrosion is a key issue for material selection. In this context, a homogeneous and crack-free FeAl coating with high Al content was prepared by using cold spray (combined with a post heat treatment) to improve the corrosion resistance of stainless steel 316 L (SS316L) in molten carbonate salt for CSP applications. A series of immersion corrosion tests were performed to explore the corrosion behavior of the prepared aluminide coating in the LiNaK molten carbonate salt at 700 degrees C. The results demonstrated that the corrosion resistance of SS316L in the molten carbonate salt can be greatly improved by the prepared aluminide coating. This is attributed to the formation of a continuous dense LiAlO2-layer on the surface of the coating during corrosion. Although an alpha-LiAlO2 -> gamma-LiAlO2 phase transformation occurred during corrosion, it showed little influence on the corrosion performance of the prepared coating under the present experimental conditions. Furthermore, the coating remained intact even after 1000 h of corrosion. It is envisaged that the prepared coating has broad application prospects for CSP system with molten carbonate salt medium.

TI A method to account for transient performance requirements in the design
   of steam generators for concentrated solar power applications
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB Concentrating solar power plants are strongly characterized by recurring start-up and shut-down procedures. This imposes new challenges for conventional components such as the steam generator systems, as frequent load variations might lead to high thermal stress cycles, affecting their lifetime negatively. In this context, the header and coil design is a favourable configuration to reduce stresses. This paper introduces a method to design the heat exchangers of the header and coil steam generator type accounting for the dynamic performance, thermal stress sensitivity and impact on the performance of the power plant. Optimal designs were determined by minimizing the cost and total water-side pressure drop of the steam generator and the levelized cost of electricity of the power plant. The steam generator dynamic model was successfully validated using operational data. The results suggest that a steam generator design characterized by a tube outer diameter of 30 mm, high steam generator pressure drop and low investment cost is the optimal solution for the power plant under consideration. A configuration featuring a large number of tube layers is optimal in order to reduce the pressure drop at the superheater while at the same time, guaranteeing acceptable stresses and good transient response.

TI Benchmarking supercritical carbon dioxide cycles against steam Rankine
   cycles for Concentrated Solar Power
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB Research into concentrated solar power (CSP) technologies has increased significantly due to environmental and energy security concerns. In particular, central receiver CSP technology is considered to be a viable option for large scale electricity generation. However, electricity cost associated with current commercial central receiver CSP technology is not yet competitive with conventional fossil-fuel based electricity generation technologies. In order to reach cost parity with conventional technologies, it is necessary to reduce capital requirements and increase efficiency. In order to meet these requirements, alternative power cycles to the current commercial steam Rankine cycle need to be considered.
   Supercritical carbon dioxide (S-CO2) has been considered as an alternative working fluid for power cycles in operation within a central receiver CSP plant. In this study, three different S-CO2 power cycle layouts are compared against a steam Rankine cycle at both superheated and supercritical conditions. The power cycle concepts are compared on a consistent basis in terms of both cost and thermal efficiency. Results show that S-CO2 power cycles are not competitive against the current steam Rankine technology. Therefore, based on the results of this study, research into power cycles for CSP application should target the steam Rankine cycle over S-CO2 power cycles. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Techno-economic analysis on the design of sensible and latent heat
   thermal energy storage systems for concentrated solar power plants
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB One feasible solution to reduce the cost of concentrated solar power is to employ a higher temperature and efficiency supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton power cycle. An alternative heat transfer medium and thermal energy storage (TES) system therefore needs to be explored. This work considered a variety of phase change materials (PCMs) and graphite as the storage media in four indirect shell-and-tube storage configurations, including a 3-PCM and 5-PCM cascade storage, a PCM-graphite-PCM hybrid storage and a single graphite storage. The sizing and design of the TES systems were performed by using a dynamic cycling methodology based on a transient 2D numerical model. The cost of those designs were then determined by using an economic model developed inhouse. This work also investigates the impact of some geometric parameters and cost assumptions on the techno-economic performance of the TES system. The analysis suggests a scenario exists whereby a low thermal efficiency storage system which therefore utilises less tube or storage material could be more cost-effective. Overall, the cost of hybrid TES is the lowest among all studied systems, at $26.96/kWh(t) and $21.49/kWh(t) for charging temperature of 720 degrees C and 750 degrees C, respectively, followed by the 5-PCM storage at $28.06/kWh(t) and $21.82/kWh(t), respectively.

TI Prospective fully-coupled multi-level analytical methodology for
   concentrated solar power plants: Applications
SO APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING
AB Reliability is of primary significance for running a concentrated solar power (CSP) plant. The fully-coupled multi-level analytical methodology, covering system-level performance prediction and component-level targeting insight, is regarded as the most effective solution against unreliability. Herein, we address these issues in a direct steam generation (DSG) system with parabolic trough collectors (PTCs) by applying the previously-proposed hybrid multi-dimensional model (0-1-2-3 Model) to automatically on-line monitor the loop sections suffering from riskily excessive thermal-stress, including the evaporation stage with two-phase stratified flow and superheating stage with the highest thermal load, and the thermo-hydraulic characteristics along the loop under cloud-shading condition. Due to the fact that the radial thermal deformation of receiver tube can reach up to 1.78 cm, the energy and exergy efficiencies could therefore be reduced by 0.84% and 0.42% for solar field, and 0.24% and 0.25% for the whole plant, respectively. In addition, the overall performance of a 50-MWe DSG-PTC-CSP plant in North China is predicted on two typical days. On summer solstice, the daily average energy efficiency and exergy efficiency are 18.37% and 19.78%, respectively. They, however, decrease to 10.81% and 11.53%, respectively on winter solstice. The overall performance prediction guarantees the real-time evaluation of the CSP plant. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A thermocline thermal energy storage system with filler materials for
   concentrated solar power plants: Experimental data and numerical model
   sensitivity to different experimental tank scales
SO APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING
AB Thermocline thermal energy storage is one of the most promising, cost-effective solutions in improving concentrated solar power plant capacity factor. However, this thermal energy storage needs to be well understood; for this reason, the PROMES-CNRS laboratory built a laboratory-scale experiment. The experiment comprises a thermocline thermal energy storage tank fitted with an oil loop to heat and cool down the thermal oil flowing through the tank. The present study compares experimental results coming from the laboratory experiment but also from two large scale industrial storages already presented in the literature, with two numerical models. The 1D-1P model considers a homogeneous medium that flows through the tank, while the second one (1D-2P) distinguishes between the solid continuous medium and the fluid flowing through the void fraction. The 1D-1P model showed close agreement with experimental results when compared with industrial-size tanks, but differed markedly in the case of laboratory scale ones. The results show that the 1D-2P model is more accurate, especially for small-size tanks. Particular attention has been paid to the tank wall and to heat losses, which have a direct influence on the outlet temperature, especially for laboratory scale tanks. With these considerations, the numerical 1D-2P model can predict the thermocline behavior with accuracy, without parameter fitting process and without a high computation time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A home solar power system for micro electric vehicles (EVs) is one of the important technologies to realize a sustainable energy society. The aim of this paper is a demonstration of a high performance digital control phase shifted full-bridge converter connected between solar panels and the dc-bus line. Since the voltage in a home storage battery and EV battery is around 72V in some products, the output voltage of prototype is regulated from 70V to 84V. The output power of prototype is 8kW conforming with a general power amount of home solar power generation. As a result, the prototype achieves up to 94% power efficiency. Moreover, the output voltage fluctuation is less than 1% when a load step change is from 0A to 100A.

SO SCRIPTA MATERIALIA
AB Concentrating solar power is one of the most promising solar energy exploitation technologies. Its efficiency improvement needs a significant increase of operating temperatures, from the current 500 degrees C to 900 degrees C. Alumina (Al2O3) ceramics are refractory materials characterized by a huge industrial interest, mature production techniques and low cost. In the present work, we successfully synthesized dark ceramic Al2O3 bulks, to evaluate their potential as high-temperature solar absorbers for CSP. We investigated process-dependent ceramics composition, microstructure and optical properties, obtaining pellets with a solar absorbance even higher than that of SiC. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.

AB Parameter optimization of a hybrid CPV/CSP system is investigated using energy analysis with a steady-state physical model. Two kinds of solar radiation flux density distribution, the Gaussian distribution (GD) and the trapezoidal-shaped distribution (TSD), are employed in the analysis. Three influencing parameters including the average optical concentration ratio, the outlet temperature of R134a from the solar thermal receiver, and the saturation vapor temperature of R134a are taken into consideration. The results show that, increasing the average optical concentration ratio, decreasing the outlet temperature of R134a from the thermal receiver, and selecting appropriate saturation vapor temperature are the effective methods for increasing the power output of the proposed hybrid system.

TI Ensemble models for solar power forecasting-a weather classification
   approach
SO AIMS ENERGY
AB Solar power integration has shown a significant growth in many power systems during the last decade. The intermittent nature of solar irradiance tends to vary the amount of solar power in the system and an accurate solar power forecasting method can be used to tackle this in power system planning and operation. In this paper, authors have proposed a generalized ensemble model integrating deep learning techniques to generate accurate solar power forecasts for 21 solar photovoltaic facilities located in Germany. Most important weather parameters for solar power generation are selected through a feature selection process. In addition, a weather classification approach is used to cluster the dataset and for each cluster, a separate ensemble algorithm is assigned. Finally, considering the prediction errors in each cluster, a novel ensemble model is developed. The proposed models are evaluated using root mean square error and results are compared with single machine learning techniques and available forecasting models in the literature. Compared to deep belief network, support vector regression and random forest regression models, the proposed ensemble model with cloud classification reduces RMSE error by 10.49%, 7.78%, and 7.95% respectively. Results show that the weather classification approach reduces the forecasting error by a considerable margin and the proposed ensemble model provides a better forecasting accuracy than single machine learning methods.

TI Wind and solar power probability density prediction via fuzzy
   information granulation and support vector quantile regression
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS
AB Uncertainty among wind and solar power affects the stability of power systems. In order to fully describe the uncertainty of wind and solar power, a probability density prediction model is proposed to predict the probability density function of wind and solar power. According to the wind and solar power time series, the original data is processed with fuzzy information granularity to eliminate the fluctuation and uncertainty of data. The Lagrange function is constructed by a support vector quantile regression model to get the quantile of wind and solar power at different points. The conditional quantiles are combined with the Epanechnikov kernel function to acquire complete probability density curves of forecasting results. In order to evaluate the performance of the output results, this paper analyzes the accuracy of the prediction results using point prediction error, prediction interval coverage probability and average bandwidth. The experimental data of wind and solar power with same temporal and spatial resolutions are taken into account. The results show that the method can effectively describe the uncertainty of wind and solar power, and also provide technical support for the safe and stable operation of the power system.

TI Optical Waveguide Solar Power System for Material Processing in Space
SO JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING
AB The conventional concept for solar energy utilization in space is converting solar radiation to electricity and then using the electric power for various applications. For some applications, however, it is more efficient to utilize solar energy directly. Oxygen production from lunar regolith, for example, can be accomplished by using solar thermal power directly for thermochemical reduction of lunar oxides. Space-based plant growth can use photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) from solar spectra for biomass production and life support. The authors and their colleagues have been developing a new solar power system called the optical waveguide (OW) system for solar power utilization in space. In this system, solar radiation is collected by the concentrator array, which transfers the concentrated solar radiation to the OW transmission line made of low loss optical fibers. The OW transmission line directs the solar radiation to the site of solar power utilization. This paper discusses the technical background of the OW system and reviews development and testing of the engineering prototype of the OW solar thermal system during the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in situ resource utilization (ISRU) analog test in 2010. Based on the results, performance and viability of the OW system in application to space solar power utilization are discussed. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

TI Thermo-economic optimization of an air driven supercritical CO2 Brayton
   power cycle for concentrating solar power plant with packed bed thermal
   energy storage
SO SOLAR ENERGY
AB This work presents an innovative indirect supercritical CO2 - air driven concentrated solar power plant with a packed bed thermal energy storage. High supercritical CO2 turbine inlet temperature can be achieved, avoiding the temperature limitations set by the use of solar molten salts as primary heat transfer fluid. The packed bed thermal energy storage enables the decoupling between solar irradiation collection and electricity production, and it grants operational flexibility while enhancing the plant capacity factor. A quasi steady state thermoeconomic model of the integrated concentrating solar power plant has been developed. The thermo-economic performance of the proposed plant design has been evaluated via multi-objective optimizations and sensitivity analyses. Results show that a Levelized Cost of Electricity of 100 $/MWhe and a capacity factor higher than 50% can be achieved already at a 10 MWe nominal size. Such limited plant size bounds the capital investment and leads to more bankable and easily installable plants. Results also show that larger plants benefit from economy of scale, with a 65 $/MWhe cost identified for a 50 MWe plant. The receiver efficiency is found to be the most influential assumption. A 20% decrease of receiver efficiency would lead to an increase of more than 15% of the Levelized Cost of Electricity. These results show the potential of indirect supercritical CO2 - air driven concentrated solar power plant and highlight the importance of further air receiver development. More validations and verification tests are needed to ensure the system operation during long lifetime.

TI Use of a Big Data Analysis in Regression of Solar Power Generation on

SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB This study identified the meteorological variables that significantly impact the power generation of a solar power plant in Samcheonpo, Korea. To this end, multiple regression models were developed to estimate the power generation of the solar power plant with changing weather conditions. The meteorological data for the regression models were the daily data from January 2011 to December 2019. The dependent variable was the daily power generation of the solar power plant in kWh, and the independent variables were the insolation intensity during daylight hours (MJ/m(2)), daylight time (h), average relative humidity (%), minimum relative humidity (%), and quantity of evaporation (mm). A regression model for the entire data and 12 monthly regression models for the monthly data were constructed using R, a large data analysis software. The 12 monthly regression models estimated the solar power generation better than the entire regression model. The variables with the highest influence on solar power generation were the insolation intensity variables during daylight hours and daylight time.

The voltage level provided by solar power plants can change rapidly, since it depends on environmental factors and on the surface temperature of the solar cells. At extreme temperatures, the provided voltage can exceed the prescribed standard value, therefore an intervention primarily hysteresis voltage regulation - becomes necessary. The present study describes the effect of a 680.4 kW(p) solar power plant on the voltage of the power grid as a function of ambient temperature, through simulation results.

TI Investigation of enhanced thermal properties in NiO-based nanofluids for
   concentrating solar power applications: A molecular dynamics and
   experimental analysis
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB Nanofluids could be a promising alternative to the typical heat transfer fluids (HTF) used in concentrating solar power. This study analyses nanofluids based on a typical HTF for concentrating solar power (CSP) applications and NiO nanoparticles. The optimum nanoparticle concentration was determined by analysing the stability of the nanofluids. Some of their properties, such as density, viscosity, isobaric specific heat and thermal conductivity, were characterized to evaluate their performance. Their thermal conductivity increased by up to 96% and the heat transfer coefficient by 50%. Molecular dynamics calculations were performed to explain from a molecular perspective how the presence of equal proportions of two surfactants, benzalkonium chloride (BAC) and 1-Octadecanethiol (ODT), enhanced the thermal properties of the NiO nanofluid. The isobaric specific heat and thermal conductivity values followed the same experimental tendency. The analysis of the radial distribution functions (RDFs) and spatial distribution functions (SDFs) revealed an inner layer of base fluid and surfactant molecules around the NiO cell. This first layer contained BAC molecules at all the temperatures, while ODT was only incorporated at higher temperatures. The exchange of surfactant and base fluid molecules around the NiO as the temperature increases may play an important role in the enhancement of the thermal properties.

AB A conceptual analysis of the coupling of a concentrating solar power plant with a chemical process for hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of microalgae to biocrude was performed. The two plants were considered coupled by molten salt recirculation that granted energetic supply to the chemical process. Preliminary estimations have been done considering a solar field constituted by 3 linear parabolic solar collectors rows, each 200 m long, using a ternary molten salts mixture as heat transfer fluid, and a chemical plant sized to process 10 kT/y of microalgae. Under adopted conditions, we have estimated a minimum selling prize of the biocrude that is similar to that achieved in non-solar HTL processes.
