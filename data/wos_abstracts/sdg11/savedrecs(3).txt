AB The decentralisation of municipal solid waste management (MSWM) brings significant reductions in the amount of waste sent to landfills, distances travelled by waste collection vehicles yielding subsequent reductions in fuel consumption, transport and maintenance costs, greenhouse gas and other emissions as well as vector associated human health impacts thereby bringing sustainability in MSW. Such decentralised MSWM systems require residents' acceptance derived from their participation in its planning, development and implementation. This study reviewed the options for decentralizing waste management in Harare and surrounding urban areas. Numerous opportunities for decentralisation exist from household backyard composting, anaerobic digestion or composting of biodegradable fraction of municipal solid waste (MSW), anaerobic co-digestion of biodegradable fraction of MSW and dewatered sewage sludge, source separation of MSW for material recovery, construction of waste transfer stations or citizens' convenient centres and establishment of thermal waste to energy facilities. Legislative reforms and their implementation need to be initiated as provided for under goal 10 of the national integrated solid waste management plan (NISWMP) for Zimbabwe to promote the decentralisation of MSWM authority to the lowest appropriate level as well as strengthening the capacity of local authorities to fulfill their obligations.

TI Municipal solid waste as a sustainable resource for energy production:
   State-of-the-art review
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Solid waste treatment and disposal is a global challenge for the development of a sustainable society. The problem has been exacerbated by a rise in waste products as a result of population growth and urbanization. Ever-increasing municipal solid waste, together with its high proportion of organic waste and its unscientific disposal, contributes to Greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollutants. Municipal solid waste (MSW) mismanagement not only has harmful environmental consequences but also poses public health risks and raises other socioeconomic concerns. The mitigation approach requires an environmentally sustainable interpretation of the waste for its management and treatment. The waste-to-energy conversion provides a solution to environmental issues such as Greenhouse gas emission and waste management, thereby helping to achieve a green environment with a simultaneously prospering economy. This paper provides a comprehensive review of municipal solid waste generation and its characteristics. It provides a bird's-eye view of the suitability of various technologies for energy production, providing up-to-date information about it. It also covers challenges and perspectives in this field of research.

TI Solid Waste Management Options and their Impacts on Climate Change and
   Human Health
SO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION STRATEGIES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
SE Strategies for Sustainability
AB The recent changes in global climate are believed to be the result of growing anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; mainly carbon dioxide and methane, resulting from the increased industrial activities over the years. One of the main emission sources that add to the anthropogenic greenhouse gases concentrations in the atmosphere are derived from the processes of solid waste disposal. It can be shown that solid waste has adverse impacts on climate change and human health. The potential for deleterious public health and environmental effects is substantial where waste has been improperly disposed off.
   Waste can be categorized predominantly into four sections as: municipal solid waste; agricultural waste; industrial waste; and hazardous waste. The economic growth and urbanization experienced over the past decades in many parts around the world have significantly escalated the quantities of the municipal solid waste. The improper disposal and the uncontrolled dumping of different types of waste have caused long term environmental and health problems, as well as degradation of land resources. Different solid waste management options have recently emerged inter alia including collection, processing, recycling, and disposal of the solid waste in ways that will reduce their harmful effects. This chapter will thoroughly assess the various robust and cost effective management alternatives, with the exception of hazardous waste, such as landfilling, composting, incineration, recycling, and the use of landfill gas (LFG) as a renewable source of energy. The chapter will also address the impacts of these management strategies that are reflected on the environment, the economy, and on human health.

TI Life Cycle Assessment of Integrated Municipal Organic Waste Management
   Systems in Thailand
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The majority of municipal solid waste in Thailand is organic waste including food and garden waste. Improper waste management has caused negative impacts on the environment. This study aimed to find a hypothetical municipal organic waste management scenario with the lowest environmental impacts using life cycle assessment (LCA). The system boundary of organic waste management includes collection and transportation; treatment, including centralized and on-site treatment technologies; and by-product utilization. The two main waste management systems considered in this study were centralized and on-site waste management systems. The first two scenarios take into account all the amount of the municipal organic waste collected and transported and then treated by centralized waste treatment technologies (composting, anaerobic digestion, and landfill). The remaining three scenarios are integrated between 10% on-site (home composting, food waste processor, and composting bin) and 90% centralized (composting, anaerobic digestion, and incineration) waste treatment technologies; the scenario combining centralized (food waste anaerobic digestion, garden waste composting, and incineration) and on-site (home composting) systems yielded the lowest environmental impacts (except short-term climate change, freshwater, and marine eutrophication). On-site systems can help reduce collection, transportation, and treatment impacts, particularly photochemical oxidant formation, which was proportional to the amount of waste or distance reduced. Benefits from the by-product utilization can offset all impacts in terms of fossil and nuclear energy use and freshwater acidification, and result in a negative impact score or impact reduction. This research can be used as guidance for developing countries with conditions and waste composition similar to Thailand for making initial decisions on environmentally sustainable municipal organic waste management.

TI Impact of organic waste composition on life cycle energy production,
   global warming and Water use for treatment by anaerobic digestion
   followed by composting
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB In response to significant organic waste generation, environmental policies are increasingly mandating diversion of organic waste from landfills and promoting alternative management practices to produce energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Anaerobic digestion and composting are organic waste treatment alternatives, however, both practices require careful management to prevent similar environmental impacts as landfills. A model was developed to assess the impact of anaerobic digestion followed by composting of food waste and green waste mixtures on net energy production, global warming potential and scarce water use. The model included the ability to vary the initial organic waste composition, decomposition kinetics and treatment time. Energy needs for composting aeration and water pumping, and water use decreased as anaerobic digestion time increased. Composting water use savings for an organic waste anaerobically digested for 90 days prior to composting compared to zero days prior to composting ranged between 25%-53% for different organic waste compositions (from 1:0 to 0:1 green waste to food waste ratios), and energy use savings for composting aeration and water pumping ranged between 15%-17% and 24%-54%, respectively, for the same conditions. For an anaerobic digestion pretreatment time of 30 days prior to composting, the analysis predicted scarce water use to be 0.31-1.09 in m(3) SWe/Mg waste, primary energy use to be -168.5-298.3 MJ/Mg waste, and global warming potential to be 8.1-26.4 kg CO(2)e/Mg waste. The results will help inform the design and maintenance of waste treatment in resource-limited environments.

TI Life cycle assessment of biodegradable waste treatment systems for
   sub-Saharan African cities
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Most of the waste collected in sub-Saharan African cities is biodegradable but it is usually dumped in landfills, creating environmental and health challenges for residents. However, there are biodegradable waste treatment methods that could mitigate these challenges. This study analysed anaerobic digestion, composting, vermicomposting and fly larvae waste treatments using life cycle assessment (LCA). The impact categories assessed were energy use, global warming and eutrophication potential. The results showed that anaerobic digestion performed best in all impact categories assessed. However, management of the anaerobic digestion process is critical and methane losses must be kept very small, as otherwise they will cause global warming. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Review of life-cycle environmental consequences of waste-to-energy
   solutions on the municipal solid waste management system
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB The interest in implementing waste-to-energy (WtE) solutions for municipal solid waste (MSW) is increasing on a global scale motivated by the environmental concerns that arise from an inadequate disposal. The evaluation of the environmental impacts associated with WtE technologies has been widely addressed through the life-cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. However, a robust analysis of the environmental consequences of implementing WtE solutions requires the consideration of the entire MSW management system. In this review, we delve into published LCA studies on MSW management systems with the aim of identifying WtE solutions and their impact on the system's environmental performance. We found a consensus amongst the case studies reviewed on the favourable environmental consequences of both the diversion of organic waste from composting to anaerobic digestion and the implementation of a landfill gas collection system to produce electricity. There was also a consensus that the diversion of MSW from landfilling to incineration would generally reduce the global warming impact, but with uncertain human health consequences. Discrepancies were observed with respect to the environmental consequences of both the diversion of organic waste from incineration to anaerobic digestion and the diversion of waste from incineration to mechanical-biological treatment plants. Overall, this review can help decision-makers pre-identify environmentally sound WtE solutions. However, a subsequent LCA specific to the new context is imperative in order to identify the environmentally preferred option.

TI Economic and environmental life cycle assessment of organic waste
   treatment by means of incineration and biogasi fication. Is source
   segregation of biowaste justi fied in Germany?
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB In the realm of the German scope, four different waste treatment options for the Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste (OFMSW) were evaluated against the environmental and economic background: (i) anaerobic digestion followed by composting, (ii) incineration of OFMSW, (iii) incineration of separately pre-dried OFMSW and (iv) a cascaded treatment system, which couples anaerobic digestion with incineration (i.e. incineration of digestate). Environmental life cycle assessment (eLCA) and a calculation of the levelized costs of exergy (LCOE) were performed to map the sustainability aspects of the different product systems. Within a hybrid approach, consisting of literature data evaluation, theoretical modelling, the conduct of lab-scaled experiments and a substrate analysis, a comprehensive assessment was compiled.
   Within the eLCA, the main drivers of the total environmental impact were the categories global warming potential (GWP) and the fossil depletion potential (FDP). (i) Anaerobic digestion followed by composting and (ii) incineration were hereby characterized by the fewest environmental impacts. With regards to the base case, the GWP was calculated to similar to 500 g CO2-Eq/kWh exergy for these options. The FDP was <0.05 kg oil-Eq/kWh exergy for anaerobic digestion and -0.075 kg oil-Eq/kWh exergy for incineration. The other examined treatment options were characterized by a significantly higher GWP and FDP.
   The economic assessment showed median LCOE of 27 ct/kWh exergy for anaerobic digestion followed by composting and thus outcompeted incineration (median: 55 ct/kWh Exergy). Separate pre-drying prior to incineration increased the economic burdens marginally. Anaerobic digestion followed by incineration showed the highest economic expenses (89 ct/kWh exergy). In conclusion, anaerobic digestion followed by composting was marked by an overall preferential environmental and economic constellation and source segregation is thereof justified and should further be maintained.

TI Odors Emitted from Biological Waste and Wastewater Treatment Plants: A
   Mini-Review
SO ATMOSPHERE
AB In recent decades, a new generation of waste treatment plants based on biological treatments (mainly anaerobic digestion and/or composting) has arisen all over the world. These plants have been progressively substituted for incineration facilities and landfills. Although these plants have evident benefits in terms of their environmental impact and higher recovery of material and energy, the release into atmosphere of malodorous compounds and its mitigation is one of the main challenges that these plants face. In this review, the methodology to determine odors, the main causes of having undesirable gaseous emissions, and the characterization of odors are reviewed. Finally, another important topic of odor abatement technologies is treated, especially those related to biological low-impact processes. In conclusion, odor control is the main challenge for a sustainable implementation of modern waste treatment plants.

TI Comparison of the organic waste management systems in the Danish-German
   border region using life cycle assessment (LCA)
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB This study assessed the management of the organic household waste in the Danish-German border region and points out major differences between the systems and their potential effects on the environment using life cycle assessment (LCA). The treatment of organic waste from households in the Danish-German border region is very different on each side of the border; the Danish region only uses incineration for the treatment of organic household waste while the German region includes combined biogas production and composting, mechanical and biological treatment (MBT) and incineration. Data on all parts of the organic waste treatment was collected including waste composition data and data from treatment facilities and their respective energy systems. Based on that the organic waste management systems in the border region were modelled using the EASETECH waste management LCA-model. The main output is a life cycle assessment showing large differences in the environmental performance of the two different regions with the Danish region performing better in 10 out of 14 impact categories. Furthermore, the importance of the substituted district heating systems was investigated showing an impact up to 34% of the entire system for one impact category and showing large difference between each heating system substituted, e.g. in "Global Warming" the impact was from 16 to 1.1 milli person equivalent/tonne treated waste from substitution of centralised hard coal and decentralised natural gas, respectively.

TI Life cycle and economic assessment of source-separated MSW collection
   with regard to greenhouse gas emissions: a case study in China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB In China, the continuously increasing amount of municipal solid waste (MSW) has resulted in an urgent need for changing the current municipal solid waste management (MSWM) system based on mixed collection. A pilot program focusing on source-separated MSW collection was thus launched (2010) in Hangzhou, China, to lessen the related environmental loads. And greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Kyoto Protocol) are singled out in particular. This paper uses life cycle assessment modeling to evaluate the potential environmental improvement with regard to GHG emissions. The pre-existing MSWM system is assessed as baseline, while the source separation scenario is compared internally. Results show that 23 % GHG emissions can be decreased by source-separated collection compared with the base scenario. In addition, the use of composting and anaerobic digestion (AD) is suggested for further optimizing the management of food waste. 260.79, 82.21, and -86.21 thousand tonnes of GHG emissions are emitted from food waste landfill, composting, and AD, respectively, proving the emission reduction potential brought by advanced food waste treatment technologies. Realizing the fact, a modified MSWM system is proposed by taking AD as food waste substitution option, with additional 44 % GHG emissions saved than current source separation scenario. Moreover, a preliminary economic assessment is implemented. It is demonstrated that both source separation scenarios have a good cost reduction potential than mixed collection, with the proposed new system the most cost-effective one.

TI Life cycle assessment of waste treatment strategy for sewage sludge and
   food waste in Macau: perspectives on environmental and energy production
   performance
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT
AB Purpose This study evaluates waste treatment scenarios involving the current waste treatment method (i.e., incineration) and two proposed technically feasible treatment methods (i.e., anaerobic digestion and co-digestion) for sewage sludge and food waste, with the consideration of environmental impacts and energy production performance. A sustainable waste treatment strategy is then identified through a combination of waste treatment methods with low environmental impacts and high energy production in Macau.
   MethodsThis study applies life cycle assessment methodology. The selection of waste treatment methods is based on Macau's situation (i.e., land scarcity and limited agricultural activities). Scenarios with different treatment methods are evaluated based on human health, ecosystems, and energy production performance. This study is divided into three parts. In part 1, three scenarios for treating sewage sludge and food waste are evaluated including existing incineration, anaerobic co-digestion, and a combination of existing incineration and anaerobic digestion. In part 2, two scenarios are assessed for treating the remaining food waste. In part 3, a proposed waste treatment scenario through a combination of waste treatment methods is identified based on the results from part 1 and part 2. The scenario is compared with the existing incineration scenario for treating all sewage sludge and food waste generated in Macau. Furthermore, a study is conducted to evaluate the condition with increased sewage sludge after the wastewater treatment plants are upgraded.
   Results and discussionIn part 1 and part 2, anaerobic co-digestion scenario and anaerobic digestion scenario (i.e., for remaining food waste) outweigh other scenarios with the lowest environmental impacts and highest energy production. With the combination of these two selected scenarios, the proposed waste treatment scenario improves the performance in human health, ecosystems, and energy production by 36, 13, and 61 %, respectively, compared with the existing incineration scenario in Macau. Moreover, the proposed scenario also has better performance even if the generation of sewage sludge increases. The environmental performance of proposed scenario is almost two times better than the existing incineration scenario in human health categories.
   ConclusionsIn this study, a proposed waste treatment strategy for sewage sludge and food waste in Macau is suggested with low environmental impacts and high energy production performance. The proposed waste treatment strategy includes a combination of anaerobic co-digestion and anaerobic digestion treatment method. The result of this study could serve as a reference to other urbanized countries or cities for sustainable treatment of sewage sludge and food waste.

TI Comparative environmental and economic life cycle assessment of high
   solids anaerobic co-digestion for biosolids and organic waste management
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB High-Solids Anaerobic co-Digestion (HS-AcD) of sewage sludge (biosolids) with the organic fraction of municipal solid waste is a promising waste management alternative due to high methane yields, lower reactor volume requirements, lower energy inputs, and less leachate production than liquid anaerobic digestion. This study evaluated the environmental and economic burdens and benefits of HS-AcD of biosolids, Food Waste (FW), and Yard Waste (YW) using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) methods using Hillsborough County, Florida in the U.S. as a case study. Results for HS-AcD were compared with incineration, composting, and landfilling, with and without landfill gas use. The results showed that HS-AcD of a mixture of biosolids, FW, and YW had the lowest environmental impacts in all categories analyzed (global warming potential, acidification, eutrophication, and ecotoxicity). In terms of economics, HS-AcD had the lowest life cycle cost, with or without considering land acquisition. The results show that HS-AcD is the best choice to manage biosolids and the organic waste in Hillsborough County in terms of both environmental and economic sustainability. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The geographical area under study is Catalonia (Spain). The current Catalan waste management scenario treating 1218 Gg of organic waste is analyzed and compared to a new scenario treating the same amount of waste but fulfilling the European Landfill Directive and the new recently approved Catalan waste management plan. As final disposal (incineration and sanitary landfill) of untreated municipal solid waste is not permitted, the new scenario includes increasing anaerobic digestion treatment of source selected organic fraction of municipal solid waste while maintaining the existing composting plants for this type of waste. Gaseous emissions treatment equipment will be provided when not installed in composting plants. Home composting is also included. Non-source selected organic fraction of municipal solid waste will be treated by composting. Different scenarios for sensitivity analysis have also been proposed dealing with the influence of transport, fugitive methane emissions from anaerobic digestion plants and the use of compost among other issues. The new scenario proposed decreases the impact in five out of the six impact categories studied (from a 49% in eutrophication potential to a 9% in ozone depletion potential). The inclusion of methane fugitive emissions in anaerobic digestion installations in impacts calculation impairs the environmental benefits of this type of treatment facilities (increasing global warming potential value up to a 31%). Improvement of landfill gas collection is of utmost importance in decreasing global warming potential. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Integrating food waste management into urban wastewater treatment:
   Economic and environmental impacts
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Food waste is the main component of municipal solid waste (MSW) and its sustainable management is a global challenge. Co-treatment of food waste and urban wastewater in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) could be a plausible management strategy to reduce the MSW amount that is disposed in landfills, while converting its organic fraction into biogas in the WWTP. However, the increased organic load in the wastewater influent would impact the capital and operating costs of the WWTP, mainly due to the increase in sludge production. In this work, different scenarios for co-treatment of food waste and wastewater were studied from both economic and environmental perspectives. These scenarios were designed based on different sludge disposal and management options. The results showed that the co-treatment of food waste and wastewater would be more environmentally friendly than their separate treatment, but its economic feasibility strongly depends on the ratio between the management costs of MSW and sewage sludge.

TI Detection, Composition and Treatment of Volatile Organic Compounds from
   Waste Treatment Plants
SO SENSORS
AB Environmental policies at the European and global level support the diversion of wastes from landfills for their treatment in different facilities. Organic waste is mainly treated or valorized through composting, anaerobic digestion or a combination of both treatments. Thus, there are an increasing number of waste treatment plants using this type of biological treatment. During waste handling and biological decomposition steps a number of gaseous compounds are generated or removed from the organic matrix and emitted. Different families of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) can be found in these emissions. Many of these compounds are also sources of odor nuisance. In fact, odors are the main source of complaints and social impacts of any waste treatment plant. This work presents a summary of the main types of VOC emitted in organic waste treatment facilities and the methods used to detect and quantify these compounds, together with the treatment methods applied to gaseous emissions commonly used in composting and anaerobic digestion facilities.

TI Carbon Footprint and Total Cost Evaluation of Different Bio-Plastics
   Waste Treatment Strategies
SO CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES
AB To address the problem of fossil-based pollution, bio-plastics have risen in use in a wide range of applications. The current waste management system still has some weakness for bio-plastics waste (BPW) treatment, and quantitative data is lacking. This study combines environmental and economic assessments in order to indicate the most sustainable and suitable BPW management treatment between organic, plastic and mixed wastes. For the scope, the carbon footprint of each scenario was calculated by life cycle assessment (LCA), while the total cost of the waste management system was used as an economic parameter. The economic evaluation revealed that the organic, plastic and mixed waste treatment routes reached a total cost of 120.35, 112.21 and 109.43 EUR, respectively. The LCA results showed that the incomplete degradation of BPW during anaerobic digestion and composting led to the disposal of the compost produced, creating an environmental burden of 324.64 kgCO(2)-Eq. for the organic waste treatment route, while the mixed and plastic treatment routes obtained a benefit of -87.16 and -89.17 kgCO(2)-Eq. respectively. This study showed that, although the current amount of BPW does not affect the treatment process of organic, plastic and mixed wastes, it can strongly affect the quality of the output, compromising its further reuse. Therefore, specific improvement of waste treatment should be pursued, particularly with regard to the anaerobic digestion of organic waste, which remains a promising technology for BPW treatment.

TI Boundaries matter: Greenhouse gas emission reductions from alternative
   waste treatment strategies for California's municipal solid waste
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB How waste is managed - whether as a nuisance to be disposed of, or as a resource to be reused - directly affects local and global environmental quality. This analysis explores the GHG benefits of five treatment options for residual municipal solid waste (MSW) in California: Business As Usual (landfilling), Anaerobic Digestion, Incineration, 40% Reduction, and MaxEnergy (both incineration and anaerobic digestion). Because recycling efforts in California are already strong, this analysis focuses on non-recyclables and asks what else can be done with the material fractions that are currently reaching landfills. Using two different waste LCA models, EASEWASTE (a Danish model) and WARM (a U.S. model), we find that improved biogenic waste management through anaerobic digestion and waste reduction can lead to life-cycle GHG savings when compared to Business As Usual. The magnitude of the benefits depends strongly on a number of model assumptions: the type of electricity displaced by waste-derived energy, how biogenic carbon is counted as a contributor to atmospheric carbon stocks, and the landfill gas collection rate. Assuming that natural gas is displaced by waste-derived energy, that 64% of landfill gas is collected, and that our system boundary begins when waste is thrown away and ends with disposal or conversion to air emissions, reducing California's residual waste by 40% can lead to a savings of 6 Mt (million metric tonnes) of CO(2)-e per year, and digesting California's biogenic waste could save 0.6 Mt CO(2)-e per year. Source reduction is the most robust means to mitigate GHG emissions from waste, though either increasing landfill gas capture rates within the current management plan or digesting biogenic waste (and designing landfills to maximize carbon sequestration) provide two other important means for greenhouse gas mitigation from waste management.

TI Sustainability Assessment of Municipal Solid Waste in Riyadh, Saudi
   Arabia, in the Framework of Circular Economy Transition
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Life cycle assessment (LCA) tools can be used for the environmental assessment of municipal solid waste management (MSWM) systems. The present study aims to evaluate the impact of an MSWM system in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, under three different scenarios based on the Strategy for 2045 of Riyadh. The current scenario (S0) considers that municipal solid waste (MSW) is landfilled, scenario one (S1) considers waste to energy (WtE) as the main treatment while dry recyclables and organic waste collection schemes are introduced, and scenario two (S2) considers dry recyclables and organic waste collection schemes at the maximum level while the residual portion is treated as WtE. The system boundaries include MSW treatment and disposal by recycling, incineration, composting, and landfilling methods. The scenarios were compared using SimaPro 9.1.1.1 software, and the ReCiPe 2016 Midpoint (H) V1.04/World (2010) H method was used to assess global warming, ozone formation (human health), fine particulate matter formation, terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication, mineral resource scarcity, and fossil resource scarcity. S0 was found to be the scenario with the least impact if considering just the waste treatment. However, S1 and S2 allow material and energy recovery that avoids the impact of obtaining primary resources. S1 and S2 reduced greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions by 55% and 58%, respectively, compared to S0. According to the SV2030, 2% of the electricity generated by the Kingdom would have to come from WtE, but based on the calculations, the maximum electricity from waste would be obtained with S1 fully implemented and would contribute a maximum of 1.51% to Saudi Arabia's electricity demand. This study contributes by providing useful insights that could help decision-makers to understand the potential environmental impacts by assessing each step considered by the Strategy for 2045 for Riyadh along with the consequences on material and energy supply by using the material and energy potential of MSW.

TI Energy, economic and environmental (3E) analysis of waste-to-energy
   (WTE) strategies for municipal solid waste (MSW) management in Malaysia
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB The utilisation of municipal solid waste (MSW) for energy production has been implemented globally for many decades. Malaysia, however, is still highly dependent on landfills for MSW management. Because of the concern for greenhouse gases (GHG) emission and the scarcity of land, Malaysia has an urgent need for a better waste management strategy. This study aims to evaluate the energy, economic and environmental (3E) impact of waste-to-energy (WTE) for municipal solid waste management. An existing landfill in Malaysia is selected as the case study for consideration to adopt the advanced WTE technologies including the landfill gas recovery system (LFGRS), incineration, anaerobic digestion (AD), and gasification. The study presented an interactive comparison of different WTE scenarios and followed by further discussion on waste incineration and AD as the two potential WTE options in Malaysia. The 3E assessment reveals incineration as the superior technology choice when the production of electricity and heat were considered; however, AD is found to be more favourable under the consideration of electricity production only.

TI Life Cycle Assessment of management systems for sewage sludge and food
   waste: centralized and decentralized approaches
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The aim of the present study has been to assess the environmental profile of an experimental decentralized waste management system which is based on the anaerobic codigestion of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) and dewatered sewage sludge in small plants (annual capacity: about 3000 t coupled at a 75 kW CHP unit) distributed over the territory. Two scenarios have been analysed: with and without aerobic composting post-treatment. In so far as an environmental point of view is concerned, such scenarios have been compared with the past and the current approaches occurring in the case study area (NE Italy) and characterized by a strong centralization. Environmental performances of the different scenarios have been assessed through Life Cycle Assessment methodology. Our results indicate that the anaerobic codigestion of dewatered sewage sludge and OFMSW in small plants combined with composting post-treatment may offer an environmentally sustainable option of waste management in small communities. This is achieved by (1) a strong reduction in the distances and volumes transported by. road, (2) low energy requirement for the process itself, (3) energy saving from CHP unit and (4) energy/resources saving from the compost produced by the digested matter. Also social advantages may be gained, such as increased public acceptability of waste treatment facilities and increased awareness among citizen on waste management issue. To note that these advantages are closely related to some key assumptions like the use of digested matter as fertilizer. Assumptions and work limits are discussed in the final section of the paper.

TI Environmental performance and energy recovery potential of five
   processes for municipal solid waste treatment
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB In this study, the environmental impacts were assessed for five municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment processes with energy recovery potential. The life cycle assessment (LCA) tool was used to quantify the environmental impacts. The five processes considered are incineration, gasification, anaerobic digestion, bio-landfills, and composting. In addition, these processes were compared to recycling where applicable. In addition to environmental impacts quantification, the energy production potentials for the five processes were compared to provide a thorough assessment. To maximize the future applicability of our findings, the analyses were based on the waste treatment technologies as they apply to individual waste streams, but not for a specific MSW mixture at a particular location. Six MSW streams were considered; food, yard, plastic, paper, wood and textile wastes. From an energy recovery viewpoint, it was found that it is best to recycle paper, wood and plastics; to anaerobically digest food and yard wastes; and to incinerate textile waste. On the other hand, the level of environmental impact for each process depends on the considered impact category. Generally, anaerobic digestion and gasification were found to perform better environmentally than the other processes, while composting had the least environmental benefit. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB To assess the sustainability of waste management scenario with energy recovery, it is necessary to carry out an adequate analysis of all influential criteria. The main problem in the analysis is to determine the indicators that clearly and fully sublimate the most important influential factors. The model for the assessment of the sustainability of waste treatment scenarios based on multi-criteria analysis AHP (analytic hierarchy process) method is developed. The model predicts an increase in the number of indicators, if it found that a selected number of indicators are not sufficient to distinguish between scenarios and new criterion for the selection of indicators: the relevance of the indicator for certain waste treatment. The model is verified in the case study the city of Nit. Four scenarios were selected and examined: business as usual scenario (landfilling of waste) and the other are created as scenarios with energy recovery and recourses preserving: composting organic waste with recycling inorganic waste, incineration of waste and anaerobic digestion of waste. The assessment of the sustainability of waste treatment scenarios was made in several steps. It is found that the best sustainable scenario is composting of organic and recycling of inorganic waste.

SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was conducted to determine the environmental impacts of several waste treatment scenarios for a suburban New York (U.S.) municipality. The study goal was to determine if separate food waste recovery and management was environmentally sounder than waste-to-energy incineration (the baseline case). Three alternatives, enclosed tunnel composting, enclosed windrow composting, and anaerobic digestion with subsequent enclosed windrow composting of residuals, were examined considering the entire residual waste stream (not just separated food wastes). Impact categories assessed were climate change, environmental eutrophication and acidification, resource depletion, and stratospheric ozone depletion. A normalized, aggregated impact assessment was created to compare the treatments across categories. The anaerobic digestion scenario scored best, followed by the tunnel composting and the baseline waste to energy incineration scenarios, and, last, the enclosed windrow composting scenario. Although it was possible to select an alternative that decreased environmental burdens compared to the business-as-usual case, all modeled scenarios resulted in higher overall environmental burdens than savings, underscoring the need to avoid creating waste to conserve resources and reduce environmental burdens, and ultimately lead to more sustainable waste management practices.

TI Optimization of the municipal solid waste management system using a
   hybrid life cycle assessment-emergy approach in Tehran
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The sustainable design of the waste-management system is of crucial importance for cities like Tehran, capital of Iran. Tehran's municipal solid-waste management has adopted modern practices and technologies very slowly. This study proposes the optimum pathway to reach maximum environmental benefits as well as the most cost-effective technologies according to the financial limits. The hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA)-emergy approach is applied to utilize the life cycle emissions as an inventory database to estimate the ecosystem services provided by the natural ecosystem to dilute the emissions and compensate raw material consumption. Among organic waste-treatment options, composting is optimally chosen by the hybrid LCA-emergy approach while considering the LCA method solely; the anaerobic digestion is the preferable option. Recycling is the most preferable solution for paper, plastic, and glass in terms of energy recovery and cost saving. However, the budget constraint affects the results. Considering the budget constraint, 65% of ferrous metals are diverted from recycling into metal landfill. Cost reduction of recycling technologies may divert metal flow from landfill to recycling. The limited budget has a significant impact on recycling solutions. Overall, the combination of composting and source separation should be considered as the most sustainable and eco-friendly pathway in Tehran.

TI Improving the sustainability of organic waste management practices in
   the food-energy-water nexus: A comparative review of anaerobic digestion
   and composting
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB With global population growth, the security of food, energy and water is becoming more challenging. Both anaerobic digestion (AD) and composting are waste management methods that are plausible approaches to address this challenge by reusing organic waste and generating value-added products. In this paper, recent research on AD and composting is summarized, and differences in the technical, economic, and environmental aspects of AD and composting, and their potential to improve the sustainability of waste management, are examined. Recent research on AD has focused on process enhancement and valorization of end products, while composting research has emphasized ways to shorten composting period and reduce odor and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Strategies to enhance AD and composting processes are similar, but the operational parameters that affect microbial activity, including inoculation, aeration, temperature, moisture, C/N ratio, and pH, can differ. AD can be economically more advantageous than composting, depending on plant scale and valorization of end products, while composting is more profitable at smaller scales (e.g.< 20,000 t). Therefore, AD may be favored for centralized treatment, such as for food waste or sewage sludge; whereas, composting may be preferred for decentralized treatment, such as for on-farm animal manure. Environmentally, AD is favorable in terms of lower GHG emissions due to production of biogas as a renewable energy source. In composting, no single aeration scheme or additive has been found to be effective in reducing odor and GHG emissions simultaneously. Further research on AD and composting should be conducted to improve precision control and optimization, process design, product value, pollution control, and economic and environmental analyses, and more information needs to be provided to decision makers.

TI Steps towards more environmentally sustainable municipal solid waste
   management - A life cycle assessment study of Sao Paulo, Brazil
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Landfill disposal has thus far been the predominant treatment method for municipal solid waste (MSW) throughout Brazil, including Sao Paulo city. Environmentally sustainable development of MSW management in Sao Paulo necessitates a stepwise reduction of landfilling. However, ever increasing MSW generation poses the challenge of managing increasing MSW volumes while simultaneously modernizing the MSW management system. In this study, the environmental impacts of the current MSW management system and future alternatives in the city were assessed by means of life cycle assessment (LCA) to determine a pathway towards more environmentally sustainable MSW management. The assessed impact categories were global warming, acidification and eutrophication potentials. Potential future alternatives included the stepwise reduction of landfilling by the introduction of composting, anaerobic digestion and mechanical-biological treatment (MBT). The results of the study indicated that the environmental impacts of MSW management in Sao Paulo can be most effectively diminished by anaerobic digestion of source separated organic waste and MBT of MSW, on condition that the produced refuse-derived fuel (RDF) is utilized in cement production as a substitute for coal. The other utilization option for RDF, incineration, would increase the environmental impacts of MSW management due to the low amount of avoided emissions resulting from electricity substitution since average electricity production in Brazil is dominated by hydropower. Sensitivity analyses indicated, however, that the environmental impacts of incineration might decrease with different modeling assumptions, e.g. the modeling assumption regarding the kind of electricity production substituted by electricity production from MSW. Nevertheless, the main findings of the study remained the same and they are in line with the previous literature. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Bioaerosol Emissions during Organic Waste Treatment for Biopolymer
   Production: A Case Study
SO ATMOSPHERE
AB Environmentally sustainable methods of waste disposal are a strategic priority. For organic waste management and innovative biological treatments present advantageous opportunities, although organic waste treatment also includes environmental drawbacks, such as bioaerosol production. This study aims to evaluate bioaerosol spread during an innovative experimental treatment. The process consists of two anaerobic steps: acidogenesis, which includes polyhydroxyalkanoate accumulation, followed by methanogenesis. Bioaerosol, PM10, and endotoxin concentrations were measured at three sampling points during different campaigns to evaluate: (1) the background levels, (2) the contamination produced in the pre-treatment stage, and (3) the residual contamination of the outgoing digested sludge. Environmental PM10 seemed to be generally quite contained, while the endotoxin determination was close to 90 EU/m(3). Significant microbial concentrations were detected during the loading of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (fungi > 1300 CFU/m(3), Bacillus genus (approximate to 10(3) CFU/m(3)), higher Clostridium spp. and opportunistic human pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae), suggesting a significant contamination level. Such results are useful for hazard identification in the risk assessment of innovative processes, as they reveal contaminants potentially harmful to both workers' health and the environment.

TI Municipal solid waste treatment for bioenergy and resource production:
   Potential technologies, techno-economic-environmental aspects and
   implications of membrane-based recovery
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB World estimated municipal solid waste generating at an alarming rate and its disposal is a severe concern of today's world. It is equivalent to 0.79 kg/d per person footprint and causing climate change; health hazards and other environmental issues which need attention on an urgent basis. Waste to energy (WTE) considers as an alternative renewable energy potential to recover energy from waste and reduce the global waste problems. WTE reduced the burden on fossil fuels for energy generation, waste volumes, environmental, and greenhouse gases emissions. This critical review aims to evaluate the source of solid waste generation and the possible routes of waste management such as biological landfill and thermal treatment (Incineration, pyrolysis, and gasification). Moreover, a comparative evaluation of different technologies was reviewed in terms of economic and envi-ronmental aspects along with their limitations and advantages. Critical literature revealed that gasification seemed to be the efficient route and environmentally sustainable. In addition, a framework for the gasification process, gasifier types, and selection of gasifiers for MSW was presented. The country-wise solutions recom-mendation was proposed for solid waste management with the least impact on the environment. Furthermore, key issues and potential perspectives that require urgent attention to facilitate global penetration are highlighted. Finally, practical implications of membrane and comparison membrane-based separation technology with other conventional technologies to recover bioenergy and resources were discussed. It is expected that this study will lead towards practical solution for future advancement in terms of economic and environmental concerns, and also provide economic feasibility and practical implications for global penetration.

TI Environmental Impact Assessment of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW)
   Management in Florence, Italy
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Facing the trouble of municipal solid waste (MSW) management is a rising challenge of urbanized areas. Yearly data of waste management from the city of Florence (Italy) and neighboring municipalities were gathered over 2015 year. About 412105 t of waste were collected, where 202794 t were mixed-waste and 72540 t were organic. Fractions were treated in a centralized selecting-composting plant. The outgoing materials were further treated in external plants for additional selection, composting, incineration, landfilling. The present study was aimed to assess the environmental impact of such waste management applying LCA technique. The functional unit was "one year mixed and organic waste treatment at Florence and neighboring municipalities". System boundaries included waste collection, final transport, working of the selecting-composting plant. System expansion was used to account for energy recovery (electricity) from waste. Background data were sourced from ELCD-core3-LCI database. Life cycle impact assessment (classification and characterization) was performed by ILCD midpoint method. Sixteen impact categories were computed. Focusing on global warming potential (GWP), the functional unit impacts for roughly 6.99E+8kgCO2eq. This figure drops to 0.212E+8kgCO2eq if urban collection was not considered and further to 0.186E+8kgCO2eq if final transportation was excluded. Results underline the potential benefit of on-site treatment of waste.

TI Policy-driven municipal solid waste management assessment using relative
   quadrant eco-efficiency: A case study in Malaysia
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Despite studies encouraging sustainable waste management, most municipal wastes remain in landfills, partic-ularly in developing countries. Lack of holistic planning and national policy alignment might impair the waste management facility implementation. Policy-driven waste treatment scenarios should be designed to strongly link to the local conditions when assessing the eco-efficiency impacts of the waste management system. Taking Malaysia as a case study, a relative quadrant life cycle eco-efficiency indicator is developed to investigate the eco-efficiency of waste treatment scenarios. The relative quadrant life cycle eco-efficiency indicator depicts the eco-efficiency of various waste management scenarios. Compared with Scenario S1 - business-as-usual (i.e., 71.5% open landfill, 10% sanitary landfill, 1% composting, 17.5% recycling), five waste treatment scenarios (S2-S6) are designed based on Malaysia's existing and future policy targets. Scenario S5 (15.5% sanitary landfill, 22.25% composting, 22.25% anaerobic digestion, 40% recycling) and Scenario S6 (5% sanitary landfill, 22.25% com-posting, 22.25% anaerobic digestion, 40% recycling, 10.5% incineration) demonstrate that the 40% recycling rate is 32.9-33.6 times more environmentally favorable and 10-20% more economically viable than business-as -usual. Another four scenarios (NS1-NS4) are designed to investigate zero waste in landfills and the need to implement incineration or material recovery. Scenario NS3 suggests increasing incineration capacity to 33% could be an option should incineration is implemented. Adopting home or centralized windrow composting and increasing 2.5-5.5 times of current Feed-in Tariff rates are recommended to improve the eco-efficiency of the waste treatment scenarios. This study could facilitate policymakers to set waste minimization targets and in-centives through various scenarios via sensitivity and comparative analyses.

TI Environmental, energy, and economic analysis of integrated treatment of
   municipal solid waste and sewage sludge: A case study in China
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Incineration is well used to treat municipal solid wastes (MSW) but is difficult to treat sewage sludge (SS) because it requires a large amount of heat to remove high content of moisture in SS. Over 50 billion tons of SS are discharged annually in China, and the need for a better waste treatment strategy is urgent. This paper is to introduce a waste disposal technology referring to the integrated treatment of MSW and SS. Four scenarios were analyzed including Mono-incineration of MSW (Case 1) and SS (Case 2), co-incineration of SS and MSW by traditional (Case 3) and integrated ways (Case 4), in terms of environment, energy and economic impact by means of LCA, CED and TEA method. From the environmental perspective, the top four mid-point categories involving the largest effect on four cases are N-C (non-carcinogens), OLD (Ozone layer depletion), TET (Terrestrial eco-toxicity), and GWP (Global warming potential). Case 4 has the most positive effect on climate change and resources (-1.44 kg CO2 eq and -18 MJ, respectively) according to end-point categories. From the view of energy, Case 4 shows the best performance of energy efficiency, and significantly saves the non-renewable energy (0.21 t coal per ton feedstock compared with Case 3). From the economic part, Case 4 is preferentially potential with the best profit, cutting down 79.08% of cost in coal than that in Case 3. These results provide understandings of developing an effective approach for co-treating MSW and SS in the near future. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Composting Processes for Agricultural Waste Management: A Comprehensive
   Review
SO PROCESSES
AB Composting is the most adaptable and fruitful method for managing biodegradable solid wastes; it is a crucial agricultural practice that contributes to recycling farm and agricultural wastes. Composting is profitable for various plant, animal, and synthetic wastes, from residential bins to large corporations. Composting and agricultural waste management (AWM) practices flourish in developing countries, especially Pakistan. Composting has advantages over other AWM practices, such as landfilling agricultural waste, which increases the potential for pollution of groundwater by leachate, while composting reduces water contamination. Furthermore, waste is burned, open-dumped on land surfaces, and disposed of into bodies of water, leading to environmental and global warming concerns. Among AWM practices, composting is an environment-friendly and cost-effective practice for agricultural waste disposal. This review investigates improved AWM via various conventional and emerging composting processes and stages: composting, underlying mechanisms, and factors that influence composting of discrete crop residue, municipal solid waste (MSW), and biomedical waste (BMW). Additionally, this review describes and compares conventional and emerging composting. In the conclusion, current trends and future composting possibilities are summarized and reviewed. Recent developments in composting for AWM are highlighted in this critical review; various recommendations are developed to aid its technological growth, recognize its advantages, and increase research interest in composting processes.

TI Evaluation of potential environmental impacts related to two organic
   waste treatment options in Italy
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB This paper aims at evaluating the environmental impact of two types of organic fraction of municipal solid waste treatment techniques composting and anaerobic digestion with post-composting by using the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. The analysis concerns a facility of municipal solid waste selection and composting, which is located in Italy and where currently there is only a composting line. Two LCA implementations will be presented - one on the current status and one on the future option where, according to the plant expansion plan, an anaerobic digestion line is expected to be introduced. This line will allow obtaining electricity and heat as a result of a cogeneration process fuelled by the produced biogas. Following the characterisation results, currently the compost production phase assumes the highest values in 9 out of 18 analysed impact categories, while the landfill phase prevails in the remaining 9. As far as the option to be implemented in the future is concerned, the stage that affects the most (for 8 categories) is sewage treatment, followed by landfill (6 of them) and finally by the compost production (for the remaining 4). The parallel analysis of the two organic waste treatment methods showed that the best one is the anaerobic/composting digestion solution, obtaining lower scores with respect to the sole composting option (apart from the photochemical formation of oxidants impact category).

TI Environmental sustainability of an integrate anaerobic
   digestion-composting treatment of food waste: Analysis of an Italian
   plant in the circular bioeconomy strategy
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB In light of the adoption of recent global policies and strategies for a more sustainable food waste management system and a greater control of environmental impacts, this study describes a circular bioeconomy plant model, currently operating in South Italy, for treatment and enhancement of organic fraction of municipal solid waste. The key basis for plant activity is dry anaerobic digestion of separately collected organic fraction of municipal solid waste (SC-OFMSW) followed by digestate composting process. Biomethane for use in the transport sector is obtained by biogas cleaning and upgrading, while high-quality compost for organic farming is produced by digestate composting. Plant activities are completed by the transformation of part of the produced waste into refuse derived fuel (RDF) to be allocated to waste-to-energy plants and the treatment of odour emissions which allows the recovery of ammonium sulphate as a fertilizer. A rooftop photovoltaic system supplies most of electric energy needed by the plant. For plant activities relative to 2020, carbon footprint was equal to -112 kg CO(2)eq. for Mg of organic waste, while depletion of fossil resources was estimated at-89.6 kg oil eq. Mg-1 of waste. Primary energy demand of food waste treatment system was-2.66 GJ Mg-1 of input waste. Replacement of natural gas with biomethane for transport sector provided the greatest improvement contribution for all the examined categories.

TI Life cycle assessment of MSW-to-energy schemes in Thailand
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Life cycle assessment was performed to evaluate environmental impacts of two municipal solid waste (MSW) to energy schemes currently practiced in Thailand: incineration and anaerobic digestion. Potential impacts such as global warming, acidification, stratospheric ozone depletion, and photo-oxidant formation were avoided due to net electricity production and also fertilizer production as by-products from the anaerobic digestion scheme. In addition, the anaerobic digestion resulted in the higher net energy output compared to the incineration scheme. However, the incineration had less potential impact for nutrient enrichment. The LCA results were also useful in determining where the improvements could be made for both the schemes. In order to adopt a sustainable waste management system elsewhere in the country, decision makers may need to consider a combination of techniques, or an integrated method of management. LCA could serve as an invaluable tool for such an analysis. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Critical review on technological advancements for effective waste
   management of municipal solid waste - Updates and way forward
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION
AB Rise in industrialization and urbanization has resulted in problems like uprising energy demand, voluminous waste generation, and environmental effects. As a consequence, implementing an efficient solid waste management strategy is gaining momentum. The urgency becomes more evident as out of 17 Sustainable Development Goals majority of goals and their targets have a direct link to solid waste management. Public awareness is essential for proper waste management as well as social and demographic issues. The present review intends to expand the literature about recent technological advancements in the area of minimizing waste content and electricity generation. It also covers the conversion of energy from waste with the help of techniques like incineration, gasification, plasma gasification, co-gasification, composting, vermicomposting, co-composting, anaerobic digestion, and co-digestion. These techniques are utilized to convert municipal solid waste into a suitable source for renewed energy that produces heat and electricity and other byproducts in risk-free and environmentally friendly way(s). More precisely, this paper focuses on the enhanced generation of biogas. This review also highlights challenges, knowledge gaps, and future research direction(s). (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI Solid waste treatment as a high-priority and low-cost alternative for
   greenhouse gas mitigation
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The increased concern about environmental problems caused by inadequate waste management, as well as the concern about global warming, promotes actions toward a sustainable management of the organic fraction of the waste. Landfills. the most common means to dispose of municipal solid waste (MSW), lead to the conversion of the organic waste to biogas, containing about 50% methane, a very active greenhouse gas (GHG). One unit of methane has a global warming potential of 21 computed for a 100-year horizon or 56 computed for 20 years. The waste sector in Israel contributes 13% of total greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions for a time horizon of 100 years (for a time horizon of 20 years, the waste sector contribution equals to more than 25% of total GHG emissions). The ultimate goal is to minimize the amount of methane (CH4) by converting it to CO2. This can be achieved by physicochemical means (e.g., landfill gas flare, incineration) or by biological processes (e.g., composting. anaerobic digestion). Since the waste in Israel has a high organic material content, it was found that the most cost-effective means to treat the degradable organic components is by aerobic composting (investment of less than US$ 10 to reduce emission of one ton CO2 equivalent per year). Another benefit of this technology is the ability to implement it within a short period. The suggested approach, which should be implemented especially in developing countries, could reduce a significant amount of GHG at relatively low cost and short time. The development of a national policy for proper waste treatment can be a significant means to abate GHG emissions in the short term, enabling a gain in time to develop other means for the long run. In addition, the use of CO2 quotas will credit the waste sector and will promote profitable proper waste management.

AB Application and development of municipal solid waste treatment technology depends on various socio-economic and environmental factors. All those factors are work as development drivers for waste management systems. The study aims to identify key drivers from case studies of waste management development trend in Sweden. Social, economic and environmental drivers are identified and presented in this study. The study identifies personal behaviour, local waste management practice, consumption and generation of waste as the key social drivers. Resource value of waste, economic benefit from waste treatment facilities and landfill tax have been acknowledged as economic drivers for developing waste treatment technology. Moreover, global climate change, environmental movement and awareness have been working as environmental drivers for developing various waste treatment methods in Sweden. In addition, the study aims to analyse emerging waste treatment technologies based on a number of literature review and questionnaire survey. Dry composting, pyrolysis-gasification, plasma arc, and anaerobic digestion have been identified as potential emerging technologies for waste management systems in Sweden.

TI Environmental Impact Evaluation of Current Municipal Solid Waste
   Treatments in India Using Life Cycle Assessment
SO ENERGIES
AB An environmental life cycle assessment was conducted to compare proposed municipal solid waste treatment systems with the existing system in Visakhapatnam, India. Five waste alternative treatment systems, including open dumping of municipal solid waste (S1), landfill without gas recovery [LFWGR] (S2), landfill with gas recovery (S3), anaerobic digestion + LFWGR (S4), and incineration + LFWGR (S5). EASETECH(TM) was considered for assessment using ReCiPE Midpoint (Heuristic) world environmental impact assessment method. Global warming potential (GWP), terrestrial acidification (TA), freshwater eutrophication (FEW), marine water eutrophication (ME), human toxicity (HTP), terrestrial ecotoxicity (TE), freshwater ecotoxicity (FWT), and marine ecotoxicity (MET) impacts were determined for each option. The existing MSW disposal practice in Visakhapatnam city (baseline scenario, S1) has the highest GWP (1107 kg CO2 eq.), which can potentially be reduced to 68.2%, 81.5%, 98.2%, and 94.5% by alternative waste management scenarios S2, S3, S4 and S5, respectively. Scenario S4, involving the use of anaerobic digestion of food waste and residues dumped in engineered landfill without energy recovery was found to be the option with the highest mitigation potential of most of the impacts, and it contributes to significant environmental benefits in terms of ecological footprints in a low-income country such as India. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to confirm the reasonable legitimacy of data used for the determination of the impacts.

TI Efficient approach for improving municipal solid waste management in
   Oman: towards sustainable development
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Sultanate of Oman faces the problem of rapid growth in waste generation, and other than limited recycling there are no waste treatment facilities. This situation demands for an optimum waste management plan to divert waste from landfills and to reduce the environmental impacts. In this study, analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was utilised to incorporate the priorities of several criteria and four waste management scenarios into the hierarchy structure based on the preferences of experts and stakeholders. This study concludes that the economic and environmental criteria rank the highest when deciding on the best waste management plan for Oman. The results show that scenario 2, which integrates incineration with the current practice of landfilling, is the optimal approach for the situation of Oman. Scenarios 2 and 3 that involved source separation of waste along with anaerobic digestion and recycling respectively, ranked in the middle; while the status quo presented in scenario 1 performed worst.

TI Comparative life cycle environmental impacts of two scenarios for
   managing an organic fraction of municipal solid waste in Rasht-Iran
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Population growth and increasing rapidly expanding urbanization in developing countries have led to an increase in municipal solid waste. Accordingly, the municipal solid waste management is a challenging and revolute issue which requires more informed decision making by authorities and experts from a variety of perspectives. Various methods have been suggested for the treatment of municipal solid waste to solve the problems and challenges. However, environmental sustainability should be considered by decision-makers in different ways. The life cycle assessment as a tool can help authorities and experts in the selection of stability methods of municipal solid waste management. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate and compare two scenarios, namely, composting and anaerobic digestion, for managing the organic fraction of municipal solid waste of Rasht city, Iran from an environmental sustainability perspective. Life cycle assessment was used to evaluate the environmental impact of composting and anaerobic digestion of organic fraction of municipal solid waste. In this study, the functional unit is defined as 100 t municipal solid waste and the system boundaries include all proceedings for municipal solid waste transportation from the city to the end of the production process in each scenario. The results showed that the treatment of organic wastes by the anaerobic digestion scenario compared with the composting scenario leads to a reduction of 66.67% in damage to human health, 47.84% in damage to ecosystem quality, and 89.64% in the climate change. Also, the result represents that the treatment of organic wastes by the anaerobic digestion scenario leads to a redaction 21 times in damage to resources compared with when organic wastes are treated by composting scenario. More specifically, the presented results in this study showed anaerobic digestion scenario owing to the treatment of organic wastes and convert them into value-added material/energy has favorable environmental impacts.

TI An incentive-based source separation model for sustainable municipal
   solid waste management in China
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) management (MSWM) is most important and challenging in large urban communities. Sound community-based waste management systems normally include waste reduction and material recycling elements, often entailing the separation of recyclable materials by the residents. To increase the efficiency of source separation and recycling, an incentive-based source separation model was designed and this model was tested in 76 households in Guiyang, a city of almost three million people in southwest China. This model embraced the concepts of rewarding households for sorting organic waste, government funds for waste reduction, and introducing small recycling enterprises for promoting source separation. Results show that after one year of operation, the waste reduction rate was 87.3%, and the comprehensive net benefit under the incentive-based source separation model increased by 18.3 CNY tonne(-1) (2.4 Euros tonne(-1)), compared to that under the normal model. The stakeholder analysis (SA) shows that the centralized MSW disposal enterprises had minimum interest and may oppose the start-up of a new recycling system, while small recycling enterprises had a primary interest in promoting the incentive-based source separation model, but they had the least ability to make any change to the current recycling system. The strategies for promoting this incentive-based source separation model are also discussed in this study.

TI Effect of different environmental conditions on the growth and
   development of Black Soldier Fly Larvae and its utilization in solid
   waste management and pollution mitigation
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION
AB The current waste treatment techniques in developing countries do not meet the standards of appropriate waste management systems. Poor waste management leads to serious environmental issues at the local and global levels, for which an effective and sustainable waste disposal system is in urgent need. Due to its proven waste degradation and biotransformation capabilities, the Black Soldier Fly (BSF) provides a potential and economical alternative to recycling biological waste. The current study investigated the interactions between municipal and organic waste with the help of Black Soldier Fly Larvae (BSFL) as a growing medium for substrate culture by comparing the physicochemical parameters of waste before and after BSFL treatment of municipal and organic waste. The study results revealed that BSFL can improve the quality of the final product and promote the degradation of organic waste, although BSFL cannot effectively directly degrade municipal solid waste, it can reduce municipal solid waste by efficiently degrading organic waste. The optimal environmental conditions for BSFL breeding and growth was summarized in this study, and the environmental conditions of four seasons of four representative cities in different location of Pakistan were collected and analyzed. The most suitable cities for the development of the BSFL waste treatment system were first inferred, which makes basic research for developing an economical and feasible waste treatment system in Pakistan. A comprehensive legal framework regarding integrated MSW management systems should be introduced and implemented in Pakistan, including that local municipal authorities should collect the waste collection fee.

TI Systems engineering opportunities for agricultural and organic waste
   management in the food-water-energy nexus
SO CURRENT OPINION IN CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Managing food, water, and energy waste streams leads to more sustainable production, consumption, and distribution processes in the food-water-energy nexus (FWEN). Agricultural and organic waste streams within the FWEN can be difficult to manage due to both volume and their potential environmental impacts. However, they are also often characterized by a rich mix of organic compounds, ripe for conversion into energy or value-added products. Process systems engineering (PSE) stands uniquely positioned to understand the interconnections between food, water, and energy of agricultural and food wastes, wastewater, and municipal solid waste (MSW). Targeted advances in systems analysis as well as design and optimization of integrated FWEN waste management technologies and processes are expected to have the greatest impact. When building integrated mathematical models, care must be taken to consider waste treatment not as an independent process unaffected by the FWEN, but as a core component of the FWEN, connected to all nexus resources and systems.

TI Assessing the economic and environmental sustainability of household
   food waste management in the UK: Current situation and future scenarios
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The value embedded in food waste is increasingly being recognised, with the UN targeting a 50% reduction in consumer food waste and the EU recycling of 60% of all household waste, both by 2030. Aiming to provide guidance on the most sustainable food waste utilisation routes, this study evaluates the life cycle environmental and economic sustainability of five plausible scenarios for the year 2030. Focusing on the UK for context, these are compared to the current treatment of food waste as well as to its potential future prevention. The scenarios consider a differing share of four widely-used treatment methods: anaerobic digestion, in-vessel composting, incineration and landfilling. The scenario with the highest anaerobic digestion share that recovers both heat and electricity is the best option for seven out of 19 environmental impacts and the second best for life cycle costs. Upgrading anaerobic digestion biogas to biomethane achieves the lowest global warming potential and life cyde costs. Net-negative global warming potential (savings) can be achieved if the heat from anaerobic digestion and incineration or biomethane are utilised to displace natural gas. Displacing a future electricity mix does not lead to significant global warming potential savings due to the expected grid decarbonisation. However, savings are still achieved for metal depletion and human and terrestrial toxicities as they are higher for decarbonised grid electricity due to the increased share of renewables. A greater share of in-vessel composting leads to higher impacts because of the high electricity consumption. Landfill reduction has an economic advantage for all the scenarios, except for the business-as-usual, with life cycle costs 11-75% lower than for the current situation. While future scenarios improve the overall sustainability compared to the current situation, halving food waste by 2030 can save 15 times more greenhouse gas emissions than the best treatment scenario without waste reduction. Therefore, any commitments to improve the sustainability of food waste treatment must be accompanied by an effective waste prevention strategy. The outcomes of this work can help waste treatment operators and policy makers towards more sustainable food waste management. Although the focus is on UK situation, the overall conclusions and recommendations are applicable to other regions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Life cycle assessment of BMT based integrated municipal solid waste
   management: Case study in Pudong, China
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Biological and mechanical treatment (BMT) is a newly developed integrated municipal solid waste (MSW) management pretreatment process. Based on recommended BMT-based integrated MSW management system, life cycle assessment is employed to compare the environmental impact potential (EIP) of three BMT based waste treatment strategies (BMT-compost, BMT incineration and BMT landfill) with traditional landfill and incineration in Pudong New Area of Shanghai. The results show that the incineration process of MSW presents the highest acidification potential, and landfill presents both the highest global warming potential and eutrophication potential. Meanwhile, EIP of BMT-compost, BMT-incineration and BMT landfill are all decreased greatly when BMT technology is introduced into municipal solid waste management. The total environmental impact potential (TEIP) of landfill is 1.5 times larger than that of BMT-landfill. And the TEIP of incineration is also 1.5 times larger than that of BMT incineration while the TEIP of BMT compost is the lowest. The result verifies that BMT-based MSW management model would be environmentally reasonable and helpful to develop integrated MSW management system in Pudong. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI Optimal process network for municipal solid waste management in Iskandar
   Malaysia
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Ineffective management of municipal solid waste (MSW) may cause degradation of valuable land resources and create long-term environmental and human health problems. A sustainable and efficient waste management strategy is needed to balance the need for development, the quality of human life and the environment. This study aims to synthesis a MSW processing network to produce energy and value-added products for achieving economic and environmental competitiveness. An optimisation model that integrates four major utilisation technologies was incorporated to facilitate a cost-effective processing network. The model is able to predict the best mix of waste treatment technologies, forecast the production of by-product from waste treatment process, estimate the facility capacity, forecast the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission of the system, and eventually generate an optimal cost-effective solution for municipal solid waste management (MSWM). Four scenarios for MSWM were considered to analyse the economic impact of different waste utilisation alternatives: i) the business as usual (BAU) scenario as a baseline study, ii) the waste-to-energy (WTE) scenario, iii) the waste-to-recycling (WTR) scenario, and iv) the mixed technology (MIXTECH) scenario. The MIXTECH scenario was able to provide the best mix of waste utilisation technologies. The optimal waste allocation in terms of percentage involved landfill gas recovery system (LFGRS) (14%), mass burn incineration (3%), material recycling facilities (MRF) (56%), and composting (27%). The optimal scenario would be able to achieve the renewable energy (RE) target, achieve the recycling target and promote composting as the waste reduction alternative for the region being studied. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for the optimal or MIXTECH scenario to examine the effect of the RE target and GHG emission reduction target with respect to the system cost and waste allocation to each technology. The proposed mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model was applied for Iskandar Malaysia (IM) as a case study. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Technologies for Municipal Solid Waste Treatment: A Case Study of Surat,
   India
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS TOXIC AND RADIOACTIVE WASTE
AB In this study, the energy, economic, and environmental (3E) analysis on two waste-to-energy (WtE) technologies, for example, anaerobic digestion (AD) and incineration, for the treatment of municipal solid waste in Surat (Gujarat, India) was conducted. For energy criteria, the potential for energy recovery from municipal solid wastes (MSW) through AD and incineration was considered. The economic analysis that was carried out considered preprocessing, transportation, land, capital investment, and operational and maintenance costs that were incurred. The revenue that was generated by selling the electricity and compost was considered along with the recycling value of the paper waste. For environmental analysis, the global warming and acidification potentials (APs) were considered from the emissions that were produced during the treatment, transport, and disposal along with the displaced emissions. The results indicated that the average daily solid waste generation from Surat was 0.33 kg/person and the average total solid waste generation was 2080 t/day. Organic waste was the largest fraction (35.6%) followed by inert waste (13.5%), construction and demolition waste (12.4%), and recyclable waste, such as glass, rubber, and metal (11.2%). AD had less energy generation potential (9.89 MW) compared with incineration (16.99 MW). From an economic perspective, incineration had a higher profit (INR 1.48 million/day) than AD (INR 1.38 million/day). The environmental analysis showed that incineration had greater potential to reduce global warming and acidification compared with AD. The 3E analysis revealed that incineration was the superior technology choice.

TI Life cycle assessment of potential municipal solid waste management
   strategies for Mumbai, India
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Dumping of municipal solid waste into uncontrolled dumpsites is the most common method of waste disposal in most cities of India. These dumpsites are posing a serious challenge to environmental quality and sustainable development. Mumbai, which generates over 9000t of municipal solid waste daily, also disposes of most of its waste in open dumps. It is important to analyse the impact of municipal solid waste disposal today and what would be the impact under integrated waste management schemes. In this study, life cycle assessment methodology was used to determine the impact of municipal solid waste management under different scenarios. Six different scenarios were developed as alternatives to the current practice of open dumping and partially bioreactor landfilling. The scenarios include landfill with biogas collection, incineration and different combinations of recycling, landfill, composting, anaerobic digestion and incineration. Global warming, acidification, eutrophication and human toxicity were assessed as environmental impact categories. The sensitivity analysis shows that if the recycling rate is increased from 10% to 90%, the environmental impacts as compared with present scenario would reduce from 998.43kgCO(2) eqt(-1) of municipal solid waste, 0.124kgSO(2) eqt(-1), 0.46kgPO(4)(-3) eqt(-1), 0.44kg 1,4-DB eqt(-1) to 892.34kgCO(2) eqt(-1), 0.121kgSO(2) eqt(-1), 0.36kgPO(4)(-3) eqt(-1), 0.40kg 1,4-DB eqt(-1), respectively. An integrated municipal solid waste management approach with a mix of recycling, composting, anaerobic digestion and landfill had the lowest overall environmental impact. The technologies, such as incineration, would reduce the global warming emission because of the highest avoided emissions, however, human toxicity would increase.

In particular, anaerobic digestion has been discussed, as this technology is already being widely used in India and proves its sustainable effect. The high organic fraction content in MSW makes it suitable for anaerobic digestion and can be used sustainably. Besides, waste-to-energy (WTE) technology is very profitable due to biogas production out of organic waste and the generation of fertiliser out of the slurry. The result of this analysis on the current situation and prospects shows that India's biogas production is lower than its potential. This aspect is mainly due to non-functioning waste management, including separation, collection, and transport.

Five promising technologies in China are compared, including anaerobic digestion (AD), aerobic composting combined digestion (AC + AD), aerobic composting (AC), biochemical processor (BP), and anaerobic digestion combined feed processing technology (AD + FP). Results show that the rank of environmental impact is AD + FP > AD > BP > AC + AD > AC, while the rank of LCC is AC + AD > AD + FP > BP > AC > AD. Aerobic technology usually has a lower environmental impact, but slightly higher economic cost compared with anaerobic technology, about 188 CNY/t and 249 CNY/t, respectively. AD + FP has the best environmental performance (4.5E-11/t), and AC + AD has the best economic performance (5.3 CNY/t) due to profits from soil amendment selling. Mixed technologies AC + AD and AD + FP exhibit obvious better cost-benefit efficiency than single treatment technology AC or AD and thus are suggested to be set priority in food waste treatment. BP has relatively good performance and is worthy of consideration for regions with small treatment demand.

TI Life-cycle assessment of solid waste management in Dhulikhel
   Municipality, Nepal
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE
AB Solid waste management is becoming a major environmental and public health concern in emerging municipalities in Nepal. In this study, the life-cycle assessment (LCA) approach is used to address the environmental impacts of potential waste-treatment scenarios in Dhulikhel Municipality in Nepal. The assessment was based on four different scenarios - namely, scenario 1, landfilling; scenario 2, composting combined with landfilling; scenario 3, recycling, composting and landfilling; and scenario 4, recycling, anaerobic digestion and landfilling. The LCA methodology was developed, including the benefits and impact potentials of different unit processes in each scenario, also taking into consideration emissions from energy use. The environmental impacts from the scenarios were compared in terms of global warming potential, acidification potential and eutrophication potential. Among the four scenarios, scenario 4 (i.e. with anaerobic digestion) showed the most environmental advantage. Scenarios without biological treatment facilities are the least preferred option, as their impact is significantly greater than those of other options. Therefore, organic waste is recommended not to be disposed of in landfill sites even if the transportation activity increases, because the magnitude of methane avoidance increases with an increased amount of waste diversion to the biological treatment units.

TI Challenges and Priorities of Municipal Solid Waste Management in
   Cambodia
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) management is one of the utmost challenges for Cambodia's city and district centers. The unsound management of MSW has detrimentally affected the environment and human health. In the present study, an attempt has been made to provide a comprehensive insight into the generation and characteristics, policies and legislation frameworks, management arrangement, collection, treatment, and disposal of MSW. The experience of developed and developing countries and the challenges and priorities of MSW management in Cambodia are also highlighted. In Cambodia, about 4.78 million tons of MSW were generated in 2020, with a 0.78 kg/capita/day generation rate. Only 86% of cities and districts have access to MSW collection services. The current practice of MSW management is reliance on landfill (44%). There are 164 landfills operating countrywide, receiving about 5749 tons of MSW per day. Recycling, incineration, and composting share 4%, 4%, and 2% of MSW generation, respectively. In 2021, the total revenue that was recovered from recyclables was USD 56M. The study concludes several major challenges and proposes valuable suggestions, which may be beneficial for the improvement of the current system to support the sustainable management of MSW in Cambodia.

TI Seasonal characterization of municipal solid waste for selecting
   feasible waste treatment technology for Guwahati city, India
SO JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION
AB As quantities and composition of municipal solid waste (MSW) vary significantly with seasons, a seasonal characterization study is critical for developing an efficient MSW management system. MSW was characterized in three different seasons for selecting an appropriate waste treatment and management strategy for Guwahati city. Results of the study shows that the major components of the MSW were organics (42.2%) and plastic wastes (25.2%), which show high variations on a seasonal basis (22-49%). The chemical characterization of MSW revealed that on seasonal basis moisture content varies between 43.4% and 58.3%, pH between 5.5 and 6.5, volatile solid content from 32.9 to 58.9%, and the calorific value between 1203 and 3015 kcal/kg. Waste collected in the present study was a mixture of organics, recyclables, and inert material which is difficult and uneconomical for treatment in its present form. However, with proper waste segregation, bio-methanation, and composting could be sustainable waste treatment solutions due to the high moisture and volatile content of the MSW. Due to inadequate quantity, low calorific values, requirement of skilled supervision, and high capital investment, the thermochemical conversion of MSW may not be economically feasible for the present case. Implications: Present study is a novel attempt to analyze in-depth variation in the municipal solid waste (MSW) composition and properties in different seasons and how does it influence the selection and feasibility of the available waste treatment technologies. Search on Google scholar shows that only seven articles have been published till now which evaluated seasonal impact of MSW. Out to these published studies only one study have calculated energy potential of MSW on seasonal basis which is mainly restricted to incineration only. In-depth analysis of seasonal variation on anaerobic digestion, composting, refuse derived fuel (RDF), pyrolysis, and gasification is yet to determine. Furthermore, to best of our knowledge so far in India there was no such in-depth study has been published related to seasonal variation in MSW on large scale (city level). Present study provides in-depth valuable information regarding degree of variation in MSW composition and how does it affect resource recovery out of waste, which was not studied before in-depth before. Outcomes of the present study will definitely assist engineers and policymaker involved MSW management and planning for large urban areas to fulfil their sustainability goals.

TI Developing a sustainability solid waste treatment portfolio for 3Ps
   (planet-prosperity-people) nexus
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Municipal solid waste requires effective management to avoid adverse environmental impacts, such as pollution emissions and leachate discharge, and to enhance economic feasibility and societal acceptance. The current waste policy lacks the synergistic and integrated effect of the 3Ps dimensions - planet (environment), prosperity (economic), and people (social) - leading to unsustainable municipal solid waste management. This study develops a novel 3Ps nexus graphical portfolio that can be universally adoptable in various regions to quantitatively evaluate the life cycle sustainability of solid waste facilities relative to business-as-usual (i.e., open landfill). The 3Ps assessments, which share the backbone of life cycle analysis, are conducted to form the portfolio. Taking Malaysia as a case study, mechanical material recovery facility is the most sustainable solid waste facility, outperforming open landfill by 7.5 (environmental), 2.7 (economic), and 1.95 (social) times, followed by incineration, anaerobic digestion, tunnel composting, and sanitary landfill. Mechanical material recovery facility (-67.7 Pt) and incineration (-9.26 Pt) are the only solid waste treatment facilities with net environmental benefits due to the 298-and 4.18-times environmental saving effect, respectively, from their generated valueadded by-product. Ten scenarios are further analysed, combining existing national municipal solid waste policies and zero-landfill targets. A scenario with 40% recycling is the most sustainable scenario for fulfilling the 3Ps. Recycling is recommended to be coupled with tunnel composting and anaerobic digestion to treat heterogeneous waste, rendering the scenario 1.04-33 times more sustainable than other integrated scenarios. To align with the 2030 Agenda, waste segregation is essential for sustainable waste management and can be supported by technology improvement, financial subsidy, and legislative enforcement.

SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Biochemical quantitative characterization of biomass is becoming of key importance with the awareness and implementation of the fourth industrial revolution (FIR) and specifically in waste to energy recovery technologies. In this study, we investigated the quantification, characterization and anaerobic digestion of organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW), sewage sludge, animal manure and agricultural waste as a substrate for potential alternative clean fuel production to meet the ever-rising energy demand. The basis of comparison included ultimate analysis and proximate analysis for better understanding of the characteristic of biomass for waste to energy application. Existing quantitative and characterization methods for physical and chemical properties were analyzed and reviewed using collected samples. The substrates analysis showed physio-chemical properties of significant energy value, like that of natural gas. Biochemical methane potential test (BMP) showed high feasibility for methane production with mono and co-digestion of animal waste, sewage sludge, OFMSW and agriculture waste. The results of the quantitative characterization and BMP test would contribute to affordable, sustainable, reliable, carbon-neutral form of modern energy and development of adequate waste to energy recovery management strategies.

TI A Review on Characteristics, Techniques, and Waste-to-Energy Aspects of
   Municipal Solid Waste Management: Bangladesh Perspective
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) management has become a major concern for developing countries. The physical and chemical aspects of MSW management and infrastructure need to be analyzed critically to solve the existing socio-economic problem. Currently, MSW production is 2.01 billion tonnes/yr. In developing countries, improper management of MSW poses serious environmental and public health risks. Depending on the socio-economic framework of a country, several MSW management procedures have been established, including landfilling, thermal treatment, and chemical treatment. Most of the MSW produced in underdeveloped and developing countries such as Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan is dumped into open landfills, severely affecting the environment. Waste-to-Energy (WTE) projects based on thermal treatments, e.g., incineration, pyrolysis, and gasification, can be feasible alternatives to conventional technologies. This research has explored a comprehensive method to evaluate MSW characteristics and management strategies from a global and Bangladesh perspective. The benefits, challenges, economic analysis, and comparison of MSW-based WTE projects have been analyzed concisely. Implementing the WTE project in developing countries can reduce unsupervised landfill and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Alternative solutions and innovations have been discussed to overcome the high capital costs and infrastructural deficiencies. By 2050, Bangladesh can establish a total revenue (electricity sales and carbon credit revenue) of USD 751 million per year in Dhaka and Chittagong only. The landfill gas (LFG) recovery, waste recycling. and pyrolysis for energy production, syngas generation, and metal recovery are possible future directions of MSW management. The MSW management scenario in developing countries can be upgraded by improving waste treatment policies and working with government, academicians, and environmentalists together.

SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB Municipal food waste (FW) represents 35-45% of household residual waste in Australia, with the nation generating 1.6 Tg annually. It is estimated that 91% of this FW ends up in landfill. This study used life cycle assessment to determine and compare the environmental impact of seven contemporary FW management systems for two real-life jurisdictions; incorporating the complete waste service and expanding the system to include inert and garden waste. Although, no system exhibited a best ranking across all impact categories, FW digestion based systems were all revealed to have a lower global warming potential than composting and landfilling systems. Mechanical biological treatment, anaerobic co-digestion, and home composting all demonstrated the lowest environmental impacts for two or more of the environmental impact categories assessed. The assessment included market and technological specific variables and uncertainties providing a framework for robust decision making at a municipality level.

TI Economic Feasibility and Sustainability Assessment of Residual Municipal
   Solid Waste Management Scenarios in NSW, Australia
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This study evaluates the economic cost and sustainability of treating residual municipal solid waste (MSW) through five waste management scenarios. In the baseline scenario (Bsc), all waste was managed through landfilling, while in scenario 1 (Sc1) all waste was treated by incineration. Sc2 employed anaerobic digestion (AD) for food waste and landfilling, and Sc3 treated the waste through AD for food waste, incineration of combustible and plastic wastes, and landfilling. Sc4 treated the waste using AD, incineration, landfilling, and recycling of the plastic waste. The economic cost of waste management scenarios was estimated by calculating different economic variables, such as gate fees, including capital and operating costs, governmental incentives and levies, and also the potential of employed waste treatment technologies for resource recovery. The results revealed that Sc3 has the lowest economic cost of 238.1 mAUD/year, followed by Sc1 (261.9 mAUD/year), while Bsc proved to be the highest cost at 476.1 mAUD/year for MSW treatment. It was noticed that scenarios employing incineration had lower economic costs compared to Bsc and Sc2, mainly because incineration resulted in higher electricity generation and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The sustainability assessment results confirmed that Sc3 had the lowest and Bcs the highest total economic cost and environmental damage.

TI Greenhouse Gas Emission Mitigation Relevant to Changes in Municipal
   Solid Waste Management System
SO JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION
AB Standard methods for assessing the environmental impact of waste management systems are needed to underpin the development and implementation of sustainable waste management practice. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool for comprehensively ensuring such assessment and covers all impacts associated with waste management. LCA is often called "from cradle to grave" analysis. This paper integrates information on the greenhouse gas (GHG) implications of various management options for some of the most common materials in municipal solid waste (MSW). Different waste treatment options for MSW were studied in a system analysis. Different combinations of recycling (cardboard, plastics, glass, metals), biological treatment (composting), and incineration as well as land-filling were studied. The index of environmental burden in the global warming impact category was calculated. The calculations are based on LCA methodology. All emissions taking place in the whole life cycle system were taken into account. The analysis included "own emissions," or emissions from the system at all stages of the life cycle, and "linked emissions," or emissions from other sources linked with the system in an indirect way. Avoided emissions caused by recycling and energy recovery were included in the analysis. Displaced emissions of GHGs originate from the substitution of energy or materials derived from waste for alternative sources. The complex analysis of the environmental impact of municipal waste management systems before and after application of changes in MSW systems according to European Union regulations is presented in this paper. The evaluation is made for MSW systems in Poland.

TI The adaptation of waste-to-energy technologies: towards the conversion
   of municipal solid waste into a renewable energy resource
SO ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS
AB Currently, there are an estimated 1.3 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste (MSW) generated per year globally, and this quantity is predicted to increase to 2.2 billion tonnes annually by 2025. If not well treated, this rapid growth of waste products can lead to socio-economic and environmental problems. Waste is potentially a misplaced valuable resource that can be converted and utilized in different ways such as renewable energy resources for the realization of sustainable development. Presently, waste-to-energy technologies (WtETs) are considered to be an encouraging advanced technology that is applied to convert MSW into a renewable energy resource (methane, biogas, biofuels or biodiesel, ethanol, syngas, or alcohol). WtETs can be biochemical (fermentation, anaerobic digestion, landfill with gas capture, and microbial fuel cell), thermochemical (incineration, thermal gasification, and pyrolysis), or chemical (esterification). This review mainly aims to provide an overview of the applications of these technologies by focusing on anaerobic digestion as biological (nonthermal) treatment technologies, and incineration, pyrolysis, and gasification processes as thermal treatment processes. Landfill gas utilization technologies, biological hydrogen production processes, and microbial fuel cells also are assessed. In addition, the contemporary risks and challenges of WtETs are reviewed.

TI Smart Approaches to Food Waste Final Disposal
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Food waste, among the organic wastes, is one of the most promising substrates to be used as a renewable resource. Wide availability of food waste and the high greenhouse gas impacts derived from its inappropriate disposal, boost research through food waste valorization. Several innovative technologies are applied nowadays, mainly focused on bioenergy and bioresource recovery, within a circular economy approach. Nevertheless, food waste treatment should be evaluated in terms of sustainability and considering the availability of an optimized separate collection and a suitable treatment facility. Anaerobic codigestion of waste-activated sludge with food waste is a way to fully utilize available anaerobic digestion plants, increasing biogas production, energy, and nutrient recovery and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Codigestion implementation in Europe is explored and discussed in this paper, taking into account different food waste collection approaches in relation to anaerobic digestion treatment and confirming the sustainability of the anaerobic process based on case studies. Household food waste disposal implementation is also analyzed, and the results show that such a waste management system is able to reduce GHG emissions due to transport reduction and increase wastewater treatment performance.

Thus, the development of optimal waste management strategies has been a priority for the European Commission, especially in the transition toward a circular economy. In this paper, an analysis of different MSW treatment methods that can be effectively implemented in the Region of Central Macedonia (RCM) is provided, and their comparison from an environmental point of view is performed. The assessment is based on real data indicated in the recently updated Greek National Waste Management Plan, whereas the different scenarios developed include landfilling without energy recovery, landfilling with energy recovery, recycling and secondary materials recovery, mechanical-biological treatment, bio-waste composting and anaerobic digestion with energy recovery, and incineration with energy recovery. The obtained results illustrate that efficient waste streams sorting is of vital importance for the effective implementation of an integrated waste management system toward the sustainable management of MSW.

TI Evaluation of compositional characteristics of organic waste shares in
   municipal solid waste in fast-growing metropolitan cities of India
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB India currently has the second largest urban population worldwide, while facing an increasing burden on its urban solid waste infrastructure. To develop sustainable approaches for solid waste management in Indian cities, detailed information on urban and suburban waste characteristics are fundamental. A comprehensive municipal solid waste (MSW) analysis for the city of Bangalore showed that organic waste (OFMSW) shares in urban household waste amount 59.0, 63.3 and 59.2% in low-density, medium-density and high-density population areas, respectively. Urban litter spot (LS) and street sweeping waste had comparatively lower OFMSW shares of 57.1 and 51.9%. In suburban LS, OFMSW shares were the lowest with 47.5%. With a confidence interval of 95%, the statistical analysis revealed that urban household and LS waste have the same source of generation. Screening sizes of 20, 60 and 80mm were found to be adequate for the urban MSW. The chemical analysis showed that all investigated waste streams do not comply with the Indian heavy metal standards for compost, with the highest pollution level post-rotting found in suburban OFMSW with Cr exceeding the Indian standards by 100%, Cu by 395% and Pb by 26%.

TI Analysis of Energy Recovery from Municipal Solid Waste and Its
   Environmental and Economic Impact in Tulkarm, Palestine
SO ENERGIES
AB Municipal solid waste management (SWM) is one of the most useful applications of renewable energy, supporting the market for renewable energy and assisting in environmental protection by reducing emissions. Sustainability is one of the key issues with solid waste management systems in developing countries, including Palestine. Waste-to-energy (WTE) technology is one of the greatest strategies for effectively managing solid waste. This study focuses mostly on waste management in Palestine's Tulkarm area. We conducted an evaluation of the potential of energy recovery from municipal solid waste through a number of approaches, such as incineration, gasification, anaerobic digestion, and landfilling. Additionally, the implications on the environment, human health, and economics were investigated. The results showed that anaerobic digestion recovered around 5156.15 kWh per day; whereas, incineration and gasification recovered about 40,986.60 and 14,663.88 kWh per day, respectively. The least recovered energy amount was roughly 3563.87 kWh per day, which was generated by landfilling technology. Additionally, the environmental analysis showed that anaerobic digestion could save around 48,362 tons of CO2 annually; meanwhile, incineration and gasification could save about 384,424 and 137,538 tons of CO2, respectively. The lowest quantity of emissions could be saved by landfilling, with about 33,427 tons saved yearly. The energy cost savings associated with each technology were also estimated. The results of the energy savings estimation showed that incineration had the highest saving of USD 4918.12; gasification and anaerobic digestion saved USD 1759.67 and USD 618.74, respectively. Whereas, landfilling had the lowest saving of about USD 427.66. A careful analysis of all aspects related to each technology, in comparison to the available waste treatment techniques, was carried out to propose a solution to cover the energy deficit in Tulkarm as a primary goal. Anaerobic digestion was found to be more environmentally advantageous and economically feasible and thus can be recommended to decision-makers and investors.

TI Environmental and economic analysis of management systems for
   biodegradable waste
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB The management system for solid and liquid organic waste affects the environment and surrounding technical systems in several ways. In order to decrease the environmental impact and resource use, biological waste treatment and alternative solutions for sewage treatment are often advocated. These alternatives include increased agricultural use of waste residuals. To analyse whether such proposed systems indicate improvements for the environment and its sustainability, systems analysis is a useful method The changes in environmental impact and resource use is not only a result of changes in waste treatment methods, but also largely a result of changes in surrounding systems (energy and agriculture) caused by changes in waste management practices. In order to perform a systems analysis, a substance-flow simulation model, the organic waste research model (ORWARE), has been used. The results are evaluated by using methodology from life cycle assessment (LCA). An economic analysis was also performed on three of the studied scenarios. The management system for solid organic waste and sewage in the municipality of Uppsala, Sweden, was studied. Three scenarios for different treatments of solid waste were analysed: incineration with heat recovery, composting, and anaerobic digestion. These three scenarios included conventional sewage treatment. A fourth scenario reviewed was anaerobic digestion of solid waste, using urine-separating toilets and separate handling of the urine fraction. The results are only valid for the case study and under the assumptions made. In this case study anaerobic digestion result in the lowest environmental impact of all the solid waste management systems, but is costly. Economically, incineration with heat recovery is the cheapest way to treat solid waste. Composting gives environmental advantages compared to incineration methods, without significantly increased costs. Urine separation, which may be implemented together with any solid waste treatment, has great advantages, particularly in its low impact on the environment. However, there is a large increase in acidification. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rapid urbanization, industrialization, and change of life style of people has increased the rate of solid waste generation by leaps and bounds in the developing countries. Municipal solid waste generation varies with place to place and the standard of living of the people residing in cities. Solid waste consists of organic matter, which undergoes degradation and produces foul smell, if not properly managed. Therefore management of the garbage had reached a very critical stage and now emphasis has been given to its collection, treatment, and final disposal. Generally in Indian cities, waste is collected and simply dumped outside the cities which are called as landfill sites. Any method of disposal other than composting will be uneconomical, required skilled person, and also pollute air, water, and soil. Large quantity of plant nutrients gets wasted in other methods of disposal. Composting is not a method of waste disposal but it is a method of recycling the waste. Municipal solid waste is one of the potential organic nutrient residues, which upon recycling leads to a valuable compost, which is vital for growth and development of plants. Sewage sludge is rich in micro-organisms, organic content, as well as nutrient elements. So in this study co-composting of municipal waste with sewage sludge has been taken up to conserve nutrients. In the present work studies were conducted on municipal solid waste, mixed with sewage sludge in different proportion, to check the technical viability of the integrated system of composting. Addition of sewage sludge to waste for composting not only increases decomposition rate and fertility value, it also solve the problem of sludge disposal from treatment plant. It will save the cost of sludge treatment. Municipal waste compost can be regarded as being valuable in soil management practices because of their organic matter content.

TI Biogas Harvesting from Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste as a
   Renewable Energy Resource in Malaysia: A Review
SO POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
AB The accumulation of organic fraction in municipal solid waste (OFMSW) is now:, becoming scarce globally due to population and economic boosts, especially in Malaysia. Municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills remain the predominant end-state for waste disposal in most developing countries. Unsustainable MSW management accelerates environmental degradation through landfill gaseous (LFG) emissions of mainly methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), which promote global warming that finally is affecting human health. Recently, harnessing CH4 from anaerobic digestion of solid waste has attracted more interest and promised betterment in MSW management. With its current amount of more than 50%, organic material in landfills is estimated to emit 310,225 CH4/year with carbon credit of US$ 85.93, which can potentially generate 2.20x10(9) kWh of electricity valued at US$ 220 million. This present work is a review manuscript that discusses the state-of-the-art anaerobic digestion of OFMSW as treatment in term of waste diversion from a landfill. The study also estimates the renewable energy potentials from OFMSW waste diversion. Finally, this paper discusses the benefits of harnessing biogas from the perspectives of environmental benefits, energy recovery, and economics.

AB Various municipal solid waste management (MSWM) technologies were evaluated using life-cycle analysis (LCA). The study aimed to compare different MSWM approaches: landfill with composting, anaerobic digestion (AD) combined with landfill, incineration and AD combined with incineration. The Impact 2002 +approach and Simapro 9.1.1.1 software using the Ecoinvent v3.6 database were used to compare environmental impacts. The study showed that landfill with composting had the highest environmental impact due to its high potential of global warming and depletion in ecosystem quality, while other scenarios showed reduced impacts. AD combined with incineration was found to have least environmental impact, mainly due to energy recovery from AD. The goal of the study was to determine more environmentally sustainable alternatives for MSWM using LCA within the system boundary.

TI Technologies for municipal solid waste management: Current status,

SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) is a reflection of the culture that generates it and has a negative impact on the health of the humans and the environment. In the global context, people are abandoning increasing volumes of garbage, and the content of that waste is becoming more complicated than it has ever been, as plastic and electronic consumer goods spread. At the same time, the world is rapidly urbanizing. These changes place a burden on cities to manage garbage appropriately on both a social and environmental level. Globally, extensive research has been conducted to develop a comprehensive MSW management system that includes treatment. The primary objective of this article is to examine municipal solid waste in eight of China's eastern coastal regions. With the use of this review, we found that MSW generation is increasing in Shandong, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces, but declining in other eastern coastal cities, provinces, and special zones. Furthermore, municipal solid waste in China is treated utilizing 52 percent landfill, 45 percent incineration, and 3 percent composting techniques, resulting in significantly lower usage efficiency than in developed countries. The effectiveness of China's municipal waste management system must be improved. In addition, this review examines MSW management issues and prospects in China, as well as recommendations for strengthening the MSW management system.

TI Critical review on life cycle assessment of conventional and innovative
   waste-to-energy technologies
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB In this study 315 peer-reviewed studies on environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) of waste-to-energy (WtE) technologies were critically analysed. The technologies considered were anaerobic digestion, hydrothermal carbonization, pyrolysis, gasification and incineration. It was found that overall increasingly more studies are concerned with LCA on waste-treatment systems. Although incineration and anaerobic digestion were primarily assessed, especially in recent years, a growing number of LCA-studies investigated advanced thermal treatment options. The geographical scope within the studies under review focused mainly on European (195 studies) and Asian (68 studies) regions.
   In regards to their quality, a majority of the analysed studies were marked by several shortcomings and showed poor compliance with the ISO 14040 and ISO 14044. 55 studies did not present a functional unit and >45% of all reviewed studies did not present a life cycle inventory. More than 50% of the reviewed studies omitted a sensitivity analysis and a comprehensive assessment of all impact categories was not present in most studies.
   By selecting studies that analysed two or more different WtE treatment options, the global warming potential and the acidification potential of the considered five different technologies were compared. By contrasting advanced treatment options against incineration, substantial environmental benefits of advanced treatment options could not be observed. However, only 34 studies fulfilled the criteria to be taken into account for this comparison. The main finding within this scope, was that anaerobic digestion and gasification seemed to outcompete incineration in the conversion process of waste. Cascaded waste treatment, i.e. combining several treatment technologies, was only present in few studies. Environmental benefits could be assigned to these treatment paths in most cases. Lastly, techno-economic aspects are highlighted and appropriate policies are deducted from the obtained results. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Future improvements on performance of an EU landfill directive driven
   municipal solid waste management for a city in England
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Sustainable municipal solid waste (MSW) management is regarded as one of the key elements for achieving urban sustainability via mitigating global climate change, recycling resources and recovering energy. Landfill is considered as the least preferable disposal method and the EU Landfill Directive (ELD) announced in 1999 requires member countries to reduce the volume of landfilled biodegradable materials. The enforcement of ELD initiated the evolution of MSW management system UK. This study depicted and assessed the transition and performance of MSW management after the millennium in Nottingham via materials flow analysis (MFA), as well as appropriately selected indicators based on the concept of waste management hierarchy and targets set in waste management regulations. We observed improvements in waste reduction, material recycling, energy recovery, and landfill prevention. During the period 2001/02 to 2016/17, annual waste generation reduced from 463 kg/Ca to 361 kg/Ca, the recycling and composting share increased from 4.6% to 44.4%, and the landfill share reduced from 54.7% to 7.3%. These signs of progress are believed to be driven by the ELD and the associated policies and waste management targets established at the national and local levels. An alternative scenario with food waste and textile separation at source and utilizing anaerobic digestion to treat separately collected organic waste is proposed at the end of this paper to fulfil the high targets set by local government and we further suggest that the recycling share may be improved by educating and supporting the public on waste separation at the sources.

TI Investigating the Correlation of Purchase Power Parity (PPP) with the
   Adopted Waste Management Method in EU28
SO SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The amount of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) generated mostly in large urban centers is a major problem. For a modern society, the proper management and treatment of MSW is imperative and necessary. However, each community has organized and installed different waste treatment methods based on environmental, social and economic criteria. In this paper, a comparative analysis of waste treatment methods that countries in EU28 have adopted based on economic factors for a time period of 2008-2017, is presented. Power Purchase Parity (PPP), production of MSW and population growth have been considered as to identify how these factors may influence or determine the selected waste management methods. From the results obtained, what should be highlighted is the decrease of MSW in the majority of countries in EU28, regardless of population growth. PPP seems to have no correlation with more ecofriendly waste treatment methods such as recycling and composting, while countries that started to invest in waste-to-energy in the initial years of the examined period (2008-2017), increased their confidence in this technology up until the present day, regardless of PPP formulation.

TI BIOGAS HARVESTING FROM ANAEROBICALLY DIGESTED FOOD WASTE: A REVIEW
SO APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Food waste (FW) is the largest and most problematic organic waste component in the solid waste management system around the world including Malaysia. In promoting renewable energy production, FW has enormous potential and is one of the most promising sources as it can be converted into energy due to high organic matter content found in this source. Improper handling of FW has adverse effects on humans and the environment. FW that ends up in landfills is capable of producing greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide which can lead to increased atmospheric temperature, climate change, and global warming as well as causing serious health hazards. Compared to landfilling, incineration, and composting, anaerobic digestion (AD) is considered the best treatment alternative in FW management. This paper reviews the efficacy of using FW AD for energy production, focusing on the critical factors influencing the digestion process, the characteristics of the FW and their impact on the AD process, and the method of anaerobic conversion of FW (batch or continuous) to methane. To enhance the AD of FW, the co-digestion and pretreatment method will also be discussed further in this review paper.

For SRF, co-combustion was compared with mass burn incineration. For organic waste, anaerobic digestion (AD) was compared with mass burn incineration. In the case of mass burn incineration, incineration with and without energy recovery was modelled. Biogas produced from anaerobic digestion was evaluated for use both as transportation fuel and for heat and power production. All relevant consequences for energy and resource consumptions, emissions to air, water and soil, upstream processes and downstream processes were included in the LCA. Energy substitutions were considered with respect to two different energy systems: a present-day Danish system based on fossil fuels and a potential future system based on 100% renewable energy. It was found that mass burn incineration of SRF with energy recovery provided savings in all impact categories, but co-combustion was better with respect to Global Warming (GW). If all heat from incineration could be utilized, however, the two alternatives were comparable for SRF. For organic waste, mass burn incineration with energy recovery was preferable over anaerobic digestion in most impact categories. Waste composition and flue gas cleaning at co-combustion plants were critical for the environmental performance of SRF treatment, while the impacts related to utilization of the digestate were significant for the outcome of organic waste treatment. The conclusions were robust in a present-day as well as in a future energy system. This indicated that mass burn incineration with efficient energy recovery is a very environmentally competitive solution overall. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Life cycle environmental performance of two restaurant food waste
   management strategies at Shenzhen, China
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Restaurant food waste (RFW) can be separated from other municipal solid waste (MSW) for individual treatment or treated together with other MSW, and it is disputed which option is the optimal strategy for MSW management in the practice of Shenzhen, China. To weigh pros and cons of RFW separation, a hybrid life cycle assessment is conducted to compare (S1) all MSW incineration and (S2) individual anaerobic digestion of RFW and other MSW incineration referring to the real situation. The results show that S2 reduces 10.6% carbon emission than S1, mainly owing to higher heat value of incineration feedstock and higher yield of electricity. In addition, the cumulative energy demands of S1 and S2 are - 6290 and - 6544 MJ/t MSW, and their energy efficiencies are 67.4 and 70.3%, respectively. Moreover, RFW separation reduces acidic gases emission due to the substitution effect of more energy products. Overall, source sorting of RFW is a sustainable model of MSW management at Shenzhen, and the result provides quantitative support for the strategy of RFW separation from MSW.

TI A Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis of Waste Treatment Options for Food
   and Biodegradable Waste Management in Japan
SO ENVIRONMENTS
AB Dealing with large-scale Food and Biodegradable Waste (FBW) often results in many logistical problems and environmental impacts to be considered. These can become great hindrances when the integration of solid waste management is concerned. Extra care is needed to plan such waste disposal or treatment services and facilities, especially with respect to the ecological impact. Decision-making with regards to the sustainable use of these facilities also involves tradeoffs between a number of conflicting objectives, since increasing one benefit may decrease the others. In this study a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is presented to evaluate different waste management options and their applicability in Japan. The analytical process aims at selecting the most suitable waste treatment option, using pairwise comparisons conducted within a decision hierarchy that was developed through the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). The results of this study show that anaerobic digestion should be chosen as the best FBW treatment option with regards to resource recovery. The study also presents some conditions and recommendations that can enhance the suitability of other options like incineration and composting.

TI Technological pathways for bioenergy generation from municipal solid
   waste: Renewable energy option
SO ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
AB World's biggest challenge today is safe disposal and treatment of municipal solid waste (MSW). This review presents an overview of pathways for the generation of the bioenergy from MSW, through the biological-chemical-thermal route of treatment, current status, deployment of biochemical-thermochemical conversion technologies for a biogenic fraction of MSW, its challenges and performance. Currently, key challenges posed to the world are energy security, waste management, and climate change. Out of these, waste management across the world is in the dejected state due to lack of proper treatment and conversion technologies. In recent times, pressure on the global environment increased for the use of renewable resources due to depleting fossil fuels. Energy from biomass waste is going to be one of the crucial and dominant sources of renewable energy harness in the future. Conversion of a biogenic fraction of MSW to energy will solve waste management issue as well as offers energy generation in a sustainable manner and can be termed as "Renewable Waste". This study provides technological pathways for the generation of biofuels using MSW biomass as a feedstock, and the technology progression of various pathways and gaps for implementation of these technologies were also analyzed in this study.

AB About 3600 tonnes food waste are discarded in the landfills in Hong Kong daily. It is expected that the three strategic landfills in Hong Kong will be exhausted by 2020. In consideration of the food waste management environment and community needs in Hong Kong, as well as with reference to the food waste management systems in cities such as Linkoping in Sweden and Oslo in Norway, a framework of food waste separation, collection, and recycling for food waste valorization is proposed in this paper. Food waste can be packed in an optic bag (i.e., a bag in green color), while the residual municipal solid waste (MSW) can be packed in a common plastic bag. All the wastes are then sent to the refuse transfer stations, in which food waste is separated from the residual MSW using an optic sensor. On the one hand, the sorted food waste can be converted into valuable materials (e.g., compost, swine feed, fish feed). On the other hand, the sorted food waste can be sent to the proposed Organic Waste Treatment Facilities and sewage treatment works for producing biogas. The biogas can be recovered to produce electricity and city gas (i.e., heating fuel for cooking purpose). Due to the challenges faced by the value-added products in Hong Kong, the biogas is recommended to be upgraded as a biogas fuel for vehicle use. Hopefully, the proposed framework will provide a simple and effective approach to food waste separation at source and promote sustainable use of waste to resource in Hong Kong.

TI Environmental, energy, and economic impact assessment of sludge
   management alternatives based on incineration
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB In this study, different management strategies for sewage sludge disposal were evaluated associated with environmental, energy, and economic impact, using life cycle assessment (LCA), cumulative energy demand (CED) and life cycle costing (LCC) approaches. Four scenarios, including mono-incineration, co-incineration in municipal solid wastes (MSW) incineration plant, co-incineration in coal-fired power plant and co-incineration in cement kiln, were assessed. The environmental burdens generated from the sludge incineration contributed primarily to the global warming, followed by eutrophication, marine aquatic ecotoxicity, and human toxicity potential across the four scenarios. Furthermore, mono-incineration scenario appeared to be the most environ-mentally unfriendly, energy and economy intensive alternative, with the LCA, CED and LCC value of 5.41E-09, 1736 MJ and 1.84 million CNY, respectively. By contrast, co-incineration in cement kiln exhibited the lowest CED (368 MJ), LCC (0.59 million CNY), and environmental burdens (1.02E-09). In addition, the sensitivity analysis indicated that four scenarios were sensitive to the changes in the electricity efficiency and the moisture content contained in sewage sludge, suggesting that it was of great significance to enhance the efficiency of sludge dewatering and thermal drying The findings of this study can provide scientific reference for selecting the optimal strategies for the most environmentally and economically friendly sewage sludge management with optimum energy efficiency.

TI The treatment of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW)
   as a possible source of micro- and nano-plastics and bioplastics in
   agroecosystems: a review
SO CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN AGRICULTURE
AB Plastics fragmentation into smaller debris, namely, micro- and nano-plastics (MPs and NPs), is a matter of global concern because of their wide distribution in terrestrial and marine environments. The latest research has focused mainly on aquatic ecosystems, and fragmentation of bioplastics into micro- and nano-particles (MBPs and NBPs) is not considered. The distribution, concentration, fate and major source of MPs, NPS, MBPs and NBPs in agroecosystems still need to be understood. The use of composts and sewage sludge from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) treatment plants as soil amendments is likely to represent a major input of these debris. The present review provides insights into the current evidence of pollution from micro- and nano-particles of both fossil- and bio-origin in the OFMSW treatment, and aims at evaluating if the recycling of organic waste and its application as a soil fertilizer outweigh the risk of pollution in terrestrial environments. Huge unpredictability exists due to the limited numbers of data on their quantification in each source of possible solution. Indeed, the major hurdles arise from the difficult to quantify the micro-, especially the nano-, particles and subsequently assess the concentrations in the environments, as well as bioaccumulation risks, and toxic effects on organisms.

TI Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollutant Emissions from Composting
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Composting can divert organic waste from landfills, reduce landfill methane emissions, and recycle nutrients back to soils. However, the composting process is also a source of greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions. Researchers, regulators, and policy decision-makers all rely on emissions estimates to develop local emissions inventories and weigh competing waste diversion options, yet reported emission factors are difficult to interpret and highly variable. This review explores the impacts of waste characteristics, pretreatment processes, and composting conditions on CO2, CH4, N2O, NH3, and VOC emissions by critically reviewing and analyzing 388 emission factors from 46 studies. The values reported to date suggest that CH4 is the single largest contributor to 100-year global warming potential (GWP100) for yard waste composting, comprising approximately 80% of the total GWP100. For nitrogen-rich wastes including manure, mixed municipal organic waste, and wastewater treatment sludge, N2O is the largest contributor to GWP100, accounting for half to as much as 90% of the total GWP100. If waste is anaerobically digested prior to composting, N2O, NH3, and VOC emissions tend to decrease relative to composting the untreated waste. Effective pile management and aeration are key to minimizing CH4 emissions. However, forced aeration can increase NH3 emissions in some cases.

TI A new framework for assessing the sustainability of municipal solid
   waste treatment techniques applying multi-criteria decision analysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In this study, a new multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework was designed and adopted for assessing the sustainability of solid waste treatment techniques (six treatment techniques) in urban areas of Baghdad (the capital of Iraq). A questionnaire has been developed that contains the four dimensions of sustainability (environmental, economic, social, and technical) and their indicators. These indicators have been studied, analyzed, and evaluated by a group of specialists working on solid waste management. Then the data were modelled adopting the weighted sum model (WSM), weighted product model (WPM) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The main results of the study clearly showed that the sustainability of municipal solid waste treatment in the city of Baghdad is directly related to the four dimensions in variable proportions (weights), and the environmental dimension gained the largest impact (46.9%) while the technical dimension gained the least impact (16.1%) on sustainability. By analyzing the questionnaire data according to the designed framework with reference to the three methods of MCDA (WSM, WPM, and TOPSIS) and in the presence of three Scenarios of the multi-criteria weights, Recycling by Source-Separation (RSS) Technique gained the highest score (0.896) which means that it is the best alternative, while Anaerobic Digestion Technique (AD) gained the lowest score (0.397) which means that it is the worst alternative, other scores are (0.874) for material recycling facility (MRF) Technique, (0.84) for Landfill Technique, (0.813) for Composting Technique, and (0.584) for mass-burn incineration (MBI) Technique.

TI Implementation of Analytic Hierarchy Process for Sustainable Municipal
   Solid Waste Management: a Case Study of Bangkok
SO INTERNATIONAL ENERGY JOURNAL
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) is considered as one of the renewable energy sources in Thailand, and MSW management is a challenging issue due to its complicated structure that relevant to environmental and socio-economic condition, especially in developing countries. This study aims to review the current status to highlight issues of MSW management in Bangkok, Thailand, then to analyze the situation in order to propose suitable waste treatment technologies for Bangkok based on data/information analysis. To reach the milestone, the interviewing of local administrators and experts in field of waste treatment technologies as well as reviewing of relevant documents are needed. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is implemented to evaluate a sustainable MSW management for Bangkok by considering a sustainability model that is associated with environmental, social and economic aspects. The result indicates that 90% of total waste generation in Bangkok are collected. Out of MSW collected in Bangkok, 10% was composted in On-Nut transfer station, 3% was incinerated in Nong Khaem transfer station, and the other 87% was sent to landfills outside Bangkok. On the other hand, results of AHP analyses show the preferred technology for Bangkok while sensitivity analysis determines the variation of technologies ranking when the weight of criteria changes. The study also suggests the integrated systems for sustainable development. The first integrated system, composting (CP) and gasification (GF), is preferable in case there are market opportunities for compost products. On the other hand, an anaerobic digestion (AD) and gasification (GF) system is preferable if the stakeholders give more importance to biogas production and electricity generation. The outcomes are thought to provide benefits for the policymakers, investors, researchers, and other stakeholders in Bangkok and elsewhere.

   Scenario
SO CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) is the abridgment of the waste generated from domestic, commercial, and construction activities by natural persons that is collected and treated by municipalities. Exponential growth of population and urbanization, and the development of social economy, coupled with the improvement of living standard, have resulted in an increase in the amount of MSW generation throughout the world. On average the developed countries typically generate 521.95-759.2 kg per person per year (kpc) and 109.5-525.6 kpc typically by developing countries. Recent estimates suggest that the MSW generation globally exceeds 2 billion tons per year, which is a potential threat to environmental dilapidation. Therefore, MSW management (MSWM) seems to be one of the key topics for environmental protection in present days and also in the future. The authors have illustrated MSW generation and composition analysis and have provided a comprehensive review of MSWM in different countries throughout the world based on the available literatures. Some of the important aspects of waste management, such as composting, landfilling, and incineration, are illustrated.

   management system focusing on policies, selection criteria and
   techniques for waste-to-value
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The huge build-up of untreated Municipal solid waste (MSW) is one of the major problems of the modern world. The uncontrolled waste generation and its accumulation are due to the rapid population rise, rapid urbanization, and inefficient MSW management systems. An efficient and sustainable MSW management system is a necessity worldwide, especially in lower and middle-income countries. Efficient MSW management supports a country in preserving the environment and adapting to eco-friendly methods. The selection criteria for deciding on the suitable waste treatment methods are addressed using Economic Cost (EcC) & Environment Cost (EnC) analysis. This study effectively classifies the different waste treatment methods into conventional and non-conventional methods to explain the suitability and effectiveness of each method. Highlighting the concept of waste-tovalue, further elaboration on waste-to-energy (generation of energy in the form of heat and electricity), waste-to-material (producing value-added products like slag, char, soil manures, bio-oils, chemicals, etc.) have been done. An estimation of the gap in the MSW management systems for the different income-levelled countries is presented based on the waste management policies and tactics employed by the governing bodies. The study also offers valuable suggestions to bridge the gap in MSW management between the high-income and low-income countries including new trends in technology. This review focuses on establishing the importance of an effective MSW management system to help in the sustainable development of countries throughout the world.

The aim of this study was to examine the PG of municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment process through a life cycle assessment (LCA) method. The study also includes a comparative LCA model of PG and incineration to identify the potential environmental burdens from the existing (incineration) and emerging (PG) waste treatment technologies. This study focused on ten environmental impact categories under two different scenarios, namely: (a) LCA model of PG and (b) comparative LCA model of PG and incineration. The scenario (a) showed that PG had significant environmental burdens in the aquatic eco-toxicity and the global warming potential impact categories. The comparative scenario (b) of PG and incineration of MSW showed that PG had comparatively lower potential environmental burdens in acidification, eutrophication, and aquatic eco-toxicity. Both LCA models showed that the environmental burdens were mainly caused by the volume of the thermal gas (emissions) produced from these two technologies and the final residue to disposal. Therefore, the results indicate that the efficiency and environmental burdens of the emerging technologies are dependent on the emissions and the production of final residue to the landfill.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB In terms of improvement of the existing municipal solid-waste management system in city of Zagreb (Croatia) in a line with legal requirements and its shift towards circular economy, two scenarios were investigated. Life-cycle assessment (LCA) methodology was used to compare the existing municipal solid-waste management system mainly relay on landfilling of waste with expanded system combining mechanical separation of recyclable fractions of mixed municipal waste (MMW), anaerobic digestion of organic fraction, and thermal treatment of residual waste. The waste management-dedicated LCA software EASETECH was used for the assessment of the scenarios in accordance with the EDIP 1997 LCA method. Improved solid-waste management scenario showed superior results in terms of increased recycling rate of valuable materials and overall environmental performance. Because of introduction of convenient mechanical, biological, and thermal treatment technologies, it enables fulfilment of legal obligation concerning waste recycling targets and landfilling of waste.

AB This paper focuses on a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of four waste management strategies: landfill without biogas utilization; landfill with biogas combustion to generate electricity; sorting plant which splits the inorganic waste fraction (used to produce electricity via Refuse Derived Fuels, RDF) from the organic waste fraction (used to produce biogas via anaerobic digestion); direct incineration of waste. These scenarios are applied to the waste amount and composition of the Municipality of Roma (Italy) and are evaluated under different points of view: global and local emissions, total material demands, total energy requirements and ecological footprints. Results, reliable for most of the European big cities, show landfill systems as the worst waste management options and significant environmental savings at global scale are achieved from undertaking energy recycling. Furthermore, waste treatments finalized to energy recovery provide an energy output that, in the best case, is able to meet the 15% of Roma electricity consumption. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Life cycle assessment of municipal solid waste management with regard to
   greenhouse gas emissions: Case study of Tianjin, China
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The environmental impacts of municipal solid waste (MSW) management have been highlighted in China, due to the continually increasing amount of MSW being generated and the limited capacity of waste treatment facilities. Of particular interest is greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, aided by the Kyoto Mechanisms. China is an important case study for this global issue; however, an analysis of the entire life cycle of MSW management on GHG emissions is not available for China. This study evaluates the current and possible patterns of MSW management with regard to GHG emissions, using life cycle assessment (LCA), based on the Tianjin case. We assess the baseline scenario, reflecting the existing MSW management system, as well as a set of alternative scenarios, five exploring waste treatment technology innovations and one exploring integrated MSW management, to quantitatively predict potentials of GHG mitigation for Tianjin. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis is used to investigate the influence of landfill gas (LFG) collection efficiency, recycling rate and methodological choice, especially allocation, on the outcomes. The results show GHG emissions from Tianjin's MSW management system amount to 467.34 Mg CO2 eq. per year, based on the treatment of MSW collected in the central districts in 2006, and the key issue is LFG released. The integrated MSW management scenario, combining different improvement options, shows the highest GHG mitigation potential. Given the limited financial support and the current waste management practice in Tianjin, LFG utilization scenario would be the preferred choice. The sensitivity analysis of recycling rate shows an approximately linear relation of inverse proportion between recycling rate and total GHG emissions. Kitchen waste composting makes a considerable contribution to total GHG emissions reduction. Allocation choices result in differences in total quantitative outcomes, but preference orders and contributions analysis are found to be robust, suggesting LCA can support decision making.

TI Life cycle assessment of integrated solid state anaerobic digestion and
   composting for on-farm organic residues treatment
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Driven by the gradual changes in the structure of energy consumption and improvements of living standards in China, the volume of on-farm organic solid waste is increasing. If untreated, these unutilized on farm organic solid wastes can cause environmental problems. This paper presents the results of a life cycle assessment to compare the environmental impacts of different on-farm organic waste (which includes dairy manure, corn stover and tomato residue) treatment strategies, including anaerobic digestion (AD), composting, and AD followed by composting. The input life cycle inventory data are specific to China. The potential environmental impacts of different waste management strategies were assessed based on their acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP), global warming potential (GWP), ecotoxicity potential (ETP), and resource depletion (RD). The results show that the preferred treatment strategy for dairy manure is the one that integrated corn stover and tomato residue utilization and solid state AD technologies into the system. The GWP of integrated solid state AD and composting was the least, which is -2900 kg CO2 eq/t of dairy manure and approximately 14.8 times less than that of current status (i.e., liquid AD of dairy manure). Solid state AD of dairy manure, corn stover and tomato residues is the most favorable option in terms of AP, EP and ETP, which are more than 40% lower than that of the current status (i.e., AP: 3.11 kg SO2, EP: -0.94 kg N, and ETP: -881 CTUe (Comparative Toxic Units ecotoxicity)). The results also show that there is a significant potential for AP, EP, ETP, and GWP reduction, if AD is used prior to composting. The scenario analysis for transportation distance showed that locating the AD plant and composting facility on the farm was advantageous in terms of all the life cycle impact categories.

TI Life cycle assessment of integrated waste management systems for
   alternative legacy scenarios of the London Olympic Park
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB This paper presents the results of the life cycle assessment (LCA) of 10 integrated waste management systems (IWMSs) for 3 potential post-event site design scenarios of the London Olympic Park. The aim of the LCA study is to evaluate direct and indirect emissions resulting from various treatment options of municipal solid waste (MSW) annually generated on site together with avoided emissions resulting from energy, materials and nutrients recovery. IWMSs are modelled using GaBi v6.0 Product Sustainability software and results are presented based on the CML (v.Nov-10) characterisation method.
   The results show that IWMSs with advanced thermal treatment (ATT) and incineration with energy recovery have the lowest Global Warming Potential (GWP) than IWMSs where landfill is the primary waste treatment process. This is due to higher direct emissions and lower avoided emissions from the landfill process compared to the emissions from the thermal treatment processes. LCA results demonstrate that significant environmental savings are achieved through substitution of virgin materials with recycled ones. The results of the sensitivity analysis carried out for IWMS 1 shows that increasing recycling rate by 5%, 10% and 15% compared to the baseline scenario can reduce GWP by 8%, 17% and 25% respectively. Sensitivity analysis also shows how changes in waste composition affect the overall result of the system. The outcomes. of such assessments provide decision-makers with fundamental information regarding the environmental impacts of different waste treatment options necessary for sustainable waste management planning.

TI Environmental challenges impeding the composting of biodegradable
   municipal solid waste: A critical review
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Biodegradable material, primarily composed of food waste, accounts for 40-70 wt% of municipal solid waste (MSW) in developing countries. Therefore, to establish a sustainable waste management system, it is essential to separate and recycle biodegradable organic material from the municipal waste stream. Of all the recycling methods, composting is recommended due to its environmental and economic benefits. However, compared with readily recyclable materials (e.g., paper, metals, etc.), recycling/composting biodegradable MSW presents a great challenge to furthering the promotion of waste recycling.
   This review provides a systematic analysis of organic waste sorting and recycling/composting practices in several countries: the UK, US, Japan, and China. Compared to the great efforts that have been made in developed countries for the promotion of waste composting, much less has been achieved in developing countries. For example, the MSW composting rate in China decreased from 10% to less than 2% in the past 15 years, and similar trends may exist in other developing countries. Therefore, it is essential to identify the barriers that impede waste composting and predict developing trends. This article emphasizes environmental challenges (i.e., odor, bioaerosols, and heavy metals), focusing on their generation and control strategies, in an effort to identify barriers hindering MSW composting. Successful practices in several European countries suggest that source-separated composting presents many advantages over mechanical-separated composting. This may partially be ascribed to the fact that source separation of organic waste can prevent contact with heavy metal-bearing items, resulting in the production of high quality compost. Mixed collection MSW normally contains significantly higher concentrations of heavy metals, which could affect the marketing of composting products. Moreover, source separation of organic waste can minimize waste pretreatment operations, leading to lower bioaerosol and malodor generation during composting. Implementing source separation of MSW in more countries would increase the amount of organic waste available for composting. In addition, attention should focus on secondary pollutant production for proper composting management. Finally, setting standards for end product quality control is highly recommended for controlling both marketing and environmental risks. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Megacities are characterized by a high urban population density, and timely solid waste management is crucial for the wellbeing of its citizens. In this study, the cellulosic fraction of municipal solid waste is the target for management in Singapore (which has one of the highest population densities in the world) using four pertinent options incineration, anaerobic digestion, gasification and composting. The energy sustainability and environmental impacts in the form of greenhouse gas emissions are considered for each scenario together with the status quo to achieve the most favorable recommendation, with a sensitivity analysis in the case that no bio-fertilizers are allowed for use locally. In terms of GWP and energy profile for grass waste, AD is the most environmentally friendly option (2 kilo tonnes of CO2-eq and 23.3 GWh respectively), while for leaf waste, gasification is the best, with AD a close second.

TI Methodology for Assessment of Alternative Waste Treatment Strategies
   Using Entropy Weights
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Energy recovery from municipal solid waste is one of the means to attain sustainable development. Multiple factors involving several location specific situations, both measurable and intangible, makes decision making for technology selection very difficult. In this paper, a multi criterion evaluation system for municipal solid waste treatment strategies is established on the basis of specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and trackable situations, to prove the effectiveness of this method. From among various alternatives, three prominent strategies, namely, incineration, anaerobic digestion and composting are considered for the evaluation. Exhaustive data collection is done from conducting field studies, as well as from published data. Three types of communities are evaluated by this technique, namely, typical cities in developed countries, 'A' grade cities in India and 'B' grade cities in India. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of community specific situations on the right choice of waste disposal method using a technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) approach, where weights of criteria are determined by means of entropy weight method. The case study shows that the proposed evaluation results are reliable, which are more coincident with the reality, since the most relevant factors for selection have been used backed by exhaustive field data collection. Policy makers gain from the outcome of this study by guiding them through technology selection. So, the adopted approach should be promoted widely in the evaluation of waste treatment strategies, to realize sustainable development.

TI Beneficial role of biochar addition on the anaerobic digestion of food
   waste: A systematic and critical review of the operational parameters
   and mechanisms
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The generation of huge amounts of food waste due to the increasing population is a serious global issue. The inadequate management of food waste and lack of proper handling approaches have created adverse negative impacts on the environment and the society. The use of traditional disposal (i.e. landfilling) and treatment (i.e. incineration and composting) methods are not considered to be efficient for managing food waste. Thus, anaerobic digestion (AD) has proven to be promising and cost-effective, as an alternative technology, for digesting and converting food waste into renewable energy and useful chemicals. However, mono-digestion of food waste suffers from process inhibition and instability which limit its efficiency. Adding biochar that has high buffering capacity and ensures optimum nutrient balance was shown to enhance biogas/methane production yields. This review reports on the physicochemical characteristics of food waste, the existing problems of food waste treatment in AD as well as the role of biochar amendments on the optimization of critical process parameters and its action mechanisms in AD, which could be a promising means of improving the AD performance. Also, this review provides insights regarding the selection of the desired/appropriate biochar characteristics, i.e. depending on the source of the feedstock and the pyrolysis temperature, and its role in enhancing biogas production and preventing the problem of process instability in the AD system. Finally, this review paper highlights the economic and environmental challenges as well as the future perspectives concerning the application of biochar amendments in AD.

TI Environmental impact of solid waste treatment methods in Korea
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE
AB The environmental impact of various solid waste treatment methods being used in Korea was assessed to provide useful information for decision making in solid waste management strategy. Among the treatment methods considered, the incineration method and the anaerobic digestion method are the most environmentally friendly, while the landfill method has the highest environmental impact. Regarding the life cycle of the treatment methods, the environmental impact of the main treatment stage is the largest, contributing 46-94% of the total impact, depending on the treatment method. The environmental impact due to wastewater treatment was 6.2, 0.2, 4.1, and 9.0% for landfilling, incineration, composting, and anaerobic digestion, respectively. Among the environmental impact categories considered, global warming, eutrophication, and acidification are the key contributors to environmental impact, with a range of 53 to 91% of the total environmental impact depending on the selected treatment method. Of these key contributors, global warming has the largest contribution. Other contributors to environmental impact, such as photochemical oxidant creation, abiotic resource depletion, and ozone depletion, contribute little to the total environmental impact. These results make it possible to construct an environmental data set and examine the environmental impact of the life cycle of various waste treatment methods to support decision making in solid waste management strategy.

TI Food waste minimization from a life-cycle perspective
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB This article investigates potentials and environmental impacts related to household food waste minimization, based on a case study in Southern Sweden. In the study, the amount of avoidable and unavoidable food waste currently being disposed of by households was assessed through waste composition analyses and the different types of avoidable food waste were classified. Currently, both avoidable and unavoidable food waste is either incinerated or treated through anaerobic digestion. A hypothetical scenario with no generation of avoidable food waste and either anaerobic digestion or incineration of unavoidable food waste was compared to the current situation using the life-cycle assessment method, limited to analysis of global warming potential (GWP). The results from the waste composition analyses indicate that an average of 35% of household food waste is avoidable. Minimization of this waste could result in reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of 800-1400 kg/tonne of avoidable food waste. Thus, a minimization strategy would result in increased avoidance of GWP compared to the current situation. The study clearly shows that although modern alternatives for food waste treatment can result in avoidance of GWP through nutrient and energy recovery, food waste prevention yields far greater benefits for GWP compared to both incineration and anaerobic digestion.

TI Evaluation of Physio-Chemical Characteristics of Bio Fertilizer Produced
   from Organic Solid Waste Using Composting Bins
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Background: The possibility of converting the organic fraction of municipal solid waste to mature compost using the composting bin method was studied. Nine distinct treatments were created by combining municipal solid waste (MSW) with animal waste (3:1, 2:1), poultry manure (3:1, 2:1), mixed waste (2:1:1), agricultural waste (dry leaves), biocont (Trichoderm hazarium), and humic acid. Weekly monitoring of temperature, pH, EC, organic matter (OM percent), and the C/N ratio was performed, and macronutrients (N, P, K) were measured. Trace elements, including heavy metals (Cd and Pb), were tested in the first and final weeks of maturity. Results: Temperatures in the first days of composting reached the thermophilic phase in MSW compost with animal and poultry manure between 55-60 degrees C, pH and EC (mS/cm) increased during the composting period in most composting bin treatments. Overall, organic matter (OM percent) and the C/N ratio decreased (10.27 to 18.9) as result of microbial activity during composting. Organic matter loss percent was less in treatments containing additives (biocont l humic acid) as well agricultural waste treatment. Composting bin treatments with animals and poultry showed higher K and P at the mature stage with an increase in micronutrients. Finally heavy metals were (2.25-4.20) mg/kg and (139-202) mg/kg for Cd and Pb respectively at maturation stage. Conclusion: Therefore, the results suggested that MSW could be composted in the compost bin method with animal and poultry manure. The physio-chemical parameters pH, Ec and C/N were within the acceptable standards. Heavy metals and micronutrients were under the limits of the USA standards. The significance of this study is that the compost bin may be used as a quick check to guarantee that the outputs of long-term public projects fulfill general sustainability requirements, increase ecosystem services, and mitigate the effect of municipal waste disposal on climate change particularly the hot climate regions.

TI Design of an organic waste power plant coupling anaerobic digestion and
   solid oxide fuel cell technologies
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB The preliminary design of an organic waste power plant utilizing both anaerobic digestion and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technologies is presented along with a review of these technologies. Food waste and sewage sludge from a mid-sized Canadian municipality were modeled as feedstock for anaerobic digestion. The biogas quality and quantity produced from the digestion process were determined by modeling the municipal waste's chemical composition and chemical oxygen demand (COD) content. Overall, between 480 kW and 1410 kW of electrical power can be produced from the SOFC system fueled by the biogas. The compatibility of these two technologies is evident and the major challenges and benefits associated with implementing this concept are discussed. This work demonstrates that an organic waste power plant is a sustainable solution to waste management and power production.

TI Township-based bioenergy systems for distributed energy supply and
   efficient household waste re-utilisation: Techno-economic and
   environmental feasibility
SO ENERGY
AB Sustainable waste management and climate change have been two of the major challenges worldwide. This study designed township-based bioenergy systems to treat solid waste in Glasgow based on anaerobic digestion and gasification technologies. The economic feasibility and environmental impacts (i.e. global warming potential, eutrophication potential, and acidification potential) were evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation-based cost-benefit analysis and life cycle assessment. It was found that township-based bioenergy systems could save over 300 kg of CO2 per tonne of municipal solid waste treated when biogenic carbon is excluded. It was shown that the proposed systems have profitability chances ranging from 68 to 98%, when the sale of by-products (digestate and biochar) is considered. This study also explored the effects of by-product selling and carbon tax on the economic feasibility of township-based bioenergy systems. The township-based bioenergy system can satisfy 20-23% of electricity demands and 4-5% of heat demands of each township served. The study can facilitate investors and policymakers to make informed decisions about planning distributed Waste-to-Energy (WtE) systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Comprehensive Review of Hydrothermal Pretreatment Parameters Affecting
   Fermentation and Anaerobic Digestion of Municipal Sludge
SO PROCESSES
AB Municipal solid waste treatment and disposal have become one of the major concerns in waste management due to the excessive production of waste and higher levels of pollution. To address these challenges and protect the environment in sustainable ways, the hydrothermal pretreatment (HTP) technique coupled with anaerobic digestion (AD) becomes a preferred alternative technology that can be used for municipal solid waste stabilization and the production of renewable energy. However, the impact of HTP parameters such as temperature, retention time, pH, and solid content on the fermentation of TWAS is yet to be well studied and analyzed. Hence this study was conducted to review the effect of hydrothermal pretreatment of thickened waste-activated sludge (TWAS) on fermentation and anaerobic digestion processes. Many studies reported that fermentation of TWAS at pretreatment temperature ranges from 160 degrees C to 180 degrees C resulted in a 50% increase in volatile fatty acid (VFA) yields compared to no pretreatment. However, for the AD process, HTP in the range of 175 degrees C to 200 degrees C with a 30-60 min retention time was considered the optimal condition for higher biogas production, with 30% increase in biodegradability and greater than 55% increase in biogas production. Even though there is a direct relationship between increased HTP temperature and the hydrolysis of TWAS, a pretreatment temperature range beyond 200 degrees C alters the biogas production. The solid content (SC) of sludge plays a crucial role in HTP, where in practice up to 16% SC has been utilized for HTP. Further, a combined alkaline-HTP enhances the process performance.

TI Life cycle assessment of waste management in rural areas in the
   transition period from mixed collection to source-separation
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Rural solid waste management is essential for fulfilling sustainable development goals, especially in developing countries. However, quantitative study on this aspect has been little and far behind the urban areas. In this study, the environmental impacts of four typical rural solid waste management systems were quantified using life cycle assessment based on data from field investigations of five towns across four seasons. Sensitivity analysis was used to determine the most influential parameters. The results showed that landfilling mixed waste contributed the highest environmental impacts. By substituting landfilling with incineration, the environmental impacts (i.e., global warming potential, terrestrial acidification potential, fossil resource scarcity, freshwater ecotoxicity po-tential) dropped about 110%-900%. When shifting collection schemes to source separation, the environmental impacts also decreased by approximately 50%-200%. However, the environmental impacts of applying source separation to the existing management systems with mixed collection and disposal facilities of landfill or waste -to-energy (WTE) incineration are unclear and depend on the performance of decentralized composting and anaerobic digestion facilities, which need further investigations. Compared with urban cases, the landfill in rural areas emits higher greenhouse gas (GHG), and WTE incineration plants in rural areas have similar GHG emissions to WTE in urban areas. Besides, energy recovery was the most influential process in WTE systems and a 1% improvement on that would bring over 10% progress on global warming potential impact category. These findings can be useful for improving and developing rural domestic waste treatment in China and other devel-oping countries.

TI An overview of the sustainability of solid waste management at military
   installations
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB Sustainable Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) management at military solutions necessitates a combined approach that includes waste reduction, alternative disposal techniques, and increased recycling. Military installations are unique because they often represent large employers in the region in which they are located, thereby making any practices they employ impact overall waste management strategies of the region. Solutions for waste sustainability will be dependent on operational directives and base location, availability of resources such as water and energy, and size of population. Presented in this paper are descriptions of available waste strategies that can be used to support sustainable waste management. Results presented indicate source reduction and recycling to be the most sustainable solutions. However, new waste-to-energy plants and composting have potential to improve on these well proven techniques and allow military installations to achieve sustainable waste management.

TI Co-digestion of food waste and sewage sludge for methane production:
   Current status and perspective
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB Food waste (FW) is a valuable resource which requires sustainable management avenues to reduce the hazardous environmental impacts and add-value for better economy. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is still reliable, cost-effective technology for waste management. Conventional AD was originally designed for sewer sludge digestion, is not effective for FW due to mainly high organics and volatile fatty acid (VFA) accumulation, hence better technical aptitudes and biochemical inputs are required for optimal biogas production. Besides, to overcome these challenges, FW co-digestion with complementary organic waste e.g. sewage sludge (SS) mixed which complement each other for better process design. The main aim of this article is to summarize the recent updates and review different holistic approaches for efficient anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD) of FW and SS to provide a comprehensive review on the topic. Moreover, to demonstrate the status and perspectives of AcoD at present scenario for Hong Kong and rest of the world.

TI Greenhouse gas emissions from different municipal solid waste management
   scenarios in China: Based on carbon and energy flow analysis
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Waste management is a major source of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and many opportunities exist to reduce these emissions. To identify the GHG emissions from waste management in China, the characteristics of MSW and the current and future treatment management strategies, five typical management scenarios were modeled by EaseTech software following the principles of life cycle inventory and analyzed based on the carbon and energy flows. Due to the high organic fraction (50-70%) and moisture content (>50%) of Chinese municipal solid waste (MSW), the net GHG emissions in waste management had a significant difference from the developed countries. It was found that the poor landfill gas (LFG) collection efficiency and low carbon storage resulted landfilling with flaring and landfilling with biogas recovery scenarios were the largest GHG emissions (192 and 117 kgCO(2)-Eq/t, respectively). In contrast, incineration had the best energy recovery rate (19%), and, by grid emissions substitution, led to a substantial decrease in net GHG emissions (-124 kgCO(2)-Eq/t). Due to the high energy consumption in operation, the unavoidable leakage of CH4 and N2O in treatment, and the further release of CH4 in disposing of the digested residue or composted product, the scenarios with biological treatment of the organic fractions after sorting, such as composting or anaerobic digestion (AD), did not lead to the outstanding GHG reductions (emissions of -32 and -36 kgCO(2)-Ecift, respectively) as expected.

TI The application of LCA to alternative methods for treating the organic
   fiber produced from autoclaving unsorted municipal solid waste: case
   study of Catalonia
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Despite efforts to increase the selective collection of municipal solid waste (MSW) in developed countries, the amount of unsorted waste remains high, with the consequent difficulty of material recovery and recycling. In 2010, 61% of the MSW generated in the European Union (EU) ended up in landfill and incineration facilities. Autoclaving is a novel technology that can be used to treat unsorted MSW, producing organic fibers that can be composted. The life cycle analysis (LCA) was used to assess the effectiveness of autoclaving unsorted MSW and various alternative methods for treating organic fibers produced through this process. The alternative methods that were considered included composting in tunnels, composting in confined windrow and composting in turning windrow as well as anaerobic digestion. The environmental assessment results were compared to those associated with incineration and landfill. The results of this study showed that autoclaving with sorting, digesting anaerobically and composting had the lowest impact values for eutrophication and the global warming potential. It was also found that autoclaving is justified only if the products of the process, that is, polyethylene terephthalate, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, are recycled to avoid virgin material production and if the remaining mixed plastic wastes are incinerated for energy recovery.

TI Electricity generation and GHG emission reduction potentials through
   different municipal solid waste management technologies: A comparative
   review
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB The increasing trend in the consumption of various materials has also led to a huge increase in the final waste streams especially in the form of municipal solid waste (MSW) and the consequent environmental pollutions in particular greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These have made MSW management a significant environmental issue for governments and policy-makers. To address these challenges, developed countries have implemented sustainable material management (SMM) strategies which have been comprehensively reviewed herein. Moreover, waste generation statistics reported for most of the developed and developing countries as well as the existing gaps in MSW management among these countries have been fully discussed. The present paper was also aimed at comprehensively assessing electricity generation potentials from MSW using an integrated solid waste management system (including three different technologies of anaerobic digestion (AD), incineration, and pyrolysis-gasification) while the consequent GHG emission reduction potentials as a result of their implementation were also explored. To facilitate the understanding of the potential impacts of these treatment strategies, Iran's data were used as a case study. More specifically, the theoretical and technical potentials of electricity generation were calculated and the GHG emission reduction potentials were estimated using a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. Overall, it was found that 5005.4-5545.8 GW h of electricity could be generated from MSW in Iran annually which could lead to approximately 3561-4844 thousand tons of avoided CO(2)eq. Such GHG reductions would be translated into approximately 0.5% of Iran's annual GHG emissions and would be considered a promising achievement given Iran's international GHGs reduction commitment, i.e., 4% reduction of anthropogenic GHGs emissions by 2030 below the business as usual scenario. Such findings could also be modeled for the other developing countries around the world where efficient MSW management is yet to be implemented.

TI Sustainable Management of Organic Wastes in Sharjah, UAE through
   Co-Composting
SO METHODS AND PROTOCOLS
AB Daily human activities and vast green areas produce substantial amounts of organic wastes that end up in landfills with minimal treatment. In addition to the problems associated with landfills, disposal through this method is unsustainable in the long run and does not allow recovering materials from the waste. This paper focuses on the co-composting of different organic wastes produced in The Emirate of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates (UAE), to optimize mixing proportions of three different kinds of wastes-sewage sludge (SS), green waste (GW), and food waste (FW). All three organic wastes were analyzed to determine their chemical composition and the mixing proportions. Ten different mixing proportions as a function of carbon:nitrogen (C:N ratios) were determined and mixed in a NatureMill composter. Compost samples were tested for pH, salinity, conductivity, moisture content, organic matter, organic carbon, phosphorus, total nitrogen, and final C:N ratio after 6 weeks. Results indicate that a period of 5-6 weeks is sufficient for the compost to stabilize. The varying mixing proportions produced a good-quality compost (C:N up to 20:1) with high nutrient content. The study reaffirms that co-composting can be a potential sustainable organic waste management option for the United Arab Emirates.

TI Environmental and economic implications of recovering resources from
   food waste in a circular economy
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Around a third of food is wasted globally, requiring significant resources for its treatment and disposal, in addition to wasting valuable resources. Following the circular economy principles, this waste should ideally be avoided, and if not possible, treated to recover resources. This paper considers the life cycle environmental and economic implications of recovering energy and material resources from food waste, focusing on the UK situation. Four treatment methods are considered: anaerobic digestion, in-vessel composting, incineration and landfilling. The results show that per tonne of waste treated, anaerobic digestion has the lowest environmental impacts in 13 out of the 19 categories considered in the study, including net-negative global warming potential. In-vessel composting is the least sustainable option environmentally, in contrast to being preferred over incineration according to the circular economy principles. Incineration has the lowest life cycle costs (71 pound/t), while landfilling is the costliest option (123 pound/t). Managing the 4.9 Mt of food waste collected annually from UK households via the four methods generates 340,000 t CO(2)( )eq. and costs 452 pound m, in addition to causing a number of other environmental impacts. However, it also saves 1.9 PJ of primary energy, primarily due to electricity generation through incineration. If all of this food waste was incinerated, 103 pound m and 360.000 t CO2 eq./year could be saved compared to current waste management, rendering incineration a carbon-negative technology. This would also result in savings in 14 other impacts, but would increase summer smog by 30% and metal depletion by 56%. The environmental benefits of incineration would be exceeded only if all food waste was treated by anaerobic digestion, which would save 490,000 t CO2 eq./year and produce 50% more electricity per tonne of waste than incineration. Anaerobic digestion would also lead to savings in 14 other impacts compared to the present situation, but would result in a four times higher acidification and three times greater emissions of particulate matter. In addition, it would save 251 pound m/year compared to the current costs. Nevertheless, prevention of avoidable food waste would realise far greater environmental and economic savings, estimated here at 14 Mt CO2 eq. and 10.7 pound bn annually. (C) 2019 The Authors.

TI Exergetic sustainability analysis of municipal solid waste treatment
   systems: A systematic critical review
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB The growing volume of municipal solid waste (MSW) generated worldwide often undergoes open dumping, landfilling, or uncontrolled burning, releasing massive pollutants and pathogens into the soil, water, and air. On the other hand, MSW can be used as a valuable feedstock in biological and thermochemical conversion processes to produce bioenergy carriers, biofuels, and biochemicals in line with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Valorizing MSW using advanced technologies is highly energy-intensive and chemical consuming. Therefore, robust and holistic sustainability assessment tools should be considered in the design, construction, and operation phases of MSW treatment technologies. Exergy-based methods are promising tools for achieving SDGs due to their capability to locate, quantify, and comprehend the thermodynamic inefficiencies, cost losses, and environmental impacts of waste treatment systems. Therefore, the present review paper aims to comprehensively summarize and critically discuss the use of exergetic indicators for the sustainability assessment of MSW treatment systems. Generally, consolidating thermochemical processes (mainly incineration and gasification) with material recycling methods (plastic waste recovery), heat and power plants (steam turbine cycle and organic Rankine cycle), modern power technologies (fuel cells), and carbon capture and sequestration processes could improve the exergetic performance of MSW treatment systems. Typically, the overall exergy efficiency values of integrated MSW treatment systems based on the incineration and gasification processes were found to be in the ranges of 17-40% and 22-56%, respectively. The syngas production through the plasma gasification process could be a highly favorable waste disposal technique due to its low residues and rapid conversion rate; however, it suffers from relatively low exergy efficiency resulting from its high torch power consumption. The overall exergy efficiency values of integrated anaerobic digestion-based MSW processing systems (34-73%) were generally higher than those based on the thermochemical processes. Exergy destruction and exergy efficiency were the most popular exergetic indicators used for decision-making in most published works. However, exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental indices have rarely been used in the published literature to make decisions on the sustainability of waste treatment pathways. Future studies need to focus on developing and realizing integrated waste biorefinery systems using advanced exergy, exergoeconomic, and exergoenvironmental methods.

AB Recent trends in fecal sludge management evoke the need for improving facilities for co-composting with municipal wastes having spatiotemporally varying compositions under changing atmospheric conditions. The present study is an attempt to recognize the need for locating an aerobic in-vessel co-compost unit in the vicinity of an overloaded sewage treatment plant aiming at synergistic waste management through minimizing water and land resources requirement. Dewatered sewage sludge was incorporated at selected proportions to differently degradable wastes under semiarid and subhumid conditions. The results indicate that the prevailing atmospheric conditions elongated the spray cover from surface aerators in the downwind direction, enabling the compost to receive augmented moisture supply with susceptible aerobic organisms towards achieving faster stability within 35 days. The results also suggest that temporal redistribution of nitrogenous compounds, as well as reduced emission of volatile organics, generally followed the proportion of partially digested sludge in the mixture. The study emphasizes the suitability of combined sludge dewatering and composting system for promoting sustainable and integrated waste management without adverse environmental impacts.

TI Proposal for the integration of decentralised composting of the organic
   fraction of municipal solid waste into the waste management system of
   Cuba
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) generation and management in Cuba was studied with a view to integrating composting of the organic fractions of MSW into the system. Composting is already included as part of the environmental strategy of the country as an appropriate waste management solution. However, no programme for area-wide implementation yet exists. The evaluation of studies carried out by some Cuban and international organisations showed that organic matter comprises approximately 60-70% of the MSW, with households being the main source. If all organic waste fractions were considered, the theoretical amount of organic waste produced would be approximately 1 Mio. Mg/a, leading to the production of approximately 0.5 Mio. Mg/a of compost. Composting could, therefore, be a suitable solution for treating the organic waste fractions of the MSW. Composting would best be carried out in decentralised systems, since transportation is a problem in Cuba. Furthermore, low technology and low budget composting options should be considered due to the problematic local economic situation. The location for such decentralised composting units would optimally be located at urban agricultural farms, which can be found all over Cuba. These farms are a unique model for sustainable farming in the world, and have a high demand for organic fertiliser. In this paper, options for the collection and impurity-separation in urban areas are discussed, and a stepwise introduction of source-separation, starting with hotel and restaurant waste, is suggested. For rural areas, the implementation of home composting is recommended. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Life cycle assessment for municipal solid waste management: a case study
   from Ahvaz, Iran
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB This study assessed the available status of waste management system in Ahvaz and its impact on the environment, as well as seven other scenarios in order to quantitatively calculate potential environmental impacts by utilizing the life cycle assessment (LCA) method. These scenarios were as follows: scenario 1: landfilling without biogas collection; scenario 2: landfilling with biogas collection; scenario 3: composting and landfilling without biogas collection; scenario 4: recycling and composting; scenario 5: composting and incineration; scenario 6: anaerobic digestion, recycling, and landfilling; scenario 7: anaerobic digestion and incineration. Emissions were calculated by the integrated waste management (IWM) model and classified into five impact categories: resource consumption, global warming, acidification potential, photochemical oxidation, and eco-toxicity. In terms of resource consumption and the depletion of non-renewable resources, the third scenario showed the worst performance due to its lack of any recycling, energy recovery, and conversion to energy. In terms of greenhouse gas emissions and the effect on global warming, scenario 1 and scenario 2 showed that disposing the whole amount of waste resulted in the most amount of greenhouse gases produced. Moreover, 50% gas and energy recovery from landfills, in comparison with the non-recovery method, reduced the index of global warming by 12%. Finally, scenarios which were based on producing energy from waste showed a reasonably positive performance in terms of greenhouse gases emissions and the influence on global warming.

SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS
AB Enhancement in living standards leads the world towards exponentially increasing population in urban areas, which causes a massive increase in municipal solid waste (MSW) production. It is proven that plasma technologies are beneficial for recycling materials and generating energy from various kinds of solid wastes. So, there is a high demand for potentially sustainable, environment and user-friendly, cost-effective, and highly efficient thermal plasma-based waste-to-energy facilities. Three different types of advanced thermal plasma technologies, such as atmospheric DC, RF, and Microwave plasma torches, are considered for waste treatment application at small and industrial scales. A comparative study was carried out for all three plasma torches for waste to energy and waste treatment applications.
   Furthermore, simulation modeling and experimental results of a lab-scale DC non-transferred and RF thermal plasma torch were presented. The results show that DC and RF plasma torches are economical and advantageous for large-scale waste treatment and energy output. At the same time, small-scale waste treatment could incorporate MW plasma torch. Therefore, technological advancement, minimization of environmental effects, and process economics are the most critical parameters for improving plasma-based waste treatment plant's feasibility and sustainability.

TI Assessment of potential impacts of municipal solid waste treatment
   alternatives by using life cycle approach: a case study in Vietnam
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB In Vietnam, most of municipal solid waste (MSW) is disposed of at open dumping and landfill sites, and the methane gas from waste is the un-ignorable source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. It is indispensable to explore the possibility for GHG mitigation in MSW management. The objective of this study was to estimate alternative waste treatment practices towards the GHG emission mitigation, energy consumption and generation, reduction of landfill volume, and various benefits for proposing the appropriate selection by scenario analyses for representative Vietnam's cities. Impacts were calculated by utilizing life cycle assessment (LCA) method. A literature review survey on the current applicability of LCA database for assessing impacts from waste sector in developing countries, especially for Vietnam, was carried out. This study assessed the contribution of alternative solid waste treatment practices. The result showed that, except investment and operation costs, incineration with energy recovery seems the suitable alternative for treating waste from representative cities of Vietnam according to reduction of GHG emission and waste burden to landfill sites and energy recovery and generation. Besides, MSW composition was identified as an important factor directly influencing to impacts as well as other products and benefits of waste treatment alternatives. Reliable data on waste composition are indispensable for assessing to choose, improve, or plan the waste treatment practices towards sustainable development.

AB This paper overviews the main work and achievements of the International Energy Agency's Task on Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) conversion to energy. The objectives of the Task were to encourage information exchange between research and development programmes and other new initiatives relating to energy recovery from MSW, and to use this information to benefit research, development and deployment programmes on energy recovery from MSW in participating countries. Governments are now encouraging the sustainable use of MSW resources, both domestically and as part of their international obligations. These encourage development of a waste management hierarchy which places greater emphasis on waste prevention and minimisation through materials and energy recovery. The IEA Task provided participating countries with an international perspective in the areas of thermal technologies (incineration of MSW and refuse derived fuel and ash residues), biological technologies (landfill gas and anaerobic digestion of MSW) and generic issues relating to MSW conversion technologies (source separation, recycling, mechanical processing, sampling and analytical protocols). Work was carried out through meetings, study tours and networks. The main benefits from this international collaboration were that participants obtained up-to-date information on technical and nontechnical issues affecting energy from waste technologies, including legislation, methodologies, and plant experience, that they could then use to encourage the development of energy from waste in their own countries. The work of the Task will continue for a further three years during 1995-97.

TI Performance evaluation of anaerobic digestion technology for energy
   recovery from organic fraction of municipal solid waste: A review
SO ENERGY
AB Anaerobic digestion is one of the most effective and environment-friendly waste management techniques. It not only treats the organic fraction of municipal solid waste, but at the same time it can be considered as one of the potent renewable energy sources due to generation of methane during digestion process. The technology is not new and has been commercialised from early 1980s. But, the data suggests that it is not still widely applied for energy recovery from organic wastes at centralised level. The reason may be poor methane yield due to operational issues and process instability. There were numerous studies already done at the lab scale, now it is the time to replicate the outcomes of lab-scale studies to the full scale plant. Further studies are required to make the anaerobic digestion techno-economically sustainable. This paper presents a detailed review of essential process parameters and identifies gaps and solutions for effective implementation of the anaerobic digestion of organic fraction of municipal solid waste. The paper also presents the effect of co-digestion, pre-treatments and inhibition on the performance of anaerobic digestion. The paper will help the readers in understanding the process, operation and control of anaerobic digestion technology. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Sustainable municipal waste management strategies through life cycle
   assessment method: A review
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Increasing amounts of municipal solid waste (MSW) has gained widely concern on reduction, utilization and minimizing environmental impacts associated with waste management. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been used to evaluate total environmental impact of municipal waste management (MSWM) options in strategyplanning and decision-making process. The exiting LCA studies have covered a large range of detailed focus from waste treatment technology to applied modelling methods in LCA of MSWM, yet an important concern for stakeholders, the relationship between practical management strategies and their LCA results, has not been comprehensively summarized. This paper reviews recent LCA studies focusing on MSWM system in 45 cases from both developing and developed regions to promote evolution of the MSWM system through modification of waste management strategies. Selected literatures conducted LCA with system boundary covering the whole MSWM system rather than single treatment process or specific type of waste. This review has explored distribution and evolution of LCA studies in waste management field and summarized critical parameters (system boundary, functional unit, assessment approach and data uncertainty) for conducting LCA of MSWM system. Comparison results from 45 worldwide cases indicated 33%?154% environmental benefit in Global warming potential (GWP) impact with implement of integrated solid waste management system to replace single landfill, incineration, or open dumping treatment. Key issues with upgrading of MSWM system have been highlighted to raise concern, i. e., the importance of targeted management strategy on organic and recyclable waste, the growing contribution of waste collection and transportation to the total environmental impact, as well as promoting multi-impacts assessment for MSWM system to achieve environmentally effective, economically affordable, and socially acceptable. Rather than focus on technical factors, results from this study indicated the key influences from understanding local limitation, environmental concern, management chain and comprehensive impact, providing useful strategies on improving MSWM with generalization results of LCA studies.

SO HELIYON
AB With the continuous development of agriculture, Agricultural organic waste (AOW) has become the most abundant renewable energy on earth, and it is a hot spot of research in recent years to realize the recycling of AOW to achieve sustainable development of agricultural production. However, lignocellulose, which is difficult to degrade in AOW, greenhouse gas emissions, and pile pathogenic fungi and insect eggs are the biggest obstacles to its return to land use. In response to the above problems researchers promote organic waste recycling by pretreating AOW, controlling composting conditions and adding other substances to achieve green return of AOW to the field and promote the development of agricultural production. This review summarizes the ways of organic waste treatment, factors affecting composting and problems in composting by researchers in recent years, with a view to providing research ideas for future related studies.

TI Pretreatment and co-digestion of wastewater sludge for biogas
   production: Recent research advances and trends
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Currently, sludge is not considered as a waste any more, since it is capable of producing valuable products. Besides land disposal and thermochemical processes (i.e. pyrolysis, combustion, gasification), biological processes appear as promising valorisation routes to treat wastewater sludge efficiently. Anaerobic digestion (AD) processes are already being applied at industrial scales for the effective disposal and valorisation of sludge. However, methane yields from sludge anaerobic digestion remain low compared to other types of organic waste. Thus, pretreatment and co-digestion contribute to improve the degradability of organic matter and methane potential of sludge, respectively. This paper reviews the recent achievements in sludge pretreatment and co-digestion with other substrates such as the organic fraction of municipal solid waste, fatty waste, lignocellulosic and algal biomass. Furthermore, recent studies combining co-digestion and pretreatment are examined. The paper also provides recommendations to better manage sludge recovery by taking into account multiple aspects such as techno-economic feasibility, the effect of pretreatment on both the physico-chemical properties of sludge and the quality of digestate. The socio-environmental and legislative aspects are also essential in order to ensure the sustainability of the process.

TI Municipal Waste Management Strategy Review and Waste-to-Energy
   Potentials in New Zealand
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Municipal waste management and Waste-to-Energy (WtE) potentials in New Zealand are discussed. The existing main waste management strategy of New Zealand is to reduce, reuse and recycle waste. Most of the remaining waste is currently disposed of in landfills. WtE options were explored in this study as a more sustainable waste treatment alternative in the country, while making use of the annual 30.8 petajoule of available waste energy in New Zealand. Four WtE technology options were discussed and compared, namely incineration, anaerobic digestion, gasification and pyrolysis. The aspects in comparison were air pollution, cost, side products, capacity, commercial maturity, energy efficiency and type of waste treated. Special emphasis was given to environment-friendliness and cost. From the comparison, it was found that anaerobic digestion seems to be the most attractive solution for the country as it is environment-friendly, economical and the concept is consistent with New Zealand's existing waste management strategy. The major limitations of anaerobic digestion are its low energy production efficiency and its limited waste treatment capacity. Hence, an effective national waste reduction and recycling strategy is crucial for the success of this waste management option.

AB There is about 2.01 billion metric tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) produced annually and organic waste constitutes of a major portion from total waste generation worldwide. This current circumstance not only create extra burden on the landfill, but also causing some environmental issues such as greenhouse gases emission, odor emission and leachate production. Therefore, a sustainable and pro-environmental of organic waste disposal solution is acknowledged by composting practice. However, organic waste consists of some significant properties include high in salt, oil, nitrogen and moisture content. All of these properties contributing difficulties on the efficiency of organic waste composting process. In previous studies, researchers had studied various bulking agents such as biochar, sawdust, lime and others in order to optimize the efficacy of composting process. Nevertheless, utilization of zeolite as bulking agent in composting process is getting famous in the recent years due to its unique physiochemical characteristics. Hence, this article attempts to review the potential of zeolites in optimizing the composting process for better understanding of the mechanism as well provides valuable insights for sustainable organic waste management practice.

TI A Review of Organic Waste Treatment Using Black Soldier Fly (Hermetia
   illucens)
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The increase in solid waste generation is caused primarily by the global population growth that resulted in urban sprawl, economic development, and consumerism. Poor waste management has adverse impacts on the environment and human health. The recent years have seen increasing interest in using black soldier fly (BSF), Hermetia illucens, as an organic waste converter. Black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) feed voraciously on various types of organic waste, including food wastes, agro-industrial by-products, and chicken and dairy manure, and reduce the initial weight of the organic waste by about 50% in a shorter period than conventional composting. The main components of the BSFL system are the larvero, where the larvae feed and grow, and the fly house, where the adults BSF live and reproduce. It is essential to have a rearing facility that maintains the healthy adult and larval BSF to provide a sufficient and continuous supply of offspring for organic waste treatment. The BSF organic waste processing facility consists of waste pre-processing, BSFL biowaste treatment, the separation of BSFL from the process residue, and larvae and residue refinement into marketable products. BSFL digest the nutrients in the wastes and convert them into beneficial proteins and fats used to produce animal feed, and BSFL residue can be used as an organic fertilizer. This review summarizes the BSFL treatment process to provide an in-depth understanding of the value of its by-products as animal feed and organic fertilizer.

TI Sustainable design of a municipal solid waste management system
   considering waste separators: A real-world application
SO SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB Enhancing sustainability in Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) management requires options that alleviate environmental issues and provide economic and social benefits. Though, the social aspect of sustainability has not been thoroughly investigated in the related literature. Therefore, this paper proposes a new multi-objective mathematical programming model considering new employment opportunities as the social side of sustainability. Furthermore, due to ineffective public participation in the waste management processes in the developing countries, incorporating waste separation after collection in the waste management practices is the suggestion of this study to contribute to the social sustainability. Other aspect of the proposed model is uncertainty that is inevitable and should be acknowledged to guarantee reliability in the decision-making process. To handle the uncertain model coefficients and stipulations, we utilize the robust possibilistic programming approach. The application of the proposed model is demonstrated in a real case study associated with the Tehran MSW system. The obtained results indicate that composting is the worst waste final disposal alternative, while anaerobic digestion and incineration have better performance in terms of the sustainability indicators. Moreover, the preliminary findings of a sensitivity analysis show that the waste recovery percentage has a direct influence on rates of waste reuse and recycling.

In this chapter, recent research on AD and composting is summarized, and differences in the technical, economic, and environmental aspects of AD and composting are examined. Recent research on AD has focused on process enhancement and valorization of end products, while composting research has emphasized ways to shorten composting period and reduce odor and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. AD can be economically more advantageous than composting, depending on plant scale and valorization of end products. AD may be favored for centralized treatment; whereas, composting may be preferred for decentralized treatment, such as for on-farm animal manure. Environmentally, AD is favorable in terms of lower GHG emissions due to production of biogas as a renewable energy source. In composting, no single aeration scheme or additive has been found to be effective in reducing odor and GHG emissions simultaneously. Further research on AD and composting should be conducted to improve precision control and optimization, process design, product value, pollution control, and economic and environmental analyses, and more information needs to be provided to decision makers.

TI Assessing the impact of waste separation on system transition and
   environmental performance through a city-scale life cycle assessment
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB The increase in municipal solid waste (MSW) generation entails growing pressures on developing countries to achieve urban sustainability. New waste management strategies should be implemented with caution considering limited budget and uncertain outcome. Taking the city of Shenzhen, China as a case study, this research aimed to assess the positive transition of this city's MSW management system since the recent enforcement of waste separation. The life cycle assessment (LCA) results confirmed a good synergy between waste management system upgrade and environmental performance improvements. A noteworthy reduction of 51% in Global Warming Potential (GWP) was observed with determined cost of 61 US$/t CO2-eq, making waste separation a costeffective management option for developing economies to achieve their environmental targets. Sensitivity analysis was performed to address the effect of specific waste composition and related properties on systematic environmental performance. Results emphasized the impact of a certain waste treatment pathway is not always constant therefore characterization of local waste flow is vital to facilitate integrated waste management. Municipalities from developing countries are encouraged to take mandatory separation as a first step to upgrade insufficient waste management system before heavy investment in new treatment technologies.

TI A perspective on hydrothermal processing of sewage sludge
SO CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & HEALTH
AB The US annually produces 79 million dry tons of liquid organic waste including sewage sludge. Anaerobic digestion can only reduce the sludge volume by 50% in mass, leaving the other half as a growing waste management and hygienic problem. Hydrothermal processing (HTP), a set of several chemical digestion processes, could be used to convert sewage sludge into valuable products and minimize potential environmental pollution risks. Specifically, hydrothermal carbonization and hydrothermal liquefaction have been extensively studied to sustainably manage sludge. Two of the main reasons for this are the high upscalability of HTP for public waste management and that it is estimated that HTP can recover eleven times more energy from waste products than landfilling. An integration of HTP with anaerobic digestion or recycling the soluble organics (in the HTP aqueous products) into the HTP process could lead to a higher overall rate of energy recovery for municipal sewage sludge.

AB The paper summarizes research results of Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste (OFMSW) co-digestion with various wastes. The possible use of sewage sludge, livestock waste and other organic waste (for instance olive mill effluents, organic solid poultry slaughterhouse waste) as a co-substrate in co-digestion process has been evaluated. The presented data shows huge potential and numerous benefits of co-digestion of organic fraction of municipal solid waste with different wastes. In most cases, the addition of co-substrate to the OFMSW digester resulted in an improved the biogas yield as well as volatile solid removal.

TI A review on waste management and compost production in the Middle
   East-North Africa region
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Over the last two decades, solid waste management in the Middle East-North Africa (MENA) region has been one of the major challenges due to increasing solid waste quantities and poor waste management practices. With the tremendously increasing amounts of organic waste, MENA countries are under great pressure and are facing the threats of acute air pollution, contamination of water bodies and climate change. As a result, these countries are adopting different methods to cope with this rising challenge of waste management, including composting. This review reports on the different MENA countries' organic waste quantities, disposal methods, organic waste management practices and challenges, along with the potential use and demand of compost, where information is available. The reported data are from 2009 to 2021, with the bulk of the papers being from 2014 and onwards. The total amount of municipal waste collected in the 21 countries ranged from 0.56 million tons in Mauritania to 90 million tons in Egypt, with an average of 16.42 million tons, equivalent to 1.08 kg per capita waste generation per day. Around 55% of this material is biogenous. Many treatments and repurposing methods of this material are adopted in the MENA region, mainly through composting, as it presents one of the most sustainable solutions that lead to immediate climate change mitigation. This article also presents the biotic and abiotic stressors faced by this region, which in turn affect the successful implementation of composting solutions, and proposes some solutions based on different studies conducted.

TI Microbial Management of Organic Waste in Agroecosystem
SO MICROORGANISMS FOR GREEN REVOLUTION, VOL 2 : MICROBES FOR SUSTAINABLE
   AGRO-ECOSYSTEM
SE Microorganisms for Sustainability
AB Organic waste materials occur universally as surplus agricultural waste, municipal solid waste, industrial waste and poultry waste. Microbial management of organic waste is a promising, environment-friendly approach to manage the large quantities of organic waste due to its recycling potential. Composting is a biotechnological process by which different microbial communities play a key role in biotransformation of complex organic substrates into useful decomposed residues. In this biological oxidative decomposition process, different types of diverse compost microbiota are involved. Due to the synergistic activities and functional diversity of microbiota, relatively low-cost, stable biomass, humus products are produced. Microbial compost materials are used as bioorganic manures to increase soil fertility that facilitates sustainable agriculture. In this chapter, we describe the history and science of composting, types of organic waste, microbial parameters, different types of composting, diversity and function of composting microbiota, mechanism of decomposition, microbiological methods for the analysis of compost maturity and socio-economic significance of microbial management of organic waste.

TI A review of computational modeling techniques for wet waste
   valorization: Research trends and future perspectives
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The conversion of wet waste (e.g., food waste, sewage sludge, and animal manure) into bioenergy is a promising strategy for sustainable energy generation and waste management. Although experimental efforts have driven waste conversion technologies (WCTs) to various degrees of maturity, computational modeling has equally contributed to this endeavor. This review focuses on the application of modeling techniques, including computational fluid dynamics (CFD), process simulation (PS), and machine learning (ML) on WCTs including anaerobic digestion, hydrothermal carbonization, gasification, pyrolysis and incineration. It addresses in a concise manner on how CFD models aid in understanding of the complex process and their molecular kinetics; while PS and ML models help in understanding the reaction kinetics, variable-response relationship, techno-economic assessment and sensitivity analysis. Relevant modeling approaches with their pros and cons are summarized and case studies are presented for each WCT. Moreover, a comparative evaluation among the three modeling techniques, along with their recent and ongoing developments are highlighted. Hybrid frameworks derived by combining mechanistic and ML models are proposed, which are expected to advance future wet waste valorization strategies for sustainable clean energy production and waste management.

   management options in Harare, Zimbabwe
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB This study assessed the process contributions to life cycle impacts of six developed municipal solid waste management (MSWM) options (A1-A6) for Harare. Results show that waste collection contributes to increased acidification, eutrophication and global warming of 0.012, 0.0002 and 0.065 species.yr respectively as well as human health impact potential of 34 DALYs across all the MSWM options. Anaerobic digestion contributed to increased acidification, eutrophication and global warming impact potentials of 0.053, 0,008 and 0.043 species.yr respectively and 52 DALYs under MSWM options A3 to A6. Overall, incineration performed better than landfilling. The recovery of 20% of the recoverable materials for reuse and recycle under MSWM options A5 and A6 contributes to impacts reductions of -0.05, -0.004 and -0.26 species.yr with regards to acidification, eutrophication and global warming respectively and -56 DALYs with regards to human health. Therefore, strategies earmarked at reducing the positive contributions need to be developed.

TI Comparative analysis of environmental costs, economic return and social
   impact of national-level municipal solid waste management schemes in
   Thailand
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB This research comparatively investigates fifteen national-level integrated municipal solid waste (MSW) man-agement schemes and determines the most preferable MSW scheme that attaches equal importance to the environmental, economic, and social impacts. The fifteen schemes are one business as usual (BAU) scheme, seven composting-and seven biogas production-oriented schemes. All the MSW schemes rely on incinerators and refuse derived fuel (RDF) processing for waste disposal. The environmental impacts and costs are quantified by Step-wise2006 based on ecoinvent database. The economic return is evaluated based on the net present value of the construction and operation cost. The affected local community area is the indicator of public perception toward the waste disposal projects (i.e., social impact). The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used to determine the most preferable scheme. The results showed that MSW combustion by incineration and RDF is the main contributor of environmental impacts. The environmental costs of composting schemes were lower than those of biogas production schemes. Total environmental cost of scheme 7 (i.e., 25% recycling, 50% decomposing, 5% biogas production, two incineration plants, and seven RDF plants) is the lowest (7492.63 billion THB2020). The cash inflow of BAU is lowest and the cash outflow is highest. In comparison with the biogas production schemes, the cash inflows and outflows of composting schemes are lower. Scheme 7 is the most preferable MSW man-agement scheme, given the highest AHP priority score (0.228). Therefore, the composting-incineration-RDF scheme (scheme 7) should be adopted to treat biodegradable and combustible waste.

CT 22nd European International Biomass Conference - Setting the Course for
   a Biobased Economy
CY JUN 23-26, 2014
CL Hamburg, GERMANY
AB Discontinuous Dry Digestion (DDD) as part of sustainable waste management systems bears high potential to reduce the amount of organics landfilled worldwide and entails twofold benefit for the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions. Diffuse landfill gas emissions can be reduced significantly and the produced biogas substitute fossil fuels. Compared to fully mixed and plug flow wet digestion processes, mechanical pre-treatment of mixed solid waste streams is very simple for DDD comparable to aerobic stabilization/composting processes. Anaerobic bacteria selectively degrade organics and with the discontinuous concept the non-degradable part is simply brought out of the process as solid digestate in batches. Post-treatment of the solid residues as well is much simpler as for digestate sludge making solid waste treatment concepts using DDD comparably cost efficient. Amongst the industrialized DDD processes the GICON-Process is the only two stage process on the market. The discontinuous solid waste treatment using the principle of percolation is designated to derive a COD-enriched percolate by hydrolysis which is transferred to a high performance fixed bed reactor for biological methanation. Advantages to the so far wider spread single stage processes are higher efficiency of the installed reactor volume, more stable processing, less disposition for silting of digestate, very high methane concentration in biogas from the methane reactor, controllability of biogas production and less incrustation of pipes and aggregates.

TI Sustainable Sewage Sludge Management Technologies Selection Based on
   Techno-Economic-Environmental Criteria: Case Study of Croatia
SO ENERGIES
AB The management and disposal of sewage sludge is becoming a growing concern at the global level. In the past, the main goal was to completely eliminate sewage sludge since it was deemed a threat to humans and the environment, but recently different possibilities for energy generation and material recovery are emerging. Existing technologies such as incineration or direct application in agriculture contribute to quantity reduction and nutrient recovery but are unable to fully exploit the potential of sewage sludge within the frameworks of circular economy and bioeconomy. This paper developed a model within the PROMETHEE method, which analyses technologies for the sustainable management of sewage sludge, which could make the most from it. For the empirical part of the study, the Republic of Croatia was used as a country in which sewage sludge is increasing in quantity as a result of recent upgrades and expansions in the wastewater system. Incineration, gasification, anaerobic digestion, and nutrient recovery were analyzed as treatment concepts for the increased amounts of sewage sludge. The model reveals that the best solution is the material recovery of sewage sludge, using the struvite production pathway through analysis of selected criteria.

TI Comparative LCA of Alternative Scenarios for Waste Treatment: The Case
   of Food Waste Production by the Mass-Retail Sector
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Food waste is one of the most important issues taken into account by the European Union due to its negative environmental, economic and social impacts. The treatment of food waste through recycling processes represents a solution for food waste minimisation. Concerning, in particular, the retail sector, it is necessary to define strategies for retail-oriented sustainable food waste management. The aim of this study is to compare the potential environmental impacts related to five scenarios (landfill, incineration, composting, anaerobic digestion and bioconversion through insects) for the disposal/treatment of food waste produced by a mass retail company operating in Messina (Italy) through the application of the Life Cycle Assessment method, in order to find the best treatment solution. Results based on the treatment of a functional unit of 1 tonne of food waste show that the bioconversion scenario represents the most preferable solution considering all of the impact categories analysed through the CML 2 baseline 2000 method, except for Global Warming, for which higher environmental performances are connected to the anaerobic digestion scenario. The incineration and the bioconversion scenarios show the highest environmental benefits when the production of alternative energy sources and valuable materials is evaluated through the inclusion of the avoided productions in the analysis.

AB This study develops a sustainability assessment model for analysis and decision-making of the impact of China's municipal solid waste management enhancement strategy options based on three waste treatment scenarios: landfill disposal, waste-to-energy incineration, and a combination of a material recovery facility and composting. The model employs life cycle assessment, health risk assessment, and full cost accounting to evaluate the treatment scenarios regarding safeguarding public health, protecting the environment and conserving resources, and economic feasibility. The model then uses an analytic hierarchy process for an overall appraisal of sustainability. Results suggest that a combination of material recovery and composting is the most efficient option. The study results clarify sustainable attributes, suitable predications, evaluation modeling, and stakeholder involvement issues in solid waste management. The demonstration of the use of sustainability assessment model (SAM) provides flexibility by allowing assessment for a municipal solid waste management (MSWM) strategy on a case-by-case basis, taking into account site-specific factors, therefore it has the potential for flexible applications in different communities/regions.

TI Biogas production from municipal sewage sludge (MSS)
SO ENERGY SOURCES PART A-RECOVERY UTILIZATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS
AB Biogas is produced by anaerobic (oxygen free) digestion of organic materials such as sewage sludge, animal waste, and municipal solid wastes (MSW). As sustainable clean energy carrier biogas is an important source of energy in heat and electricity generation, it is one of the most promising renewable energy sources in the world. Biogas is produced from the anaerobic digestion (AD) of organic matter, such as manure, MSW, sewage sludge, biodegradable wastes, and agricultural slurry, under anaerobic conditions with the help of microorganism. Biogas is composed of methane (55-75%), carbon dioxide (25-45%), nitrogen (0-5%), hydrogen (0-1%), hydrogen sulfide (0-1%), and oxygen (0-2%). The sewage sludge contains mainly proteins, sugars, detergents, phenols, and lipids. Sewage sludge also includes toxic and hazardous organic and inorganic pollutants sources. The digestion of municipal sewage sludge (MSS) occurs in three basic steps: acidogen, methanogens, and methanogens. During a 30-day digestion period, 80-85% of the biogas is produced in the first 15-18 days. Higher yields were observed within the temperature range of 30-60 degrees C and pH range of 5.5-8.5. The MSS contains low nitrogen and has carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratios of around 40-70. The optimal C/N ratio for the AD should be between 25 and 35. C/N ratio of sludge in small-scale sewage plants is often low, so nitrogen can be added in an inorganic form (ammonia or in organic form) such as livestock manure, urea, or food wastes. Potential production capacity of a biogas plant with a digestion chamber size of 500 m(3) was estimated as 20-36 x 10(3) Nm(3) biogas production per year.

TI Treatment of municipal solid waste incineration fly ash:
   State-of-the-art technologies and future perspectives
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash is considered as a hazardous waste that requires specific treatment before disposal. The principal treatments encompass thermal treatment, stabilization/solidification, and resource recovery. To maximize environmental, social, and economic benefits, the development of low carbon and sustainable treatment technologies for MSWI fly ash has attracted extensive interests in recent years.

TI A review on biological methodologies in municipal solid waste management
   and landfilling: Resource and energy recovery
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Rapid industrialization and urbanization growth combined with increased population has aggravated the issue of municipal solid waste generation. MSW has been accounted for contributing tremendously to the improvement of sustainable sources and safe environment.Biological processing of MSW followed by biogas and biomethane generation is one of the innumerable sus-tainable energy source choices. In the treatment of MSW, biological treatment has some attractive benefits such as reduced volume in the waste material, adjustment of the waste, economic aspects, obliteration of microor-ganisms in the waste material, and creation of biogas for energy use. In the anaerobic process the utilizable product is energy recovery. The current review discusses about the system for approaching conversion of MSW to energy and waste derived circular bioeconomy to address the zero waste society and sustainable development goals. Biological treatment process adopted with aerobic and anaerobic processes. In the aerobic process the utilizable product is compost. These techniques are used to convert MSW into a reasonable hotspot for resource and energy recovery that produces biogas, biofuel and bioelectricity and different results in without risk and harmless to the ecosystem. This review examines the suitability of biological treatment technologies for energy production, giving modern data about it. It likewise covers difficulties and points of view in this field of exploration.

TI Assessment of the environmental sustainability of municipal solid waste
   valorization by anaerobic digestion and by composting in Sri Lanka
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY
AB Municipal solid waste management (MSWM) remains a major concern in Sri Lanka, and various treatment methods have been deployed. Though both composting and anaerobic digestion have been effective in environmental decontamination, there are other environmental issues that should be assessed. This study aimed to evaluate the environmental impacts of a full-scale composting plant and an anaerobic digestion plant for managing the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) in Sri Lanka using life cycle assessment (LCA). The results show that OFMSW composting causes unfavourable environmental impacts on damage categories such as human health (6.77 x 10(-4) disability-adjusted life years (DALY) tonne(-1) OFMSW), ecosystem quality (1.90 x 10(-6) species.year tonne(-1) OFMSW), and resource scarcity (3.66 x 10(-1) United States Dollar (USD) tonne(-1) OFMSW). Anaerobic digestion also leads to unfavourable impacts on human health (2.13 x 10(-4) DALY tonne(-1) OFMSW) and ecosystem quality (6.46 x 10(-7) species.year tonne(-1) OFMSW). However, the impact on resource scarcity (-3.85 x 10(-2) USD tonne(-1) OFMSW) was avoided due to electricity production via anaerobic digestion. Specifically, the treatment of OFMSW by anaerobic digestion resulted in a reduction by 68.3% in the total environmental load as compared to composting. It can be concluded that out of the two existing systems investigated, anaerobic digestion has a more favourable environmental impact than composting.

TI Integrated municipal solid waste management scheme of Hong Kong: A
   comprehensive analysis in terms of global warming potential and energy
   use
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The climate and energy nexus have drawn global attention towards sustainable solutions for synthetic processes, such as waste management. Innovative policies can amend waste management systems to be more sustainable, as in Hong Kong, where besides the conventional landfilling, alternatives like incineration and biological treatment methods are being considered to develop an integrated system. However, the outcomes appear uncertain and need to be analysed for best possible integration. This study proposes a customized methodology for impact assessment of these waste treatment technologies and evaluates five integrated scenarios in terms of net greenhouse gas emissions (GHEs) and energy use by applying classified modelling approaches. The baseline results revealed that compared to the landfilling alone, integration of landfilling with combined anaerobic digestion and composting (ADC) reduced up to 56% of net GHEs. Incineration with ADC saved up to 87% GHEs and ranked as the best-case scenario in both impact categories. Considering carbon sequestration as a credit suggested that landfill-linked scenarios were suitable for GHEs saving, while landfilling alone remained the worst case. The uncertainty propagation and sensitivity analysis revealed that some key parameters can alter the ranking order of scenarios, when variated by the reported uncertainty. The study provides useful modelling insights into the critical nature of these technologies and can be considered as a decision-making tool locally, as well as a generic calculation template.

TI Sustainability Evaluation of Municipal Solid Waste Management System for
   Hanoi (Vietnam)-Why to Choose the 'Waste-to-Energy' Concept
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB According to decision no. 491/QD-TTg signed in 2018 by the Vietnamese Prime Minister approving adjustments to the national strategy for the general management of solid waste until 2025 with a vision toward 2050, Vietnam has committed itself to move toward collecting, transporting, and treating 100% of non-household waste by 2025 and 85% of waste discharged by households by 2025. This paper aims to determine which is the best sustainable solid waste management system out of those that have been formulated by World Bank experts for Hanoi until 2030 for implementing the national strategy. The paper compares four distinct solid waste management enhancement alternatives, namely, "Improving the current system for waste collection and transportation"; "Reducing, reusing, and recycling waste at source"; "Mechanical-biological treatment (MBT) plants for classifying, composting, and refuse-derived fuel (RDF) for the cement industry"; and "MBT plants for classifying, composting, and RDF for waste-to-energy/incineration plants". The comparison was made using an analytic hierarchy process. As a result, the research indicated that "MBT plants for classifying, composting, and RDF for waste-to-energy/incineration plants" has the highest ranking in terms of a sustainable solution for the municipal solid waste management system. Therefore, it should be applied for managing the current situation in Hanoi. At the same time, the sustainable development of the system must seek to decrease the waste-to-energy ratio continuously and significantly through the planned reuse of materials that can be recycled to industry. According to the literature, in major cities in Asia and Africa, development programs are moving toward waste-to-energy solutions. The EU's circular innovation programs and action plan may be in the opposite direction to this trend.

TI Comparative assessment of compositing and anaerobic digestion of
   municipal biodegradable waste in Harare, Zimbabwe
SO ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
AB Composting and anaerobic digestion (AD) of biodegradable waste were assessed for their benefits from literature and environmental impacts using the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) procedure. Literature review findings indicate an overall edge for AD over composting largely due to its renewable energy production capabilities, reduced exhaust emissions, and cost effectiveness considering the entire municipal solid waste (MSW) life cycle. LCIA results show that both AD and composting lead to increases across the four impact categories considered namely, global warming, human health, eutrophication, and acidification. AD however showed lower contributions than composting to global warming, human health, and acidification. Composting only showed lower contribution than AD with regards to eutrophication. Overall study results indicate an edge for AD over composting in treating and managing biodegradable fraction of MSW generated in Harare and its surrounding urban and peri urban environments of Chitungwiza, Epworth, Norton, and Ruwa.

TI Applying life cycle assessment to support environmentally sustainable
   waste management strategies in Brazil
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB This paper aims to investigate sustainable waste management solutions for the city of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, based on a life cycle approach. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was performed by using the LCA-IWM methodology. The model was adapted to the Brazilian solid waste context and to the local characteristics, including waste composition, electricity mix and regulations. The annual amount of waste generated was the functional unit adopted. Eight municipal solid waste management strategies were evaluated. Scenarios including mixed waste collection and source separated collection as well as materials recovery and energy from waste were investigated. Scenarios were ranked based on the LCA results. Sensitivity analysis was carried out by varying the electricity mix. The results indicate that the current situation of municipal solid waste (MSW) in Rio de Janeiro presents the worst performance in terms of aggregated environmental burdens, indicating the urgency for implement new strategies toward a more environmentally friendly and sustainable MSW management system. It is noted that the better LCA performances were obtained in scenarios with high separately collection rates. Among them, the scenario based on recyclables recovery and anaerobic digestion shows to be a promising strategy to improve environmental sustainability. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the ranking of scenarios was not affected by changes in the electricity mix. From the results, the investment in source separated waste collection and materials recovery is the most environmentally friendly MSW strategy for Rio de Janeiro. In addition, scenarios with an emphasis in materials recovery presented higher environmental benefits than the alternatives focused on energy generation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Life cycle assessment of municipal solid waste management scenarios on
   the small island of Mauritius
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB The aim of this study was to use the life cycle assessment tool to assess, from an environmental point of view, the different possible municipal solid waste (MSW) management scenarios for the island of Mauritius. The scenarios include landfilling with energy recovery (S1), incineration with energy recovery (S2), composting, incineration and landfilling (S3) and finally composting, recycling, incineration and landfilling (S4). The MSW generated in 2010 was selected as the functional unit. Foreground data were collected through surveys and literature. Background data were obtained from ecoinvent data in SimaPro 8 libraries. The scenarios were compared both through the CML-IA baseline-midpoint method and the ReCiPe end-point method. From the midpoint method, the results obtained indicates that landfilling (S1) has the greatest impact in all the analyzed impact categories except ozone layer depletion and human toxicity, while incineration (S2) has the least impact on almost all the analyzed damage categories except in global warming potential and human toxicity. The collection and transportation of waste has a significant impact on the environment. From the end-point method, S4 reduces the damage impact categories on Human Health, Ecosystems and Resources due to the recycling process. S3 is not favorable due to the impact caused by the composting process. However, it is also very important to emphasize that for incineration, the best available technology with energy recovery shall be considered. It is recommended that S2 and S4 are considered for strategic planning.

TI Life cycle assessment of the existing and proposed municipal solid waste
   management system in Moscow, Russia
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB This study provides the first life cycle assessment (LCA) for municipal solid waste waste management system in one of the largest cities in Europe, Moscow. Its significance stems from recent important changes in the waste management system, the introduction of limited source separate collection in 2020, and the first examination of sorted municipal solid waste (MSW) composition. Moscow city generates 8.1 million tonnes of MSW per year, most of which is still mainly disposed of in landfill sites. The study assesses the current situation, the waste management system planned to be operational by 2024 and proposes improvements to separate collection and treatment of organic waste that could be adopted in the future. In this context, 6 scenarios are compared using LCA based approach. The impacts are presented as global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP) and eutrophication potential (EP). The results show that the existing MSW management system has the highest GWP and AP. Planned changes to the system by 2024 will reduce impacts in all categories. The largest emissions reduction potential is found for refuse-derived fuel (RDF) production and its use in cement kilns as a replacement for coal, which reduces emissions by 1.1 kg CO2-eq/kgRDF and results in a negative AP. The change in EP remains negligible. Separate collection and treatment of biowaste is also beneficial, with anaerobic digestion being the most advantageous treatment method. Nevertheless, even after the implementation of all initiatives, landfill still represents about 53% of direct emissions in GWP. Sensitivity analysis estimated that flaring of landfill gas can reduce GWP from landfill sites by a factor greater than two. With these changes, the total emissions of the system approach zero. Energy recovery at MSW incineration plants and substitution to the grid gives reductions in GWP and EP in the range of 35% and provides especially significant reductions in AP. The waste management system in Moscow accounts for 3% of residents' carbon footprint, which might drop to 1% if appropriate changes to the system are implemented.

AB Sustainable handling of municipal waste and sewage sludge has an important goal to recycle resources without supply of harmful substances to humans or the environment. The gasification mechanism of phosphorus from municipal waste and sewage sludge during the incineration process has been investigated to develop a phosphorus recovery system. Quadrupole mass spectrometer coupled to an electric furnace is applied to study the vaporisation behaviour of phosphorous gas phases from municipal solid waste (MSW) incinerator ash of sludge during solid-state reduction by carbon. Measurements are carried out in vacuum conditions of 2 x 10(-6) Torrs and furnace temperature range 573 - 1773 K, at a heating rate of 7.22 K/minute. It has been found that most of the phosphorus is vaporised as PO2, P-2 and P-4, in agreement with thermodynamic estimation despite a shift in the temperature regimes.

TI Efficiency of microbial fuel cells in the treatment and energy recovery
   from food wastes: Trends and applications-A review
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB The rising global population and their food habits result in food wastage and cause an obstacle in its treatment and disposal. Due to the rapid shift in the lifestyle of the human population and urbanization, almost one-third of the food produced is wasted from various sectors like domestic sources, agricultural sectors, and industrial sectors. These food resources squandered are rich in organic biomolecules which can cause complications upon direct disposal in the environment. Conventional disposal methods like composting, landfills and incineration demand high costs besides causing severe environmental and health issues. To overcome these demerits of the conventional methods and to avoid the loss of rich organic food resources, there is an immediate need for a sustainable and eco-friendly solution for the valorization of the food wastes. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are gaining attention, due to their ideal approach in the production of electricity and parallel treatment of organic food wastes. The MFCs are significant as an innovative approach using microorganisms and oxidizing the organic food wastes into bio-electricity. In this review, the recent advancements and practices of the MFCs in the field of food waste treatment and management along with electricity production are discussed. The major outcome of this work highlights the setting up of MFC for the treatment of higher volumes of food waste residues and enhancing the bioelectricity production in an optimal condition. For further improvements in the food waste treatments using MFCs, greater understanding and more research needs are to be focused on the commercialization, different operational modes, operational types, and low-cost fabrication coupled with careful examination of scale-up factors.

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Municipal solid waste management has become one of the most important environmental management issues around the world. In this study, a bibliometric analysis of the literature related to municipal solid waste management from a global and South African perspective was performed using the software, VOSviewer. Relevant scientific literature was sourced from the Scopus database. Results showed that, globally, articles based on this topic started during the 1968-1969 period, whereas in South Africa such articles only appeared in 1996. The keyword analysis showed that most studies were related to waste-to-energy technologies, waste treatment, and other management aspects. Globally, emerging keywords representing new research areas were COVID 19-related waste streams, life-cycle assessments, and the role of municipal solid waste management in the circular economy. In contrast, South Africa's prominent keywords were municipal solid waste, developing country, landfills, waste treatment, waste-to-energy technologies, pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and others. Based on these results, and possible solutions to reduce the amounts of MSW generation rates, recommendations are made to bring South African research on par with international trends.

TI Waste-to-Energy
SO LOW-CARBON ENERGY IN AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA: RENEWABLE TECHNOLOGIES,

SE Lecture Notes in Energy
AB This chapter shows that municipal and other waste forms make a significant contribution to GHG emissions and have an adverse impact on other environmental factors (e.g., health, water quality, air, etc.) in those regions where waste management systems are rudimentary or non-existent. Waste-to-energy provides a very limited amount of electricity or heat on a global basis and has virtually no contribution in either Africa or Latin America. There is a wide variety of Municipal solid waste (MSW) production rates between countries in Africa related to GDP per capita, and variations in national policies. In Latin America the average values of MSW production rates are significantly higher but are less related to GDP per capita than other socio-economic factors that are difficult to identify. Landfill gas and biogas projects are increasing in frequency within Africa and Latin America. For small communities, biogas digesters using animal and human manure could provide cooking solutions while also providing supplementary benefits to sewage treatment. A number of programmes are in place in Africa to increase the use of biogas in domestic applications. Therefore, instead of carbon capture and storage in landfills, which generally occurs at the beginning of the resource flows, the principle of carbon capture, transformation and reuse adding waste-to-energy paths in the cycle could be further developed and applied throughout the whole socio-industrial metabolism.

TI End-of-life of starch-polyvinyl alcohol biopolymers
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB This study presents a life cycle assessment (LCA) model comparing the waste management options for starch-polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) biopolymers including landfill, anaerobic digestion (AD), industrial composting and home composting. The ranking of biological treatment routes for starch-PVOH biopolymer wastes depended on their chemical compositions. AD represents the optimum choice for starch-PVOH biopolymer containing N and S elements in global warming potential (GWP(100)), acidification and eutrophication but not on the remaining impact categories, where home composting was shown to be a better option due to its low energy and resource inputs. For those starch-PVOH biopolymers with zero N and S contents home composting delivered the best environmental performance amongst biological treatment routes in most impact categories (except for GWP(100)). The landfill scenario performed generally well due largely to the 100-year time horizon and efficient energy recovery system modeled but this good performance is highly sensitive to assumptions adopted in landfill model.

TI Decentralized composting as a waste management tool connect with the new
   global trends: a systematic review
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB New global trends connect municipal solid waste management to climate change mitigation and resource depletion policies. In this context, decentralized composting stands out as a tool that has the potential to, at the same time, divert about 50% of waste from landfills and treat it in an environmentally adequate manner, return nutrients to the soil, removed at the beginning of the production cycle, and promote environmental awareness. However, decentralized composting rates remain low in many countries, especially low- and middle-income countries. This review critically evaluates the information that has already been published about decentralized composting and considers the progress of current research on the topic. The systematic literature search yielded 199 publications, of which 114 were analyzed for meeting the proposed criteria. The contents were grouped into categories, such as methods and techniques, difficulties of implementation, impacts, comparison with other treatments and between scales, compost quality and destination, types of programs, socio-educational dimension, and case studies. This review highlights the main points of the different areas of knowledge involved, achieving an integrated and critical view, connected with the new trends in municipal solid waste management.

TI An economic and global warming impact assessment of common sewage sludge
   treatment processes in North America
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB This study details a probabilistic life cycle assessment model to evaluate the environmental (i.e., global warming potential) and economic impact of four common sewage sludge treatment methods (anaerobic digestion, incineration, composting and pyrolysis) coupled with their most common end-of-life scenarios for the North American context. The model is subsequently applied to a realistic case study where each technology is assessed over a 10-year analysis period based on data made available by a Canadian municipality. For the case study, pyrolysis and anaerobic digestion coupled with agricultural land application have an expected global warming impact at least 46% and 60% lower, respectively, than the alternative treatment methods. Conversely, com-posting and pyrolysis have an expected life cycle cost at least 32% and 27% lower, respectively, than the competing treatment alternatives. Composting is able to achieve its relatively low life-cycle costs through the affordability of the required capital investments; conversely, pyrolysis is able to reduce its life-cycle cost through the recovery of valuable resources such as energy, fertilizer, and fuel. These findings and the resulting tool from this work will aid decision-makers as they seek sustainable sewage sludge treatment strategies.

TI Comparison of environmental performance for different waste management
   scenarios in East Africa: The case of Kampala City, Uganda
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB Poor waste flows management in East African cities has become an environmental and public health concerns to the city authorities and the general public. We assessed the environmental impacts of waste recycling in Kampala City, for four designed waste management scenarios, namely: (1) Scenario S1 representing the current status quo, (2) Scenario S2 maximizing landfill, (3) Scenario S3 combining composting, resource recovery, landfill and sewerage, and (4) Scenario S4 integrating anaerobic digestion, resource recovery, landfill and sewerage. These scenarios are quantitatively assessed for environmental impacts of global warming, acidification, nutrient enrichment, photochemical ozone formation, water pollution and resource conservation. Sensitivity analyses are performed on the robustness for the ranking of the scenarios. Scenario S4 integrating anaerobic digestion, resource recovery, landfill and sewerage performs best for all environmental impact categories. Sensitivity analysis shows that this assessment result is robust Therefore, integrating waste recycling into the formal waste management system for Kampala would considerably reduce the environmental impacts of waste flows. Also, considering the similarities in municipal solid waste compositions, sanitation systems and settlement patterns among the large cities in East Africa, assimilating waste recycling into the formal waste management systems for these cities would results in minimal environmental impacts for their waste flows.

AB Ireland produces 642,000 t of separated household organic waste or "food waste" annually. In 2016, only 420,000 t of biodegradable waste was permitted to landfill following the EU Directive 1999/31/EC. Growing population and restrictive directives are making landfills unfeasible. Anaerobic digestion (AD) offers an initial waste management measure of food waste (organic fraction of municipal solid waste). Gasification is an attractive process that can extract the remaining energy in the waste and reduce the final volume. This work explores the use of a food waste treatment network in Ireland in which AD and gasification are integrated with cogeneration of heat and electricity in a waste-to-energy national scheme. This work includes a parametric optimisation of AD and gasification of food waste based on experimental data and process modelling. A Geographic Information System algorithm locates and designs facilities for waste treatment, distribution and conversion to energy that minimise the energy involved in transporting food waste to treatment facilities. A techno-economic evaluation of the system is performed that minimises the levelised cost of power generation and maximises the energy output. This work presents the benefits of this waste-to-energy network and provides a sustainable alternative to current waste management practices in Ireland and other regions where landfills and other methods are environmentally harmful.

TI Characterization of household solid waste and current status of
   municipal waste management in Rishikesh, Uttarakhand
SO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH
AB The municipal solid waste (MSW) management system in one of the Class II Indian cities i.e. Rishikesh was studied and analysed to identify the key issues in solid waste management in the city. A total of 329 solid waste samples from 47 households were collected to characterize the household solid waste (HSW). The average (HSW) generation rate was 0.26 kg/c/d and it was composed of organic waste (57.3%), plastics (14%), paper (10.9%), and glass and ceramic (1.3%) and other materials (16.5%). There was an inverse relationship between household waste generation rate and family size (p < 0.05). The MSW management system practiced in Rishikesh is unsound. There is no waste segregation at source, no provisions of composting and no recycling by formal sector. The collection and transportation of waste is inadequate and inappropriate. Collected waste is dumped in open dumping site without scientific management. Following are some recommendations for developing a sustainable solid waste management system in Rishikesh city: (1) sensitize people for segregation at source; (2) promote reduction, reuse and recycling of wastes; (3) promote community based composting; (4) provision for 100% door to door collection and; (5) formalize the informal sectors such as rag pickers and recycling industries.

TI Analyzing Municipal Solid Waste Treatment Scenarios in Rapidly
   Urbanizing Cities in Developing Countries: The Case of Dar es Salaam,
   Tanzania
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Currently, large quantities of municipal solid waste (MSW) in many cities of the developing countries are being dumped in informal or formal but unregulated dumpsites that threaten the ecological environment and general public health. The situation in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania is of particular concern and is further challenged by a rapidly growing population and urbanization without adequate waste management systems. Current MSW treatment options have been selected based on the judgment and the experience of individuals with authority while underestimating the role of scientifically derived techniques. This study analyzes the most efficient waste treatment options, particularly scenarios with the lowest economic and environmental costs (EcC and EnC, respectively). It uses 12 years (2006-2017) of MSW management data and compares potential waste treatment options for the identified waste streams. A total of 108 different scenarios were designed, and a multi-criteria analysis method was applied to enable the identification of 11 scenarios with acceptable EcCs and EnCs. These formed an initial decision matrix of aggregation dominance that was then categorized into four groups, each represented by the most ideal point. Finally, the dominant scenario that formed the core for all considered options was found. It costs around $274,100 USD while saving about 1585 metric tons (MT) of CO2 emissions daily. This suggests that after all the MSW generated in the city is collected and segregated, organic waste should be composted whilst plastic, paper, glass, and ferrous metal should be recycled. After treatment, other waste will go to some form of landfill. Sustainable management of MSW in this city and others with similar conditions should consider particular local conditions and could use the methods and the findings of this study as a starting point.

AB In recent years, the rising generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) as well as insufficient electricity generation to meet the needs of the growing population is becoming a huge concern for developing countries. There is a need for alternative energy sources and MSW is regarded as a renewable energy resource that can contribute to the energy chart of Lesotho. This paper therefore assesses the potential of electricity obtainable from MSW of Lesotho using anaerobic digestion (AD) and incineration technologies thereby bridging the gap between environmental sustainability and energy production. The data for the study (i.e. the population growth rate, per capita waste generation rate as well as the waste composition of Lesotho) were sourced from literature, government publications and technical reports. The assessment was based on the available data from four selected industrialized districts that makeup the lowland region of Lesotho. Some of the key results reveal that incineration technology presents the best technological option for the Lowlands region of Lesotho based on the generated electrical energy potential.

TI DETERMINING OPTIMAL MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT SCENARIO BASED ON
   BEST-WORST METHOD
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) management is one of the most important issues in urban environments, especially in developing countries. In this work, a comprehensive assessment framework for MSW management is proposed to evaluate and screen the optimal scenario. The best-worst method (BWM) is utilized to determine the optimal weight of each criterion for each disposal scenario. However, the original BWM model is difficult to be solved globally. A linear model is presented to solve the model and an interval model is employed to verify the optimality of the linear model. The results indicate that the results of the linear model and interval model are consistent. A case study of MSW disposal in Qingdao City is used to demonstrate the application of the proposed method. The results indicate that a combination of landfilling, incineration technology with energy recovery facility is preferred for the current MSW management in Qingdao from the chosen criteria. The framework proposed in this work can be assisted to help the decision-makers to identify the priority sequence of MSW management scenarios.

TI Biowaste Treatment and Waste-To-Energy-Environmental Benefits
SO ENERGIES
AB Biowaste represents a significant fraction of municipal solid waste (MSW). Its separate collection is considered as a useful measure to enhance waste management systems in both the developed and developing world. This paper aims to compare the environmental performance of three market-ready technologies currently used to treat biowaste-biowaste composting, fermentation, and biowaste incineration in waste-to-energy (WtE) plants as a component of residual municipal solid waste (RES). Global warming potential (GWP) was applied as an indicator and burdens related to the operation of facilities and credits obtained through the products were identified. The environmental performance of a WtE plant was investigated in detail using a model, implementing an approach similar to marginal-cost and revenues, which is a concept widely applied in economics. The results show that all of the treatment options offer an environmentally friendly treatment (their net GWP is negative). The environmental performance of a WtE plant is profoundly affected by its mode of its operation, i.e., type of energy exported. The concept producing environmental credits at the highest rate is co-incineration of biowaste in a strictly heat-oriented WtE plant. Anaerobic digestion plants treating biowaste by fermentation produce fewer credits, but approximately twice as more credits as WtE plants with power delivery only.

TI Evaluating the urban metabolism sustainability of municipal solid waste
   management system: An extended exergy accounting and indexing
   perspective
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB In this study, Extended Exergy Accounting was adopted to develop an accounting model to evaluate the performance of a Municipal Solid Waste Management System. Furthermore, urban metabolism sustainability index for waste was also proposed to represent the unified society-economy-environment impacts of the MSWMS under the framework of a comprehensive sustainability evaluation. A detailed analysis of wood and horticultural waste treatment scenarios in Singapore was done as a case study. It was found that the gasification scenario theoretically performs significantly better than the incineration scenario, in terms of energy carrier consumption, emissions, thermodynamic efficiency and sustainability. Analysis results show that, if extrapolated to Singapore's total wood and horticultural waste, gasification technology has potential to reduce energy consumption and increase electricity output. An uncertainty analysis was carried out and it was found that the main extended exergetic parameters of the two scenarios considered were in the range of 3-8%, thus confirming the reliability of the accounting results. A sensitivity analysis of the urban metabolism sustainability index for waste was conducted for the gasification scenario to identify key influencing factors and seek potential improvements; this was done by considering changes in four variables: transportation distance, electrical efficiency, working hour increment and gross capital cost per ton waste treated. It was found that, to ensure the feasibility and sustainability of gasification scenario, the following are required: keeping the electricity production efficiency greater than 21.33%; the transportation distance between the gasification power plant and source of wood and horticultural waste should be kept within 17.08 km; employment of per kton annual treatment capacity should be less than 0.14 workers; wood and horticultural waste source should control the waste collection frequency of no more than 3 times per day and the number of workers participating in the collection each time is less than 4 persons, totaling to 12 workers per day.

TI Energy recovery and greenhouse gas reduction potential from food waste
   in Japan
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Waste-to-energy is one effective waste management approach for a sustainable society. The purpose of this study was to clarify the potential for energy recovery and greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction that could be achieved by introducing anaerobic digestion (AD) facilities in the process of reconstructing aging incineration facilities in Japan. Using statistical data from 1068 incineration facilities, four future scenarios were considered and compared with the current situation. As results, compared with the current situation the amount of electricity generated could increase by 60 % in 2030, by combining AD facilities for food waste with new, high-efficiency incineration facilities for remaining municipal solid waste (MSW). From a life cycle perspective, net energy recovery in 2030 was approximately three times greater than in 2011, and GHG emission could be reduced by 27 %. The introduction of AD facilities is attractive for small authorities, which currently treat < 100 t/day of MSW through incineration facilities without energy recovery. An AD facility is also beneficial for large authorities. On the contrary, in middle-scale authorities that treat 100-299 t/day of MSW, the reconstruction of incineration facilities to include electricity production capabilities requires careful consideration, because it will significantly influence energy recovery and GHG reduction effects.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Improper solid waste management poses adverse health effects and pollution challenges in both developed and developing countries. The present study is aimed to evaluate the fate of municipal solid waste (MSW) and household waste behaviors in Tabriz megacity. A questionnaire survey was performed to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and practices of residents toward MSW reduction, source separation, recycling and collection. The results indicated that food wastes make up the highest portion of MSW, and high moisture content of waste leads to low heating value which is below than average heating value for applicability of incineration. Potentially recyclable wastes such as paper and cardboard, plastics, metals, textiles, glass, wood and others make up a total of 33% of the household solid wastes. Investigation of the fate of MSW revealed that about 55.5% of generated waste ends up in landfill sites, 20.5% is separated by itinerant buyers and separation facility just before landfilling, and 24% is converted into compost. The evaluation of resident's behaviors toward MSW demonstrated the low knowledge of respondents and their high willingness to segregate solid wastes.

TI An environmental analysis for comparing waste management options and
   strategies
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The debate on different waste management practices has become an issue of utmost importance as human activities have overloaded the assimilative capacity of the biosphere. Recent Italian law on solid waste management recommends an increase in material recycling and energy recovery, and only foresees landfill disposal for inert materials and residues from recovery and recycling. A correct waste management policy should be based on the principles of sustainable development, according to which our refuse is not simply regarded as something to eliminate but rather as a potential resource. This requires the creation of an integrated waste management plan that makes full use of all available technologies.
   In this context, eMergy analysis is applied to evaluate three different forms of waste treatment and construct an approach capable of assessing the whole strategy of waste management. The evaluation included how much investment is needed for each type of waste management and how much "utility" is extracted from wastes, through the use of two indicators: Environmental yield ratio (EYR) and Net eMergy. Our results show that landfill is the worst system in terms of eMergy costs and eMergy benefits. Composting is the most efficient system in recovering eMergy (highest EYR) from municipal solid waste (MSW) while incineration is capable of saving the greatest quantity of eMergy per gram of MSW (highest net eMergy). This analysis has made it possible to assess the sustainability and the efficiency of individual options but could also be used to assess a greater environmental strategy for waste management, considering a system that might include landfills, incineration, composting, etc. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Exploring the role of Black Soldier Fly Larva technology for sustainable
   management of municipal solid waste in developing countries
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION
AB A rapid increase in population causes quantitative municipal solid wastes (MSW) in Pakistan, leading to serious public health and environmental impacts. Pakistan has social and environmental issues due to poor and inadequate waste management. Moreover, solid waste in Pakistan is 2.4% per year and 0.283 to 0.612 kg/capita/day. While the new scheme focuses primarily on waste collection and transportation, but the recovery rate is 68%. Insufficient waste collection and disposal would pollute the air, water, and soil that may cause a public health risk. The main techniques for waste disposal used in Pakistan include composting, landfilling, open dumping, incineration, anaerobic digestion, etc. However, these approaches are not ecological and cost-effective. The black soldier's fly technology (BSF) effectively and biologically breaks down diverse biodegradable wastes under sub-tropical conditions. Most people worldwide use BSF larvae to degrade biodegradable matter, especially in tropical and developing countries. BSF innovation has a high potential to cope with the current challenges related to inadequate reliable waste management infrastructure as Pakistan has favorable environmental and climate conditions. It is also capable of fostering regional growth, creating jobs, and local recycling of degradable waste. Black soldier fly larvae technology is an environmentally friendly and cost-effective method because of its quick transition rate, good sustainability, and low cost-effectiveness compared to existing and other operating technologies in Pakistan. Organic waste becomes not only useful after being processed by BSFL but also produces high-value eco-friendly goods. This review highlights the role of BSFL for waste management, its benefits in Pakistan under the current environmental condition, and the biodegradation of various organic wastes under subtropical conditions. In this study, different kinds of practices used in Pakistan for waste management, including open dumping, landfilling, incineration, and anaerobic digestion, were compared. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB In South America, a high percentage of urban waste streams are not well managed, implying associated health and environmental risks. In Ecuador, around 2.7 million tons of municipal solid wastes (MSW) are generated annually, with 80 percent located in urban areas. Correct management and hygienic and ecological issues from these increased quantities of waste is the responsibility of municipalities that must provide sewerage, wastewater treatment, and solid waste management, according to the Constitution of the Republic (Art 264). With only seven licensed landfill areas out of thirty-one in total (66 percent mechanized and 34 percent manually sorted), a sustainable waste management model must be developed to reduce environmental hazards and also to obtain new bioproducts such as compost or fertilizers. Agricultural utilization of MSW compost is the most cost-effective management option compared to traditional means such as landfilling or incineration, and this option also enables the recycling of potential plant nutrients. In this work, the problem we addressed was to obtain analytical information about representative MSW samples from different origins and locations within the Chimborazo region in order to establish its potential for composting. In the studied MSW samples (which included sludge from aerobic wastewater treatment plants), high nutrient contents and low concentrations of heavy metals were observed, showing great potential to develop high-quality compost. In addition, improvement of separate collections of food market and/or municipal gardening wastes can provide specific clean waste streams of degradable materials to be managed separately from not separately collected MSW.

TI Sewage sludge ash recovery as valuable raw material for chemical
   stabilization of leachable heavy metals
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB This paper proposes, for the first time, the use of sewage sludge ash (SSA), obtained by sludge combustion for the stabilization of fly ashes containing heavy metals as Pb and Zn.
   In particular, the proposed method aims to take advantage of valuable raw materials present in SSA, such as phosphate, silica, and alumina. The stabilization has been explained by the synergic phosphate, carbonation, and pozzolanic reactions together with the Friedel's salt formation. This method to sewage sludge management allows the complete recovery of valuable raw materials otherwise destinated for lanfill. This is virtuous example of the use of waste materials for de-pollution processes.

TI Urban solid waste management in the developing world with emphasis on
   India: challenges and opportunities
SO REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND BIO-TECHNOLOGY
AB Management of municipal solid waste is a global problem and is faced by all developing countries. The rapid pace of increase in population, economic growth, urbanization and industrialization is coupled with accelerated solid waste generation. In most of the developing countries wastes are either scattered in urban centers or disposed off unplanned in low lying areas or open dumps. The lack of infrastructure for collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of solid waste, proper solid waste management planning, insufficient financial resources, technical expertise and public attitude have made the situation exasperating due to which several environmental and health related problems are increasing. Though, there are many negative issues related to solid waste, it also provides many opportunities that not only mitigates its negative impact but also helps in meeting the demand for energy and employment generation as well as in soil health improvement. Keeping in mind the present situation the current review was planned with the objective to overlook the challenges and opportunities faced during urban solid waste management in developing countries like India.

TI Analysis of solid waste management scenarios using the WARM model: Case
   study
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The production of municipal solid waste (MSW) is a critical global issue, due to the large amount of waste produced and the environmental impacts it can generate if they are managed improperly. The implementation of modern and efficient solutions, such as waste-to-energy technologies, are important for sustainable development, minimizing environmental impacts and producing renewable energy. MSW managers should use tools, such as scenario analysis, to assess management options more broadly and accurately. Thus, this study aims to analyze alternative scenarios using the Waste Reduction Model (WARM) to find the best solutions for sustainable management of MSW in the city of Xangri-l ' a (southern Brazil). One hundred and fourteenth (114) scenarios were evaluated that included recycling, landfill (no gas recovery and with flare gas recovery) and Waste-to-Energy (WTE) technologies (landfill with biogas recovery for energy, anaerobic digestion, and incineration). Then, after obtaining the outputs of different scenarios simulated in WARM model, the statistical methods (Principal Component Analysis, Hierarchical Clustering Analysis and Correlation Analysis) were used for data analysis. In addition, an easy-of-use regression model was calibrated to predict intermediate scenarios not covered in the Design of Experiment. The results of this work suggest that the priority, most sustainable, and low-cost strategy for the city of Xangri-l ' a is to encourage and promote initiatives to gradually increase recycling rates. Afterwards, the biogas collection from the landfill for energy generation presents itself as a viable alternative, mainly in a short period of time. Finally, as long-term solutions, anaerobic digestion and incineration techniques must be implemented, mainly through the establishment of inter-municipal waste management consortia.

TI Comparative life cycle assessments of incineration and non-incineration
   treatments for medical waste
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT
AB Management of the medical waste produced in hospitals or health care facilities has raised concerns relating to public health, occupational safety, and the environment. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a decision-supporting tool in waste management practice; but relatively little research has been done on the evaluation of medical waste treatment from a life cycle perspective. Our study compares the environmental performances of two dominant technologies, hazardous waste incineration (HWI) as a type of incineration technology and steam autoclave sterilization with sanitary landfill (AL) as a type of non-incineration technology, for specific medical waste of average composition. The results of this study could support the medical waste hierarchy.
   This study implemented the ISO 14040 standard. Data on steam autoclave sterilization were obtained from an on-site operations report, while inventory models were used for HWI, sanitary landfill, and residues landfill. Background data were from the ecoinvent database. The comparative LCA was carried out for five alternatives: HWI with energy recovery efficiencies of 0%, 15%, and 30% and AL with energy recovery efficiencies of 0% and 10%.
   The assumptions on the time frame for landfill markedly affect the impact category scores; however, the orders of preference for both time frames are almost the same. HWI with 30% energy recovery efficiency has the lowest environmental impacts for all impact categories, except freshwater ecotoxicity. Incineration and sanitary landfill processes dominate global warming, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity, and eutrophication of incineration and non-incineration alternatives, respectively. Dioxin emissions contribute about 10% to human toxicity in HWI without energy recovery alternatives, and a perturbation analysis yielded identical results. As regards eutrophication, non-incineration treatments have an approximately sevenfold higher impact than incineration treatments.
   The differences between short-term and long-term time frame assumptions mainly are decided by heavy metals dissolved in the future leachate. The high heat value of medical waste due to high contents of biomass, plastic, and rubber materials and a lower content of ash, results in a preference for incineration treatments. The large eutrophication difference between incineration and non-incineration treatments is caused by different N element transformations. Dioxin emission from HWI is not the most relevant to human toxicity; however, large uncertainties could exist.
   From a life cycle perspective, the conventional waste hierarchy, implying incineration with energy recovery is better than landfill, also applies to the case of medical waste. The sanitary landfill process is the key issue in non-incineration treatments, and HWI and the subsequent residues landfill processes are key issues in incineration treatments.
   Integrating the medical waste hierarchy and constructing a medical waste framework require broader technologies to be investigated further, based on a life cycle approach.

TI Energy recovery from municipal solid waste in Mauritius: Opportunities
   and challenges
SO ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
AB Energy recovery from Municipal Solid Waste in Mauritius is considered as a solution to enhance the country's energy security and tackle imminent waste management issues. This study applies an Analytical Hierarchy Process model for identifying the best waste to energy technology, which can be set up in Mauritius while taking into consideration technical as well as sustainability indicators. Incineration, gasification, pyrolysis and anaerobic digestion, were considered for the purpose of this study. As a result of the analysis, anaerobic digestion was ranked as the prioritised technology when social acceptance indicator, identified as the critical criterion, was attributed a high weight. When the effects of the critical criterion was either attenuated or eliminated during the sensitivity analysis, incineration emerged as the preferred technology. A critical analysis revealed that higher environmental and economic gains are expected to be generated as a result of implementing incineration for energy recovery in Mauritius. Finally, a review of the barriers hampering the implementation of an incineration plant in Mauritius demonstrated that the uptake of this technology is constrained by social acceptability. However, if proper awareness is conducted, energy recovery from municipal solid waste using incineration technology can become an interesting project for the Mauritian economy.

SO ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB Municipal solid waste management is creating serious environmental issues for both developing and developed countries. Proper waste management solutions should be adopted to meet technological feasibility, and it should be financially and environmentally sustainable as well as socially and legally acceptable. Developing countries like India have introduced new policy frameworks for the proper management of municipal solid waste resources along with waste-to-energy recovery and material recycling. This paper gives a deep insight into municipal waste management systems and examines the energy and environmental policy issues to identify weak points in selection criteria for suitable technology. India is facing serious issues in the management of municipal solid waste and is trying to introduce better management solutions. From a technical perspective, both gasification and anaerobic digestion seem to be attractive when compared to traditional management approaches, but the economic feasibility of these technologies needs to be verified.

TI Determination of the Least Impactful Municipal Solid Waste Management
   Option in Harare, Zimbabwe
SO PROCESSES
AB Six municipal solid waste management (MSWM) options (A1-A6) in Harare were developed and analyzed for their global warming, acidification, eutrophication and human health impact potentials using life cycle assessment methodology to determine the least impactful option in Harare. Study findings will aid the development of future MSWM systems in Harare. A1 and A2 considered the landfilling and incineration, respectively, of indiscriminately collected MSW with energy recovery and byproduct treatment. Source-separated biodegradables were anaerobically treated with the remaining non-biodegradable fraction being incinerated in A3 and landfilled in A4. A5 and A6 had the same processes as in A3 and A4, respectively, except the inclusion of the recovery of 20% of the recoverable materials. The life cycle stages considered were collection and transportation, materials recovery, anaerobic digestion, landfilling and incineration. A5 emerged as the best option. Materials recovery contributed to impact potential reductions across the four impact categories. Sensitivity analysis revealed that doubling materials recovery and increasing it to 28% under A5 resulted in zero eutrophication and acidification, respectively. Increasing material recovery to 24% and 26% under A6 leads to zero acidification and eutrophication, respectively. Zero global warming and human health impacts under A6 are realised at 6% and 9% materials recovery levels, respectively.

TI Issues and options in waste management: A social cost-benefit analysis
   of waste-to-energy in the UK
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB The growing stream of municipal solid waste (MSW) requires a sustainable waste management strategy. At the same time, addressing climate change and security of energy supply concerns requires increased use of low-carbon and domestic sources of energy. This paper assesses the economic and environmental aspects of waste management options focusing on waste-to-energy (WtE) as a renewable resource. We discuss how WtE and recycling are compatible as waste treatment options. The paper then presents a social cost-benefit analysis of selected waste management scenarios for the UK focusing on specific waste management targets and carbon prices and compares them with coal-fired electricity. The results indicate that meeting the waste management targets of the EU Directive are socially more cost-effective than the current practice. The cost-effectiveness improves substantially with higher carbon prices. The findings show that WtE can be an important part of both waste management strategy and renewable energy policy although achieving the full potential of WtE requires development of heat delivery networks.

TI The holistic impact of integrated solid waste management on greenhouse
   gas emissions in Phuket
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Continually increasing amounts of municipal solid waste (MSW) and the limited capacity of the existing waste management system in Phuket have led to the consideration of integrated waste management system (IWMS). Life cycle assessment (LCA) was employed to compare the greenhouse gas emissions expressed as global warming potential (GWP) of the existing waste management system (the base scenario) and other three IWMSs for Phuket MSW. Besides incineration and landfilling, the proposed scenarios include 30% source separation for recycling (scenario 2), anaerobic digestion (scenario 3) and both (scenario 4).
   The functional unit is set as 1 t of Phuket MSW treated. Results from the impact assessment of the base scenario shows that the net GWP is 1006 kg CO2 equivalent. Landfilling contributes to the highest potentials of this impact. The results from a holistic comparison show that scenario 4 is the best option among all the scenarios, contributing GWP of 415 kg CO2 eq., whereas the base scenario is the worst. The emission of greenhouse gas from landfilling is reduced by the introduction of landfill gas recovery and utilization for electricity production. By assumption, 50% recovery of landfill gas leads to the GWP reduction around 58% by total GWP of landfilling and 36% by the net GWP of the whole system in the base scenario. The study suggests that a policy that promotes source separation should be pursued, preferably combined with the application of landfill gas recovery for electricity. Policy promoting recycling is favorable over anaerobic digestion in the situation that both treatment systems could not be established at the same time. The major conclusion from the study is that results from the LCA can support Phuket Municipality for decision-making with respect to planning and optimizing IWMS. It can benefit other municipalities or policy makers to apply in their waste management projects. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A sustainable municipal solid waste system under leachate treatment
   impact along with leakage control and source separation
SO PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
AB Over the past few decades, inefficient waste management has caused environmental problems, such as leachate leakage, high pollution in the surface and groundwater, and soil contamination. In this regard, it is essential to adopt proper pre-discharge leachate management and treatment in the case of municipal waste. This study proposes a novel sustainable network design model by determining the optimal combination of transfer stations and separation units equipped with waste compaction and leachate treatment technologies, waste treatment facilities with different efficiencies, and optimal waste and leachate flow allocation along with waste separation at the source for municipal solid waste (MSW) systems. The uncertainty in the generated amount of waste is also considered in different urban areas. Therefore, a two-stage stochastic programming has been developed to minimize the total cost and the leachate pollution potential of MSW network systems, considering leachate types, collection and garbage-bin-cleaning truck types, and recyclable waste quality. Furthermore, the social objective is to maximize the number of job opportunities. The sample average approximation approach and the augmented epsilon-constraint method have been implemented to address the model uncertainty and solve the proposed multiobjective model, respectively. The results have indicated that considering the leachate treatment in the MSW network and waste separation at the source, despite increasing the total cost, has decreased leachate pollution potential by 41.3% and has created the number of job opportunities by 29.2% compared to the current situation in Tehran as a case study. Moreover, complete waste separation at the source in the proposed model has shown that it can have a positive effect on decreasing the total cost and leachate pollution potential.

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The global waste generation keeps increasing over the years and it requires innovative solutions to minimize its impacts on environmental quality and public health. A strategic plan must be ascertained to overcome the future challenges of Municipal solid waste (MSW) locally and globally. Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) coined an initiative to demonstrate a showcase pilot plant for green energy production from MSW. The data was obtained from the survey and actual sampling within the UPM compound shows that UPM has generated 5.0-7.0 t/d of MSW generated consist of 30-35% organic fraction. Restaurants are the main source of the organic fraction. Upon separation, the organic fractions were digested into biogas. At a maximum conversion of the organic fraction, 715 kWh of electricity might be generated from the 2.2 t/d of organic waste generated in UPM. In this study, organic components from UPM were proposed to be subsequently used as a substrate via anaerobic digestion to produce green energy in the form of electricity or flammable fuels.

TI Sustainable strategy for municipal solid waste disposal in Hong Kong:
   current practices and future perspectives
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Hong Kong (HK) is confronted by increasing problems of solid waste disposal, as it is an overpopulated city with limited land resources. Currently, solid waste disposal mainly relies on three landfills located in the New Territories. However, the current waste treatment facilities and policies cannot appropriately control and manage increments of solid waste. The primary reason is the increased amount of municipal solid waste (MSW) caused by the growth of the population and the economy, with food waste accounting for the largest proportion of MSW in HK. The secondary reason is that the capacity of existing landfills will be exhausted in the near future as the level of waste generated continues to grow. To deal with these problems, in this paper, we propose five approaches with the aim of identifying the most sustainable strategy for efficient solid waste disposal in HK: a food waste recycling program; an MSW charging scheme; the implementation of incineration plants (i.e., waste to energy); black soldier fly bioconversion and a waste trading scheme; and black soldier fly bioconversion and a hybrid anaerobic digestion system. This is followed by a detailed demonstration of each approach, particularly focusing on the benefits, limitations, and implementation of each in the case of HK. The results of this study may shed light on how to effectively and sustainably manage the increasing amount of solid waste in HK.

TI Life cycle assessment on the treatment of organic waste streams by
   anaerobic digestion, hydrothermal carbonization and incineration
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB By means of source-segregation, organic waste streams are deterred from mass-burning and more sustainable treatment paths may be enabled. This study analyzed the environmental and economic performance of custom treatment paths for organic waste streams in Germany towards energy generation. The reference quantity was the production and export of 1 kWh of exergy, while treating a certain amount of waste. The methodologies of environmental life cycle assessment (eLCA) and levelized costs of exergy (LCOE) were applied. The considered treatment systems were (i) anaerobic digestion, (ii) hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) and (iii) incineration. The technologies were considered individually or in a cascade. The analyzed waste streams were the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW), food waste and waste wood. For food waste and OFMSW, anaerobic digestion followed by the spreading of the digestate was characterized by overall beneficial environmental and economic properties. As the preferable treatment system was the same for both substrates, a separate collection of food waste was not considered worthwhile. For waste wood, the most environmentally friendly and economic option was direct incineration -either in a waste incinerator or in a lignite power plant. The implementation of an HTC process appeared viable for the treatment of OFMSW and food waste, both from an environmental and economic point of view. However, the energy intensive system must be outlined towards an environmentally friendly heat source. In this context, a cascading of anaerobic digestion with the HTC-process proofed to be an acceptable alternative.

TI Environmental Effects of Sewage Sludge Carbonization and Other Treatment
   Alternatives
SO ENERGIES
AB Carbonization is a newly developed process that converts sewage sludge to biocoal, a type of solid biomass that can partially substitute for coal during power generation. This study presents an assessment of the environmental effects of various sewage sludge treatment processes, including carbonization, direct landfills, co-incineration with municipal solid waste, and mono-incineration in Taiwan. This assessment was conducted using the life cycle assessment software SimaPro 7.2 and the IMPACT2002+ model. Results show that carbonization is the best approach for sewage sludge treatment, followed in descending order by co-incineration with municipal solid waste, direct landfills, and mono-incineration. The carbonization process has noticeable positive effects in the environmental impact categories of terrestrial ecotoxicity, aquatic ecotoxicity, land occupation, ionizing radiation, aquatic eutrophication, non-renewable energy, and mineral extraction. For the emission quantity of greenhouse gases, landfilling has the greatest impact (296.9 kg CO2 eq./t sludge), followed by mono-incineration (232.2 kg CO2 eq./t sludge) and carbonization (146.1 kg CO2 eq./t sludge). Co-incineration with municipal solid waste has the benefit of reducing green house gas emission (-15.4 kg CO2 eq./t sludge). In the aspect of energy recovery, sewerage sludge that has been pretreated by thickening, digestion, and dewatering still retains a high moisture content, and thus requires a significant amount of energy use when used as a substitute solid fuel. Therefore, the carbonization of sewage sludge would be a more sustainable option if the energy delivery and integration processes are made more efficient.

TI Biomethanization as a Method of Sustainable Utilization of Wastes
SO ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA
AB Millions tones of waste are produced every year in Poland. Among them industrial waste, municipal solid waste and sewage sludge can be marked out. In decades-long time the main method of their utilization was dumping on the landfill sites. Growing production of wastes effects with using non-renewable resources and leave disadvantageous legacy to the future generations. The aim of sustainable waste management is to reduce, reuse and recycle of wastes. In this paper anaerobic digestion process was shown as a sustainable utilization method. A sustainable sewage and solid waste management is a difficult task from economical and technical point of view. However, biogas production one of the accelerating sectors of renewable energy seems to be a promising solution. Since environmental regulations in the European Union are based on the concept of prevention and control of pollution, therefore waste-sludge management, waste disposal and environmental pollution are strictly linked. Biogas is formed as a product of the anaerobic digestion process and usually contains about 40-70% of methane. With regard to its high energetic value methane can be considered as a source of energy for producing heat or electricity. Alternative for anaerobic digestion could be co-digestion. This process makes conversion more profitable in comparison with one-source waste. In this study an amount of energy which can be obtain during co-digestion of solid waste and sewage sludge was estimated.

TI Carbon footprint of food waste management options in the waste hierarchy
   - a Swedish Case study
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Food waste is a problem with economic, environmental and social implications, making it both important and complex. Previous studies have addressed food waste management options at the less prioritised end of the waste hierarchy, but information on more prioritised levels is also needed when selecting the best available waste management options. Investigating the global warming potential of different waste management options offers a limited perspective, but is still important for validating generations from the waste hierarchy in a local context. This study compared the effect on greenhouse gas emissions of different food waste management scenarios representing different levels in the waste hierarchy in the city of Uppsala, Sweden. A life cycle assessment was performed for six waste management scenarios (landfill, incineration, composting, anaerobic digestion, animal feed and donations), using five food products (bananas, grilled chicken, lettuce, beef and bread) as examples when treated as individual waste streams. For all five waste streams, the established waste hierarchy was a useful, but approximate, tool for prioritising the various options, since landfill proved to tie the worst option and donation, anaerobic digestion and incineration with energy recovery the best options, for easily handle products, wet products and dry products, respectively, taking into account the GHG emissions. The greatest potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions was in the bread waste stream, since bread is an energy-rich product with a relatively low carbon footprint, increasing the possibilities for replacing fossil energy carriers. Lettuce, with its high water content, had the least potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions when the waste management method was changed. Waste valorisation measures should therefore focus on food products with the potential to replace production of goods and services, rather than on food products that are wasted in large quantities or have a high carbon footprint.

TI Life cycle assessment of portable two-stage anaerobic digestion of mixed
   food waste and cardboard
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Biogas produced from organic waste can reduce waste and produce renewable energy and is a viable waste treatment alternative for remote encampments. Portable, small-scale anaerobic digestion (AD) units can be used to sustainably produce biogas in remote areas and reduce landfilled waste. This project investigated the life cycle impacts of a portable AD unit and the effects of organic loading rate (8-32 g chemical oxygen demand (COD) L-1 d(-1)) and waste composition (food versus cardboard waste ratios of 35:65 and 65:35) on biogas production efficiency. Optimal biogas production was obtained using a 65% food to 35% cardboard waste mixture and a mid-range organic loading rate (16 g COD L-1 d(-1)); this scenario also yielded the lowest climate change impact [37.4 +/- 0.7 g CO2 eq per kg COD waste] due to greater biogas conversion efficiency. However, the overall life cycle impacts of biogas production were not significantly affected by waste mixtures or feed rates in the AD portable system and experiments evaluated. Life cycle impacts due to portable AD processing were overall agnostic to feedstock variability. Thus, waste type and volume variations generated by encampments with fluctuating populations can likely be accommodated by the portable AD system without substantially affecting short term process sustainability. Portable AD system biogas generation rates were comparable to conventional, full-scale waste to energy facilities, while combustion impacts were more sustainable than those associated with conventional fossil fuels. Portable AD units represent a sustainable energy resource, waste reduction, and landfill alternative for remote areas.

TI An industrial ecology approach to municipal solid waste management: II.
   Case studies for recovering energy from the organic fraction of MSW
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB The organic fraction of municipal solid waste provides abundant opportunities for industrial ecology-based symbiotic use. Energy production, economics, and environmental aspects are analyzed for four alternatives based on different technologies: incineration with energy recovery, gasification, anaerobic digestion, and fermentation. In these cases electricity and ethanol are the products considered, but other products and attempts at symbiosis can be made. The four technologies are in various states of commercial development. To highlight their relative complexities some adjustable parameters which are important for the operability of each process are discussed. While these technologies need to be considered for specific locations and circumstances, generalized economic and environmental information suggests relative comparisons for newly conceptualized processes. The results of industrial ecology-based analysis suggest that anaerobic digestion may improve seven emission categories, while fermentation, gasification, and incineration successively improve fewer emissions. A conceptual level analysis indicates that gasification, anaerobic digestion, and fermentation alternatives lead to positive economic results. In each case the alternatives and their assumptions need further analysis for any particular community. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Development of a Municipal Solid Waste Management Life Cycle Assessment
   Tool for Banepa Municipality, Nepal
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In this study, the life cycle assessment (LCA) method has been used to evaluate the environmental impacts of various municipal solid waste (MSW) management system scenarios in Banepa municipality, Nepal, in terms of global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP), human toxicity potential (HTP), abiotic depletion potential (ADP), and photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP). There are at least six possible scenarios of MSW management in Banepa: the current or baseline scenario (Scenario 1); composting with landfilling (Scenario 2); material recovery facility (MRF) recycling, composting, and landfilling (Scenario 3); MRF and anaerobic digestion (AD); composting, and landfilling (Scenario 4); MRF, composting, AD, and landfilling (Scenario 5); and, finally, incineration with landfilling (Scenario 6). Using both information from Ecoinvent 3.6 (2019) and published research articles, a spreadsheet tool based on the LCA approach was created. The impact of the recycling rate on each of the six abovementioned scenarios was evaluated using sensitivity analysis, which showed that the recycling rate can considerably decrease the life-cycle emissions from the MSW management system. Scenario 3 was found to have the least overall environmental impact with a GWP of 974.82 kg CO2 eq. per metric ton (t), EP of 0.04 kg PO4 eq./t, AP of 0.15 kg SO2 eq./t, HTP of 4.55 kg 1,4 DB eq./t, ADP of -0.03 kg Sb eq./t, and POCP of 0.06 kg C2H4 eq./t. By adoption of MRF and biological treatments such as composting and AD, environmental impact categories such as AP, EP, HTP, ADP, POCP, and GWP can be significantly reduced. The findings of this study can potentially serve as a reference for cities in the developing world in order to aid in both the planning and the operation of environmentally friendly MSW management systems.

TI Application of TOPSIS and VIKOR improved versions in a multi criteria
   decision analysis to develop an optimized municipal solid waste
   management model
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Selecting a suitable Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method is a crucial stage to establish a Solid Waste Management (SWM) system. Main objective of the current study is to demonstrate and evaluate a proposed method using Multiple Criteria Decision Making methods (MCDM). An improved version of Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) applied to obtain the best municipal solid waste management method by comparing and ranking the scenarios. Applying this method in order to rank treatment methods is introduced as one contribution of the study. Besides, Viekriterijumsko Kompromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) compromise solution method applied for sensitivity analyses. The proposed method can assist urban decision makers in prioritizing and selecting an optimized Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) treatment system. Besides, a logical and systematic scientific method was proposed to guide an appropriate decision-making.
   A modified TOPSIS methodology as a superior to existing methods for first time was applied for MSW problems. Applying this method in order to rank treatment methods is introduced as one contribution of the study. Next, 11 scenarios of MSW treatment methods are defined and compared environmentally and economically based on the waste management conditions. Results show that integrating a sanitary landfill (18.1%), RDF (3.1%), composting (2%), anaerobic digestion (40.4%), and recycling (36.4%) was an optimized model of integrated waste management. An applied decision-making structure provides the opportunity for optimum decision-making. Therefore, the mix of recycling and anaerobic digestion and a sanitary landfill with Electricity Production (EP) are the preferred options for MSW management. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI A multi-objective model to optimize country-scale municipal solid waste
   management with economic and environmental objectives: A case study in
   Malaysia
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) is a universal issue affecting all countries. In Malaysia, almost 90% of the MSW is disposed of in open landfills with no energy recovery system. Due to the heterogeneous characteristics of MSW, it is essential to develop a combination of different waste processing facilities with simultaneous cost and greenhouse gas (GHG) minimization. A novel multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming with the augmented e-constraint method is developed to assess the optimum MSW allocation on seven conventional waste processing facilities, including open landfills, material recycling facility, sanitary landfills, anaerobic digestion, composting, incineration, and plasma gasification. The avoided emissions of the valuable products valorized from MSW, which have been often neglected in the optimization model, are included in the study to investigate the extent of emissions reduction in the MSW management system. Compared to the current scenario in Malaysia (total cost: 66.66 MYR/tonne MSW, net GHG emissions: 0.42 tonne CO2-eq/tonne MSW), the least-cost solution (i.e., 74% open landfill, 10% sanitary landfill, and 15% material recycling facility) shows 26% reduction for both cost and GHG emissions, while the least GHG emissions solution (i.e., 20% sanitary landfill, 21% anaerobic digestion, 21% composting, 21% plasma gasification, and 17% material recycling facility) indicates 159% reduction of GHG emissions with 15% increase in cost. Among the 11 Pareto-optimal solutions, the 10th solution (34% sanitary landfill, 21% anaerobic digestion, 21% composting, 17% material recycling facilities, and 8% plasma gasification) reduces 3% of national greenhouse gas emissions and is recommended for future MSW management in Malaysia. The sensitivity analysis indicates that plasma gasification is more favorable when the electricity price is higher. A change of waste separation rate from 30% to 90% reduces total MSW management cost and the net GHG emissions by 18.24 MYR/tonne MSW and 0.30 tonne CO2-eq/tonne MSW, respectively. This study provides quantitative information to policymakers in developing a sustainable and resource-efficient MSW management system in Malaysia.

TI An environmental LCA of alternative scenarios of urban sewage sludge
   treatment and disposal
SO THERMAL SCIENCE
AB The majority of pollutants that effect wastewater are concentrated by treatment processes in sludge; it is therefore critical to have a suitable evaluation methodology of sludge management options to analyse if pollution is redirected from water to other media, such as air and soil. Life cycle assessment is one of the most widely known and internationally accepted methodologies to compare environmental impacts of processes and systems and to evaluate their sustainability in the entire life cycle. In this study the methodology was applied to assess and compare three scenarios of urban sewage sludge treatment and disposal: sludge anaerobic digestion followed by dedicated incineration, sludge incineration without previous digestion, and sludge anaerobic digestion followed by composting. The potential benefits of spreading the compost to soil were not included in the system boundaries even if due to its nutrients contents and soil improving,features, compost could partially replace the use of commercial products. The study was aimed at finding out the environmental critical points of the treatment alternatives selected and at providing a technical and scientific contribution for further debates with national and local authorities on the environmental optimisation of sewage sludge management. Life cycle assessment results confirmed the major contribution of electricity and methane consumption on several environmental impact categories. Incineration contributes more than sludge, composting to almost all categories, although the heavy metals content of urban wastewater sludge raises substantial concerns when composted sludge is spread to soil. In this paper the models adopted, the hypotheses assumed and the main findings of the study are presented and discussed.

TI Source separation, transportation, pretreatment, and valorization of
   municipal solid waste: a critical review
SO ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB Waste sorting is an effective means of enhancing resource or energy recovery from municipal solid waste (MSW). Waste sorting management system is not limited to source separation, but also involves at least three stages, i.e., collection and transportation (C&T), pretreatment, and resource utilization. This review focuses on the whole process of MSW management strategy based on the waste sorting perspective. Firstly, as the sources of MSW play an essential role in the means of subsequent valorization, the factors affecting the generation of MSW and its prediction methods are introduced. Secondly, a detailed comparison of approaches to source separation across countries is presented. Constructing a top-down management system and incentivizing or constraining residents' sorting behavior from the bottom up is believed to be a practical approach to promote source separation. Then, the current state of C&T techniques and its network optimization are reviewed, facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things technologies. Furthermore, the advances in pretreatment strategies for enhanced sorting and resource recovery are introduced briefly. Finally, appropriate methods to valorize different MSW are proposed. It is worth noting that new technologies, such as AI, show high application potential in waste management. The sharing of (intermediate) products or energy of varying processing units will inject vitality into the waste management network and achieve sustainable development.

TI Anaerobic digestion of food waste - Challenges and opportunities
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB The disposal of large amounts of food waste has caused significant environmental pollution and financial costs globally. Compared with traditional disposal methods (i.e., landfilling, incineration, and composting), anaerobic digestion (AD) is a promising technology for food waste management, but has not yet been fully applied due to a few technical and social challenges. This paper summarizes the quantity, composition, and methane potential of various types of food waste. Recent research on different strategies to enhance AD of food waste, including codigestion, addition of micronutrients, control of foaming, and process design, is discussed. It is envisaged that AD of food waste could be combined with an existing AD facility or be integrated with the production of value-added products to reduce costs and increase revenue. Further understanding of the fundamental biological and physicochemical processes in AD is required to improve the technology.

The results of first step are to be utilized as a reliable data source in establishing a complete picture of the environmental performances of municipal solid waste management systems with a life cycle perspective. The functional unit of the study was selected as one ton of municipal solid waste generated in Sakarya. System boundaries included collection and transportation of municipal solid waste and its treatment and disposal by MRF, incineration, composting and landfilling methods. Data on the process was gathered from a field study conducted in Sakarya, and from SimaPro 8.0.2 literature and libraries. The data was evaluated with CML-IA methodology by the means of abiotic depletion, abiotic depletion (fossil fuels), acidification, global warming, ozone depletion, human toxicity, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity, marine aquatic ecotoxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity and photochemical oxidation. According to the results, while landfilling and incineration have been confirmed as the worst waste final disposal alternatives, composting and material recovery showed better performance. An integrated system (MRF, composting, incineration and landfilling) is considered as a solution towards improved sustainability to overcome the existing waste management problem. The paper showed LCA to be a valuable tool which can help governors and managers plan an integrated waste management strategy that provides more preferable environmental outcomes than the strategy suggested.

TI Current status and perspectives on anaerobic co-digestion and associated
   downstream processes
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
AB Anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD) has the potential to utilise spare digestion capacity at existing wastewater treatment plants to simultaneously enhance biogas production by digesting organic rich industrial waste and achieve sustainable organic waste management. While the benefits of AcoD regarding biogas production and waste management are well established, the introduction of a new organic waste (i.e. co-substrate) with different chemical composition compared to residential sewage sludge is expected to impact on not only the anaerobic digestion process itself but also downstream processing of biogas and digestate. This work critically evaluates the potential impact (both positive and negative) of co-digestion on key downstream processes in the context of AcoD of sewage sludge and organic waste. AcoD can potentially lead to significant changes in biogas quality, digestate dewaterability, biosolids odour and the nutrient balance within the overall wastewater treatment process. The literature reviewed here suggests that effective management of these impacts can enhance the economic and environmental benefits of AcoD. Potential techniques to manage the impact of AcoD on downstream processing include co-substrate selection to minimise sulphur content, co-substrate pretreatment to improve dewaterability, process optimisation to minimize downstream impacts, biological desulphurisation of biogas, and side stream nutrient recovery. These techniques have been investigated and in some cases successfully applied for conventional anaerobic digestion. Nevertheless, further research is needed to adapt them for AcoD. In particular, the issue of nutrient accumulation due to AcoD can be seen as an opportunity to utilise recently commercialised technologies (e.g. Phosnix and Ostara) and currently emerging processes (e.g. forward osmosis and electrodialysis) for phosphorus recovery from food waste and wastewater.

TI New Compact Biodigester Model for Organic Waste Treatment in Urban
   Residences and Buildings
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
AB A biodigester consists of a closed chamber to anaerobically digest biomass into biogas and biofertilizer, and is an efficient alternative for organic waste treatment and energy generation. The new interest in decentralizing waste treatment and the restricted space of urban centers makes compact biodigesters a feasible alternative for sustainable cities. This paper presents the compact and low-cost Hexagonal Methane Collector biodigester and its operational capacity to produce biogas. The factorial experimental design results indicate that the volume of inoculum and mixture inside the reactor are important in controlling biogas yield, but the volume of water is not. The findings indicate that this novel biodigester technology has a practical operational mode based on a batch dry system. The space-saving hexagonal shape and the flexible design, which can serve a variable number of people in small places are other advantages of Hexagonal Methane Collector compared with available models. Therefore, this concept of biodigester could be an important tool to integrate organic waste treatment and energy sustainability goals in increasingly populated urban centers.

TI Management of urban solid waste: Vermicomposting a sustainable option
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Solid waste management is a worldwide problem and it is becoming more and more complicated day by day due to rise in population, industrialization as well as changes in our life style. Presently most of the waste generated is either disposed of in an open dump in developing countries or in landfills in the developed ones. Landfilling as well as open dumping requires lot of land mass and could also result in several environmental problems. Land application of urban/municipal solid waste (MSW) can be carried out as it is rich in organic matter and contains significant amount of recyclable plant nutrients. The presence of heavy metals and different toxics substances restricts its land use without processing. Vermicomposting of MSW, prior to land application may be a sustainable waste management option, as the vermicast obtained at the end of vermicomposting process is rich in plant nutrients and is devoid of pathogenic organism. Utilization of vermicast produced from urban/municipal solid waste in agriculture will facilitate in growth of countries economy by lowering the consumption of inorganic fertilizer and avoiding land degradation problem. Vermicomposting of urban/MSW can be an excellent practice, as it will be helpful in recycling valuable plant nutrients. This review deals with various aspects of vermicomposting of MSW.

   technologies for municipal solid waste
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB MSW management can be defined as the discipline associated with the control of generation, storage, collection, transfer, processing and disposal of MSW, in a way which is governed by the best principles of Public health, economics, engineering, aesthetics and other environmental considerations. The disposal of MSW has been the focus of environmental policy for several industrialised countries since the mid-1970s, when attempts were made to identify and categorise, in a systematic way, the waste fractions involved. This categorisation provided the policy makers with the necessary information, to determine the most appropriate option for dealing with the waste in a more economic and environmentally-sustainable way. This paper reviews the main economic costs and the environmental impacts of the widely-accepted waste treatment and disposal methods. Examples of successful waste-management schemes are presented and prospective future trends are assessed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Framework for life cycle sustainability assessment of municipal solid
   waste management systems with an application to a case study in Thailand
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB At present, there are many environmental, economic and social problems associated with poor municipal solid waste (MSW) management in Thailand. The development of sustainable solid waste management systems is a crucial aspect and should be based on an integrated approach. Therefore, an integrated system was designed for Nonthaburi Municipality incorporating recycling, anaerobic digestion, incineration and landfill technologies. In order to assess sustainability, a clear methodology was developed via life cycle thinking and a set of endpoint composite indicators has been proposed considering the most critical ultimate damages/effects of MSW management on the environment, the economy and society. The results showed that the appropriate integration of technologies offers important prospects with regards to socio-economic and environmental aspects, contributing, therefore, to improved sustainability for the overall MSW management system. The methodology and the proposed indicators would be useful in strategic planning, including decision- and policy-making with respect to the development of appropriate sustainable MSW management systems.

   SYSTEMS-JSDEWES
AB As the shift towards renewable energy sources continues, new approaches for energy recovery from sewage sludge must be established. This paper explores the feasibility of implementing full-scale co-digestion of municipal sewage sludge with fruit biowaste through the synergetic effects obtained at the laboratory scale. The efficiency/stability of the process was studied for three hydraulic retention times. By using simple tools to evaluate the performance of the anaerobic digestion system, such as the specific methane indicator and the energy potential recovery indicator, it was shown that the shortest retention time of 13 days had the highest methane production and almost doubled the specific methane production, thus contributing to sustainable waste management and energy self-sufficiency of wastewater treatment plants.

TI Valorisation of fish by-products against waste management treatments -
   Comparison of environmental impacts
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Reuse and valorisation of fish by-products is a key process for marine resources conservation. Usually, fishmeal and oil processing factories collect the by-products generated by fishing port and industry processing activities, producing an economical benefit to both parts. In the same way, different added-value products can be recovered by the valorisation industries whereas fishing companies save the costs associated with the management of those wastes. However, it is important to estimate the advantages of valorisation processes not only in terms of economic income, but also considering the environmental impacts. This would help to know if the valorisation of a residue provokes higher impact than other waste management options, which means that its advantages are probably not enough for guarantying a sustainable waste reuse. To that purpose, there are several methodologies to evaluate the environmental impacts of processes, including those of waste management, providing different indicators which give information on relevant environmental aspects.
   In the current study, a comparative environmental assessment between a valorisation process (fishmeal and oil production) and different waste management scenarios (composting, incineration and landfilling) was developed. This comparison is a necessary step for the development and industrial implementation of these processes as the best alternative treatment for fish by-products. The obtained results showed that both valorisation process and waste management treatments presented similar impacts. However, a significant benefit can be achieved through valorisation of fish by-products. Additionally, the implications of the possible presence of pollutants were discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The effect of adding of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMWS) on the anaerobic digestion of municipal sewage sludge (SS) has been examined. Research on a laboratory scale showed that the 75:25 ratio by volume of SS to OFMWS is the recommended limiting value which ensures effective co-fermentation and intensification of biogas production. Biogas production on the technical scale was significantly lower in comparison to that on the laboratory scale which could be the result of lower digester loads in the technical environment.

   Case Study
SO ENERGIES
AB Wastewater and sewage sludge contain organic matter that can be valorized through conversion into energy and/or green chemicals. Moreover, resource recovery from these wastes has become the new focus of wastewater management, to develop more sustainable processes in a circular economy approach. The aim of this review was to analyze current sewage sludge management systems in Scandinavia with respect to resource recovery, in combination with other organic wastes. As anaerobic digestion (AD) was found to be the common sludge treatment approach in Scandinavia, different available organic municipal and industrial wastes were identified and compared, to evaluate the potential for expanding the resource recovery by anaerobic co-digestion. Additionally, a full-scale case study of co-digestion, as strategy for optimization of the anaerobic digestion treatment, was presented for each country, together with advanced biorefinery approaches to wastewater treatment and resource recovery.

AB The objective of the present study is to improve the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge via co-digestion with biowastes. In the study, anaerobic co-digestion of sewage sludge and six organic waste materials as possible co-substrates for enhancement of bio-methane potential were carried out. Furthermore, the possible impact of the co-digestion on digested sludge content in terms of volatile solids (VS), Chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total solids (TS) were examined. Firstly, physicochemical characterization of sewage sludge as the anaerobic digestion feedstock was carried out before anaerobic digestion to obtain their composition. Characterizations such as proximate and ultimate analysis were carried out using a Hach spectrophotometer, a laboratory oven, and a furnace. The characterization feed-stock results showed that the sludge contains a reasonable amount of COD, organic matter, TS, and VS along with the inhibitory compounds which shows potential for a high yield of methane in biogas production, as long as the stability of anaerobic digestion is maintained throughout the process. The results show that the sewage sludge has great methane potential during biogas production quantified as 28.6 g CH4/kg feed. When compared to sewage sludge mono digestion, biomethane yield was increased by 3-6 times when thick co-substrates were used. Although high solid content co-substrates generated significantly more methane gas, they also increased the risk of organic overloading. Co-substrates such as molasses, food waste, animal manure, and fresh produce waste performed well at 25% co-digestion ratios. Furthermore, all other solid co-substrates co-digestion resulted in increased VS and COD residuals in digested sludge, with exception of manure. Most of the liquid co-substrates studied here, on the other hand, had a significant synergistic effect, enhancing the removal of TS, VS, and COD during anaerobic digestion.

TI Energy recovery potential and life cycle impact assessment of municipal
   solid waste management technologies in Asian countries using ELP model
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
AB Natural resource scarcity and the effects of environmental destruction have pushed societies to use and reuse resources more efficiently. Waste should no longer be seen as a burden but rather as another source of material such as energy fuel. This study analyzes the potential of three waste management scenarios that include the combination of four waste management technologies - incineration with energy recovery, composting, anaerobic digestion, and sanitary landfill gas collection - as ways to recover energy and material from municipal solid waste. The study applies the environmental load point (ELP) method and utilizes municipal waste characteristics and composition from India, Indonesia, and China as case studies. The ELP methodology employs integrated weighting in the quantification process to get a one-unit result. This study particularly uses analytic hierarchical process questionnaires to get the weighting value of the nine impact categories: energy depletion, global warming, ozone depletion, resource consumption, ecosystem influence, water pollution, waste disposal, air pollution, and acid rain. The results show that the scenario which includes composting organic waste and sanitary landfill with gas collection for energy recovery has medium environmental impact and the highest practicability. The optimum material and energy potential is from the Chinese case study in which 254 tonnes of compost fertilizer and 60 MWh of electricity is the estimated output for every 1,000 tonnes of waste treated.

TI Combined Life Cycle Environmental and Exergetic Assessment of Four
   Typical Sewage Sludge Treatment Techniques in China
SO ENERGY & FUELS
AB Four commonly used sewage sludge treatment techniques in China are compared, each with and without the combination of anaerobic digestion: composting, co-combustion in power plant, thermal drying-incineration, and cement manufacturing. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is used to quantify the environmental burden, while exergetic life cycle assessment (ELCA) is supplemented to measure the resources conversion efficiency. Afterward, abatement exergy is adopted to determine their degree of environmental sustainability, so that all environmental issues associated with resource use and environmental emissions can be solved simultaneously. Results show that anaerobic digestion is an effective pretreatment approach to reduce environmental burden. Thermal drying-incineration is preferable to co-combustion and cement production, since fossil fuel combustion is the dominant cause of emissions. Composting poses a positive effect to mitigate global warming, but it introduces high heavy metals to the soil. Results from ELCA reveal that thermal techniques present higher resources conversion efficiency than a biological system. Adopting anaerobic digestion obviously improves the performance of composting, but it has reduced the total energy recovered in thermal techniques. For process improvements, an efficient sludge predrying is important; and the use of a combined heat and power system can also provide more effective recovery of energy.

TI Critical evaluation of municipal solid waste composting and potential
   compost markets
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB Mechanical biological treatment (MBT) of mixed waste streams is becoming increasingly Popular as a method for treating municipal solid waste (MSW). Whilst this process can separate many recyclates from mixed waste, the resultant organic residue can contain high levels of heavy metals and physical and biological contaminants. This review assesses the potential end uses and sustainable markets for this organic residue. Critical evaluation reveals that the best option for using this organic resource is in land remediation and restoration schemes. For example, application of MSW-derived composts at acidic heavy metal contaminated sites has ameliorated soil pollution with minimal risk. We conclude that although MSW-derived composts are of low value, they still represent a valuable resource particularly for use in post-industrial environments. A holistic view should be taken when regulating the use of such composts, taking into account the specific situation of application and the environmental pitfalls of alternative disposal routes.

TI Waste-to-energy policy in Thailand
SO ENERGY SOURCES PART B-ECONOMICS PLANNING AND POLICY
AB This paper presents the conversion of waste-to-energy (WtE) in Thailand. The amount of municipal solid waste (MSW) generated in Thailand in 2013 was 26.77 million tons which requires an enormous budget allocation for municipal solid waste management (MSWM). However, the budget is insufficient to provide adequate MSWM services. In order to increase the efficiency, sustainable and environmentally in MSWM, WtE technologies are provided as a solution toward a successful policy. Thailand considers WtE, incineration, refuse derived fuel (RDF), anaerobic digestion, pyrolysis and gasification, and landfill gas recovery to be renewable technologies. These technologies not only reduced the quantity but also improved the quality of waste to meet the required pollution control standards, besides generating a substantial quantity of energy.

TI A multi-criteria decision analysis of management alternatives for
   anaerobically digested kraft pulp mill sludge
SO PLOS ONE
AB The Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) procedure was used to compare waste management options for kraft pulp mill sludge following its anaerobic digestion. Anaerobic digestion of sludge is advantageous because it produces biogas that may be used to generate electricity, heat and biofuels. However, adequate management of the digested sludge is essential. Landfill disposal is a non-sustainable waste management alternative. Kraft pulp mill digested sludge applied to land may pose risks to the environment and public health if the sludge has not been properly treated. This study is aimed to compare several recycling alternatives for anaerobically digested sludge from kraft pulp mills: land application, landfill disposal, composting, incineration, pyrolysis/gasification, and biofuel production by algae. The MCDA procedure considered nine criteria into three domains to compare digested sludge recycling alternatives in a kraft pulp mill: environmental (CO2 emission, exposure to pathogens, risk of pollution, material and energy recovery), economic (overall costs, value of products) and technical (maintenance and operation, feasibility of implementation). The most suitable management options for digested sludge from kraft pulp mills were found to be composting and incineration (when the latter was coupled with recycling ash to the cement industry). Landfill disposal was the worst option, presenting low performance in feasibility of implementation, risk of pollution, material and energy recovery.

SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB Various methods of solid waste treatment are available. However, due to heterogeneity characteristic of solid waste, determined the best means to manage solid waste in environmental view of point is not straightforward. In this case, solid waste management scenarios and an environmental analysis tool are required. This study compared various energetic valorization options with each other using the simplified Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. These scenarios were landfilling without energy recovery as a representative of existing solid waste management, landfilling with energy recovery, combination of incineration and anaerobic digestion, combination of gasification and anaerobic digestion, direct incineration, and direct gasification. A case study area in a typical KARTAMANTUL (acronym of three cities: Yogyakarta, Sleman, Bantul) intercity region in province of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. One ton of solid waste treated was defined as the functional unit of the systems studied. The Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) analysis was done by including field and laboratory survey to characterize solid waste in area study and using emission factors which were adopted from literature to estimate environmental burdens for each scenario. Inventory's result was classified into impact categories, i.e. global warming, acidification, eutrophication, and photochemical oxidant formation. The indicators of categories were quantified by using the equivalence factors of relevant emissions to determine the environmental performance of each scenario. The study shown that in most of the impact categories (except acidification), a scenario with direct gasification indicated the best environmental profile. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to examine change in outcomes for a variety of organic biowaste inputs, but had no significant effect on the overall result. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Optimizing biogas production: a novel hybrid approach using anaerobic
   digestion calculator and machine learning techniques on Indian biogas
   plant
SO CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
AB In low- and middle-income countries, managing municipal solid waste and crop residue burning is a major environmental and public health challenge. Composting and anaerobic digestion technologies are promising solutions for biodegradable organic waste management, particularly in India. However, accurate estimation of biogas yield and economic viability is essential for successful implementation of anaerobic digestion in Indian municipalities, considering regional climatic conditions like psychrophilic and psychotropic climates found in areas like North-east India. The proposed anaerobic digestion calculator provides valuable insights for operators to optimize anaerobic digestion unit performance, monitor seasonal variations in biogas production, and enhance profitability under diverse climatic conditions. It comprises a robust biogas production model and an economic model for revenue and cost evaluation. The calculator caters to the needs of anaerobic digestion units commonly employed in India, considering location-specific factors like energy prices, product values, and government incentives. The predictive models developed using machine learning techniques, including multilayer perceptron, support vector regression, and hybrid models like autoregressive integrated moving average-multilayer perceptron, enable the optimization of biogas production by adjusting key parameters. In summary, the proposed anaerobic digestion calculator and machine learning-based predictive models offer a comprehensive approach for biogas yield estimation, optimization, and economic analysis. This contributes to the efficient, sustainable, and profitable operation of biogas plants, supporting India's transition towards a bio-based smart economy and addressing environmental and public health concerns associated with waste management.

TI Biogas and biofertilizer production from organic fraction municipal
   solid waste for sustainable circular economy and environmental
   protection in Malaysia
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Waste management in Malaysia remains a persistent economic and environmental challenge. Up to date, more than 80% of Malaysian solid waste disposed at landfills and dumpsites. Therefore, Malaysia is facing an urgent need to move towards a sustainable solid waste management and thus resource recovery from organic solid waste. Hence, this study aims to investigate the feasibility of energy and bio fertilizer recovery fromorganic fraction municipal solid waste (OFMSW) via anaerobic digestion. The economic and environmental benefit analysis was investigated. Approximate and elementary analysis of OFMSW samples were carried out to estimate the potential production of biogas and bio fertilizer. It was found that organic waste contributes about 45% of the total MSW generated in Malaysia. Anaerobic digestion of 50% of organicwaste is expected to produce 3941MWh/day of electrical energy and 2500 t/day of bio fertilizer. In terms of environmental impacts, 2735 t/day of Carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, 1128m(2)/day of landfilling area and 481m(3)/day of leachate can be avoided. A net revenue of 3300 million RM (1 US Dollar approximate to 4.15 RM) can be generated by the sales of electricity via Feed-in-Tariff (FiT), sales of biofertilizer to local agricultural industries and inclusive of the saving generated from the reduction of OFMSW landfilling operations and leachate treatment at landfills. Economic development can go hand-inhand with environmental sound practices in the field of waste management. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the lack of appropriate policies in the last decades, Greece has delayed to adopt integrated practices on solid waste management. municipal solid waste (MSW) management has been recognised as one of the most urgent problems in Greece which was compelled by European Engagements to follow an efficient strategy. An integrated methodology for the MSW management of the Municipality of Patras, the third largest city in Greece, which involves the construction of a combustion unit, is developed and analysed. Furthermore, the estimated investment and operating cost of the suggested scenario and the implementation of a pilot composting scheme are comprehensively presented in the prism of current trends and the provisions of EU norms. This study is proposed as a useful guide for the waste management of the MSW in medium-sized cities which face similar waste management problems.

TI Valorization of solid waste using advanced thermo-chemical process: A
   review
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Global economic development and continuous rise in the standard of living has led to resource depletion and increased per capita waste generation and, thus waste management issue becomes crucial. Sustainable development and circular economy require prominent technology for reducing the pace of resource depletion while producing alternatives to meet future energy demands. Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is a potential source of interest for the recovery of either secondary raw material or to produce energy. At present, most of the MSW in waste treatment plants is converted into recyclable fractions called Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) through the process of Mechanical Biological Treatment (MBT) with the aim of reducing environmental concerns and increasing its value. The focus of this review is to evaluate the importance of a thermo-chemical process for conversion of RDF into fuel and value-added products as well as evaluating applicability of this process in waste management sector and solid waste treatment. However, due to heterogeneous nature of RDF, investigation of co-pyrolysis behavior of RDF components as well as reaction mechanisms in both catalytic and non-catalytic reactions has been conducted. It has been observed that a high H/C, low O/C ratio and lower biomass content in RDF feed produces better quality products and decreases the dioxins emission during pyrolysis. Interactions of free radicals produced from polymer components with biomass greatly affect the product distribution. Chemicals derived out of RDF pyrolysis have been discussed and effect of various catalysts in enhancing oil yield and quality has been summarized. Catalytic pyrolysis with the use of P, Ni, Co, and Mo modified zeolite catalyst improves the quality of oil, and also the activity and catalyst lifetime. Different reactor technologies available for solid waste valorization have also been analyzed.

AB Sustainability assessment of a waste management system is a very complex problem for numerous reasons. Firstly, it is a problem of environmental assessment, economic viability and social acceptability, and also a choice of the most practical waste treatment technique, taking into account all the specific areas in which a waste management system is implemented. For these reasons, among others, it is very important to benchmark, cooperate and exchange experiences in areas with similar characteristics. In this study, a comparison of waste management scenarios in the Cities of Ni and Sofia was performed. Based on the amount and composition of municipal solid waste, and taking into account local specifics (economic conditions, social acceptance, etc.), different scenarios were developed: landfilling without energy recovery, landfilling with energy recovery, mechanical-biological treatment, anaerobic digestion with biogas utilization and incineration with energy recovery. Scenario ranking was done using multi-criteria analysis and 12 indicators were chosen as the criteria. The obtained results show that the most sustainable scenario in both case studies is the mechanical-biological treatment (recycling, composting and Refuse Derived Fuel production). Having in mind that this scenario is the current waste management system in Sofia, these results can help decision-makers in the City of Ni in choosing a successful and sustainable waste management system.

TI Key parameters for behaviour related to source separation of household
   organic waste: A case study in Hanoi, Vietnam
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Proper management of food waste, a major component of municipal solid waste (MSW), is needed, especially in developing Asian countries where most MSW is disposed of in landfill sites without any pretreatment. Source separation can contribute to solving problems derived from the disposal of food waste. An organic waste source separation and collection programme has been operated in model areas in Hanoi, Vietnam, since 2007. This study proposed three key parameters (participation rate, proper separation rate and proper discharge rate) for behaviour related to source separation of household organic waste, and monitored the progress of the programme based on the physical composition of household waste sampled from 558 households in model programme areas of Hanoi. The results showed that 13.8% of 558 households separated organic waste, and 33.0% discharged mixed (unseparated) waste improperly. About 41.5% (by weight) of the waste collected as organic waste was contaminated by inorganic waste, and one-third of the waste disposed of as organic waste by separators was inorganic waste. We proposed six hypothetical future household behaviour scenarios to help local officials identify a final or midterm goal for the programme. We also suggested that the city government take further actions to increase the number of people participating in separating organic waste, improve the accuracy of separation and prevent non-separators from discharging mixed waste improperly.

SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The combination of anaerobic digestion and transesterification technologies to treat food waste avoids the environmental problems associated with other treatment methods and effectively utilizes food waste to produce valuable products for society. However, as the anaerobic mono-digestion of food waste is not as efficient as anaerobic co-digestion of food waste with other substrates, this needs to be considered in food waste treatment system planning. Few studies on the mixed treatment of food waste with other substrates have considered the system from the economic, environmental, and social perspectives. Therefore, this paper comprehensively considered the economic, environmental, and social objectives of food waste treatment systems and developed a multi-objective optimization model to investigate the optimal systems operational strategy for food waste mixed treatment with other substrates by anaerobic co-digestion and transesterification. Uncertainties regarding the source quantities of food waste and substrates are solved in the proposed model using trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, and a case study in China is given to assess the validity and practicality of the proposed model. It was found that different substrate types and different mixing proportions affected the optimal system decisions, environmental and economic objectives were mutually constraining, and there was a positive relationship between the social objectives and the economic and environmental objectives.

TI Municipal Solid Waste Management: A Review of Waste to Energy (WtE)
   Approaches
SO BIORESOURCES
AB Global municipal solid waste (MSW) generation will increase to 2.2 billion tons per year by 2025 as per the World Bank projection. Improper waste management often leads to environmental degradation (i.e. water, air and soil pollution), transmission of diseases, and the release of greenhouse gases emissions, which contributes to climate change. To combat these problems, several countries are following the waste to energy (WtE) approach, which significantly reduces the volume of waste and generates renewable energy. Thus, the present study focuses on the municipal solid waste generation, composition, and waste to energy conversion technologies. Thermal conversion processes including incineration, pyrolysis, and gasification for heat, bio-oil, and syngas generation are already well established and are being employed in several countries. Currently, researchers are trying to improve the efficiency of biochemical methods such as anaerobic digestion, microbial fermentation, and microbial fuel cells for biogas, biohydrogen, and bioelectricity generation from MSW. This review explains the recent focus on microbial fermentation and microbial fuel cells for biofuels and bioelectricity production. Development of these technologies can lead to suitable ecofriendly approaches for the future. WtE technologies are important components of circular economy that will assist to achieve the demand of clean energy in future.

TI Selecting sewage sludge treatment alternatives in modern wastewater
   treatment plants using environmental decision support systems
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The importance of the sewage sludge treatment within the field of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) suggests new dimensions of analysis where the relevance of economic criteria combined with the associated environmental issues are increasing the sludge management complexity. For supporting the decision process and for comparative purposes, this study assesses five alternative configurations for sludge treatment, namely: mesophilic and termophilic anaerobic digestion plus composting, incineration, gasification, and supercritical water oxidation (SCWO). The global warming potential (GWP) and the annual cash flow of each alternative are used to estimate a composite indicator for each alternative. Stakeholders' preferences are integrated into the assessment through the development of five scenarios prioritizing economic or environmental aspects. A case study for a 1 million person equivalent WWTP proved that SCWO is the most adequate option if economic and environmental criteria are considered equally important However, if the economic assessment is prioritized over the environmental one, thermophilic anaerobic digestion followed by composting turned out to be the most appropriate option. The proposed approach contributes to the implementation of more suitable sewage sludge treatment lines since it provides an indicator for each alternative embracing economic and GWP issues.

TI A Multi-Commodity Mathematical Modelling Approach-Hazardous Waste
   Treatment Infrastructure Planning in the Czech Republic
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This paper presents an analysis of infrastructure for the processing of Czech hazardous waste and pays attention to predictions of waste management development in the upcoming years. For this purpose, a unique complex approach to modelling future waste management changes is applied. The method uses a multi-commodity network flow model with reverse flows between treatment facilities to consider complete waste management of hazardous waste. The future outlook (2030) for the forecasted generation of different types of hazardous waste in the Czech Republic requires decisions on waste treatment facility infrastructure. The uniqueness lies in using real data for such a wide scope of a task, further enhanced by concurrent analysis of more types of waste interconnected through limited processing capacities. The results indicate the insufficiency in hazardous waste thermal treatment and stabilization. A suggestion is to extend the incineration capacity because it influences the stabilization units, which must process the remaining waste. The recommended increase is 100% with different proportions in individual regions.

TI Environmental and economic performance of an integrated municipal solid
   waste treatment: A Chinese case study
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The application of integrated municipal solid waste (MSW) management has become increasingly common for the mitigation of the ever-growing MSW stream. However, despite their popularity across the globe, little is known about the performance of integrated MSW management (MSWM) plants. This study quantitively investigates the environmental and economic performance of an integrated MSW treatment center in the city of Horqin Left Rear Banner, Inner Mongolia Province, China, using a combined life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC) methodology. Results indicate that the integrated MSWM plant is sustainable in both environmental and economic aspects, as the life cycle environmental impacts and economic costs can be offset by substituting virgin products with recycled counterparts. Amongst the included treatments, MSW separation, brick making and plastic recycling are the greatest contributors to the total environmental burdens and economic expenses. LCC results demonstrate that the equipment cost, tax and other asset costs are the greatest contributors to the total costs of the plant. Sensitivity analysis confirms that the increasing source separation ratio results in the reduction of environmental burdens and economic expenses via the usage of biogas and photovoltaic power. Furthermore, we offer recommendations for the promotion of the environmental and economic sustainability of integrated MSW treatment facilities. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Malaysia's stand on municipal solid waste conversion to energy: A review
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Malaysia is a fast emerging economy country with an average GDP growth of 4.6% and its outlook on energy generation and sustainable development are at the center of debate. It is estimated that each 1% growth in its GDP to be associated with 1.2-1.5% increase in total energy demand. An annual growth rate of 3.3% has been projected for municipal solid waste (MSW) production in the country while it lacks a comprehensive waste management network and over 80% of collected MSW is landfilled in inert, and unsanitary sites. This paper summarizes the status of the waste management techniques currently being used in Malaysia followed by an overview of sustainability analysis of the potential energy-recovered waste treatment techniques. It is concluded that retrofitting current landfill sites to capture methane is of great interest as it requires less time and investment in comparison with standard energy-recovered waste incinerator. The use of sophisticated waste incineration plants will be inevitable and other approaches such as gasification, and pyrolysis should be considered as well. Gasification, and pyrolysis are easily adaptable to bulky or powder-like wastes and drying of wet waste is performed through osmosis at no energy expenses. Due to the high level of moisture in Malaysian MSW, they therefore appear to be suitable options. In addition, an upgraded Feed-in-Tariff (FiT) embracing waste-to-energy techniques will effectively help to increase usage of renewable energy sources to acquire a green energy mix.

TI Structure characteristics and development sustainability of municipal
   solid waste treatment in China
SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB This study aims to analyze the development trend of municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment in China from 2011 to 2020, and provide insights into the challenges and opportunities of sustainable MSW management. Our analysis shows that MSW generation declined in 2020, which could be attributed to a combination of factors, including the low urban population growth rate, the implementation of the garbage classification policy, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also found that the shift from landfill to incineration is expected to in-crease significantly in the coming years, although there are still several structural problems, such as an imbalance in treatment capacity among regions and cities, and uncertainty about whether the increase in incineration treatment capacity can meet overall demand due to the high volume of MSW generation. Our analysis highlights the heavy dependence on government investment for MSW treatment mode change, which is difficult due to the expanding deficit between fiscal revenue and expenditure of local governments. Correlation coefficient analysis shows a significant positive correlation between the proportion of incineration and sanitation investment, and a significant negative correlation between the proportion of landfill treatment and sanitation investment. To address these challenges, we propose technological advancement and management optimization to reduce the cost of MSW treatment, as well as expansion of investment channels through green funds, taxation relief, and other means to promote high-quality and sustainable development of the MSW treatment industry. These changes could accelerate the transformation of China's MSW treatment industry from policy promotion -dependent to market-oriented sustainable operation.

TI Environmental performance of dewatered sewage sludge digestate
   utilization based on life cycle assessment
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Due to the global trend of urbanization, the amount of sewage water is increasing in cities. This calls for efficient treatment of the resulting sewage sludge. To date, in the 27 European Union member countries (EU-27), the prevailing treatment method is application on arable land. Anaerobic digestion is one of the treatment methods being increasingly used nowadays. However, the resulting digestate requires further utilization. Therefore, in this study, the environmental performance of composting, combustion, and pyrolysis options for dewatered sewage sludge digestate is evaluated based on a life cycle assessment. The results show that digestate combustion and composting performed better than pyrolysis for most of the selected impact categories. However, pyrolysis of sewage sludge is still under development, and there are, to some degree, uncertainties in the data related to this technology; thus, more information for the performance assessment of pyrolysis is still required.

TI Converting sludge to slag through a high temperature slagging
   co-gasification process: An evaluation based on a demonstration trial
   and life cycle assessment
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB A variety of sludge-based waste materials with distinctive physical and chemical characteristics are co-treated with municipal solid waste (MSW) in a demonstration-scale high-temperature slagging gasifier. The waste materials tested include dewatered sewage sludge (originated from industrial and municipal wastewater treatment processes, respectively), dried sewage sludge, sludge incineration ashes, and waterworks sludge (originated from freshwater treatment process). Up to 49.5% by mass of dried sewage sludge is successfully co-gasified with MSW and up to 89.5% of the solid residues from the gasification process is recovered as reusable slag and recyclable metals. Despite feeding of various waste mixtures, stable operation of the slagging gasifier is achieved with the proper control of the temperature profiles inside the gasifier, the melting of inorganic residues, smooth discharge of the molten slag, and effective flue gas emissions control. Various types of waste-derived slag are characterized to evaluate their potentials to be applied as sustainable construction materials. Toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) and compliance batch leaching test results indicate that the sludge-derived slag is environmentally safe with very low pollution potential. In addition, life cycle assessment (LCA) is performed to comprehensively evaluate the treatment of sludge-based waste materials via slagging co-gasification technology. These findings reveal the promising potentials of converting sludge to slag through the high temperature slagging gasification process based on both engineering and environmental aspects, as well as the possible areas for further advancement in the future.

TI Promoting the source separation of household kitchen waste based on
   comprehensive evaluation and economic feasibility
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The source separation and treatment of food waste is urgent for sustainable municipal solid waste (MSW) management. Household kitchen waste (HKW) is relatively difficult to manage as large amounts are produced by dispersed sources. Although many countries and regions have begun to promote HKW source sorting, controversy over whether and how this approach could improve the comprehensive benefits of MSW management remains. This study constructed four most potential HKW source separation scenarios, and compared their energy effi-ciency, environmental impact and economic benefits were with the baseline full waste-incineration scenario to provide foundation for HKW management policy formation. The results showed that, when the amount of MSW stabilized, promoting HKW source separation had no significant advantages, while the overall benefits of HKW separation would be further expanded with continuous increases in the generation amount of MSW, and the economic cost would be acceptable. The suitable application conditions of different source separation modes vary. Centralized anaerobic digestion of HKW is a suitable choice for regions determined to promote long-term HKW separation, since it could reduce environmental impact by 3%-51% over the baseline scenario, and the comprehensive benefits would be further accentuated as the source separation rate increased. Small-scale on-site biochemical HKW treatment should not be widely utilized as it has high pollutant emissions and costs per-unit. Food waste disposers (FWDs) achieved outstanding waste reduction effect, and the government could guide the purchase of FWDs by residents according to the urban drainage system conditions. HKW source dewatering required the lowest cost and effort, and could be a suitable solution for regions that cannot promote strict HKW source separation.

SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Sustainable waste management is the core issue of modern societies because of its increasing social and envi-ronmental concerns. Therefore, the scientific community is continuously struggling to develop scientific waste management proposals in order to mitigate the associated health hazards and environmental anxieties. Thermal treatments are viable solutions for waste management, especially for municipal wastes. Among these, gasifica-tion is a preferred technique to envisage the concept of a circular bio-economy by producing biohydrogen rich syngas. In this manuscript, we have critically reviewed various gasification technologies incorporating different feed alternatives, catalysts used, and technology adoption. Individual gasification of municipal solid waste (MSW) has many technical concerns; therefore, feedstock management by mixing with agricultural wastes can be a workable solution that can be opted with various existing gasifiers' designs. However, an economic balance has a stern influence on design strategy. In addition, regional waste disposal regulations and implementation are vital to curbing the MSW management issues practically.

AB Organic waste management is a growing issue due to the unsustainable practices of its disposal. Sewage treatment plants are designed to treat wastewater to produce a safe effluent. However, one of the by-products, the sewage sludge which is disposed off in landfill or used as fertilizer in agricultural operation is high in pathogens. Sustainability can be achieved by Vermicomposting of organic matter which involves accelerated cycling of nutrients though a closed cycle whereby waste products are put to productive end use. Vermicomposting and vermifiltration are natural waste management processes relying on the use of worms to convert organic wastes to stable soil enriching compounds. Domestic wastewater management can be accommodated through these processes in a sustainable manner. A considerable reduction in pathogens has been noticed in the end product to a level that it can be safely applied to land. This paper provides an overview of the system characteristics of management systems utilising vermiculture, to manage wastewater. The process can be used in a small scale for household waste treatment to rural or urban waste management.

TI Additive facilitated co-composting of lignocellulosic biomass waste,
   approach towards minimizing greenhouse gas emissions: An up to date
   review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Although the composting of lignocellulosic biomass is an emerging waste-to-wealth approach towards organic waste management and circular economy, it still has some environmental loopholes that must be addressed to make it more sustainable and reliable. The significant difficulties encountered when composting lignocellulosic waste biomass are consequently discussed in this study, as well as the advances in science that have been achieved throughout time to handle these problems in a sustainable manner. It discusses an important global concern, the emission of greenhouse gases during the composting process which limits its applicability on a broader scale. Furthermore, it discusses in detail, how different organic minerals and biological additives modify the physiochemical and biological characteristics of compost, aiming at developing eco-friendly compost with minimum odor, greenhouse gases emission and an optimum C/N ratio. It brings novel insights by demonstrating the effect of additives on the microbial enzymes and their pathways involved in the degradation of lignocellulosic biomass. This review also highlights the limitations of the application of additives in composting and suggests possible ways to overcome these limitations in the future for the sustainable and eco-friendly management of agricultural waste. The present review concludes that the use of additives in the co-composting of lignocellulosic biomass can be a viable remedy for the ongoing issues with the management of lignocellulosic waste.

AB Waste management practices such as open dumping and composting are widely used for the management of municipal solid waste (MSW) in Sri Lanka. Severe socioeconomic and environmental problems occur due to open dumping of major fraction of MSW. Anaerobic digestion is a sustainable waste management strategy to manage organic fraction of MSW (OFMSW). In order to evaluate the feasibility of this strategy, a mechanistic model was developed using a steady state anaerobic digestion model which was modified using improved Chen-Hashimoto kinetic equations. It was applied to treat OFMSW generated in open dumping site at Karadiyana in Sri Lanka. The daily MSW arrival to the site is 550 tons/day and input OFMSW slurry to the anaerobic bioreactor contained of total solids 70 g/l, volatile solids 55.6 g/l, carbohydrates 58.5%, proteins 13% and lipids 3%. According to the mechanistic model, minimum payback period of 1.79 years was achieved when anaerobic bioreactor operated in continuously fed mode at operating temperature of 40 degrees C and hydraulic retention time of 11.28 days. The volatile solid reduction efficiency of 76.62%, methane yield of 0.26 m(3) per kg of volatile solids added, electricity generation of 10.31 W per kg of OFMSW per day and carbon dioxide generation of 0.21 kg per kg of OFMSW were achieved at these optimized process conditions. The model was limited to apply for continuously fed anaerobic bioreactors operated at temperature ranging from 30 degrees C to 40 degrees C.

TI Environmental assessment of supercritical water oxidation and other
   sewage sludge handling options
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Sustainable development relies on the eco-efficient use of all flows in society; more value created out of each resource unit. Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) can be used for treatment of wet organic waste. The technology has been under development for over 20 years but has not yet been fully commercialized. SCWO allows for complete oxidation of all organics in sewage sludge and almost complete recovery of the inherent energy, essentially without harmful emissions. In this paper, a life-cycle assessment (LCA) of sewage sludge SCWO (Aqua-Critox) is presented and the results are compared with LCA results for other sludge handling options: agricultural use, co-incineration with municipal solid waste, incineration with subsequent phosphorus extraction (BioCon) and sludge fractionation with phosphorus recovery (Cambi-KREPRO). For SCWO, beneficial utilization of the heat of reaction is of crucial importance for the outcome. The electricity consumed by pumping and the nitrous oxide produced are other important parameters. The best sludge handling option from an environmental point of view depends on what aspect is considered more important in the impact assessment. Regarding global warming, the energy recovery methods perform better than agricultural use.

TI Post-treatment of food waste digestate towards land application: A
   review
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB With the fast-growing adoption of anaerobic digestion in food waste treatment, the appropriate disposal and utilization of digestate have become a prominent problem. Using digestate as a soil conditioner promotes the circular economy and the sustainable development of biogas production. Before the application of digestate, post treatment is necessary to reduce the volume and phytotoxicity, accelerate the stabilization, and conserve nutrients. In this paper, the properties of food waste digestate and the worldwide regulations on digestate for soil conditioning were summarized. The principles, mechanisms, and application prospects of the various post digestion treatment processes were reviewed and discussed, including dewatering, drying, and biological stabilization. Biodrying and hyperthermophilic composting (HTC) have great potential for accelerating digestate stabilization and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from digestate handling. Combined with chemical or biological approaches, biodrying and HTC processes could achieve a 27%e84% nitrogen fixation. Thus, biodrying and HTC are applicable in the post digestion stabilization of food waste digestate. Nonetheless, more attention could be paid to assure product quality via source collection management and process optimization.

TI A web-based geographic interface system to support decision making for
   municipal solid waste management in England
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB To evaluate the feasibility and sustainability of the waste management solutions, it is necessary to assess the quantity and the flows of the waste generated. This research developed a web application which serves as a decision support system for those involved in the planning and management of municipal solid waste. In contrast to present web-based solutions, this tool provides the necessary information regarding the supply chain that is required to assess the suitability of waste valorisation in a particular location such as waste types, waste quantities and related waste contractors. Using publicly available data, a web geographic information system was designed where factors that affect the supply chain of municipal solid waste can be investigated. These include spatial and temporal variation of waste generated. The concept was demonstrated in the developed web application using publicly available data about England. Waste market opportunities were identified, for example Kent County Council and Essex County Council were identified to have the highest quantity of incinerated waste with and without energy recovery (344 and 65 kiloton) respectively. Then Staffordshire and Lancashire County Councils were identified to have the highest quantity of hazardous and non-hazardous waste being landfilled (5 and 296 kiloton) respectively. Seasonal variation was inconsistent across counties, with East North-amptonshire having little seasonal variation in household waste (<500 tonne variation) as opposed to East Riding of Yorkshire which had higher waste volumes in summer with up to 15,000 tonne variation). Circular economy partners were also identified through the web application and these results are presented in context of waste-derived supply chain decisions. The web application is therefore able to provide a comprehensive tool for improving both strategic and logistical decision-making process for municipal solid waste management. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI An evaluation of the potential of waste to energy technologies for
   residual solid waste in New South Wales, Australia
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB The state of New South Wales (NSW) accommodates the largest population in Australia and is responsible for more than one-third of all waste generated in the country. An effective and economical waste management can be achieved by using waste to energy (WtE) technologies to manage residual wastes and produce energy. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of the WtE technologies for energy recovery and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction in NSW. In this study, major streams of wastes (municipal solid waste, commercial & industrial waste, construction & demolition waste) in NSW were classified into combustible, non-combustible and food organic waste. Four waste management scenarios using different combinations of WtE technologies, such as landfilling with energy recovery, incineration and anaerobic digestion (AD) were applied to evaluate electricity generation and GHG emission potentials from all these wastes. The results indicated that by employing a combination of incineration and AD for combustible and food parts of residual waste in NSW about 4165 GWh of electricity could be generated annually, which is equivalent to about 5.9% of the total electricity generation in NSW. This conversion of WtE leads to a reduction of about 1.7 million tonnes of GHG emissions annually. In this way, about 3 million tonnes of residual waste could be diverted from landfills in NSW annually which would offer approximately 50% reduction in landfilled waste by weight. Findings of the study showed that employing incineration and AD technologies could exploit a considerable amount of energy from residual waste and mitigate GHG emissions. Furthermore, employing efficient WtE technologies would divert organic waste out of landfills, avoiding emissions from landfills and will contribute to a greater share of renewable energy production, thereby reducing emissions from fossil fuel power plants.

TI The Crowding-Out Effects of Garbage Fees and Voluntary Source Separation
   Programs on Waste Reduction: Evidence from China
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This paper examines how and to what degree government policies of garbage fees and voluntary source separation programs, with free indoor containers and garbage bags, can affect the effectiveness of municipal solid waste (MSW) management, in the sense of achieving a desirable reduction of per capita MSW generation. Based on city-level panel data for years 1998-2012 in China, our empirical analysis indicates that per capita MSW generated is increasing with per capita disposable income, average household size, education levels of households, and the lagged per capita MSW. While both garbage fees and source separation programs have separately led to reductions in per capita waste generation, the interaction of the two policies has resulted in an increase in per capita waste generation due to the following crowding-out effects: Firstly, the positive effect of income dominates the negative effect of the garbage fee. Secondly, there are crowding-out effects of mandatory charging system and the subsidized voluntary source separation on per capita MSW generation. Thirdly, small subsidies and tax punishments have reduced the intrinsic motivation for voluntary source separation of MSW. Thus, compatible fee charging system, higher levels of subsidies, and well-designed public information and education campaigns are required to promote household waste source separation and reduction.

TI Estimating Monitoring Indicators and the Carbon Footprint of Municipal
   Solid Waste Management in the Region of Cantabria, Northern Spain
SO WASTE AND BIOMASS VALORIZATION
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) generation and management can have environmental impacts and generate emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). A sustainable approach and the application of integrating strategies to waste management call for a complete system of information management to be used in the decision making process. The environmental indicators are useful tools to assess the sustainability, the target, and objectives achievement and to propose and evaluate mitigation measures in the MSW subject. In this work the MSW generation, the treatment of MSW (recycling, composting, incineration and landfill), the recycling rates of glass, paper and cardboard and packaging wastes (metals, plastics and wood) and the landfill of bio-waste, have been proposed as indicators to track progress over time (2005-2009) of waste production and management in the region of Cantabria, Northern Spain. The carbon footprint indicator (CF) complements individual waste management indicators and would be useful to support decision making and policy analysis assessing waste management technologies and strategies under the global change impacts. The CF indicator has been applied to measure the global impact of collection, transport, processing and treatment of MSW in relation with GHG emissions. Results indicate that a reduction of the MSW generation and landfill of bio-waste are necessary to achieve the targets of the Regional Plans and Programs. The CF decreased from 2005 to 2009 by 35 % with the landfill as main contribution to the GHG emissions.

TI Pre-treatments to enhance biogas yield and quality from anaerobic
   digestion of whiskey distillery and brewery wastes: A review
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB In order to encourage industrial growth based on sustainability, the replacement of fossil fuels with renewable sources has gained global importance. Anaerobic digestion (AD) fulfils the requirements for a sustainable alternative fuel, and is also an environmentally friendly waste treatment method. It requires less energy than other methods such as gasification or pyrolysis due to its low operating temperature. Whiskey distillery and brewery waste streams are classed as high strength organic wastes due to their high BOD/COD content, thus rendering them a suitable feedstock for anaerobic digestion. Due to large global alcohol production, millions of tonnes of solid and liquid waste is discharged annually, so the potential for waste-to-energy conversion can make anaerobic digestion an attractive treatment option for the waste streams of distilleries and breweries rather than diversion to landfill or incineration. However, these waste streams are lignocellulosic, containing high fractions of lignin and crystalline cellulose, meaning pre-treatments prior to anaerobic digestion can significantly enhance the biogas yield and organic matter degradation. Acid pre-treatment and enzymatic pre-treatment are particularly promising, with improvement in quality up to 74% CH4 for AD of spent grain, with 16% increase in biogas yield, and up to 87% reduction in COD. However, industrial application of pre-treatments prior to anaerobic digestion remains limited. This review collates the literature to date on pre-treatments applied prior to anaerobic digestion of whiskey distillery/brewery wastes as well as current industrial practices and different reactor configurations. A particular focus is placed on the impact of pre-treatments on biogas yield in order to highlight potential enhancements in biogas yields for industrial implications.

TI Assessment of energy recovery potential and analysis of environmental
   impacts of waste to energy options using life cycle assessment
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Effective waste management such as energy recovery from waste is not very successful in many cities of India. The present study is carried out in the Dhanbad city, India where all the generated wastes are managed unscientifically through open dumping. Most of the reported life cycle assessment-based studies for Indian cities have focussed on the common waste management options such as composting and recycling. This study aimed to evaluate the energy recovery potential and environmental impacts of mainly waste to energy options namely; anaerobic digestion, landfill gas to energy, mass incineration and refuse derived fuel incineration based on the characteristics and composition of wastes of the study area. The selection of waste to energy options is done based on the composition of waste suitable for the respective options, thus making it helpful in reproducing the present work in other cities as well. Anaerobic digestion technology is evaluated based on the biogas generation potential of total food waste generated in the study area using laboratory-scale batch experiments. Similarly, landfill gas to energy is evaluated based on the estimated landfill gas generation (using LandGEM model) from the existing landfill of the study area. While incineration (mass and refuse derived fuel) is evaluated based on the heating value of combustible waste fractions. For the comparison of energy recovery potential and environmental impacts, six scenarios are developed. The maximum energy recovery potential of 602 kWh/tonne of dry waste is found for the scenario mass incineration of combustible waste fractions (72%) and landfilling of remaining wastes (28%). This scenario also showed the maximum net environmental savings due to avoided electricity production. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the collection efficiency of generated landfill gas for electricity conversion significantly impacts the change in global warming and photochemical ozone creation potential. The outcomes of this study will help the concerned authorities in developing the efficient waste to energy system.

TI Life cycle assessment of municipal solid waste source-separated
   collection and integrated waste management systems in Hangzhou, China
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) source-separated collection was started in Hangzhou since 2010. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is conducted to evaluate its effect on the environment. Four MSW management (MSWM) systems are compared, and the functional unit is defined as the annual MSW generation in the city. Scenario 1 is the mixed collection system, where 50.77 % of the MSW is landfilled and 49.23 % incinerated. Scenario 2 represents the current system under source-separated collection. In addition, two future MSWM plans in the city are also modeled. A new incineration plant is planned to be built as the short-term plan (scenario 3); while food waste biological treatment techniques will be introduced according to the city's long-term plan (scenario 4). Results show that a total 30, 18, 28 and 29 % of global warming, acidification, nutrient enrichment and photochemical ozone formation has been saved after source separation, respectively. Meanwhile, both the short- and long-term MSWM plans provide positive effect to environmental improvements. Sensitivity analysis further reveals that food waste biological technique is essential with the continuous rise of source separation efficiency; and MSW destined for landfill should be controlled efficiently.

TI Effects of including nitrogen emissions from soil in environmental
   systems analysis of waste management strategies
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB The environmental impacts of nitrogen emissions from soil resulting from the use of organic fertilizers, such as manure, are large compared with the corresponding impacts of mineral fertilizers. However, soil emissions are rarely included in systems analysis of waste management strategies. This study examines whether the inclusion of soil emissions can affect the environmental ranking of systems for managing solid biodegradable waste. Waste management scenarios based on incineration, anaerobic digestion and composting, respectively, were compared. The scenarios were analysed using the organic waste research (ORWARE) simulation model. A simplified model for calculating nitrogen availability and emissions was also constructed. Life-cycle analysis methodology was used for choosing system boundaries and evaluating the results. Global warming, acidification and eutrophication were the impact categories considered. The results indicate the vital importance of considering nitrogen emissions from soil when comparing biological waste management systems with other waste management methods, especially with regard to eutrophication effects. Soil emissions are also important when comparing the environmental impacts of anaerobic digestion and composting systems. However, the variation in nitrogen emissions from soil is large and depends on the spreading technique used, climate, drainage and soil texture (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

SO ENERGIES
AB The waste management sector is transitioning from a dirty and undesirable industry towards a green and sustainable future where energy and materials are recycled. Recycling has potential in sewage sludge treatment, where energy and highly valuable nutrients can be recovered through innovative and sustainable sludge management. Although there are many technologies and techniques already used for sewage sludge, the indicators for their sustainability are not developed. In terms of sustainable and innovative sewage sludge treatment, usually, only techno-economic aspects of existing and current technologies are considered. We explore the existing indicators and propose new indicators for sustainable and innovative sewage sludge treatment technologies. The indicators are differentiated into four main categories: technical, social, environmental and economic, where specific indicators are explained, followed by a description of their impact on sustainability. We also consider a case study using the LEAP tool, which considered GHG emissions when utilizing sewage sludge as an energy feedstock to replace existing fossil fuels in the energy mix in several scenarios. The results showed a significant emissions reduction when sludge is used-37.6% and 90.9% in 2030 and 2050, respectively.

TI The fate of microplastic in sludge management systems
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Sewage sludge (SS) from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is commonly used as a soil amendment on agricultural land; however, this sludge contains microplastics (MPs) which harm soil ecosystems and can leach into aquatic environments. This review aims to assess the fate of MPs in SS systems and, in the context of a changing agricultural scene, present alternatives for sustainable SS disposal that are consistent with the practices of a clean, circular economy. Anaerobic digestion and composting, which are commonly used to stabilize SS before land application, were not reported to substantially affect MP removal, although process efficiency and the microbiome were affected by MPs. Alternatively, MPs can be destroyed or removed by mono-incineration or combustion, but unfortunately, some MPs may remain in the ash after these processes. Therefore, the most desirable solutions would prevent MPs from entering the environment and remove them before they enter the biological part of a WWTP, where they build up in SS. Additionally, the management of MP-containing sludge must be adapted to the geographical context and the local economy, and it should begin with legislation addressing MPs in SS. The information presented here will help to develop good practices in waste management for preventing or decreasing the transfer of MPs into the environment.

TI Environmental impact of organic fraction of municipal solid waste
   treatment by composting in Sri Lanka
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB In Sri Lanka, the management of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) is a challenge. Composting is an environmentally and economically friendly treatment method for reducing the quantity of waste going to landfills. Although composting has many advantages, it has unavoidable environmental impacts, such as atmospheric emissions and resource consumption that should be considered. This work assessed the environmental impacts of a full-scale composting plant in Sri Lanka using life cycle assessment (LCA). The impact assessment results indicated that the composting system created burdens for global warming (218 kg CO2 eq/tonne OFMSW), stratospheric ozone depletion (3.13 x 10(-3) kg CFC-11 eq/tonne OFMSW), fine particulate matter formation (0.75 kg PM2.5 eq/tonne OFMSW), terrestrial acidification (6.17 kg SO2 eq/tonne OFMSW), and fossil resource scarcity (0.613 kg oil eq/tonne OFMSW). Impacts on freshwater eutrophication, ozone formation (human health and terrestrial ecosystems), human carcinogenic toxicity, ecotoxicity (freshwater, terrestrial, and marine), marine eutrophication, human non-carcinogenic toxicity, land use, water consumption, and mineral resources scarcity were avoided due to compost production. Ammonia, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions were the main impacting elements in the composting system. Finally, the findings of this study could help in decision-making and policy formation for waste management in Sri Lanka.

TI Comparison of municipal solid waste treatment technologies from a life
   cycle perspective in China
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB China has endured the increasing generation of municipal solid waste; hence, environmental analysis of current waste management systems is of crucial importance. This article presents a comprehensive life cycle assessment of three waste treatment technologies practiced in Hangzhou, China: landfill with and without energy recovery, and incineration with waste-to-energy. Adopting region-specific data, the study covers various environmental impacts, such as global warming, acidification, nutrient enrichment, photochemical ozone formation, human toxicity and ecotoxicity. The results show that energy recovery poses a positive effect in environmental savings. Environmental impacts decrease significantly in landfill with the utilization of biogas owing to combined effects by emission reduction and electricity generation. Incineration is preferable to landfill, but toxicity-related impacts also need to be improved. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis shows that the benefit of carbon sequestration will noticeably decrease global warming potential of both landfill scenarios. Gas collection efficiency is also a key parameter influencing the performance of landfill. Based on the results, improvement methods are proposed. Energy recovery is recommended both in landfill and incineration. For landfill, gas collection systems should be upgraded effectively; for incineration, great efforts should be made to reduce heavy metals and dioxin emissions.

TI The impact of the policy of municipal solid waste source-separated
   collection on waste reduction: a case study of China
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB To fight against environmental pressure arising from growing municipal solid waste (MSW), the program of MSW source-separated collection has been launched in eight pilot cities of China since 2000. What is the impact of this pilot program on waste generation? Based on the city-level data for 1998-2012, this study examines its impact on per capita amount of MSW by employing panel data model and inverse probability weighting method. It is shown that the policy of MSW source-separated collection has insignificant influence on reduction of per capita quantity of MSW while consumption expenditure per capita, average household size and average education level significantly accelerate per capita waste generation. Although the program of MSW source separation has not led to significant waste reduction in our analysis, source separation has provided the basis for reuse, recycling and recovery of MSW by classifying waste into categories of recyclable and recycling materials. In response to the pressure of growing MSW as a result of industrialization, urbanization and economic growth, source separation is the best approach to waste management to reduce the burden of waste disposals. Therefore, it is necessary to facilitate public participation in source separation by adoption of mixed policies combining voluntary with mandatory as well as education approaches.

TI Biogas production - A review on composition, fuel properties, feed stock
   and principles of anaerobic digestion
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB In the prevailing scenario, the aberrant use of conventional fuels and the impact of greenhouse gases on the environment have leveraged the research efforts into renewable energy production from organic resources and waste. The global energy demand is high and most of the energy is produced from fossil resources. Recent studies refer the anaerobic digestion (AD) as alternative and efficient technology which combines biofuel production and sustainable waste management. There are different technological trends in biogas industry in order to enhance the production and the quality of biogas. Nevertheless, the success of AD for further investments will rise from the low cost of feedstocks availability and the wide variety of usable forms of biogas (heating, electricity and fuel). Biogas, a combination of two-thirds of methane (CH4) and the rest is mostly carbon dioxide (CO2) with traces of hydrogen sulfide. The spent slurry from the produced biogas can be enriched to be utilized as manure for agricultural crop, promoting sustainable biomass production in the world. Biogas can be utilized to produce centralized or distributed power supply in rural and urban areas and are considered to be cost beneficial. The aim of this review paper is to analyze various feedstocks, which are widely used all over the world. The working operations of anaerobic digestion process, current trends along with its merits and demerits are also discussed in order to draw more research and development towards producing a sustainable environment.

TI Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from waste and biomass to energy plants
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Following the Kyoto protocol with respect to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases emissions, and EU energy policy and sustainability in waste management, there has been an increased interest in the reduction of emissions from waste disposal operations. From the point of view of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, waste incineration and waste co-combustion are very acceptable methods for waste disposal. In order to achieve very low N2O emissions from waste incineration, particularly for waste with higher nitrogen content (e.g. sewage sludge), two factors are important: temperature of incineration over 900 degrees C and avoiding the selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) de-NOX method based on urea or ammonia treatments. The more modern selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems for de-NOX give rise to negligible Sources of N2O.

TI Studying municipal solid waste generation and composition in the urban
   areas of Bhutan
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Bhutan lacks the solid waste data which are essential parameters for planning and scheduling of municipal solid waste management (MSWM) systems. The first ever large-scale research survey on solid waste generation and characterization in the urban areas of Bhutan was conducted between November 2007 and January 2008 using the method of waste sampling at source. The MSW generation rates in the urban centres were 0.53 kg capita(-1) day(-1), which consists predominantly of organic waste materials of up to 58% indicating a great opportunity for composting. Domestic waste from the households contributed the maximum (47%) component of the total MSW generated from the urban centres followed by wastes from the commercial establishments. Attempt to study the correlation between household monthly income and the waste per capita generation rates did not yield any conclusive result.

AB Recently, the amount of Yogyakarta province municipal solid waste (MSW) came into Piyungan landfill site stood at around 470 ton/day consisting of 77% organic and 23% inorganic fractions Annually, there was an increase as many as 8% per annum for the amount of MSW. Reduction of the MSW can be "forced" in integrated waste management site (in Indonesia is called TPST) which was built in the municipal level. In each TPST, there are two main activities which are Recycling and Composting. Both scenarios assume that 23% of inorganic waste can be recycled so that the subsequent need is to manage organic waste. Based on these considerations, calculations performed with: 1). Scenario 1: The TPST has been operated but there is no waste reduction at the source; 2). Scenario 2: TPST is operated and followed by solid waste reduction at the source. If the second scenario is applied, the amount of waste that goes to landfill Piyungan can be reduced up to 200 ton/day. Actually, scenario 1 is the realistic one because of Indonesian's culture. Unfortunately, as scenario 1 was highly dependent on the TPST, the number of TPST which must be built increase steadily that it can reach 60 units in 2030 which is impossible to find space in Yogyakarta province. If the second scenario is applied, the amount of waste that goes to Piyungan landfill site can be reduced gradually from 25% (1-3 years), 35% (4-7 years), and 50% (8-15 years) through composting activity. The challenge possessed by scenario 2 is how to force people reduce their own organic waste by composting activity. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Life cycle assessment of sub-units composing a MSW management system
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB This paper summarises the results of a number of life cycle evaluations that we have carried out in recent years about some of the sub-units (in particular, the recycling of the packaging materials, the treatment of the bio-waste, and the energy recovery from the residual waste) that compose a municipal solid waste management system (MSWMS) and about the MSWMS as a whole.
   The range of values estimated for cumulative energy demand (CED), global warming (GWP(100)), human toxicity, acidification, and photochemical ozone creation indicators according to the different analyses are presented in the paper for each sub-unit. The assumptions influencing the results have been identified, too. The proper aggregation of sub-units has allowed the estimation of the impacts associated with two integrated MSWMSs implemented in Italy and of the order of magnitude of those associated with a generic MSWMS, similar to those of the two case studies.
   The results show that the assumptions that most influence the environmental indicators are those about selection efficiencies and quality deterioration in the recycling of the packaging materials, about process emissions and avoided products in the composting, about the biogas yield and its way of utilisation in the anaerobic digestion, and about the efficiency of the plant and the kind of avoided energy in the energy recovery. All the indicators, except GWP(100) under certain assumptions, are negative in sign, thus indicating a benefit for the environment thanks to the avoided impact associated with the production of material and energy during the waste management. The estimated order of magnitude of the CED and GWP100 indicators turns out to be respectively thousands of MJ eq. and tens of kg CO(2) eq. per tonne of managed waste. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Composting Strategy Instead of Waste-to-Energy in the Urban Context-A
   Case Study from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The waste-to-energy programs that have taken place in recent years present a daunting picture in terms of sustainable material management. The incineration of much organic and unorganized waste in metropolitan waste treatment facilities is not meet with sustainable development. The solution to this problem may be to increase urban composting programs in the future, which is a sustainable treatment option but also a serious technical challenge. Our research question is whether composting programs can play a key role in rapidly evolving urban ecosystems in Asia, due to the specificities associated with the waste rates outlined and developmental differences outlined. Instead of the waste-to-energy or waste-to-landfill strategies often used today, can central composting focusing on high organic matter content be a suitable alternative? Using the AHP method (Analytical Hierarchy Process), the following alternatives were examined to clarify the issue: Wastes are commingled and processed at the treatment facilities; Classification of organic and non-organic waste at source for composting; Totally separating waste at source before processing at the treatment facilities. We have found that the use of central composting (separation of organic and non-organic waste at source) strategies to support circular development is one of the most innovative development strategies in the fast-growing cities of Asia, in line with E.U. targets.

TI Perspective review on Municipal Solid Waste-to-energy route:
   Characteristics, management strategy, and role in circular economy
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The proper handling of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is critical due to its high generation rate and the potential to minimise environmental impacts by simultaneously reducing resource depletion and pollution. MSW utilization for recycling is important for transforming the linear economy model into a circular one. The current review analyses and categorises MSW to energy technologies into direct and indirect approaches taking the Circular Economy perspective. The direct approach involves incinerating MSW for heat recovery. The indirect approach, including thermochemical and biochemical processes, is more complicated but attractive due to the variety of the valorized products - such as syngas, bio-oil, biochar, digestate, humus. However, consensus on the best MSW treatment approach is yet to be established due to the inconsistency of assessment criteria in the existing studies. In the case of converting MSW to energy (Waste-to-Energy - W2E), its economic indicators, such as capital, compliance, and operation cost, are important criteria when implementations are considered. In the current work, the critical characteristics of technologies for the MSW to energy routes are scrutinised. In addition, the economic characteristics and the role of MSW in the circular bio-economy is also thoroughly evaluated. Methods to advocate the industrial adoption and important assessing aspects of W2E are proposed at the end of the review to address the environmental and resource management issues related to MSW - most notably dealing with the uncertainty in composition and amounts, the energy efficiency and the resource demands of the W2E processing.

TI Sustainable design modifications municipal solid waste management
   network and better optimization for risk reduction analyses
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The staggering rate of waste generation due to industrialization, urbanization and population growth has raised a pressing problem regarding environmental damages and human health hazards, especially in developing nations. Severe environmental and social risks such as surface and groundwater pollution, soil and air contamination, serious human health hazards and damage to aesthetic aspects are some inappropriate waste management results. To overcome these burdens and move toward sustainable municipal solid waste management, effective and efficient practices are required. This study deals with a sustainable municipal solid waste network design problem under uncertainty. For this purpose, a multi-objective fuzzy robust programming model with the aim of minimizing the total costs of the network and environmental damages and optimizing social impacts is proposed. Different practical waste treatment practices are considered in the proposed network, including incineration, recycling, composting and sanitary landfilling. Also, a risk that is related to the population of facilities' potential location is introduced and the Fuzzy Failure Mode and Effects Analysis is applied to determine the value of the mentioned risk. In order to tackle uncertain parameters of the proposed model, the Fuzzy Robust Optimization approach is applied. The proposed multi-objective model solves as a single-objective model using the Fuzzy Goal Programming approach with Different Importance and Priorities. The applicability of the model is demonstrated through a real case study of Minudasht's municipal solid waste management system. The optimal location with the least risk and environmental impacts for each treatment facility with related technology and method is introduced. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis has done on some parameters to determine the effect of parameters' changes on objective functions. The results showed the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A Nexus Approach for Sustainable Urban Energy-Water-Waste Systems
   Planning and Operation
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Energy, water, and waste systems analyzed at a nexus level are important to move toward more sustainable cities. In this paper, the "resilience.io" platform is developed and applied to emphasize on waste-to-energy pathways, along with the water and energy sectors, aiming to develop waste treatment capacity and energy recovery with the lowest economic and environmental cost. Three categories of waste including wastewater (WW), municipal solid waste (MSW), and agriculture waste are tested as the feedstock for thermochemical treatment via incineration, gasification, or pyrolysis for combined heat and power generation, or biological treatment such as anaerobic digestion (AD) and aerobic treatment. A case study is presented for Ghana in sub-Saharan Africa, considering a combination of waste treatment technologies and infrastructure, depending on local characteristics for supply and demand. The results indicate that the biogas generated from waste treatment turns out to be a promising renewable energy source in the analyzed region, while more distributed energy resources can be integrated. A series of scenarios including the business-as-usual, base case, naturally constrained, policy interventions, and environmental and climate change impacts demonstrate how simulation with optimization models can provide new insights in the design of sustainable value chains, with particular emphasis on whole-system analysis and integration.

AB Solid waste management (SWM) represents a main challenge to the developing countries. Almost all of the solid waste in these countries are dumped into landfills, which harms the environment, public health, as well as affecting the economy and society. Dumping of biodegradable waste including sewage sludge resulted from wastewater treatment plants into the landfill results in methane emission, which is a greenhouse gas 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Thus, finding a sustainable solution to manage the biodegradable and sewage sludge waste tend to be crucial. This study aims to explore the feasibility of anaerobic digestion (AD) technology to man-age the biodegradable and sewage sludge waste in the Kingdom of Bahrain. AD is an important waste-to-energy technology that leads to produces biogas, an important and promising renewable energy resource for the country. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) was used in this study that shows the feasibility of the AD project. In addition, the contribution in reduction of the landfill meth-ane emission was estimated. The study may provide sufficient information for future adoption of evidence-based technology selection in order to adopt SWM technologies in Bahrain, which con-tributes to the decision and policy-making processes.

TI Assessment of the municipal solid waste management sector development in
   Jordan towards green growth by sustainability window analysis
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB It has been argued recently that green growth is the only economic development pathway to secure a sustainable future. The Government of Jordan has launched a National Green Growth Plan aiming to facilitate the transition towards green growth in six priority sectors; amongst those is the solid waste management sector. Jordan Vision 2025 has set a 33% reduction target in the solid waste amounts disposed in landfills or dumpsites by 2025. This study examines the development of the municipal solid waste management sector in Jordan from sustainability standpoint and presents potential scenarios to attain Jordan Vision 2025 target and gradually place this sector on a green growth path. The Sustainability Window analysis tool was used to assess the sustainability of this sector over the 2010-2015 period. This tool identifies whether the economic growth maintains the social and environmental wellbeing using strong and weak environmental, social inclusion, and economic indicators. Three scenarios to address Jordan Vision 2025 target were proposed and compared using the Sustainability Window tool: Mechanical biological treatment-anaerobic digestion, mechanical biological treatment-composting, and incineration. It was concluded from the sustainability window analysis of the 2010 -2015 data that the total number of jobs in the municipal solid waste management sector is a weak social inclusion indicator compared to the stronger one "jobs per 10,000 tonnes". Likewise, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per tonne is a weak environmental indicator unlike the stronger "net GHG emissions". It was also inferred from the Sustainability Window analysis that the 2010-2015 Jordanian municipal solid waste sector growth did not fulfill all sustainability criteria. The proposed future scenarios were compared and it was determined that the mechanical biological treatment alternatives fulfill all sustainability criteria regardless of the indicators' strength, whereas the incineration scenario only satisfies the sustainability criteria using weak environmental indicators. Nonetheless, mechanical biological treatment-composting is the most attractive scenario from an economic perspective owing to the lower GHG mitigation cost of $18.3 per tCO(2)-eq compared to $35.5/tCO(2)-eq for the mechanical biological treatment-anaerobic digestion and $161.7/tCO(2)-eq for incineration.

TI The Future of Flash Graphene for the Sustainable Management of Solid
   Waste
SO ACS NANO
AB Graphene research has steadily increased, and its commercialization in many applications is becoming a reality because of its superior physicochemical properties and advances in synthesis techniques. However, bulk-scale production of graphene still requires large amounts of solvents, electrochemical treatment, or sonication. Recently, a method was discovered to convert bulk quantities of carbonaceous materials to graphene using flash Joule heating (FJH) and, so named, flash graphene (FG). This method can be used to turn various solid wastes containing the prerequisite element carbon into FG. Globally, more than 2 billion tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) are generated every year and, in many municipalities, are becoming unmanageable. The most commonly used waste management methods include recycling, composting, anaerobic digestion, incineration, gasification, pyrolysis, and landfill disposal. However, around 70% of global waste ends up in landfills or open dumps, while the rest is recycled, composted, or incinerated. Even the various waste valorization techniques, such as pyrolysis and gasification, produce some waste residues that have their ultimate destination in landfills. Thus, technologies that can minimize waste volume or convert waste into valuable products are required. The thermal treatment process of FJH for FG production provides both waste volume reduction and valorization in the form of FG. In this Perspective, we provide an overview of FJH and its possible applications in various types of waste conversion/valorization. We describe the typical current MSW management system as well as the potential for creating FG at various stages and propose a schematic plan for the incorporation of FG in MSW management. We also analyze the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of MSW as an FG precursor in terms of technical, economic, environmental, and social sustainability. This valuable waste valorization and management strategy can help achieve near-zero waste and an economy-boosting MSW management system.

TI Waste-to-energy technology integrated with carbon capture - Challenges
   and opportunities
SO ENERGY
AB Carbon dioxide emission is a serious environmental issue that humankind must face soon. One of the promising technologies for reducing global CO2 emissions is oxy-fuel combustion (OFC) technology, which belongs to the carbon capture methods. OFC involves the use of oxygen and recirculated flue gas as an oxidizer in the combustion process. Application of oxy-fuel combustion in waste incineration can result in negative CO2 emission since some part of the carbon in municipal solid waste is biogenic. Such technology is often described as BECCS or Bio-CCS and it has attracted the attention of scientists recently. In addition to easier CO2 capture, oxy-fuel combustion of municipal solid waste offers other advantages, such as reduced flue gas volume, increased combustion temperature and the possibility of retrofit existing incineration plants. In the present paper, studies of oxy-fuel combustion of waste materials, in particular, municipal solid waste and sewage sludge are presented and summarized. The study shows the opportunities and challenges that have to be addressed to fully exploit the potential of the oxy-fired incineration plant. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Integral approach for the evaluation of poultry manure, compost, and
   digestate: Amendment characterization, mineralization, and effects on
   soil and intensive crops
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The egg industry has increased its production worldwide during the last decades. Several waste management strategies have been proposed to treat large volumes of poultry manure. Composting and anaerobic digestion are the main stabilization processes used. However, there are disagreements on the criteria for applying raw and treated poultry manure to the soil. We studied the relationship between physicochemical, toxicological, microbiological, parasitological, and metabarcoding parameters of raw and treated poultry manure (compost and digestate). Subsequently, we evaluated the mineralization of C, N and P, and the effects of amended soil on horticultural and ornamental crops. Compost and digestate presented better general conditions than poultry manure for use as organic soil amendments. The highest pathogenic microorganism content (total and fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella spp.) was recorded for poultry manure. Multivariate analyses allowed associating a lower phytotoxicity with compost and a higher microbial diversity with digestate. Therefore, only compost presented stability and maturity conditions. We found high released CO2-C, N loss, and P accumulation in soil amended with a high dose of poultry manure during mineralization. However, high doses of poultry manure and digestate increased the biomass production in the valorization assay. We recommend the soil application of stabilized and mature poultry manure-derived amendments, which reduce the negative impacts on the environment and promote more sustainable practices in agricultural systems.

TI A historical perspective of Global Warming Potential from Municipal
   Solid Waste Management
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The Municipal Solid Waste Management (MSWM) sector has developed considerably during the past century, paving the way for maximum resource (materials and energy) recovery and minimising environmental impacts such as global warming associated with it. The current study is assessing the historical development of MSWM in the municipality of Aalborg, Denmark throughout the period of 1970 to 2010, and its implications regarding Global Warming Potential (GWPI(100)), using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach. Historical data regarding MSW composition, and different treatment technologies such as incineration, recycling and composting has been used in order to perform the analysis. The LCA results show a continuous improvement in environmental performance of MSWM from 1970 to 2010 mainly due to the changes in treatment options, improved efficiency of various treatment technologies and increasing focus on recycling, resulting in a shift from net emission of 618 kg CO2-eq. tonne(-1) to net saving of 670 kg CO2-eq. tonne(-1) of MSWM.

TI Economic analysis and life cycle impact assessment of municipal solid
   waste (MSW) disposal: A case study of Mumbai, India
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) management is a major concern in Indian cities. This work rigorously assesses the relative costs and the environmental and health benefits of alternative MSW management methods. Management of MSW over the next 20 years for the city of Greater Mumbai was considered. A generic model was developed to determine the costs for (i) dumping on open ground, (ii) sanitary landfill without leachate treatment, (iii) landfilling with leachate treatment and (iv) regional composting and landfilling. LandGEM was used to quantify the gaseous emissions from landfill, while emissions from leachate and composting were taken from literature. The life cycle impact model of one tonne of MSW was developed using OpenLCA software and the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) 2011 method was used for impact assessment. The cost of disposal of one tonne of waste was found to be INR344 (US$5.17), INR741 (US$11.13) and INR1367 (US$20.53), respectively, for the first three scenarios. As compared to open dumping, landfill gas flaring reduced the global warming potential by 32% and leachate treatment reduced freshwater ecotoxicity and total human toxicity marginally, by 20% and 60%, respectively. Composting-landfilling was the most preferred option, with a cost of INR531 tonne(-1) (US$7.97), leading to a reduction in global warming potential by 79% and a slight decrease in freshwater ecotoxicity by 64%. Further, emissions due to accidental fires were also quantified. The study provides valuable insights for the selection of MSW management options for large metropolitan cities in developing countries.

TI A comparative life cycle assessment on four waste-to-energy scenarios
   for food waste generated in eateries
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB A life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted to determine the best solution for dealing with the food waste (FW) generated in Singapore eateries. Since the representativeness of the life cycle inventory (LCI) data determined the overall quality of the LCA, this study made a significant endeavor to capture the local specificities, such as waste composition, water supply and treatment plant operation. Characterization data showed that eatery FW from Singapore contained 16% non-biodegradable impurities (such as plastic and metal) and a higher methane generation potential was found in FW from the dining table than in FW from the kitchen. Based on the FW chemical element composition, mass balances were established for the four examined scenarios, including incineration (Inci), anaerobic digestion (AD) followed by composting (ADcom), AD followed by incineration (ADinci) and AD followed by gasification (ADgas). Because of the environmental benefits from compost production in addition to electricity generation, ADcom outperformed other scenarios in all impact categories except Eutro (eutrophication), GW (global warming) and POC (photochemical ozone creation). The best score of GW was observed in ADgas, mainly ascribed to the highest electricity output and the carbon sequestration of biochar. The disadvantages of the AD scenarios in Eutro and POC were associated with NOx and CO emissions from the biogas engine. Finally, the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that better environmental profiles could be achieved if improvements can be made by minimizing water usage, mitigating gas engine pollution, and diverting as much FW as possible from incineration plants to AD plants. However, based on the local context, source separation was not an urgent issue for improving the sustainability of eatery FW management.

AB Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, is home to approximately 7 million people. In 2011, the city generated about 2,372,500 tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) (accounting for 11% of national generation) and the collection rate reached 85%, of which 84% was sent directly to landfills (without landfill gas capture systems). This conventional practice has caused not only adverse environmental impacts but also increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and loss of recyclable resources. Since most of the waste generated in the city is organic waste (it accounts for 71% of municipal solid waste), there is high potential for organic waste recovery of MSW in Hanoi. This paper analyzes the potential for environmental benefits of introducing composting of municipal organic waste by proposing five alternative scenarios that range from current situation to composting of both commercial and household organic waste. In order to evaluate the environmental performance of the scenarios, we used three indicators: organic fertilizer production, landfill life extension, and GHG emission reduction. The results show that composting could produce a huge amount of organic fertilizer (i.e. from 6,424 to 218,650 tons/year) depending on the scenarios. Diversion of organic waste to composting could reduce the amount of waste disposed in landfills resulting in extending landfill life significantly. Therefore, landfill life could be extended from 0.5 to 8.7 years compared to the current situation. Current MSW management practices contributed the highest amount of GHG emission accounting for 1,322,928 tons CO2-eq/year, whereas the proposed scenarios decrease emissions in accordance with increasing the amount of organic waste used for composting. The estimated emission reduction from the proposed scenarios ranges from 15% to 98% compared to the current situation. The results suggest that composting could bring significant environmental benefits and is a key solution toward sustainable solid waste management for Hanoi city. In addition, composting highlights the potential of climate protection in the waste management sector.

SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Sewage sludge, generated post wastewater treatment, constitutes only a small percentage of the total amount of sewage treated, however, its sustainable management is inevitable. In this study, the energy recovery potential of sewage sludge by incineration and anaerobic digestion is investigated for India. The dewatered sludge has total solid content of 25-45% whereas, the primary characteristics of sewage sludge showed significant organic content of about similar to 23-40% (dry basis). The calorific value was found to be 8-21 MJ/kg for sludge dry matter. The energy recovery potential of sewage sludge was 555 -1068 kWh/tonne on sludge dry matter basis for incineration and 315-608 kWh/tonne for anaerobic digestion. Additionally, the energy recovery potential of current sewage treatment in India was found to be similar to 15.3 x 10(5) or 8.6 x 10(5) MWh, annually for incineration and anaerobic digestion, respectively. The study had provided in depth view of sludge to be considered as energetic material and its energy recovery potential countrywide, which would not only help for give a proper direction for recovering energy but also helpful to deal with the issue of sludge management in India.

SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Source separation plays a pivotal role in sustainable and integrated Municipal Solid Waste Management (MSWM) and in achieving a circular economy in Asia. However, it is still not an official practice, and many cities continue to utilise open dumping, involving receiving mixed waste without pre-treatment. This paper, therefore, examines the advantages of source separation of MSW and explores the main factors for success in the planning and implementation of official source separation programmes in cities in Asia. Analysis of the results for two case studies in India and Japan could be used to strengthen capacities of policymakers in designing and implementing official source separation systems to facilitate material recovery and achieve sustainable development in Asia.

AB This paper presents a number of recent advances in technologies and improvements in units for the thermal processing of municipal solid waste (MSW) and various other types of waste. The focus is on the 'waste-to-energy' approach; various criteria for this approach are discussed, as well as the inconsistent attitudes about waste management approaches that are present in various countries in the European Union. The presented achievements include low-NOx burners, improved efficiency, heat exchangers, waste heat recovery systems, newly developed equipment for wet scrubbing, dioxin filters and systems for the treatment of sewage sludge.
   A new concept for a regional Waste-to-Energy Centre (WTEC) is outlined, the design of which is based on a combination of experience, know-how and a sophisticated approach. The proposed WFEC will use up-to-date technologies and will provide an adequate response to the growing population and rising standards of living as well to increasingly stringent environmental regulatory standards. Utilization of computational methods such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for design optimisation and/or for troubleshooting is demonstrated with examples (flue gas duct, burner, combustion chamber). Several examples from industrial applications are summarized. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   and Strategies of Mitigation
SO PROCESSES
AB Organic waste generation, collection, and management have become a crucial problem in modern and developing societies. Among the technologies proposed in a circular economy and sustainability framework, composting has reached a strong relevance in terms of clean technology that permits reintroducing organic matter to the systems. However, composting has also negative environmental impacts, some of them of social concern. This is the case of composting atmospheric emissions, especially in the case of greenhouse gases (GHG) and certain families of volatile organic compounds (VOC). They should be taken into account in any environmental assessment of composting as organic waste management technology. This review presents the relationship between composting operation and composting gaseous emissions, in addition to typical emission values for the main organic wastes that are being composted. Some novel mitigation technologies to reduce gaseous emissions from composting are also presented (use of biochar), although it is evident that a unique solution does not exist, given the variability of exhaust gases from composting.

TI Environmental impact assessment of organic fraction of municipal solid
   waste treatment by anaerobic digestion in Sri Lanka
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB The management of organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) has continued to be a significant challenge in Sri Lanka. Anaerobic digestion is one of the management options of OFMSW. However, it generates unavoidable environmental impacts that should be addressed. The present study focuses to assess the environmental impact of a full-scale anaerobic digestion plant in Sri Lanka from a life cycle perspective. The inventory data were obtained from direct interviews and field measurements. Environmental burdens were found to be in terms of global warming potential (230 kg CO2 eq) ozone formation on human health (6.15 x 10-6 kg NOx eq), freshwater eutrophication (2.92 x 10-3 kg P eq), freshwater ecotoxicity (9.27 x 10-5 kg 1,4 DCB eq), human carcinogenic toxicity (3.98 x 10-4 kg 1,4 DCB eq), land use (1.32 x 10-4 m2 a crop eq) and water consumption (2.23 x 10-2 m3). The stratospheric ozone depletion, fine particulate matter formation, ozone formation on terrestrial ecosystems, terrestrial acidification, marine eutrophication, ecotoxicity (terrestrial and marine), human non-carcinogenic toxicity, mineral resource scarcity and fossil resource scarcity, were avoided due to electricity production. Results show that the direct gaseous emissions and digestate generation should be addressed in order to reduce the burdens from the anaerobic digestion plant. Finally, the results of the study could help in policy formation and decision-making in selecting future waste management systems in Sri Lanka.

   management technologies by source separation in Hanoi, Vietnam
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The organic fraction of municipal solid wastes in Southeast Asia, which has a high moisture content, accounts for a large proportion of total waste. Local governments need to pay adequate attention to the composition of wastes to determine alternative waste management technologies. This study proposed the use of a triangle diagram to describe changes in proximate composition and rates of successful source separation of municipal solid waste and to identify technical challenges about alternative waste management technologies such as incineration, composting, and refuse-derived fuel production based on physical and proximate composition analysis of household waste sampled in Hanoi, Vietnam, as a case study. The analysis indicated the effectiveness of different types of source separation as well as different levels of successful achievement of source separation as an adjustment mechanism for the proximate composition of waste. Proper categorization of wastes for source separation is necessary for the appropriate use of alternative waste management technologies. The results showed that, at a source separation rate of just greater than 0.52 in a three-way separation scheme, the waste separated as combustible waste would be suitable for incineration with energy recovery. Based on well-designed schemes of source separation, alternative waste management technologies can be applied.

TI Review of comparative LCAs of food waste management systems - Current
   status and potential improvements
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Twenty-five comparative cycle assessments (LCAs) addressing food waste treatment were reviewed, including the treatment alternatives landfill, thermal treatment, compost (small and large scale) and anaerobic digestion. The global warming potential related to these treatment alternatives varies largely amongst the studies. Large differences in relation to setting of system boundaries, methodological choices and variations in used input data were seen between the studies. Also, a number of internal contradictions were identified, many times resulting in biased comparisons between alternatives. Thus, noticed differences in global warming potential are not found to be a result of actual differences in the environmental impacts from studied systems, but rather to differences in the performance of the study. A number of key issues with high impact on the overall global warming potential from different treatment alternatives for food waste were identified through the use of one-way sensitivity analyses in relation to a previously performed LCA of food waste management. Assumptions related to characteristics in treated waste, losses and emissions of carbon, nutrients and other compounds during the collection, storage and pretreatment, potential energy recovery through combustion, emissions from composting, emissions from storage and land use of bio-fertilizers and chemical fertilizers and eco-profiles of substituted goods were all identified as highly relevant for the outcomes of this type of comparisons. As the use of LCA in this area is likely to increase in coming years, it is highly relevant to establish more detailed guidelines within this field in order to increase both the general quality in assessments as well as the potentials for cross-study comparisons.

TI Life cycle assessment of solid waste management options for Eskisehir,
   Turkey
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology was used to determine the optimum municipal solid waste (MSW) management strategy for Eskisehir city. Eskisehir is one of the developing cities of Turkey where a total of approximately 750 tons/day of waste is generated. An effective MSW management system is needed in this city since the generated MSW is dumped in ail unregulated dumping site that has no liner, no biogas capture, etc. Therefore, five different scenarios were developed as alternatives to the current waste management system. Collection and transportation of waste, a material recovery facility (MRF), recycling, composting, incineration and landfilling processes were considered in these scenarios. SimaPro7 libraries were used to obtain background data for the life cycle inventory. One ton of municipal solid waste of Eskisehir was selected as the functional unit. The alternative scenarios were compared through the CML 2000 method and these comparisons were carried out from the abiotic depletion, global warming, human toxicity, acidification, eutrophication and photochemical ozone depletion points of view. According to the comparisons and sensitivity analysis, composting scenario, S3, is the more environmentally preferable alternative.
   In this study waste management alternatives were investigated only oil ail environmental point of view. For that reason, it might be Supported with other decision-making tools that consider the economic and social effects of solid waste management. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Studying Microbial Communities through Co-Occurrence Network Analyses
   during Processes of Waste Treatment and in Organically Amended Soils: A
   Review
SO MICROORGANISMS
AB Organic wastes have the potential to be used as soil organic amendments after undergoing a process of stabilization such as composting or as a resource of renewable energy by anaerobic digestion (AD). Both composting and AD are well-known, eco-friendly approaches to eliminate and recycle massive amounts of wastes. Likewise, the application of compost amendments and digestate (the by-product resulting from AD) has been proposed as an effective way of improving soil fertility. The study of microbial communities involved in these waste treatment processes, as well as in organically amended soils, is key in promoting waste resource efficiency and deciphering the features that characterize microbial communities under improved soil fertility conditions. To move beyond the classical analyses of metataxonomic data, the application of co-occurrence network approaches has shown to be useful to gain insights into the interactions among the members of a microbial community, to identify its keystone members and modelling the environmental factors that drive microbial network patterns. Here, we provide an overview of essential concepts for the interpretation and construction of co-occurrence networks and review the features of microbial co-occurrence networks during the processes of composting and AD and following the application of the respective end products (compost and digestate) into soil.

TI A contribution to the municipal solid waste management in Havana, Cuba
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB Problems of municipal solid waste (MSW) are increasing with growing populations and urbanisation, resulting in the need for improved waste management strategies. The physical composition and generation rate of MSW from residential areas in five representative municipalities in Havana were classified into 11 categories according to ASTM standards. The study reveals that over 65% of the MSW was comprised of organic waste (food waste). The average generation rate of MSW in the city was 0.7 kg/person-d. Five components of MSW in Havana are indicating promising dimensions for recycling activities, with paper and cardboard being largest. The recycling rate is currently insufficient and there is potential for significant improvements.

TI Sequential Methodology for the Selection of Municipal Waste Treatment
   Alternatives Applied to a Case Study in Chile
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Most municipalities in developing countries lack technical and economic resources to improve their municipal solid waste management (MSWM) system. Therefore, tools are needed that enable the most appropriate solutions to be identified to put waste to better use. This study presents an easy-to-apply sequential methodology for the analysis of MSWM alternatives. The method consists of two stages: (1) screening available technologies based on a small set of key variables; (2) ordering the selected alternatives by a combination of multicriteria methods that integrate local priorities. For this second stage, a basic series of technical, environmental, economic and social indicators is proposed. The methodology is applied to a case study where current management is limited to mixed municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal in a landfill without gas recovery. Seven options for implementing energy recovery in landfill, using mechanical plants to recover part of recyclable material, treating the organic fraction, and employing refuse-derived fuel and/or waste to energy incineration, were evaluated together with the current situation and considering four scenarios. The results identify various alternatives that allow the sustainability of MSWM in the case study to improve. Notwithstanding, today, it is necessary to introduce economic instruments that discourage final disposal to make municipal waste recovery viable.

TI Low-Carbon Waste Management
SO CREATING LOW CARBON CITIES
AB Waste management is a significant source of urban GHG emissions, with inventories suggesting that it contributes 5 % of the total, on average. Landfills are the dominant source of urban waste GHG emissions, due to their production of methane from the degradation of organic waste. A number of management strategies (e.g., LFG collection, oxidizing covering materials) can be implemented to reduce emissions from landfill operations. Organic waste can also be diverted to other treatment options (composting, anaerobic digesters) that reduce both direct process emissions and indirect emissions through the use of coproducts such as energy and soil amendments. Thermal management practices provide co-benefits such as improved material recovery and energy services, while studies of health implications have generally been inconclusive or have demonstrated no convincing evidence to directly link these treatment approaches with health outcomes. "Three R" approaches to waste management have additional benefits outside the recovery of valuable materials (e.g., aluminum, steel), in that they also can provide a significant indirect emission savings. Further to waste management infrastructure, systemic approaches, such as extended producer responsibility and product service systems, should be employed to shift waste mitigation incentives from cities to manufacturers towards higher diversion rates.

TI Waste-to-Energy in China: Key Challenges and Opportunities
SO ENERGIES
AB China-the largest developing country in the worldis experiencing both rapid economic maturation and large-scale urbanization. These situations have led to waste disposal problems, and the need to identify alternative energy sources. Waste-to-energy (WTE) conversion processes, a source of renewable energy, are expected to play an increasingly important role in China's sustainable management of municipal solid waste (MSW). The purpose of this research is to investigate the key problems and opportunities associated with WTE, to provide recommendations for the government. This paper begins by describing China's current MSW management situation and analyzing its waste disposal problems. The major challenges associated with China's WTE incineration are then discussed from economic, environmental and social points of view. These include the high costs associated with constructing necessary facilities, the susceptibility of facilities to corrosion, the lower heating value of China's MSW, air pollutant emissions and especially public opposition to WTE incineration. Since discarded waste can be used to produce energy for electricity and heatthus reducing its volume and the production of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissionswith government policies and financial incentives, the use of WTE incineration as a renewable energy source and part of a sustainable waste management strategy will be of increasing importance in the future. The paper concludes by summarizing the management, economic and social benefits that could be derived from developing the country's domestic capacity for producing the needed incineration equipment, improving source separation capabilities, standardizing regulatory and legal responsibilities and undertaking more effective public consultation processes.

TI LCA for household waste management when planning a new urban settlement
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB When planning for a new urban settlement, industrial ecology tools like scenario building and life cycle assessment can be used to assess the environmental quality of different infrastructure solutions. In Trondheim, a new greenfield settlement with carbon-neutral ambitions is being planned and five different scenarios for the waste management system of the new settlement have been compared. The results show small differences among the scenarios, however, some benefits from increased source separation of paper and metal could be found. The settlement should connect to the existing waste management system of the city, and not resort to decentralised waste treatment or recovery methods. However, as this is an urban development project with ambitious goals for lifestyle changes, effort should be put into research and initiatives for proactive waste prevention and reuse issues.

TI Assessing the alteration of physicochemical characteristics in composted
   organic waste in a prototype decentralized composting facility
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB This article presents the pilot experience of an integrated biowaste management system developed in Tinos island, Greece, which promoted source separation and decentralized composting in a prototype unit. This system was introduced as a new-to-the-area of implementation and innovation, since landfilling of mixed municipal solid waste has been the common practice in Tinos island, as in many other areas of insular and mainland Greece. The biowaste management system was implemented through a bring scheme that aimed at motivating the public to separate at source the organic fraction of MSW. The system was monitored on an input-output basis of critical parameters used to assess the purity of separately collected biowaste, the treatment efficiency of the prototype unit, the quality characteristics of compost produced, and public's awareness and participation. Results showed that biowaste source separation was practiced effectively by citizens, giving high-purity feed (>98%). Compost samples were examined in comparison with the proposed EU End-of-Waste (EoW) quality criteria and fulfilled the requirements set. More specifically, the average values of compost samples regarding heavy metal content were 72% lower than the EoW limit value for Cd, 43% lower for Ni, 38% lower for Pd, 24% lower for Cu, and 36% lower for Zn. Examined composts also met the EoW criteria for phytotoxicity and pathogenic or parasitic microorganisms, while they showed an approx. 15% decrease in initial organic matter content. Moreover, this study analyzed the carbon balances and the degree that composting can sequestrate carbon. Overall, this study demonstrated that the development and operation of on-island, decentralized composting, when properly practiced, is a sustainable option in order for islands and remote areas to adopt a closed loop approach to the biowaste management problem, in line with the circular economy principles.

TI Organic Waste Substrates for Bioenergy Production via Microbial Fuel
   Cells: A Key Point Review
SO ENERGIES
AB High-energy consumption globally has raised questions about the low environmentally friendly and high-cost processes used until now for energy production. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) may support alternative more economically and environmentally favorable ways of bioenergy production based on their advantage of using waste. MFCs work as bio-electrochemical devices that consume organic substrates in order for the electrogenic bacteria and/or enzyme cultures to produce electricity and simultaneously lower the environmental hazardous value of waste such as COD. The utilization of organic waste as fuels in MFCs has opened a new research path for testing a variety of by-products from several industry sectors. This review presents several organic waste substrates that can be employed as fuels in MFCs for bioenergy generation and the effect of their usage on power density, COD (chemical oxygen demand) removal, and Coulombic efficiency enhancement. Moreover, a demonstration and comparison of the different types of mixed waste regarding their efficiency for energy generation via MFCs are presented. Future perspectives for manufacturing and cost analysis plans can support scale-up processes fulfilling waste-treatment efficiency and energy-output densities.

TI Selection of Waste to Energy Technologies for Municipal Solid Waste
   Management-Towards Achieving Sustainable Development Goals
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) play an essential role, emphasizing responsible resource use, production, and consumption, including waste management. In addition, SDG 3, 7, 11, 12, and 13 are directly/indirectly related to waste management. This study aims to determine a suitable waste-to-energy (WtE) technology in Chittagong City, Bangladesh, focusing on cleaner technology. Anaerobic digestion, gasification, incineration, and landfill gas (LFG) recovery were considered as possible alternatives. Technical, economic, environmental, and social issues have been considered as necessary criteria for evaluation. An analytical hierarchy process was applied to rank these technologies based on stakeholders' perceptions. The study found that anaerobic digestion (AD) ranked first, receiving 38% of overall weight. The second preferred technology is LFG (27%). Gasification and incineration stood at third and fourth, respectively (21% and 14%). According to a sensitivity study, the decision is only sensitive to the economy. LFG will become the most favoured solution for WtE conversion if the economy prioritizes more than 38%. Subsequently, this study's findings will help achieve Bangladesh's SDG agenda.

SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB Food waste management has been a global challenge with significant economic and environmental impacts. A community-based food waste treatment scheme for Glasgow, UK is proposed. The food waste was treated by small-scale wet, mesophilic anaerobic digestion. Biogas was combusted in a combined heat and power plant to generate heat and electricity for each community. 201.39 kWh of electricity and 246.09 kWh of thermal energy could be provided to local communities per tonne of food waste treated. A total of 52,762 tonnes of food waste were produced each year in the city. Net-present worth analysis was employed to evaluate the scheme's economic feasibility. The scheme's environmental impacts were evaluated using life cycle assessment. The entire system saved 92.27 kg CO2-eq. per tonne of food waste treated and had a net-present worth of  pound 3.187 million with a carbon tax of 50  pound tonne(-1) and a biogas yield of 190 m(3) tonne(-1).

TI Total Material Requirement assessment of Phosphorus sources from
   Phosphate ore and urban sinks: Sewage Sludge and MSW incineration fly
   ash
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Diversification of phosphorus sources can bring substantial synergy effects within all the sustainable development domains: environmental, economic and social, and such an opportunity should not be overlooked. Urban sinks accumulate phosphorus and other elements and may serve as sources of secondary raw materials. This paper evaluates phosphorus sources based on their total material requirement (TMR). Resource requirements and emissions of the conventional phosphorus production from mining through the acid route processing have been quantified and have been used as a yardstick against which to measure the performance of two recycling options: spreading of sewage sludge and phosphorus recovery from municipal solid waste incineration fly ash (MSWA). The sludge spreading had the lowest TMR. Phosphorus extracted from the MSWA had four-fold higher TMR than the conventional production. However, method modifications were suggested and are currently being tested, which reduce the methods TMR well below the TMR of the phosphorus production from the ore. The entire impact of the Swedish mineral fertilizer demand can be avoided by recycling urban sinks of phosphorus. Sweden can become self-sufficient in mineral fertilizer because the phosphorus quantities imported in food and later found in the urban sinks such as food waste, sewage sludge and MSW incineration residues cover the entire necessary quantity.

TI Potential for greenhouse gas reduction and energy recovery from MSW
   through different waste management technologies
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) mainly consists of degradable materials, which cause a significant increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The purpose of this study is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of GHG reductions and energy recovery potentials from MSW in Dammam, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). To achieve this purpose, the amount of generated landfill gas (LFG), the potential of energy recovery, and the environmental impacts in terms of GHG emissions were investigated. The methodology includes three waste management scenarios: i) a material recovery facility (MRF) with composting, ii) landfilling, and iii) incineration (waste-to-energy WtE). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), LandGEM, and iWARM of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) models were used to estimate GHG emissions, mitigation, and energy recovery. The results showed that scenarios 1 and 3 generated the least amount of GHG emissions of -2,142,618 tCO(2)-eq/yr and -287,873 tCO(2)-eq/yr, respectively. The global warming potentials (GWPs) for three scenarios revealed that the highest GHG reduction per ton of MSW was from scenario 1 (-1.091 tCO(2)-eq/t MSW) followed by scenario 3 (-0.147 tCO(2)-eq/t MSW) whereas scenario 2 generated a net GHG emission of +0.265 tCO(2)-eq/t MSW. Furthermore, the incineration option in scenario 3 would generate, on average, about 1.91 x 10(9) kWh/yr electricity, which could reduce fossil fuel usage by 1.12 x 10(6) barrels per year. The outcomes contribute to establishing strategy of cleaner energy production throughout the reduction of GHG emissions and energy recovery from MSW. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A novel multi-dimensional modeling approach to integrated municipal
   solid waste management
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB An integrated system for waste reduction, collection, composting, recycling, and disposal is required to tackle the growing challenge of municipal solid waste management. Integrated Solid Waste Management (ISWM) involves many executive, operational and managerial decisions such as the siting of waste processing and disposal units, selection of waste-treatment technologies and allocation of waste flow to processing facilities and landfills. This study aims to satisfy the sustainability requirements for designing an ISWM system by taking economic, environmental and social factors into account. The present study utilized Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) in the Geographic Information System (GIS) environment and developed a reliable Suitability Indicator for siting the ISWM system's components. A new model is developed to minimize the fixed cost, minimize the transportation cost and maximize the suitability of the entire system. Considering the real-world constraints, the proposed model is proven to be practical, efficient and case-independent for designing an ISWM system and supporting the existing systems in both developing and developed countries. To realize the model effectively, the augmented version of e-constraint is employed so that the model is implemented in the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) software. The proposed approach is successfully applied to the existing ISWM system of Tehran, Iran, and the results show that 12%, 22% and 17% improvement can be achieved in terms of the fixed cost, transportation cost and total suitability of the system, respectively.

TI Identifying key process parameters for uncertainty propagation in
   environmental life cycle assessment for sewage sludge and food waste
   treatment
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Life cycle assessment (LCA) results are often subject to uncertainty, which may lead to erroneous conclusions. This paper aims to tackle the parameter uncertainty involved in LCA. Hong Kong is selected as the reference city for the treatment of sewage sludge and food waste. A selection approach with sensitivity analysis is proposed to identify the key process parameters and Monte Carlo simulation is further conducted to propagate the uncertainty of the key process parameters identified. The results show that climate change is the major impact category among various impact categories that are generally considered in waste LCA studies. Scenarios 5 and 6, which consider anaerobic co-digestion (coAD) treatment, achieve the best performance in regard to the climate change impact. Scenario 6 which includes a combined cycle gas turbine system for biogas utilization has -6.75 x 10(4) kg avoided CO(2)e emissions and it is equal to 44% more avoided emissions compared to scenario 5 which applies a combined heat and power system. For the key process parameters identified, it is found that the electricity generation efficiencies in different waste treatment facilities, such as the incineration plant and the anaerobic digestion plant, have the greatest sensitivity to the result. Uncertainty propagation is then conducted to obtain the probability distribution functions in environmental performance of different scenarios. Scenario 6 has a 95% probability of achieving at least -5.32 x 10(4) kg avoided CO(2)e emissions, while the probability of scenario 5, which is the second best scenario, achieving the same avoid emissions is below 5%; It indicates a significant advantage of using combined cycle gas turbine over combined heat and power unit for biogas utilization in Hong Kong. The methodologies and results of this study provide comprehensive material that can be adapted for other areas planning sustainable sewage sludge and food waste treatment, as well as in tackling parameter uncertainty in general LCA studies.

TI Policy impacts on Municipal Solid Waste management in Shanghai: A system
   dynamics model analysis
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Shanghai is the first city to implement Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) sorting regulation in China, and it also has policies on economy, demography, MSW collection and treatment. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the impacts of these polices on MSW management for Shanghai. System dynamics model is a prevailing method to simulate impacts of various policies on MSW management from a dynamic and complex perspective. Besides, different from existing studies that consider only a certain process of MSW management, our system dynamic model simulate the entire process of MSW production, sorting, collection and final treatment. Seven scenarios are set to simulate the impacts of these policies. Results show that economic policy has great impact on future MSW management. MSWgeneration in 2035 will decline by 3.25 Million tonnes if Gross Domestic Production growth rate decrease by 1%. Demographic policy will reduce MSW generation per capita, but increase the total amount of MSW generation. MSW sorting policy will decrease total demand of MSW landfill, but soar the demand of food waste treatment facility. Treatment method policy will not play a big role in decreasing total demand of MSW landfill. Finally, policy implications including prudent economic and demographic policy, strengthening biochemical treatment capacity and comprehensive utilization of residues are proposed. It is anticipated that this system dynamic model and policy implications can contribute to the MSW management of other 45 Chinese cities that are planning to implement sorting regulation soon, or even other global cities.

TI Biofuel production and utilization through smart and sustainable
   biowaste management
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB EU member states are facing many challenges in order to fulfil different legal obligations linked with the sustainable waste management. The EU legislation related to environmental protection, already implemented in the national legislation of the Republic of Croatia, aims to introduce a system of integrated and sustainable waste management. This puts a focus on material and energy utilization of different waste streams produced in urban areas. Therefore, this requirement represents main challenge for many municipalities, mostly due to various binding targets in waste collection and treatment. Some of them are: reduction of waste generation and disposal, increase of the separately collected waste amounts and recycling rates. Source-separation of biowaste combined with biofuel production is one of the key priorities for many cities, combined with biofuel production in urban areas and its distribution via existing gas grids. The objective of this research is to present environmental benefits of such concept for city of Zagreb. First step is involvement of citizens and assessment of available organic waste. Hence, the conducted analysis has been performed as a survey in order to understand their behaviour and to successfully assess the energy potential of organic fraction from municipal solid waste. The presented research show that 84% of citizens are willing and motivated to participate in biowaste separation. An estimation of energy potential through the anaerobic digestion of organic waste has been presented and calculated to 1,900 t of biomethane based on the analysis which can be utilized through almost 70 CNG busses. This paper proposed concrete solution for the biofuel consumption, and gave an overview of the required land demand for digestate utilization. Also, presented SWOT analysis is giving an overview and confirming the sustainability of proposed concept. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Towards a bio-based circular economy in organic waste management and
   wastewater treatment - The Polish perspective
SO NEW BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Bio-based solutions are expected to ensure technological circularity in priority areas such as agriculture, biotechnology, ecology, green industry or energy. Although Poland, unlike the other EU member states, has not yet adopted a precise political strategy to promote bioeconomy, it has taken several actions to enable smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. This goal can be achieved by developing selected bioeconomy-related areas such as the biogas industry together with novel technologies implemented to optimize treatment of municipal sewage and management of organic solid waste. Here, the relatively strong status of the Polish biogas sector is presented. The widely used practice of sewage sludge biomethanation has led to construction of numerous complex installations combining biological wastewater treatment plants with anaerobic digesters. Based on physico-chemical processing of biostabilized sludges, a novel method for efficient granulated soil fertilizer production is elaborated, in line with the concept of circular economy and the notion of "waste-to-product". It is also shown that anaerobic fermentation of sewage sludges can be optimized by co-digestion with properly selected co-substrates to increase bioprocess yield and improve the resultant digestate fertilizer quality. The problem of post-fermentation eutrophic sludge liquors, environmentally hazardous waste effluents requiring proper treatment prior to discharge or field application, is addressed. Attempts to optimize biological treatment of digestate liquors with complex microbial consortia are presented. The Polish innovations described show that the "zero waste" path in circular bioeconomy may bring advantageous results in terms of transformation of waste materials into commercial, added-value products together with recovery of water resources.

TI The review of municipal solid waste management in Nigeria: the current
   trends
SO ADVANCES IN ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB The management of municipal solid waste (MSW) is essential for every community; and, it is currently a major challenge in Nigeria. This paper provides an overview of the current MSW management trends in Nigeria and proposes new sustainable MSW management systems. Across Nigerian cities, MSW management is characterized by inefficient collection and transportation to disposal sites. Collection services do not reach some unplanned areas and slums due to poor street network. Even some planned areas are not reached by collection services. The informal sector contributes to waste collection, resource recovery and recycling; however, their activities are not recognized by the governments. Markets exist for recovered materials but more efforts need to be geared towards intensive recovery of materials and expansion of these markets. Despite the high proportion of putrescible matter in MSW, the only form of treatment commonly used currently is open burning for volume reduction. The high organic fraction presents a great opportunity for composting and anaerobic digestion. Ultimate disposal is currently done in open dumpsites. This needs to be upgraded to engineered landfills that are properly sited and adequately operated by well trained personnel. There is an emerging waste stream of concern, electronic-waste (e-waste), that requires urgent sustainable management as e-waste are currently co-disposed with other waste streams or burnt in the open posing detrimental health impacts.

TI Food waste treatment option selection through spherical fuzzy AHP
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
AB In line with the increase in consciousness on sustainability in today's global world, great emphasis has been attached to food waste management. Food waste is a complex issue to manage due to uncertainties on quality, quantity, location, and time of wastes, and it involves different decisions at many stages from seed to post-consumption. These ambiguities re-quire that some decisions should be handled in a linguistic and ambiguous environment. That forces researchers to benefit from fuzzy sets mostly utilized to deal with subjectivity that causes uncertainty. In this study, as a novel approach, the spherical fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (SFAHP) was used to select the best food treatment option. In the model, four main criteria (infrastructural, governmental, economic, and environmental) and their thirteen sub-criteria are considered. A real case is conducted to show how the proposed model can be used to assess four food waste treatment options (composting, anaerobic digestion, landfilling, and incineration). Also, a sensitivity analysis is generated to check whether the evaluations on the main criteria can change the results or not. The proposed model aims to create a subsidiary tool for decision makers in relevant companies and institutions.

TI Review of the potential for recycling CO2 from organic waste composting
   into plant production under controlled environment agriculture
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Composting has been used extensively as a sustainable approach for the management organic waste streams and conversion into stabilized soil amendments and horticultural growth media. In addition to these products, the composting process also generates by-products of microbial metabolism that includes gas (CO2) and energy (heat). High rates of food waste and commercial organic waste generation, along with greater diversion away from landfills, creates new opportunities to valorize these by-products from aerobic composting. Specifically, integrating carbon dioxide recapture and recycling into Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) production systems presents a pathway to circularize resources. CEA systems produce plants year round in an environmentally controlled space where elevating CO2 environments can boost plant production, creating a synergistic relationship with composting processes. The review evaluated CO2 emissions from an array of open and closed composting systems, as well as different feedstocks to demonstrate its potential for use in CEA. Rates of CO2 emissions varied widely, with a peak CO2 emission range of 0.32-429.27 g CO2-C kg(- 1) d(-1) depending on the aeration conditions and feedstock composition. Analysis of two hypothetical CEA scenarios reveals that integrating in-vessel composting as an on-site waste management process is comparable in cost to using natural gas as a regular CO2 source. The quantity of composting feedstocks required to generate CO2 emissions for a single tier and five tier CEA lettuce production system ranged from 3.38 to 69.94 kg dry biomass d(-1) and 9.93-205.50 kg dry biomass d(-1), respectively, but varied based on feedstock composition and compost operating conditions. The long-term research goal is toward valorizing non-edible biomass of CEA systems to create a circular economy model of commercial plant production.

TI Biological response of using municipal solid waste compost in
   agriculture as fertilizer supplement
SO REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND BIO-TECHNOLOGY
AB Waste management and declining soil fertility are the two main issues experienced by all developing nations, like India. Nowadays, agricultural utilization of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is one of the most promising and cost effective options for managing solid waste. It is helpful in solving two current burning issues viz. soil fertility and MSW management. However, there is always a potential threat because MSW may contain pathogens and toxic pollutants. Therefore, much emphasis has been paid to composting of MSW in recent years. Application of compost from MSW in agricultural land helps in ameliorating the soil's physico-chemical properties. Apart from that it also assists in improving biological response of cultivated land. Keeping the present situation in mind, this review critially discusses the current scenario, agricultural utilization of MSW compost, role of soil microbes and soil microbial response on municipal solid waste compost application.

AB The objective of the paper is to present sustainability indicators for municipal solid waste management (MSWM). Sustainability implies environmental, economic and social acceptance. The complexity of the system-in-focus requires the employment of a systems (or cybernetic) approach: Acceptance implies clear objectives, from a specific point of view (here, the viewpoint of the municipal administration is taken), over a time horizon covering at least two generations, a life-cycle consideration, clear evaluation criteria for alternative MSWM systems, and finally specific and measurable indicators of the degree to which the objectives have been met.
   A software package is presented for computing sustainability indicators; given a city of specific size and socio-economic and waste generating characteristics, the model computes indicators for existing MSWM systems or for alternative system scenarios. Each scenario, consists of three basic waste management sub-systems: (1) Temporary Storage, (2) Collection & Transport and (3) Treatment, Recycling and Disposal. A number of specific environmental indicators (abiotic depletion, global warming, human toxicity, acidification, eutrophication, etc.), economic indicators (cost per ton or per household, revenue from recovered material and energy, MSWM system cost as % of GNP of the city, cost per capita as % of minimum wage, subsidies per person, etc.) and social indicators (odour, visual impact, convenience, required or used-up space, noise, system complexity, etc.) indicators are suggested for measuring the performance of MSWM systems.
   The assessment model is used to analyze a real case (city of Xanthi, Greece) with the following specifications: a) Population: 45000 inhabitants, b) waste generation: 338 Kg/cap/year, c) MSW process options: collection, including mixed waste collection and source separation of bio-waste and/or mixed dry recyclables (paper, glass, metals, plastics), incineration with energy recovery, anaerobic digestion of bio-waste, mixed dry recyclables sorting and landfilling. Some of the major results are: The MSWM system, that includes anaerobic digestion of bio-waste and sorting of mixed dry recyclables, causes the higher environmental relief. The minimum and maximum total annual cost correspond, respectively, to landfilling and incineration of mixed MSW. The cost of temporary storage, collection and transport corresponds to 25-68% of the total MSWM system cost, depending on separation-at-source arrangements and treatment processes.

AB The aim of the work is to assess current solid waste management (SWM) and wastewater treatment (WWT) in the county of Sibiu, Romania. Sibiu is a region where industrialization and tourism are spreading constantly, while pollution monitoring and the introduction of circular economy (CE) principles are still lacking. The environmental issues are mostly due to the absence of reliable sanitation systems, in particular for what concerns sewage sludge treatment. Moreover, Organic fraction from selective collection of municipal solid waste is still missing, since it is disposed of directly to landfill, increasing environmental pollution and contributing considerably to global warming. As a result, SWM and WWT should be improved at the same time, as sludge requires specific handlings in order to be safety disposed. The objective of the study is to investigate the introduction of affordable technological facilities able to treat sludge and the organic fraction of municipal solid waste, recovering, at least, the energy required for the working phase of the treatment plants. Anaerobic digestion resulted viable, but the organic fraction fall stream collection seems to be the only way to have a significant energy recovery. From the financial point of view, the feasibility of this co-treatment option could count on specific opportunities that Romania has in the frame of the European Union context.

SO FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
AB This study assessed the electricity generation potential of biogas from organic fraction of municipal solid waste collected for disposal from 2004 to 2018 in 31 provinces of China using landfill gas to energy (LFGTE) and anaerobic digestion (AD) technologies. Economic feasibility assessment of the technologies was carried out using Net Present Value, and Levelized Cost of Energy methods. In addition, environmental impact of waste management options based on global warming potential was assessed under three scenarios. Key findings showed that electricity generation potential of anaerobic digestion technology was higher in all the provinces. Economically, the results showed that both projects are feasible in all the 31 provinces. However, anaerobic digestion project proved to be highly feasible, with more positive net present value, and lower levelized cost of energy. Sensitivity analysis showed that both projects are infeasible with a discount rate beyond 20%. The results also showed that landfill gas without energy recovery has high global warming potential. It was realized that on the average landfill gas to energy technology could reduce global warming potential by 71.5%, while anaerobic digestion technology could reduce global warming potential by 92.7%. This study will offer scientific guidance for investment in anaerobic digestion and landfill gas to energy projects in China and other countries.

TI Improvement of leachate quality and waste stabilization in pilot-scale
   bioreactor landfills containing geotextile filters and sewage sludge
SO DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT
AB In many developing countries, there has been growing interest in bioreactor landfills for municipal solid waste (MSW) management. This research study has been conducted for comparing leachate characterization and waste stabilization in simulated pilot-scale anaerobic bioreactor landfills. Four pilot-scale reactors were constructed and operated for 540 d. This study aimed to show whether a pilot-scale bioreactor containing sewage sludge mixed with MSW, with a geotextile filter in its drainage layer, and with recirculating leachate, could improve leachate quality and waste stabilization in a landfill. Bioreactor R1 comprised MSW and sewage sludge, while bioreactor R2 was the same as R1 but with a geotextile-1 (GT-1) filter fitted. R3 contained no sludge but only MSW and GT-1 fitted, while R4 contained no sludge but only MSW and two layers of geotextile filter (GT-2 and GT-3). All reactors were operated with leachate recirculation, simulating bioreactor landfills. The results showed that the chemical oxygen demand (COD) half-lives of leachate from the reactors were approximately 8, 7, 9, and 10 months for R1, R2, R3, and R4, respectively. By the end of the study, the waste in R2 and R4 was more stable, with 66% and 65% reductions in volatile solids, respectively. Reactor R2, which contained MSW, sewage sludge, and one-layer geotextile (GT-1), provided higher stabilization of MSW and shorter COD half life than the other reactors.

TI End- of- Life Scenarios for Municipal Solid Waste of Defence Housing
   Authority Lahore, Pakistan
SO POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
AB This paper evaluates the environmental impacts of various municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment options produced on-site simultaneously with energy and material recovery. The results present a comparison of life cycle assessment (LCA) for municipal solid waste management (MSWM) in five different waste scenarios along with baseline scenario of the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) in Lahore. All scenarios were modeled using EaseTech software. Nine impact categories were assessed and results were presented based on the ASTM D5231-92(2003) characterization method. Results revealed that a material recovery facility (MRF) had low global warming potential (GWP), but lower avoided burdens in other impact categories. The incineration process indicated fewer burdens on the environment such as GWP (- 2.086x10(7) kg CO2 eq) as compared to landfills (2.461x10(7) kg CO2 eq). This was due to lower avoided emissions in the landfill process compared to incineration. The negative values in results represented higher avoided emissions in treatment processes. Bio-gasification avoided CO2 emissions (- 8.053x10(5) kg CO 2 eq), but showed negative impacts in other categories. Almost all impact categories were high in composting except for freshwater eutrophication. LCA results provided good knowledge for decision makers as a tool to decide what alternative is a better change for sustainable waste management.

Reduction of sewage sludge waste quantities with energy recovery is the most important and modern practice, with least possible impact on the environment. Appropriate technologies for treating and disposal sewage sludge are currently considered: incineration, gasification and pyrolysis. The main products generated during the pyrolysis process are bio-gas, bio-oil and bio-residue, providing sustainable fuels/ biofuels and adsorbents. Compared to other disposal methods of sewage sludge, pyrolysis has advantages in terms of the environment: waste in small quantities, low emissions, low level of heavy metals. From a technological point of view, pyrolysis is the most efficient in relation to its final products, pyrolysis oil, pyrolysis gas and solid residue that can be transformed into CO2 adsorbent with the help of chemical and thermal activation processes. The incineration process of sewage sludge has a number of disadvantages both environmentally and technologically: organic pollutants, heavy metals, toxic pollutants and ash resulting from combustion that needs a disposal process. A comparison of different types of sewage sludge elimination for the energy recovery is described in the present paper.

TI COMPOSTING AS A WAY TO CONVERT CELLULOSIC BIOMASS AND ORGANIC WASTE INTO
   HIGH-VALUE SOIL AMENDMENTS: A REVIEW
SO BIORESOURCES
AB Plant-derived cellulosic materials play a critical role when organic wastes are composted to produce a beneficial amendment for topsoil. This review article considers publications dealing with the science of composting, emphasizing ways in which the cellulosic and lignin components of the composted material influence both the process and the product. Cellulose has been described as a main source of energy to drive the biological transformations and the consequent temperature rise and chemical changes that are associated with composting. Lignin can be viewed as a main starting material for the formation of humus, the recalcitrant organic matter that provides the water-holding, ion exchange, and bulking capabilities that can contribute greatly to soil health and productivity. Lignocellulosic materials also contribute to air permeability, bulking, and water retention during the composting process. Critical variables for successful composting include the ratio of carbon to nitrogen, the nature of the cellulosic component, particle size, bed size and format, moisture, pH, aeration, temperature, and time. Composting can help to address solid waste problems and provides a sustainable way to enhance soil fertility.

TI Promoting public participation in household waste management: A survey
   based method and case study in Xiamen city, China
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Limited success in 3R (reduce, reuse, recycle) implementation and conflicts in waste treatment plant construction call for active and sustained public participation in Chinese waste management. It is especially important to identify factors which affect citizen participation in waste reduction and recycling where waste policies are poorly implemented. In this paper we report the results of a research constructed survey conducted in Xiamen, one of eight cities in China which have been operating waste source separation pilot programs since 2000. The results showed that while more than half of respondents were satisfied with local waste management, waste recycling was still inefficient and largely carried out by the informal sector. Satisfaction rates and basic residential house prices were positively correlated, and the satisfaction rate was higher in newly urbanizing areas than in old downtown and urban village areas. A structural equation model Was used to identify key factors influencing citizen environmental willingness to participate in waste management, and this indicated that the most important influencing factor was citizen knowledge, followed by social motivation, while institutional factors had the smallest positive effect. Citizens who were better informed and lived in a community/family with more environmentally friendly behaviors have a greater propensity to participate in sustainable waste management. The model is useful for identifying causal relationships and ranking influencing factors in terms of their importance. The results indicate a waste policy hierarchy in Chinese cities, and future waste management should change from the current legislative-centered strategy. The results can be used to inform decision makers find locally effective strategies to improve public participation in waste management in accordance with socioeconomic and cultural conditions in China.

TI Co-pyrolysis of municipal solid waste and municipal sewage sludge and
   characterization of liquid product
SO PAMUKKALE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCES-PAMUKKALE
   UNIVERSITESI MUHENDISLIK BILIMLERI DERGISI
AB The reduction of the sent to landfill amount of municipal solid waste (MSWs) and municipal sewage sludges (SSs) is of great importance both for the circular economy concept, which has been on the agenda in recent years, and more careful management of MSW and SS. Pyrolysis method is one of the most suitable methods that can be utilized to treat these wastes together. In this study, it was evaluated to convert these wastes into useful products by co-pyrolyzing MSW and SS, and obtained liquid products were characterized. Samples were prepared by mixing different percentages (wt. 25-75%) from these wastes. The values of moisture content, ash content, volatile matter, and fixed carbon of prepared samples before the pyrolysis process were determined. The prepared samples were co-pyrolyzed at 400 degrees C. Elemental analysis (C, H, O, N, S), heating value measurement, FT-IR, and 1H-NMR analysis were carried out to make the characterization of the obtained liquid products after the co-pyrolysis process. According to analysis results, it was observed that M1 (25% of MSW and 75% of SS) showed the highest liquid yield. For all liquid products, it has been determined that most of the pyrolysis liquid products consist of aliphatic compounds. For sustainable municipal solid waste management, valorizing these wastes together instead of sending them to landfill sites, the co-pyrolysis process converts them to valuable products, it also might be considered an option contributing economic and environmental aspects.

TI Life-cycle assessment approach for municipal solid waste management
   system of Delhi city
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB The life-cycle assessment (LCA) approach with route optimization technique was adopted in the present study to evaluate environmental and economic aspects associated with the prevalent waste management system in Delhi city. With an objective of cost minimization and abating environmental hazards from waste transportation systems, ArcGIS was used to identify the most appropriate route for waste transportation. The study was con-ducted considering four landfills located at Bawana, Bhalswa, Ghazipur and Okhla present in Delhi city. Land-filling, composting, anaerobic digestion, and recycling methods were analyzed for global warming potential (GWP), eutrophication potential (EP), acidification potential, abiotic resource depletion potential and photo-chemical oxidation potential parameters using LCA software GaBiPro. The results from the LCA studies for the municipal solid waste management system of Delhi city revealed that transportation emissions and landfilling negatively impact the environment. The effect of recycling rate on the landfilling, composting, anaerobic digestion was also studied using sensitivity analysis. Results of sensitivity analysis depicted that recycling of waste is inversely related to the impact categories. Overall, the results exhibited a detrimental effect of landfilling on the environment in terms of GWP and EP. Further, considering the geospatial analysis, two waste recycling stations are proposed in the vicinity of existing waste management plants to reduce the time and cost of waste transport from the landfills to the waste management plants.

TI Economic growth and selection of municipal waste treatment options in
   Bangkok
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB A reasonable selection of waste treatment options is indispensable to address challenges in waste management. Introduction of incineration plants for municipal waste in Bangkok had been considered in the past, but each time it was dismissed. In 2013, however, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) decided to introduce an incinerator facility with electricity generation. This study examined how changes in socio-economic factors resulting from economic growth affected the BMA's decision. First, we conducted interviews of key relevant stakeholders (policymakers and other experts) to determine what kinds of changes in socio-economic factors affected their decision. Then, for interpretation and confirmation of the results from interview, we quantitatively estimated changes in environmental factors (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions), financial factors (e.g., construction and operating costs), and social factors (e.g., employment) in 1990, 2000, and 2012. Based on the result of interview and quantitative analysis, we illustrated the complicated structure of the mechanism of how economic growth affected the selection of waste treatment options in Bangkok, particularly those that led to the selection of the incineration. In addition to local conditions, global economic also affected the waste treatment policy in Bangkok even though waste management is usually thought of as a local issue.

TI The potential contribution of sustainable waste management to energy use
   and greenhouse gas emission reduction in the Netherlands
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Future limitations on the availability of selected resources stress the need for increased material efficiency. In addition, in a climate-constrained world the impact of resource use on greenhouse gas emissions should be minimized. Waste management is key to achieve sustainable resource management. Ways to use resources more efficiently include prevention of waste, reuse of products and materials, and recycling of materials, while incineration and anaerobic digestion may recover part of the embodied energy of materials. This study used iWaste, a simulation model, to investigate the extent to which savings in energy consumption and CO2 emissions can be achieved in the Netherlands through recycling of waste streams versus waste incineration, and to assess the extent to which this potential is reflected in the LAP2 (currently initiated policy). Three waste streams (i.e. household waste, bulky household waste, and construction and demolition waste) and three scenarios compare current policy to scenarios that focus on high-quality recycling (Recycling(+)) or incineration with increased efficiency (Incineration(+)). The results show that aiming for more and high-quality recycling can result in emission reductions of 2.3 MtCO(2) annually in the Netherlands compared to the reference situation in 2008. The main contributors to this reduction potential are found in optimizing the recycling of plastics (PET, PE and PP), textiles, paper, and organic waste. A scenario assuming a higher energy conversion efficiency of the incinerator treating the residual waste stream, achieves an emission reduction equivalent to only one third (0.7 MtCO(2)/year) of the reduction achieved in the Recycling+ scenario. Furthermore, the results of the study show that currently initiated policy only partially realizes the full potential identified. A focus on highest quality use of recovered materials is essential to realize the full potential energy and CO2 emission reduction identified for the Netherlands. Detailed economic and technical analyses of high quality recycling are recommended to further evaluate viable integrated waste management policies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Assessment of municipal solid waste management scenarios in Irkutsk
   (Russia) using a life cycle assessment-integrated waste management model
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Continuous growth in the quantity of municipal solid waste (MSW) and increasing demands for their environmentally-friendly treatment are one of the main consequences of the growing social and economic development rate in modern society. Despite ecologically sustainable trends in waste management systems around the world, open dumps are still the main waste treatment option in Russia. This study aims to help the local municipality administration in Irkutsk (Russia) identify the most appropriate direction for current waste management and its optimization. Within this study four developed MSW management scenarios were assessed and compared with respect to their ecological, economic and social aspects using a life cycle-based integrated waste management model. The evaluation results of these scenarios show that the development of environmental sustainability and the reduction of social effects lead to an increase in handling of costs of waste. The best scenario, regarding both environmental and social aspects, is scenario four, which includes the separate collection and reprocessing of recyclables in combination with an aerobic mechanical-biological pre-treatment of the residual waste before landfilling. However, this scenario is 3.6 times more expensive than the existing system. The results of all assessed scenarios were further analyzed and recommendations were made to design integrated waste management solutions that are optimal not only from the ecological and social points of view, but which are also realistic within the given economic situation.

AB The rapid industrialization, continuous economic development, as well as increasing urban population and people's living standards in Urumqi have resulted in a great increase of the total generated amount of municipal solid waste (MSW). Urumqi government strives to improve its municipal solid waste management (MSWM), and the MSW safe disposal rate was already up to 92.9% in 2011. This study presents an detailed overview on current MSWM practice in Urumqi municipality, including MSW characteristics and current status of MSW generation, collection, transportation and final disposal. It shows that more than 80% of MSW was final disposed by landfill and current landfill based MSWM system lack of effectiveness and efficiency. The major barriers and challenges that inhibit effective and efficient MSWM are imperfectness and inefficient enfoMement of relevant policies, inappropriate waste treatment fee system, backward technology, insufficient public education and participation, as well as lack of fundamental research. Finally, to overcome such barriers, we propose a detailed integrated MSWM system to facilitate MSWM in Urumqi.

AB Composting industry is a progressive and innovative industry that has been growing worldwide, especially in the last 20 years. Firstly, in this paper, an overview of fundamentals and processes on composting and anaerobic digestion are compiled, showing the versatility and multivariable profile of these processes. Secondly, a methodological proposal for a mid-size city is presented. It is proposed that the biodegradable part of the municipal solid waste, called BSW can be efficiently composted with wastewater sludge, wood ash, coal ash, lime-kiln dust, and/or limestone quarry dust to improve the profile of the compost. In addition, anaerobic decomposition followed by vermicomposting is pointed as one of the best and efficient MSW treatment system, since it may reduce total time of the composting process. Furthermore, it generates liquid fertilizer and biogas, which provides energy to supply the composting plant. This makes the plant auto-sustainable in energy. Finally, an outline using real data from the City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA, is being presented to illustrate an example of this proposed methodology of efficient composting.

TI Greenhouse Gas Emissions-Based Development and Characterization of
   Optimal Scenarios for Municipal Solid and Sewage Sludge Waste Management
   in Astana City
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Landfilling is the most applied solid waste management method in developing countries, which leads to a large amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It is thus imperative to develop strategies for evaluating different economically viable waste management scenarios to mitigate GHG emissions. According to the Paris Agreement, Kazakhstan planned to decrease GHG emissions by 25% by 2050 as compared to 1990 levels, while reaching carbon neutrality by 2060. In this context, we herein propose four different scenarios for municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment and three scenarios for sewage sludge (SS) treatment with the aim of evaluating the GHG potential for Astana, the capital city of Kazakhstan, using the (solid waste management) SWM-GHG calculator developed by the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research. The MSW treatment scenarios include: (A) 15% recycling of secondary materials and 85% landfilling of remaining MSW; (B) 30% recycling of secondary materials; 70% sanitary landfilling with biogas collection; (C) 30% recycling and 70% biological stabilization and landfilling without biogas collection; and (D) 30% recycling, 20% composting, and 50% (waste-to-energy) WtE incineration. The sewage sludge management scenarios include (1) 100% landfilling; (2) 100% WtE incineration; and (3) co-incineration of sewage sludge and coal. The results reveal that more complex scenarios lead to extensive ecological benefits; however, there are economic constraints. Based on the analysis of the proposed scenarios, we recommend the optimal strategy for MSW treatment to be 30% recycling with biological stabilization that has a total cost of EUR 16.7 million/year and overall GHG emissions of -120 kt of CO2 eq/year. In terms of sewage sludge management, the addition of coal to sewage sludge simplifies the combustion process due to the higher heat capacity. Considering lower cost and higher energy recovery, it is recommended as a favorable process.

SO FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB Municipal solid waste management systems use several techniques for municipal solid waste at the end-of-life stage. However, to take the major differences to identify good waste management practices and the optimal actions, more complex comparisons need to be discussed. This perspective article discusses the advances and future directions of the given specific research area from the viewpoint of the author with complex review of professional literature and presentation of other authors' work. This research work assesses and compares the environmental impacts of two end-of-life scenarios (landfilling and conventional incineration) in the European Union including the practical life cycle assessment. To find the research answers, eight main environmental impact categories, emissions, and primary energies were analyzed using the GaBi 8.0 software. Based on the results, it can be concluded that in the case of incineration, the emissions and the electricity power credit are higher. These research results can be used to compare waste treatment processes with lower environmental impacts, and to perform further research on these processes.

TI Greenhouse gas emissions from different sewage sludge treatment methods
   in north
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The most sustainable method for treating sewage sludge depends strongly on the situation and local circumstances. In sparsely populated northerly areas are demanding boundary conditions, e.g. cold and long winter, long transport distances and low amounts of generated sludge. In this study, commonly used calculators and emissions coefficients for calculating the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from sewage sludge treatment methods were assessed to create a calculator suitable for the Northern Finland context. The calculator was then used to determine which sewage sludge treatment method (composting, anaerobic digestion (AD), incineration (with and without thermal drying)) resulted in the lowest emissions of the GHG gases in different situations in Northern Finland. GHG gases included carbon dioxide (CO2; including biobased), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), measured as carbon dioxide equivalents (CO(2)eq). According to the calculator, AD generated the least CO(2)eq emissions of all treatment methods studied. The second best option was incineration of sludge without thermal drying, while the third best was composting or incineration of sludge after thermal drying with e.g. fossil or other fuels. Most of the emissions were generated from the treatment process itself and the share of emissions generated during transport was minimal, despite the long transport distances when all CO2 emissions (incl. biobased) were considered. The role of users of the end-products and the possibility to use the CO2 generated were highly important when considering environmental perspective. These results can be utilised when selecting the locally most suitable method. In future, some of the treatment methods (i.e. AD, incineration) with CO2 capture could be considered carbon sinks, as they also remove biobased CO2 emissions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Charging for municipal solid waste disposal in Beijing
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Considering the various ways of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) disposal that are currently in practice, this paper proposes a bundle pricing model of MSW disposal in Beijing, China. The bundle pricing model is set according to per capita annual disposable income, per capita annual consumption expenditure and MSW disposal cost based on the cost reimbursement principle and complementarity principle. This paper first estimates the unit costs of landfill and incineration respectively, and then designs three bundling packages according to three different income levels of households in Beijing (low-income households, middle-income households and high-income households). Specifically, based on our bundle pricing model, we propose to charge low-income households (of the average size of 3 persons) MSW fees 5.64 RMB per month, middle-income households 10.16 RMB, and high-income households 20.70 RMB per month. We also discuss and explain how the proposed mechanism can be expected to not only mitigate the capital shortage problem, but also reduce MSW quantity and improve the MSW incineration disposal technology.

   to Treat Municipal Organic Solid Waste: A Case Study of the Corumbatai
   River Basin Region
SO BIORESOURCES
AB This study proposed action scenarios for urban solid waste management in six municipalities in the Corumbatai River Basin. The operating scenarios were designed for organic waste treatment and for the shared disposal of urban solid waste. Six municipalities were studied, five of which had less than 30,000 inhabitants (Analandia, Charqueada, Corumbatai, Ipeilna, and Santa Gertrudes). In addition, Rio Claro had 199,000 inhabitants. Thus, the transport and transshipment stages, general infrastructure, and final disposal in landfills were analyzed. Further, the three scenarios for organic waste treatment were conducted separately. The items and the cost of implementation were estimated for decentralized composting, centralized composting, and biomethanization of waste with electricity recovery. The biomethanization scenario included the commercialization of electricity, so it generated revenues that decreased costs. This cost reduction was especially notable in the last years of the project when the goals of diversion of organic waste through selective collection were higher. The results suggested that the investigated scenarios could improve organic waste treatment and that the biomethanization scenario with electricity generation presented lower average costs per inhabitant than the centralized and decentralized composting scenarios.

TI Development of Sustainability Assessment Criteria in Selection of
   Municipal Solid Waste Treatment Technology in Developing Countries: A
   Case of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) management is a significant problem for developing countries due to lack of sufficient infrastructure, poor management capacity, and low level of waste treatment technology. This study proposes three main groups of criteria, i.e., social, economic, and environmental, that can be used as an effective tool to assess the sustainability of MSW treatment technologies, considering Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam as a case study. The sustainability assessment criteria consist of a list of indicators which consider potential waste treatment plants. The indicators and technologies then undertake a selection process from identifying assessment goals and key aspects to data collection and consultation of experts. The findings from the previous phase will be used to select the most preferred waste technology through AHP and normalization approaches. As a result, 12 selected indicators are as follows: investment cost, treatment cost, operation and maintenance costs, revenue/benefits, job creation, community consensus, support policy, community health, air pollution, water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and land quota. Among three MSW facilities selected, i.e., landfill, compost, and waste-to-energy incineration, waste-to-energy is determined as the best alternative solution for Ho Chi Minh City in a given context of approximate 70% of landfilling being applied. The selection process and indicators found can guide decision-makers and policy on selecting MSW treatment technologies in developing countries. Additionally, Ho Chi Minh City's governors benefit from finding the most appropriate waste technology. A technology adoption roadmap and its implementation plan should be thought thoroughly to address challenges in MSW management in the city.

TI The use of bio-waste to revegetate eroded land areas in Yllas, Northern
   Finland: Toward a zero waste perspective of tourism in the Finnish
   Lapland
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Lapland is one of the most attractive nature-tourism areas in Europe, and tourism is vital for local economy. However, recreational tourist activities such as skiing, hiking and horse riding deteriorate the unique and vulnerable nature of Northern Finland. Erosion and wearing of tourist areas negatively affects biodiversity and ecosystem services and reduce the attractiveness of the region. Tourism is also the source of other environmental disturbances such as wastes. Currently, in Lapland, the prevalent waste treatment method is disposal, and wastes are transported over long distances due to lack of recipient facilities for waste management. The suggestion for sustainable waste management Scenario presented in this paper is to find a synergistic solution to both of these problems, by local treatment of bio-waste in an anaerobic digestor and utilization of digestate to revegetate eroded land. It is proposed that bio-waste is co-digested with sewage sludge and offal from slaughterhouses in Yllas in the municipality of Kolari. An estimated 500-1000 t of digestate could be produced and used in tourist areas annually. Experiences from existing seasonal bio-waste collection schemes and interviews of local tourist enterprises and tourists indicate that there is willingness to extend the source separation of wastes. Assessment of the digestion Scenario suggests that economic costs of investment could be offset by avoided costs and by additional environmental and social benefits. It is concluded that this zero waste approach could lead to an improved image of Lapland as a sustainable tourist destination. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Life Cycle Assessment of prospective MSW management based on integrated
   management planning in Campo Grande, Brazil
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB A crucial first step in transforming problematic waste management into sustainable integrated systems is comprehensive planning and analysis of environmental and socio-economic effects. The work presented here is a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) that addressed the environmental performance of prospective development pathways for the municipal solid waste (MSW) management system in a large urban area, i.e. Campo Grande, Brazil. The research built on data and expanded the main development pathway proposed in the municipalities integrated waste management plan, which covers a period of 20 years (2017-2037). The system progression was assessed for milestone years (5-year intervals) considering projections of future population and waste generation growth, as well as addressing the development of surrounding systems, such as energy production. Results reveal that the rather conservative planned development pathway, which is largely based on gradual increase in selective collection, could successfully counter negative environmental externalities that would otherwise materialize due to increasing waste generation. A second, more ambitious, pathway with additionally scheduled actions to treat mixed MSW and upgrade certain treatment technologies (e.g. from composting to anaerobic digestion of collected organics), was used to illustrate a potential range for significantly higher impact reduction and even positive externalities, given a zero burden approach before waste generation.

TI European Countries: Does common legislation guarantee better hazardous
   waste performance for European Union member states?
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The study of efficiency in hazardous waste management has been proved to be a driving factor for sustainable development (SD). This study focuses on a performance assessment of European countries, most of them European Union (EU) member states and candidate countries that share a common legislative framework through European regulations, in order to provide a general understanding of hazardous waste performance. In this paper, we use Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to examine the efficiency of 32 countries in Europe by using novel input/output environmental parameters to study the efficiency of the different waste management operations from an environmental point of view. This analysis contrasts the efficiency in the management of total waste versus hazardous waste and studies three operations with hazardous wastes: incineration and incineration with energy recovery, disposal and recovery. Results show that there are differences in the achievement of efficiency, not only among countries, but also among the different waste management operations analysed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Environmental and Economic Impacts of Managing Nutrients in Digestate
   Derived from Sewage Sludge and High-Strength Organic Waste
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Increasingly stringent limits on nutrient discharges are motivating water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs) to consider the implementation of sidestream nutrient removal or recovery technologies. To further increase biogas production and reduce landfilled waste, WRRFs with excess anaerobic digestion capacity can accept other high-strength organic waste (HSOW) streams. The goal of this study was to characterize and evaluate the life-cycle global warming potential (GWP), eutrophication potential, and economic costs and benefits of sidestream nutrient management and biosolid management strategies following digestion of sewage sludge augmented by HSOW. Five sidestream nutrient management strategies were analyzed using environmental life-cycle assessment (LCA) and life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) for codigestion of municipal sewage sludge with and without HSOW. As expected, thermal stripping and ammonia stripping were characterized by a much lower eutrophication potential than no sidestream treatment; significantly higher fertilizer prices would be needed for this revenue stream to cover the capital and chemical costs. Composting all biosolids dramatically reduced the GWP relative to the baseline biosolid option but had slightly higher eutrophication potential. These complex environmental and economic tradeoffs require utilities to consider their social, environmental, and economic values in addition to present or upcoming nutrient discharge limits prior to making decisions in sidestream and biosolids management.

TI Health risks from hazardous waste disposal: the need for international
   scientific cooperation
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY
AB Adverse health effects due to waste management practices, and in particular of hazardous waste, potentially represent a public health issue in many less-developed regions and developing countries, because of growing waste production, inadequate waste management practices, lack of appropriate legislation and control systems, as well as of growing illegal hazardous waste transboundary movements driven by the most industrialized countries. According to the Report of the WHO Workshop held in Rome in 2007 " ... the scientific literature on the health effects of landfills provides some indication of the association between residing near a landfill site and adverse health effects. The evidence, somewhat stronger for reproductive outcomes than for cancer, is not sufficient to establish the causality of the association. However a public health response is warranted". Moreover, there is evidence and the global awareness of growing transboundary movements of hazardous waste from the most industrialized countries to less developed regions and developing countries. Export and import of hazardous wastes, as well as their regional final destination within a country, are driven by economic, political, environmental and technological factors such as differences in prices for treatments and disposal, different taxation levels for wastes, insufficient waste treatment capacity and technology, among several others. In this paper we aim to emphasize the need for developing international scientific cooperation activities in this field in the near future with the perspective to create an appropriate framework to promote studies, transfer of knowledge and technology as well as to widespread awareness on health risks from hazardous waste disposals.

TI Recycling of MSW compost and sewage sludge as growing substrate for
   ornamental potted plants
SO FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
AB MSW compost and anaerobically stabilized sludge mixture with soil and sheep manure were assayed as substrates for potted Ligustrum lucidum and Washingtonia robusta. Six substrates were prepared by combining MSW compost and sewage sludge with soil or manure in different proportions. Sewage sludge in mixture promoted the higher plant growth, while higher MSW compost in mixture reduced plant growth. The nutrients provided by the sewage sludge, which acted as slow-release fertilizers, positively influenced the development of both species. For substrate production, peat and soil was successfully replaced with different mixtures of sewage sludge or MSW compost, but the substrate should have a lower proportion of compost.

AB The management of municipal solid waste (MSW) in China is facing urgent problems with rapid industrialization and urbanization. This article focused on the status of Hangzhou, capital city of Zhejiang province, China. The regulations, policies, implementation, barriers and solutions about source separation, separate collection, clean & direct transportation, treatment and disposal were introduced. Source separation, separate collection and clean & direct transportation were seriously carried out from 2010. MSW was classified into four kinds, such as kitchen waste, hazardous waste, recyclable waste and other waste. Four kinds of wastes were collected, transported, treated and disposed, respectively. At the same time, a questionnaire survey was conducted in 2011 on 200 households in Xiasha and Gongshu Districts in Hangzhou. The results indicate that many citizens cannot effectively and correctly separated different kinds of solid wastes. Kitchen waste was directly disposed in landfill, because there is no composting plant in Hangzhou City. The collection of recoverable waste and hazardous waste was not in control of municipal solid waste management (MSWM) system. In order to optimize MSWM system in Hangzhou, the government and the citizen must make efforts in source separation, comprehensive treatment system, effective regulations and policies.

SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Along with population growth, rapid urbanization and industrialization process, the volume of municipal solid waste (MSW) generation in China has been increasing sharply in the past 30 years and the total amount of MSW yields will continue to increase. Nowadays, due to global warming warrants particular attention throughout the world, a series of air pollutants (including greenhouse gases, odorous gases, PCDD/Fs, heavy metals, PM, etc.) discharged from waste disposal and treatment processes have become one of the new significant emerging air pollution sources, which arousing great concerns about their adverse effects on surrounding ambient air quality and public health. At present, the overall safely disposed ratio of the collected MSW in China is reported at approximately 78% in 2010, and there are mainly three types of MSW disposal methods practiced in China, including landfill, composting and incineration. The characteristics of air pollutants and greenhouse gases discharge vary substantially among different MSW disposal methods. By presenting a thorough review of MSW generation in China and providing a summarization of the current status of MSW disposal methods practices, this review article makes an integrated overview analysis of existing air pollution problems associated with MSW collection, separation, and disposal processes. Furthermore, some comprehensive control proposals to prevent air pollution for improving MSW management of China in the future are put forward. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Energy and economic evaluation of MSW incineration and gasification in
   Brazil
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB Ever-increasing waste generation from the world population, along with the demand for renewable energy sources, are two topics gaining prominence in global conversations. Energy recovery of municipal solid wastes stands out as a possible solution for both problems. Thus, the present study aims to analyze the use of gasifiers and incinerators as technology for municipal solid waste treatment and energy generation from economic and energetic perspectives. The study was carried out in three municipalities in different regions of Brazil with distinct characteristics: Itajuba & DBLBOND;, Campinas and Campo Grande. The calculations were performed considering each city's waste production values and gravimetric composition. For each, two different waste flow scenarios were considered: the first adopted constant power and waste treatment values, while the second used values that varied year to year. The results obtained showed that the second scenario had greater energy potential than the first; however, its generation costs are higher, due to the greater flow of waste. Regarding the types of technology, gasification resulted in lower generation costs in Itajuba & DBLBOND;, while incineration was more attractive for Campinas and Campo Grande. This distinction can be explained by the different levels of organic matter in the cities involved. The use of both types of technology did not prove to be economically viable for any of the cities and conditions analyzed, thus demonstrating the need for government incentives for their viability.(C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Application of life cycle assessment in municipal solid waste
   management: A worldwide critical review
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The whopping increase in solid waste generation all over the world calls for the development of waste management strategies for a sustainable environment. By the quantification of environmental impacts, life cycle assessment (LCA) tool can help in answering the call. It evaluates the environmental performance of municipal solid waste management (MSWM) system which helps decision-maker in selecting the best management strategy with minimum impacts on the environment. But, up to what extent the LCA methodology can be applied to MSWM systems? To address this question, the present study analyzed the 153 LCA studies published till date since 2013 all over the world. The present study analyzed the time evolution, geographical distribution, and methodology applied in LCA studies. It summarized the use of the functional unit, LCA model, Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) method, MSWM options, and the critical findings of the selected LCAs, along with MSW composition, income group, and the gaps in the application of the studies. For evaluating the dependence of publication of studies and country's economic condition, the countries in which LCA studies were conducted are classified into four groups on the basis of income level viz., lower income, lower middle income, upper middle income, and higher income countries. In terms of technological coverage, 1 ton of MSW was the most used functional unit. SimaPro was the majorly used LCA model while 56 of the total studies didn't mention about the use of LCA model, only 66 of the total studies included sensitivity analysis in the assessment. Integrated solid waste management was found to be the most preferred waste management option. Also, a very limited number of studies have included life cycle costing and social aspects of MSWM system. The results indicated that the majority of the LCA studies are based in Europe and Asia. Shockingly, 178 out of the total countries in the world have not published a single LCA study on MSWM since 2013. Also, it was found that the effect of increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on the publication of LCA studies is irrelevant, possible reasons being the lack of data, time and economic constraints. Establishment of environment-friendly policies and initiatives by the Government along with the participation of public, non-government and private organizations through training courses and seminars might help in improving the LCA applicability in the field of MSWM.

SO CURRENT OPINION IN GREEN AND SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY
AB Municipal solid waste and food supply chain waste are globally generated in large quantities from various sectors including various stages of food supply chains, municipalities, open markets and catering services. A prevailing priority in the EU is to stimulate the transition towards a circular economy that fosters the promotion of sustainable and resource-efficient policies for long-term socio-economic and environmental benefits. Common practices for waste management include landfill disposal, anaerobic digestion, composting and wastewater treatment. Recently, new technologies have been introduced to produce value-added products from agricultural residues and food processing side streams. Integrated and holistic approaches for organic waste utilization as industrial feedstocks will boost the transition towards the bio-economy era. The establishment of circular economy would expand and diversify the market outlets of bio-based products. This review provides an overview of the current methods on waste and by-product streams bioconversion to develop biorefinery concepts.

TI Novel approach to quantify municipal solid waste management hierarchy
   based on analytical hierarchy process
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB A novel approach to quantify and apply the municipal solid waste management hierarchy is presented in this study. In this study, weights were assigned to the treatment methods using the analytical hierarchy process. The consistency ratio was found to be within the allowable range (0.10), indicating that weights assigned met the requirements of the analytical hierarchy process. The assigned weights for the municipal solid waste hierarchy treatment methods were prevention=0.44, reduction/minimization=0.27, reuse=0.12, recycle=0.08, incineration=0.05, and landfilling=0.04. The highest benefits were derived when all the treatment methods in the municipal solid waste hierarchy were applied based on the optimum weights generated by the analytical hierarchy process. It was, however, observed that a combination of reduction/minimization, reuse and recycling, was more effective and beneficial. Also, selecting only one treatment method gave the least benefits except for reduction/minimization. Also, applying up to two treatment methods yielded much benefit in some instances compared to a combination of three. When the proposed model was applied to data obtained from the Accra Metropolitan Assembly in Ghana on population and total municipal solid waste received at selected landfill sites over a period of 7years, it proved to be ultimately effective. The developed municipal solid waste hierarchy model equations, when properly applied will ensure sustainable treatment and provide for the exploitation of municipal solid waste resources. It is therefore a new promising module for effective planning, decision making, and sustainable municipal solid waste management.

TI Cleaner production of agriculturally valuable benignant materials from
   industry generated bio-wastes: A review
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB Bio-wastes from different agro-based industries are increasing at a rapid rate with the growing human population's demand for the products. The industries procure raw materials largely from agriculture, finish it with the required major product, and produce huge bio-wastes which are mostly disposed unscientifically. This creates serious environmental problems and loss of resources and nutrients. Traditional bio-wastes disposal possess several demerits which again return with negative impact over the eco-system. Anaerobic digestion, composting, co-composting, and vermicomposting are now-a-days given importance due to the improved and modified methods with enhanced transformation of bio-wastes into suitable soil amendments. The advanced and modified methods like biochar assisted composting and vermicomposting is highlighted with the updated knowledge in the field. Hence, the present study has been carried to compile the effective and efficient methods of utilizing industry generated bio-wastes for circularity between agriculture - industrial sectors to promote sustainability.

TI Biomass and organic waste potentials towards implementing circular
   bioeconomy platforms: A systematic bibliometric analysis
SO FUEL
AB Over the last decade, the increasing sustainability discourse has pushed interest in investments in the nexus of economy, bioeconomy, and the circular economy (CE). Consequently, the emerging circular bioeconomy (CBE) concept with a special focus on biomass and organic waste valorization to close product lifecycle loops has gained momentum. This research aims at providing a comprehensive map of the body of knowledge in the biomass and organic waste literature with a CBE perspective. To achieve this, a systematic bibliometric analysis is performed employing keywords, co-citation, and bibliographic coupling analyses on a total of 646 peer reviewed articles in Web of Science. As a result, four seminal background research themes building the biomass and organic waste research in the CE were identified as follows: (1) biological conversion technologies, (2) the CE concept and its implementation, (3) environmental studies, and (4) food waste. Moreover, the results revealed that the most recent areas of research in the target literature are clustered in seven categories, including: (1) the biochar industry development from a CE perspective, (2) the role of insect biorefinery in waste management in the CE framework, (3) lifecycle assessment studies for bio-waste treatment systems, (4) the CE implementation in the agricultural sector, (5) spent coffee grounds valorization, (6) organic waste biorefinery applications in a CBE, and (7) municipal bio-waste and food waste valorization via anaerobic digestion. The provided map of the research on biomass and organic waste in the CBE framework can, on the one hand, support scholars in advancing the research and, on the other hand, assist practitioners and local and national authorities in implementing the CE for bio-based waste management.

TI GHGs Emissions and Sustainable Solid Waste Management
SO RECYCLING OF SOLID WASTE FOR BIOFUELS AND BIO-CHEMICALS
SE Environmental Footprints and Eco-design of Products and Processes
AB In the 21st century, global warming and climate change are among the greatest environmental challenges and humanitarian crisis. Globally, annual greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions from solid waste disposal sites is estimated to be approximately a quarter of total anthropogenic methane emission. Integrated solid waste management, therefore, provides significant opportunities to control environmental pollution and minimize the negative impacts of global climate change. This chapter illustrates the current status of global GHGs emission in relationship with population growth and solid waste generation. Mathematic models used to quantify GHGs generated from the waste sector as the zero-order model (i.e., SWANA, German EPER and IPCC Default Method) and the first-order model (i.e., TNO, LandGEM, IPCC First-Order Decay; FOD) are explained including application to certain inventory in selected countries. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), which involves the cradle-to-grave concept, environmental burden from global warming and selected case studies are described and applied to assess GHGs emissions from various solid waste management options such as recycling, composting, sanitary landfilling, anaerobic digestion, incineration, mechanical biological treatment (MBT), source reduction, and utilization and application of biochar. Existing solid waste management practices and innovative options to achieve GHGs mitigation and community adaptation including resiliency are presented. Lessons learned and best practices in solid waste management from Thailand (i.e., Bangkok Kamphaeng Sean West: Landfill Gas to Electricity Project) and from other countries (i.e., GHGs mitigation project: MBT plant in Gaobeidian, Hebei province, People's Republic of China; municipal solid waste composting project in Ikorodu, Lagos State, Federal Republic of Nigeria; and gasification, landfill gas and anaerobic digestion in Bali, Indonesia) are further discussed.

TI Organic Waste Buyback as a Viable Method to Enhance Sustainable
   Municipal Solid Waste Management in Developing Countries
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Many developing countries have inadequate Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) management systems due to lack of not only the awareness, technologies, finances, but also a proper governance that is able to enforce and monitor the regulations. Not all the solutions practiced by and in developed countries fit to the developing country contexts. The local conditions and limitations must always be taken into account when proposing waste management options for developing countries. The excessively high organic waste fraction in MSW and relatively inexpensive labor markets available in developing countries are two of the strengths that have not yet been utilized fully. This manuscript is an attempt to point out the benefits we receive from the above two strengths if we establish organic waste buyback programs. This can only become successful if we find solutions to: (1) collect source-separated organic waste, and then (2) find stable markets for the products made from organic waste. Compost or biogas could be the best bet developing countries can consider as products. However, there must be some policy interventions to support buyback programs at the waste collection stage as well as at the product marketing stage. Implementation of such organic waste buyback centers that can offer some incentives can indirectly motivate residents to do source separation. This will in turn also help promote more recycling, as any waste bin that has no organics in it is much easier for anyone (e.g., waste pickers) to look for other recyclables. Developing country settings such as the Green Container composting program in Cajica, Colombia, and buyback centers in South Africa that are presented later in the manuscript are thought to be the places where the concept can be implemented with little effort. The environment, economy, and society are considered to be the three dimensions (or pillars) of sustainability. Interestingly, the organic waste buyback centers solution has positive implications on all three aspects of sustainability. Thus, it also supports the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations (UN), by making specific contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) such as zero hunger (SDG 2), affordable and clean energy (SDG 7), climate action (SDG 13), clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), and sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11).

TI Evaluation of stabilization status of the landfill layers by comparing
   long-term monitoring data of methane emission with FOD model estimate
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY
AB Long-term monitoring and treatment of landfill leachate (LFL) and landfill gas (LFG) is required until landfilled municipal solid waste (MSW) is sufficiently stabilized and post-closure care can be terminated. Monitoring data of methane (CH4) emissions in LFG from a marine landfill over 30 years were compared with the IPCC first order decay (FOD) model estimates. The observed changes in CH4 showed a similar attenuation trend to the estimates, but the observed CH4 emissions were only about 30% of the estimate over 30 years; LFL is considered to be another pathway for organic carbon to be released to the environment, but the total organic carbon in discharged LFL was only about 0.2% of CH4 carbon in LFG emission over the same period. The increase in the CO2/CH4 ratio in LFG over time suggests that the discrepancy between estimated and observed emissions is due to methane oxidation in the overlying soil, in addition to the high coefficient values used in the FOD model. Total organic carbon (TOC) in LFL discharged as effluent reached a maximum value in the early stages of the landfill and gradually decreased, but only to about one-third of the maximum value after more than 30 years and a decrease in the amount of effluent. As incineration of MSW is expected to reduce organic carbon and nitrogen, the CH4 reduction effect of incineration of business and household waste and sewage sludge was investigated using FOD model estimates.

Municipal solid and liquid waste (MSLW) production and accumulation are global environmental issues. The waste products of a home include paper, containers, tin cans, aluminum cans, and food scraps, as well as sewage. Solid wastes can be utilized by direct combustion or converted to useful fuels and chemicals by pyrolysis and/or steam gasification processes. Sewage sludge can be converted to fuel briquette and organic fertilizer by the composting and briquetting processes. MSLW can also be evaluated in landfill gas production by anaerobic microbial decomposition.

TI Food waste co-digestion with sewage sludge - Realising its potential in
   the UK
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The application of anaerobic co-digestion of food waste with sewage sludge, although well established in many European countries, is still in its infancy in the UK. This process has many benefits to offer, with a successful application often associated with increased renewable energy potential, outweighing constraints associated with the variability of food waste and its handling requirements prior to co-digestion. With both regulations and water infrastructures designed and constructed on the basis of linear views and sectorial requirements and conditions and technologies from the past in many parts of the world, in the UK, sewage sludge and food waste digestion operations are also under very different regulatory and management regimes. With sustainability requiring that we do not address single issues in isolation, but through a systems approach that delivers integrated solutions, co-digestion of food waste with sewage sludge could become such a solution. If carefully applied, co-digestion can deliver beneficial synergies for the water industry and authorities responsible for food waste management. The collaboration of all relevant stakeholders and regulators to support changes to current regulatory frameworks to enable this, is proposed as the way forward, particularly as their complexity has been identified as the major hurdle to the implementation of co-digestion in the UK.

SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The ever-increasing rise in the global population coupled with rapid urbanization demands considerable consumption of fossil fuel, food, and water. This in turn leads to energy depletion, greenhouse gas emissions and wet wastes gener-ation (including food waste, animal manure, and sewage sludge). Conversion of the wet wastes to bioenergy and bio-char is a promising approach to mitigate wastes, emissions and energy depletion, and simultaneously promotes sustainability and circular economy. In this study, various conversion technologies for transformation of wet wastes to bioenergy and biochar, including anaerobic digestion, gasification, incineration, hydrothermal carbonization, hy-drothermal liquefaction, slow and fast pyrolysis, are comprehensively reviewed. The technological challenges imped-ing the widespread adoption of these wet waste conversion technologies are critically examined. Eventually, the study presents insightful recommendations for the technological advancements and wider acceptance of these processes by establishing a hierarchy of factors dictating their performance. These include: i) life-cycle assessment of these conver-sion technologies with the consideration of reactor design and catalyst utilization from lab to plant level; ii) process intensification by integrating one or more of the wet waste conversion technologies for improved performance and sus-tainability; and iii) emerging machine learning modeling is a promising strategy to aid the product characterization and optimization of system design for the specific to the bioenergy or biochar application.

TI Effect of microwave pre-treatment of thickened waste activated sludge on
   biogas production from co-digestion of organic fraction of municipal
   solid waste, thickened waste activated sludge and municipal sludge
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Anaerobic co-digestion of organic fraction of municipal solid waste, with thickened waste activated sludge and primary sludge has the potential to enhance biodegradation of solid waste, increase longevity of existing landfills and lead to more sustainable development by improving waste to energy production. This study reports on mesophilic batch and continuous studies using different concentrations and combinations (ratios) of organic fraction of municipal solid waste, thickened waste activated sludge (microwave pre-treated and untreated) and primary sludge to assess the potential for improved biodegradability and specific biogas production. Improvements in specific biogas production for batch assays, with concomitant improvements in total chemical oxygen demand and volatile solid removal, were obtained with organic fraction of municipal solid waste:thickened waste activated sludge:primary sludge mixtures at a ratio of 50:25:25 (with and without thickened waste activated sludge microwave pre-treatment). This combination was used for continuous digester studies. At 15d hydraulic retention times, the co-digestion of organic fraction of municipal solid waste:organic fraction of municipal solid waste:primary sludge and organic fraction of municipal solid waste:thickened waste activated sludge microwave:primary sludge resulted in a 1.38- and 1.46-fold increase in biogas production and concomitant waste stabilisation when compared with thickened waste activated sludge:primary sludge (50:50) and thickened waste activated sludge microwave:primary sludge (50:50) digestion at the same hydraulic retention times and volumetric volatile solid loading rate, respectively. The digestion of organic fraction of municipal solid waste with primary sludge and thickened waste activated sludge provides beneficial effects that could be implemented at municipal wastewater treatment plants that are operating at loading rates of less than design capacity.

TI Comparison of Collection Schemes of Municipal Solid Waste Metallic
   Fraction: The Impacts on Global Warming Potential for the Case of the
   Helsinki Metropolitan Area, Finland
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In this research article the sustainability of different practices to collect the metal fraction of household waste in the Helsinki metropolitan area, Finland is examined. The study is carried out by calculating and comparing the greenhouse gas reduction potential of optional practices for collecting the metal fraction of household waste in the Helsinki metropolitan area, Finland. In order to locate the greenhouse gas reduction potential of the separate collection of the metallic fraction of municipal solid waste (MSW) collected from residential sources, a comparative carbon footprint analysis using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) on six different waste management scenarios is carried out. The modeled system consisted of a waste collection system, transportation, and different waste management alternatives, including on-site separation, separation at the waste management facility as well as metallurgical recovery of separated scrap. The results show that, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, separate collection and recycling of the metallic fraction of solid MSW at residential properties is the preferable option compared to a scenario with no source sorting and incineration of everything. According to this research scenario where the metal fraction of solid household waste was not source-separated or collected separately have clearly higher greenhouse gas emissions compared to all the other scenarios with separate collection for metals. In addition, metal recycling by regional collection points has considerably lower greenhouse gas emission potential than metal recycling by collection directly from residential properties.

TI Provisional Evaluation of Composting as Priority Option for Sustainable
   Waste Management in South-West Nigeria
SO POLLUTION
AB The management of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) in Nigeria and most developing countries has remained a major public health challenge, thus creating the need for reliable and environmentally-acceptable alternatives. This study focuses on composting assessment as a viable recovery alternative for MSW in six States of Southwest Nigeria, namely: Ekiti, Osun, Ondo, Ogun, Oyo, and Lagos. Extensive literature review has been carried out to understand the waste generation patterns in these states. Reported literature data has been assessed for sustainability of composting strategy in terms of organic waste streams, amenable of biotransformation as well as in terms of return through energy saving and material recovery. A life-cycle framework has been used to estimate GHG emissions, available nutrients, and potential compost production, instead of landfill in each region. Results show significant potential compost production of 895,659-, 255,267-, 153,423-, 117,468-, 113,094- and 112, 397-m(3)/yr for Lagos, Oyo, Ogun, Osun, Ondo, and Ekiti, respectively. It has been deduced from the study that composting would be very beneficial to the economy as its product would boost agriculture production while reducing the budget spent on fertilizer annually.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Rapid population growth and urbanization increase the Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) generation rate and the demand for natural resources. In order to reduce emissions and conserve resources, the European Commission has adopted a Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP). Cities play a vital role in transitioning to a Circular Economy (CE) model. The current study aims to determine the most efficient integrated waste management plan by considering the CE approach. In this context, the best scenario determination study was carried out on the Municipal Solid Waste model of Bursa (Turkey) by making time-based modeling to reach the percentages targeted by the European Commission in the CE model. The ideal scenario has shown the reduction of environmental impacts and material efficiency. Used different combinations from the facilities starting from 2020 aimed to reduce the landfill amount to 10% and increase the recycling up to 75% by 2045. The best scenario achieves the goal by applying the dual waste separation, eliminating the incinerator, directing the recyclable waste to the Material Recovery Facility, and evaluating the organic waste in the Anaerobic Digestion plant and composting.

TI A multi-objective model for sustainable recycling of municipal solid
   waste
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB The efficient management of municipal solid waste is a major problem for large and populated cities. In many countries, the majority of municipal solid waste is landfilled or dumped owing to an inefficient waste management system. Therefore, an optimal and sustainable waste management strategy is needed. This study introduces a recycling and disposal network for sustainable utilisation of municipal solid waste. In order to optimise the network, we develop a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model in which the economic, environmental and social dimensions of sustainability are concurrently balanced. The model is able to: select the best combination of waste treatment facilities; specify the type, location and capacity of waste treatment facilities; determine the allocation of waste to facilities; consider the transportation of waste and distribution of processed products; maximise the profit of the system; minimise the environmental footprint; maximise the social impacts of the system; and eventually generate an optimal and sustainable configuration for municipal solid waste management. The proposed methodology could be applied to any region around the world. Here, the city of Tehran, Iran, is presented as a real case study to show the applicability of the methodology.

TI Solar composting greenhouse for organic waste treatment in fed-batch
   mode: Physicochemical and microbiological dynamics
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Composting is a sustainable means of managing organic waste, and solar composters offer a viable solution in rural areas lacking connection to municipal power supplies. This study tracked the physicochemical and microbiological changes that occur in a solar composting greenhouse during the treatment of food and green cellulosic waste in fed-batch mode, which remain poorly understood. Solar composting greenhouse performed well on waste reduction and nutrient retention, resulting in a 45.0-58.8% decrease in feedstock volume over 12-day composting cycles, a 41% removal in dry matter after three batches of composting, and 29.5%, 252.9% and 96.6% increase in the nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium content respectively after 42 days of composting. Batch feeding and composting jointly influenced microbiological succession by altering the physicochemical properties of compost. The contents of nitrogen and phosphorus, pH, and electrical conductivity significantly accounts for variations in culturable microbial populations. The succession of dominant bacterial genera such as Lactobacillus, Pseudoxanthomonas, Bacillus, and Pseudomonas were closely related to pH, cellulose, NH4+-N, carbon content, and temperature. In addition, Pichia kudriavzevii, Thermomyces lanuginosus, and Scopulariopsis brevicaulis successively became the dominant fungal species during composting. Preliminary compost quality assessments showed that solar composting greenhouse has a high potentiality to transform organic waste into organic fertilizer. Additionally, corresponding purposeful suggestions were proposed for future optimization in this system, mainly from a microbiological aspect. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Economic and environmental evaluation of municipal solid waste
   management system using industrial ecology approach: Evidence from India
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Industrial ecology based symbiotic system approach is applied to Indian municipal solid waste (MSW) for population size of one million, taking various alternative techniques: anaerobic digestion (AD), compost, refuses derived fuel (RDF), incineration and gasification. Considering the virtual operation of the existing plants for production of electricity and products, the economic and environmental evaluation of each technique is presented. For environmental impact assessment global warming, acidification, photochemical oxidation and eutrophication categories are considered. The conceptual analysis depicts that AD has maximum tendency to reduce global warming (123 tonne CO2 eq./day) along with the economic benefits of 19099 INR/day (293 $/day). Gasification shows maximum reduction in acidification, photochemical oxidation and eutrophication by 189 kg SO2 eq./day, 33 kg C2H4 eq./day and 12 kg PO4 eq./day with economic benefits of 46956 INR/day (722 Way). Integrated operation of AD and gasification gives maximum economic benefits (INR 66056/day or 1016 $/day) with highest reduction in environmental impact (for all categories) as compared to a single technology and any other combination of technologies. Industrial ecology approach for MSW management system affects the economic and environmental results to significant level that can influence the policy and decision making. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Current status of solid waste management in small island developing
   states: A review
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB This article reviews the current status of waste management in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and the challenges that are faced in solid waste management. The waste generation rates of SIDS were compared within the three geographic regions namely Caribbean SIDS, Pacific SIDS and Atlantic, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean and South China (AIMS) SIDS and with countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD). Only Pacific SIDS had a waste generation rate less than 1 kg/capita/day. The waste generation rates for the three SIDS regions averaged 1.29 kg/capita/day while that for OECD countries was at a mean value of 1.35 kg/capita/day. The waste compositions in the different SIDS regions were almost similar owing to comparable consumption patterns while these differed to a large extent with wastes generated in OECD countries. In SIDS, the major fraction of MSW comprised of organics (44%) followed by recyclables namely paper, plastics, glass and metals (total: 43%). In contrast, MSW in OECD countries consisted mainly of recyclables (43%) followed by organics (37%). This article also reviewed the other functional elements of the waste management systems in SIDS. Several shortcomings were noted in the process of waste collection, transfer and transport namely the fact of having outdated collection vehicles and narrow roads which are inaccessible. Among the waste management practices in SIDS, waste disposal via landfilling, illegal dumping and backyard burning were favoured most of the time at the expense of sustainable waste treatment technologies such as composting, anaerobic digestion and recycling.

TI Recycling of Organic Wastes in Agriculture: An Environmental Perspective
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Inadequate organic waste management leads to a plethora of problems such as environmental pollution, eutrophication, esthetic damage to urban landscape, greenhouse gases emission and effects on human health. Unwise and non-scientific disposal of wastes not only poses a grave threat to environmental quality but also results in loss of economic value of wastes. Since organic wastes are an abundant pool of organic matter and valuable plant nutrients, agricultural recycling of these wastes appears to be a promising alternative enabling value addition and their resourceful utilization. Land application of organic wastes stabilized through techniques such as composting, vermicomposting and anaerobic digestion yielding excellent organic fertilizer like compost augments soil fertility and crop yield. Additionally, the practice incorporates indirect environmental benefits such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions, land conservation due to reduced landfilling of wastes and substitute to chemical fertilizers. Economically also, agricultural utilization of organic wastes reduces the cost of landfilling, transportation of wastes, imports and production cost of chemical fertilizers and opens avenues for rural employment. However, effective utilization of organic wastes for agricultural purposes requires thorough and strict risk assessment to prevent the adverse effects of contaminants like heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants to ensure agro-environmental sustainability. The present article aims to enlist the positives and negatives associated with this practice enabling to devise an approach or strategy deriving maximum environmental and economic benefits. Article HighlightsAgricultural recycling of organic wastes can be explored as an eco-friendly and sustainable waste management approach.Organic wastes are a rich source of beneficial plant nutrients (macro and micro) and organic matter.Organic waste amendments improve soil physico-chemical and biological properties and benefit plant productivity.Organic wastes offer the potential to be used as a valuable resource.

TI COMPOSTING OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE: AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF EXISTING
   PLANTS
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE
AB Thousands of tonnes of municipal solid waste (MSW) are produced every day, and consignment to landfill represents the most common disposal choice. However, sanitary problems and the increasing demand for dedicated spaces have directed the efforts of researchers and practitioners toward the study of alternative approaches to waste management. Composting is one possible way to treat the organic portion of MSW, and the efficient design and management of composting plants ensure that they are economically sustainable. Analyzing established or pioneering solutions allows guidelines to be drawn up for the design of new plants and/or the management of existing ones. In this article, a set of engineering indices for the technical and economic analysis of composting plants is first presented and then applied to data collected from ten existing plants, divided into two groups: plants mainly composting the organic fraction of household solid waste with reduced levels of the organic fraction of agro-industrial waste, green waste, and sludge (Group A); and plants only composting green waste (Group B). For Group A plants, more complex technological solutions are required, given the need to manage larger portions of untreated waste and leachate, along with odor problems. This means that the need for space (particularly covered space), facilities, operators, and initial investment is greater, and annual operating costs are higher However, Group A plants can also charge more for processing waste.

TI Life Cycle Assessment of Leachate Treatment Strategies
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Increasingly stringent regulations for leachate discharge call for leachate treatment plants (LTPs) to increase their treatment capacity by adopting membrane treatment processes to remove nitrogen and organics beyond conventional biological treatment processes. This study developed four common treatment strategies based on the existing operation and construction conditions of seven representative LTPs in China. We evaluated the LTPs' environmental impacts using life cycle assessment (LCA) following the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 14040 and ISO 14044). Compared with conventional secondary treatment processes, implementing high-level technologies to meet the strict standards could reduce an average of 59% of the eutrophication potential while increasing other environmental impacts resulting from both direct and indirect emissions by an average of 146%. We propose advanced technologies that integrate both midpoint and endpoint LCA results to meet stringent standards in areas sensitive to eutrophication.

   system
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The partial degradation of cellulose-based bioplastics in industrial treatment of organic fraction of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) opened to the investigation of further disposal routes for bioplastics in the waste management system. For this purpose, the environmental footprint of three MSW management scenarios differing only for the bioplastics final destination (organic, plastic or mixed waste streams) was assessed through a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) ap-proach. Results revealed how the treatment of bioplastics with organic waste achieved the worst environmental per-formance (5.8 kg CO2 eq/FU) for most impact categories. On the other hand, treatment with plastics and mixed waste achieved negative impact values (that mean avoided GHG emissions) of -9.8 and -7.7 kg CO2 eq/FU respec-tively, showing comparable benefits from these scenarios. The key reason was the lower quality of compost obtained from the organic treatment route, which reduced the environmental credits achieved by the energy recovery during anaerobic digestion.

TI Recent Advancement in Commercial and Other Sustainable Techniques for
   Energy and Material Recovery from Sewage Sludge
SO WATER
AB Rapid population growth and urbanization have resulted in a multi-fold increase in water consumption over the last few decades, resulting in the generation of large amounts of sewage and sewage sludge that impose severe environmental burdens if not handled properly. Sludge management itself accounts for up to 50% of the total operating costs of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Conventional sludge management practices such as incineration, landfilling, and ocean disposal have been deemed difficult in light of today's stringent environmental legislation and compliance standards. As a result, progress has been made toward developing more sustainable approaches for sludge management. This study reviews recent advancements in sewage sludge management techniques that not only ensure the safe disposal of sewage sludge but also focus on utilizing the potential of sewage sludge as feedstock for energy and resource recovery. Energy could be recovered by subjecting the pre-treated sludge to controlled anaerobic digestion (AD) to produce biogas or by utilizing the lipid content of the sewage sludge through esterification or direct sludge pyrolysis to produce biodiesel/bio-oil. Heavy metals such as Ag, Au, Cu, Fe, Ga, Cr, and others, as well as nutrients such as N, P, K, Mg, S, and others, could also be recovered. If energy and resource recovery from sewage sludge is practiced on a global scale, it could significantly contribute to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction.

TI Composting and compost application in China
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB The current situation of municipal solid waste (MSW) and sewage sludge production (in terms of volume as well as composition) in China is introduced. Composting and compost application in China are reviewed. In China, the production of municipal solid waste and sewage sludge is changing rapidly along with economic development. Composting is mainly applied for treating MSW, about 20% of the total amount of MSW being disposed. MSW composting is mainly co-composted with night soil or sewage sludge. Compost is used in agriculture, forestry and horticulture. Compost application is the key factor influencing the composting development in China. To promote composting and compost application in China, a state-wide survey on the production, composition and physical and chemical properties of MSW and sewage sludge should be carried out. More effort should be made to develop low cost and high efficient composting technologies according to China's conditions. The environmental impact of compost application should also be given more attention. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI An environmental evaluation of food waste downstream management options:
   a hybrid LCA approach
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RECYCLING OF ORGANIC WASTE IN AGRICULTURE
AB Purpose Food waste treatment methods have been typically analysed using current energy generation conditions. To correctly evaluate treatment methods, they must be compared under existing and potential decarbonisation scenarios. This paper holistically quantifies the environmental impacts of three food waste downstream management options-incineration, composting, and anaerobic digestion (AD).
   Methods The assessment was carried out using a novel hybrid input-output-based life cycle assessment method (LCA), for 2014, and in a future decarbonised economy. The method introduces expanded system boundaries which reduced the level of incompleteness, a previous limitation of process-based LCA.
   Results Using the 2014 UK energy mix, composting achieved the best score for seven of 14 environmental impacts, while AD scored second best for ten. Incineration had the highest environmental burdens in six impacts. Uncertainties in the LCA data made it difficult determine best treatment option. There was significant environmental impact from capital goods, meaning current treatment facilities should be used for their full lifespan. Hybrid IO LCA's included additional processes and reduced truncation error increasing overall captured environmental impacts of composting, AD, and incineration by 26, 10 and 26%, respectively. Sensitivity and Monte Carlo analysis evaluate the methods robustness and illustrate the uncertainty of current LCA methods. Major implication: hybrid IO-LCA approaches must become the new norm for LCA.
   Conclusion This study provided a deeper insight of the overall environmental performance of downstream food waste treatment options including ecological burdens associated with capital goods.

TI Reinforced urban waste management for resource, energy and environmental
   benefits: China's regional potentials
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Urban waste management is a huge task for achieving regional sustainability. Reinforced waste management is being expedited to achieve enhanced resource, energy and environmental benefits (REEBs). In this study, an integrated municipal solid waste management system focusing on reinforced waste recycling and energy re-covery is constructed. Considering regional disparities in waste composition and suitability for waste recycling, three scenarios with moderate, strengthened and complete waste collection and recycling levels are designed. Targeting 31 Chinese provincial regions, resource recovery potentials from recyclables, energy recovery po-tentials from incineration and anaerobic digestion, and mitigated environmental impact potentials in four aspects are evaluated. The results indicate that in 2019, the complete resource recovery capacity is 60.25 million tons (metal 4.3%, rubber & plastic 47.7%, glass 10.0% and paper 38.0%). Through incineration and anaerobic digestion, total power generation could amount to 36.39 billion kWh in the complete scenario. The complete mitigated potentials of global warming (52.5%) and eutrophication (43.1%) are much larger, followed by that of acidification (3.6%) and photochemical oxidization (0.8%). Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shandong, Zhejiang and Sichuan are more advantageous in terms of the REEBs. The novelty of this study lies in the elaborative assessment of the integrative benefits of reinforced waste management incorporating regional socioeconomic disparities. The results are expected to offer help in policy making targeting sounder performance on REEBs from waste management.

TI Design of an Optimal Waste Utilization System: A Case Study in St.
   Petersburg, Russia
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Storing municipal solid waste (MSW) in landfills is the oldest and still the primary waste management strategy in many countries. Russia is the third largest methane (CH4) emitter country after USA and China, representing 5% of total global CH4 emissions from waste landfilling. Due to high economical growth, the amount of waste generated in Russia has risen sharply over the last ten years. However, waste management in Russia is mainly based on landfilling. In order to design an optimal MSW utilization system considering various aspects related to sustainable MSW management, a linear programming model was introduced for this research. The performance of the proposed MSW utilization system in the target area has been evaluated in light of energy, economic, and environmental (3Es) aspects, such as system net cost, annual energy generated from the waste, and the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of the system. St. Petersburg city was considered as the target area for the present analysis. The results show that the introduction of the proposed MSW system with energy recovery from waste along with a high level of material recovery has energy, environmental and economic benefits compared to the conventional treatment system. This paper emphasizes the importance of introducing waste treatment methods as an alternative to landfilling, and to improve recycling activities in Russia.

TI Bioconversion of municipal solid waste into bio-based products: A review
   on valorisation and sustainable approach for circular bioeconomy
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Municipal solid waste management is one of the major issues throughout the world. Inappropriate management of municipal solid waste (MSW) can pose a major hazard. Anaerobic processing of MSW followed by methane and biogas generation is one of the numerous sustainable energy source options. Compared with other technologies applicable for the treatment of MSW, factors like economic aspects, energy savings, and ecological advantages make anaerobic processing an attractive choice. This review discusses the framework for evaluating conversion of municipal solid waste to energy and waste derived bioeconomy in order to address the sustainable development goals. Further, this review will provide an innovative work foundation to improve the accuracy of structuring, quality control, and pre-treatment for the ideal treatment of different segments of MSW to achieve a sustainable circular bioeconomy. The increasing advancements in three essential conversion pathways, in particular the thermochemical, biochemical, and physiochemical conversion methods, are assessed. Generation of wastes should be limited and resource utilization must be minimised to make total progress in a circular bioeconomy. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The feasibility of renewable energy recovery from municipal solid wastes
   in Palestine based on different scenarios
SO BIOFUELS-UK
AB Management of municipal solid waste (MSW) and energy constraints are the most pressing issues for Palestine's sustainable development and environmental protection. Palestinians are harmed by the environmental and health risks associated with the dumpsite. In addition to imported electricity, natural gas and crude oil are also used to generate electricity in Palestine. This study aimed to assess the viability of recovering energy from MSW through various processes, such as anaerobic digestion, incineration, and gasification. Consequently, this study investigates the viability of recovering and utilizing landfill gas. In addition, the potential advantages of four types of energy generation technologies, namely incineration, gasification, landfilling, and anaerobic digestion, are evaluated. According to the findings, gasification and landfilling recovered about 1,027.5 and 634.1MWh per day, respectively, and incineration recovered about 1,772MWh per day on average. Anaerobic digestion produced the least amount, at about 345.5 MWh per day. Additionally, the environmental assessment revealed that gasification and incineration only produce about 5,240,042.1 and 10,143,446.5 tons of CO2 per year, respectively, while landfilling produces about 10,143,446.5 tons of emissions annually. Anaerobic digestion produces the least amount emissions, about 3,234,444.5 tons annually. As a result, the perfect scenario for generating energy includes both anaerobic digestion and incineration.

TI Sustainable Municipal Solid Waste Disposal in the Belt and Road
   Initiative: A Preliminary Proposal for Chengdu City
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The Chinese green Belt and Road initiative is promoted. This study takes Chengdu as a key hub under the Belt and Road initiative. The municipal solid waste disposal is the point to control pollution and move toward sustainability. Hence, sustainable municipal solid waste disposal needs to be studied. The prior studies are absent in the planning scenarios analysis. This study proposes a case study to propose three planning scenarios for waste disposal to enhance its sustainability. Scenario 1 represents the current waste disposal mode in Chengdu; Scenario 2 considers all the wastes being incinerated; and Scenario 3 focuses on the incorporation of three disposal methods, i.e., anaerobic digestion, incineration, and landfilling. These three scenarios are assessed based on their greenhouse gas emissions, costs, and public acceptance, to determine the optimality for future managerial practice. Results indicated that Scenario 3 has the highest overall efficiency, yet is challenging in terms of economic feasibility. The limitations of the study are also discussed.

TI Integrated Waste Management: Adding Value to Oil and Gas Industry
   Residues Through Co-processing
SO WASTE AND BIOMASS VALORIZATION
AB In developing countries, the sustainable management of materials into a circular economy framework is conditioned by several constraints, being economic limitations one of the most relevant. Integrated waste management could effectively aid in overcoming them. This work presents an exhaustive analysis from both economic and environmental points of view addressing the selection and design of treatment alternatives for the integrated management of urban and industrial wastes. We propose a mixed-integer mathematical programming formulation to determine the optimal set of treatments to convert wastes into energy, marketable products or innocuous materials, and we endorse the environmental performance through a life cycle analysis. In our case study, urban wastes include sewage sludge and municipal solid waste, while industrial wastes come from two sources: drill cuttings (an important oil and gas industry residue) and seasonal pomace waste from fruit processing. Treatment alternatives comprise anaerobic digestion, composting, recycling, bioremediation, compost amendment, thermal desorption and final disposal in landfill. Results for different scenarios show that even though the most profitable alternative is to dispose drill cuttings in landfills while processing organic wastes by anaerobic digestion, integrated management using biological treatment alternatives provides a more sustainable and still profitable strategy. We also demonstrate that the process integration increases the profitability and reduces the environmental impact significantly when compared with separate treatment alternatives for waste streams.

TI An integrated approach of composting methodologies for solid waste
   management
SO GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM
AB Organic fraction of solid waste, which upon degradation produces foul smell and generates pathogens, if not properly managed. Composting is not a method of waste disposal but it is a method of waste recycling and used for agricultural purposes. An integrated approach of composting methodology was tested for municipal solid waste management. Solid waste first was composted and after 22 days, was further processed by vermicomposting. Samples were routinely taken for analysis of carbon, nitrogen, moisture content, pH and temperature to determine the quality of composting. Decrease in moisture content to 32.1 %, relative decrease in carbon and nitrogen content were also observed. Among the different types of treatment, municipal solid waste + activated sludge integration showed promising results, followed by vermicomposting municipal solid waste + activated sludge combination, compared to the combinations of dried activated sludge, municipal solid waste + activated sludge semisolid and municipal solid waste + sewage water. Thus, windrow composting followed by vermicomposting gave a better result than other methods. Thus this method would serve as a potential alternative for solid waste management.

TI Public opinion about the source separation of municipal solid waste in
   Shanghai, China
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB For decades the generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) in Shanghai has been increasing. Despite the long-time efforts aimed at MSW management (MSWM), the disposal of MSW achieves poor performance. Thus, a MSW minimisation plan for Shanghai was proposed in December 2010. In this study, direct face-to-face interviews and a structured questionnaire survey were used in four different Shanghai community types. We conducted an econometric analysis of the social factors that influence the willingness to pay for MSW separation and discussed the household waste characteristics, the daily waste generation and the current treatment of kitchen wastes. The results suggested that the respondents are environmentally aware of separation, but only practise minimal separation. Negative neighbour effects, confused classification of MSW, and mixed transportation and disposal are the dominant limitations of MSW source-separated collection. Most respondents are willing to pay for MSWM. Public support is influenced by household population, income and cost. The attitudes and behaviours of citizens are important for reducing the amount of MSW disposal by 50% per capita by 2020 (relative to 2010). Concerted efforts should be taken to enlarge pilot areas. In addition, the source separation of kitchen wastes should be promoted.

TI Comparative evaluation on municipal sewage sludge utilization processes
   for sustainable management in Tibet
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB In recent years, a sharp increase in the amount of municipal sewage sludge (MSS) in Tibet has posed serious threats to the fragile ecological environment. Tibetan sludge, with a high content of volatile and low heavy metals, has re-utilization advantages, and thus, the selection of appropriate utilization processes for Tibetan MSS is of great importance. In this study, not only the processes themselves, but also other factors including legislations and environmental pollution were investigated. This study introduced the current waste management legislation situation (especially for MSS) in China and Tibet, China. Moreover, a series of SWOT (strength & weakness and opportunity & threats) analyses were conducted to compare anaerobic digestion (AD), incineration, pyrolysis (PY), gasification, and anaerobic digestion coupled with pyrolysis. The results showed that anaerobic digestion coupled with pyrolysis was the optimal treatment option, because anaerobic digestion was suitable for the low oxygen content in Tibet. Although only 50-60% of the organic matter in MSS could be degraded by anaerobic digestion, the residual organic matter (energy) could be further decomposed by pyrolysis, converting it into pyrolytic gas, bio-oil, and biochar, as valuable products. Sludge digestate pyrolysis could reduce environmental risks, save energy, recover materials, and produce high value-added materials. Moreover, it provides a "zero waste" solution for sludge disposal and promotes a "Circular Economy." The challenges and obstacles of MSS anaerobic digestion coupledwith pyrolysis in Tibet were also investigated. This study provides an important technical reference for the comprehensive utilization of Tibetan MSS. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Decision makers for waste management are confronted with the problem of selecting the most economic, environmental, and socially acceptable waste treatment process. This paper elucidates evaluation methods for waste treatment processes for the comparison of ecological and economic aspects such as material flow analysis, statistical entropy analysis, energetic and exergetic assessment, cumulative energy demand, and life cycle assessment. The work is based on the VDI guideline 3925. A comparison of two thermal waste treatment plants with different process designs and energy recovery systems was performed with the described evaluation methods. The results are mainly influenced by the type of energy recovery, where the waste-to-energy plant providing district heat and process steam emerged to be beneficial in most aspects. Material recovery options from waste incineration were evaluated according to sustainability targets, such as saving of resources and environmental protection.

TI Application of life cycle assessment for municipal solid waste
   management options in Hohhot, People's Republic of China
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB With increasing population and urbanization levels in the People's Republic of China, environmental problems related to the management of municipal solid waste (MSW) are inevitable. This study aimed to determine the environmental impact of the current MSW management system in Hohhot City and to establish an optimum future strategy for it by applying life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. Four scenarios were compared using the CML-IA impact characterization method, which took into account their potential contribution to global warming, ozone depletion, human toxicity, photochemical ozone creation, acidification, and eutrophication potentials. The system boundaries included the collection and recycling, transfer and transportation of MSW, and its disposal by incineration, landfilling, and carbon dioxide (CO2) capture methods. The results showed that the scenario involving landfill and incineration in a ratio of 1:5 was the optimal waste management option; however, increasing the proportion of waste incinerated led to a significant increase in global warming potential. Additional technologies are thus required to overcome this problem, and it was found that the use of CO(2)capture technology resulted in a 30% reduction in the total environmental impact potential. This study's results indicate that LCA is a valuable and practical tool to support decision-making that can be used to suggest problematic areas in current waste management strategies and to determine an optimal alternative to the solid waste management option.

AB The management of orange peel waste constitutes an economic and environmental problem in regions in which there are important citrus processing industries, as is the case of southern Italy. Traditional handling techniques are either not economically attractive (e.g. composting and animal feeding) or discouraged by European policy (landfilling). As an alternative to these technologies, others aimed at recovering energy and resources are currently receiving increasing attention. The consequential life cycle assessment adopted in this work compares the environmental performance of ten orange peel waste management scenarios. These include mono-treatment scenarios (pyrolysis, incineration, and anaerobic mono-digestion) and co-treatment (four anaerobic co-digestion strategies with animal manure and seaweed) ones aimed at energy/resource recovery, which were compared with three "traditional non-energy focused handling techniques (landfilling, composting and animal feeding). Overall, the co-digestion scenarios appear to be the best, in terms of global warming and resource depletion mitigation. However, they also suffer from a drawback, that is, a potential eutrophication impact, due to nitrate leaching following on-land digestate use. Orange peel waste use for animal feeding, while appearing interesting from an environmental perspective (for example to reduce meal imports), presents practical challenges as far as the nutritional aspects and costs are concerned, and these eventually hinder its market potential. A preliminary cost flow analysis has concluded that anaerobic digestion strategies are economically preferable to the other alternatives.

TI Production of Methane and Hydrogen from Biomass through Conventional and
   High-Rate Anaerobic Digestion Processes
SO CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Anaerobic digestion processes have often been applied for biological stabilization of solid and liquid wastes. These processes generate energy in the form of biogas. Recently, high-rate methane and hydrogen fermentation from renewable biomass has drawn much attention due to current environmental problems, particularly related to global warming. Therefore, laboratory-scale research on this topic has significantly accelerated. The primary aim of this review paper is to summarize the most recent research activities covering production of methane and hydrogen via both conventional single and high-rate two-phase anaerobic digestion processes of natural sources of biomass.

CL Stockholm, SWEDEN
AB Solid Waste production is a problem it has intensified over the years. The environment protection, that pollution and sanitation availability is a civil right, according to Federal Constitution, so the government must be responsible for environmental control practices. The Solid Waste National Plan is a document drawn up from the Solid Waste National Policy that strengthens the principles of integrated and sustainable waste management, it proposes measures to promote the collection, treatment and disposal of solid waste. This study presents an overview of Municipal Solid Waste of Santo Andre in Brazil, in order to characterize the organic fraction using the chemical composition to evaluate the possibility of energy recovery treatment by biochemical process of anaerobic digestion. To this end, it was determined the chemical characteristics of the organic fraction of MSW disposed in the Municipal Landfill of Santo Andre such as lipids and protein composition. It was studied the household and commercial waste sources, the CRAISA (Regional Integrated Supply Company of St. Andrew) and fairs. Some results were compared and interrelated. Average values form: The 5.43% lipid content +/- 0.51% for the routes of wet waste, 2.31% +/- 0.44% for CRAISA and 3.24% +/- 0.23% for for open-market; the protein content was 12.23% +/- 2.10% for the routes of wet waste, 8.75% +/- 0.44% for CRAISA and 9.69% +/- 1.17% for open-market, standing therefore in the excellent results for the process of anaerobic digestion occurs.

TI Prioritization of Waste-to-Energy Technologies Associated with the
   Utilization of Food Waste
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Taking advantage of the growing production of organic waste for its conversion to waste-to-energy (WtE) also contributes to mitigating the problems associated with its final disposal, which is a global trend of increasing application. This work presents an innovative approach for the identification and prioritization of WtE alternatives available from the use of food waste (FW) present in the municipal solid waste (MSW) of a Colombian municipality with source separation and selective collection: (i) a systematic literature review, which allows one to identify WtE alternatives; (ii) the prospective MIC-MAC method (Matrice d'Impacts Croises Multiplication Appliques a un Classement) allowed the selection of criteria and sub criteria; (iii) the analytical hierarchical process (AHP) and the technique of order of preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS), allowed a ranking of selected alternatives considering the technical, environmental, and social aspects. The WtE technologies identified were anaerobic digestion, gasification, incineration, biogas recovery from landfills, and pyrolysis; this last was excluded due to its greater application potential with substrates such as plastic waste. The six sub-criteria identified and prioritized were social acceptability (36%), greenhouse gas emissions mitigated (16.17%), MSW reduction (15.83%), energy production (13.80%), technological maturity (12.95%), and electrical energy conversion efficiency (5.25%), with the decreasing order of preferences of anaerobic digestion (78.2%), gasification (47.5%), incineration (27.4%), and biogas recovery from landfills (6.6%); the latter was the least desirable alternative (lower social acceptance and CO2 tons mitigated in relation to the other options). The innovative nature of this study is the identification and consideration of the comprehensive management of this type of waste of a large number of criteria (120 environmental, 52 social, and 59 technical) and the validation of the results through a sensitivity analysis, which allowed us to confirm for this study, that anaerobic digestion is the most favorable technology for the treatment and energy use of FW.

TI Sustainability of using composting and vermicomposting technologies for
   organic solid waste biotransformation: recent overview, greenhouse gases
   emissions and economic analysis
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Organic solid waste poses a serious threat to the environment as the world struggles to keep up with its rapid generation. Biological waste treatment technologies such as composting and vermicomposting are widely regarded as a clean and sustainable method to manage organic waste. The focus of this review is to evaluate the feasibility of composting and vermicomposting as a means to recover nutrients from the organic waste and returning them to the environment. The environmental impact and economic potential of these processes are also discussed. This review shows that composting and vermicomposting are capable of degrading various types of organic waste, thus enabling them to be adopted widely. The present review also reveals that greenhouse gases are emitted during composting and vermicomposting processes. However, introductions of intermittent aeration, bulking agents and earthworm abundance may reduce the greenhouse gases emissions. Economic assessments of composting and vermicomposting technologies show that these technologies are generally viable except in some cases. The differences are due to the wide range in market value for organic fertilizer and differences in cost for the type of composing or vermicomposting system which could affect its economic feasibility. However, if organic fertilizer value increases and carbon offsets are available for nutrient recycling, it will affect the economic feasibility in a positive way. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Recycling of Faecal Sludge: Nitrogen, Carbon and Organic Matter
   Transformation during Co-Composting of Faecal Sludge with Different
   Bulking Agents
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB This study investigated the effect of locally available bulking agents on the faecal sludge (FS) composting process and quality of the final FS compost. Dewatered FS was mixed with sawdust, coffee husk and brewery waste, and composted on a pilot scale. The evolution of physical and chemical characteristics of the composting materials was monitored weekly. Results indicate that bulking agents have a statistically significant effect (p < 0.0001) on the evolution of composting temperatures, pH, electrical conductivity, nitrogen forms, organic matter mineralisation, total organic carbon, maturity indices, quality of the final compost and composting periods during FS composting. Our results suggest reliable maturity indices for mature and stable FS compost. From the resource recovery perspective, this study suggests sawdust as a suitable bulking agent for co-composting with FS-as it significantly reduced the organic matter losses and nitrogen losses (to 2.2%), and improved the plant growth index, thus improving the agronomic values of the final compost as a soil conditioner. FS co-composting can be considered a sustainable and decentralised treatment option for FS and other organic wastes in the rural and peri-urban communities, especially, where there is a strong practice of reusing organic waste in agriculture.

SO ENGENHARIA SANITARIA E AMBIENTAL
AB This study of the participation of different stakeholders through structured techniques to support decision making in building future alternatives or scenarios for the collection and treatment of municipal solid waste was applied to the city of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Using the life cycle assessment tool, eight different scenarios, constructed with the participation of social stakeholders and municipal technicians, were evaluated. Different collection alternatives (selective and containerized) and treatment (recycling, composting, anaerobic digestion, thermal processes and landfill disposal) were considered. We conclude that the application of the life cycle assessment tool facilitates decision-making support systems in municipal solid waste management. In our case study, the most sustainable scenario was built by municipal waste management stakeholders.

TI Getting to the bottom of food waste: identifying obstacles to effective
   circular economy practices in a Thai semi-urban context
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB In 2016, Thailand has instituted a national master plan to gradually improve the management of all types of solid waste, calling upon the cooperation of diverse stakeholders, including civil society. Although the share of reused or recycled municipal solid waste (MSW) in Thailand has been increasing over the past years, 65% of MSW still ends up in landfills or is burnt or dumped outside the municipal waste management system according to data from 2018. Most of this waste is organic waste: Whereas private stakeholders ensure that waste such as plastics and glass is being recycled, food waste lacks similar opportunities for circularity. This paper aims to identify reasons for this discrepancy, as well as the obstacles to realizing zero waste potentials for food waste by (1) understanding existing circular economy practices, and (2) stakeholder motivations behind these practices. Building on data from 404 households in a municipality north of Bangkok, this paper aims to present corresponding insights as a basis for the identification of possible avenues to increase food waste circularity. Accordingly, this paper will offer recommendations to increase the effectiveness of food waste recovery, namely arguing for a stronger focus on household-level waste reduction strategies.

TI Waste to Energy: Biogas from Municipal Solid Waste for Power Generation
SO TRANSLATING THE PARIS AGREEMENT INTO ACTION IN THE PACIFIC
SE Advances in Global Change Research
AB Anaerobic Digestion (AD) of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) produces biogas which could be utlilized to produce energy, reducing waste which otherwise would have been landfilled. For the Pacific Island Countries (PICs), the use of incineration and anaerobic digestion is more viable due to the lower capital costs, complexity, operational costs and higher efficiencies compared to pyrolysis, gasification, plasma arc and other waste to energy technologies. However, the use of either technology for energy production would require further financial, social, technical and environmental analysis. The use of Waste to Energy (WtE) technologies for the production of energy helps greatly in achieving our Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) goals in accordance with the Paris Agreement, which aims to reduce carbon emissions via sustainable biomass plantations and Waste to Energy by 212 ktCO(2)/year. This chapter discusses the viability of electricity generation from biogas produced from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste disposed at the Vunato Disposal Site (VDS) in Fiji. The information and data gathered in this study will be useful in the implementation of waste to energy projects for electricity generation as a means of curbing our greenhouse gas emissions. The findings indicate that through the implementation of WtE technology at the Vunato Disposal Site, 258 kW (241 kWh/ton of MSW) and 1008 kW (637 kWh/ton of MSW) of power (electricity) could be produced respectively from AD and incineration of OFMSW and 825 kW (521 kWh/ton of MSW) from a combination of AD and incineration technologies. This would contribute towards carbon emission reduction of approximately 0.59 Gg, 2.29 Gg and 1.88 Gg annually from AD, incineration and combination of both the technologies respectively. However, for the implementation of WtE power plants certain barriers and challenges needs to be addressed and institutional frameworks needs to be put in place for the success of the WtE.

TI Wet organic waste treatment via hydrothermal processing: A critical
   review
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB There are several recent reviews published in the literature on hydrothermal carbonization, liquefaction and supercritical water gasification of lignocellulosic biomass and algae. The potential of hydrochar, bio-oil or synthesis gas production and applications have also been reviewed individually. The comprehensive review on the hydrothermal treatment of wet wastes (such as municipal solid waste, food waste, sewage sludge, algae) covering carbonization, liquefaction and supercritical water gasification, however, is missing in the literature which formed the basis of the current review paper. The current paper critically reviews the literature around the full spectrum of hydrothermal treatment for wet wastes and establishes a good comparison of the different hydrothermal treatment options for managing wet waste streams. Also, the role of catalysts as well as synthesis of catalysts using hydrothermal treatment of biomass has been critically reviewed. For the first time, efforts have also been made to summarize findings on modelling works as well as techno-economic assessments in the area of hydrothermal treatments of wet wastes. The study concludes with key findings, knowledge gaps and future recommendations to improve the productivity of hydrothermal treatment of wet wastes, helping improve the commercial viability and environmental sustainability.

TI Waste into energy conversion technologies and conversion of food wastes
   into the potential products: a review
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AMBIENT ENERGY
AB One third of the food produced globally for human consumption is either lost or wasted every year. These food wastes, if not handled with care, lead to public health problems and environmental pollution. Therefore, converting food wastes into energy or products not only generate revenue gains but also solve waste disposal problems thus helping for environmental sustainability. Though food waste has a high potential of energy recovery, there is not much work done on the conversion of food waste into useful products. In this review article, various conversion technologies such as composting, fermentation, incineration, pyrolysis, gasification and hydrothermal carbonisation, are discussed. The article also provides a comprehensive discussion of primary useful products, which are categorised into solid, liquid and gaseous. The advantages, limitations and potential applications are evaluated. In addition, the future perspectives are presented to maximise the utilisation of food waste as an effective source of bioenergy production.

TI An emergy-LCA analysis of municipal solid waste management
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Waste management is a specific practice aimed at reducing the effects of waste materials on the environment and increasing material and energy recovery. The Beijing Municipal Solid Waste Collection and Treatment System has been slow to adopt new technologies capable to enable better treatment results. The aim of the present ecological-economic evaluation of different treatment technologies is to achieve the maximum practical benefits from investments and to ensure the minimum environmental impacts of waste flows based on variable source-separated collection and transportation rates. This paper compared four garbage treatment systems, including separate collection and transportation, sanitary landfills systems, fluidized bed incineration system, and the composting system in Beijing. Results show that as far as the Source Separation Rate (SSR) increased, the yield of recycled materials and sorted waste also rose. High SSR and Separated Transportation Rate (STR) could make recycling more beneficial: however, if more than one approach is applied, it is possible to organize the different steps in a way that minimizes costs and losses. Ajoint emergy-LCA method is applied in this study to assess the environmental impact of input and output flows and suggest process improvement. The integration offers a way to quantitatively and qualitatively assess costs and benefits, for aware and sound MSW management. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Co-combustion behavior of municipal solid waste and food waste anaerobic
   digestates: Combustion performance, kinetics, optimization, and gaseous
   products
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB With the rapid development of food waste anaerobic digestion, the safe treatment of its digestates (FWD) is an urgent mission. Co-combustion of FWD with municipal solid waste (MSW) provided a cleaner and sustainable solution. In this study, the co-combustion behavior of FWD and MSW was investigated by thermogravimetric and Fourier transform infrared (TG-FTIR) analysis. Co-combustion with MSW improved the combustion performance of FWD. Compared to calculative value, experimental CCI were maximally improved at M9F1, with growth of 32.9%. Besides, the combustion indexes were exponentially enhanced as the heating rate increased. CCI of MSW and FWD increased by 7.97 times and 7.33 times as heating rate rose from 10 K/min to 40 K/min. Kinetic analysis showed that the average apparent energy for FWD and MSW were 141.3 and 159.1 kJ/mol, respectively. The lowest average apparent energy was obtained at M1F9 with 135.5 kJ/mol. According to the established model, optimal operating condition was achieved at 540.4 degrees C, 40 K/min and MSW proportion of 0.95. FTIR results showed that total gas emissions of CO2, CO, NO, HCN and HCl from MSW were greater than FWD. High proportion of FWD was beneficial to reduce the emissions of gaseous pollutants. The experimental emissions of NO and HCl were decreased by 20.8% (M3F7) and 18.6% (M7F3).

TI Spatial-temporal variations and forecasting analysis of municipal solid
   waste in the mountainous city of north-western Himalayas
SO SN APPLIED SCIENCES
AB Municipal solid waste management is a growing problem faced by several municipalities and has become a global issue, particularly in mountainous cities of developing countries. This study focuses on the existing pattern of municipal solid waste management (MSWM) and challenges in the mountainous city of Srinagar, Kashmir, India. The study aims at analysing the municipal solid waste composition, spatio-temporal variations of municipal solid waste generated and its management by using ArcGIS mapping software. The annual results of MSW composition revealed high organic waste (53.40%), followed by recyclable (16.79%) and inert waste (23.40%), respectively. Further, the ANOVA statistical analysis in SPSS software was utilized to evaluate the seasonal variations between two seasons (i.e. winter and summer). The results showed a significance between the type of MSW and the season in which MSW was generated (p = 0.001). Further, the GIS-based spatial maps were generated, viz. ward-wise location, population density, municipal solid waste generation, wastebin density and spatial distribution of open waste points with illegal dumpsites. The spatial map findings showed high- density of MSW generation between (30.04 and 35.65) Mt day(-1) in administrative wards of (4, 6, 7, 16, 20, 21, 22 and 23), due to high population density. Furthermore, the forecast trend of MSW generation between 2020 and 2030 was evaluated in Minitab software. Based on forecasted findings, a total of 216,82,10 Mt MS will be generated during the next decade (i.e. 2020-2030). This high- quantity trend of MSW generation indicates that extra pressure will be on the existing MSW system. However, the problems of MSW management can be mitigated by implementing the integrated waste management plan.

AB The objective of this study is to illustrate and schematize the application of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to the evaluation of different conventional and current urban sludge treatment techniques. This contribution encompasses and analyzes more than 45 articles, based on the quantification of the environmental impact of wastewater treatment plant sludge disposal processes and pathways. As a whole, the methodological hypotheses reflect the steps undertaken to carry out the life cycle analysis approach. As for the technical hypotheses, they clarify and examine each sludge treatment process including: incineration, pyrolysis, wet oxidation, anaerobic digestion, composting, agricultural land application, landfill and urban sludge recovery. It is of great interest to introduce effective substitution in the sludge treatment process for energy recovery. The combination of anaerobic digestion with other disposal routes leads to conclusive results. The authors confirm that thermal treatment pathways are of paramount importance. They significantly reduce the volume of sludge, while allowing the recovery of energy and materials including fluidized bed incineration and pyrolysis. This article allows the selection of the most relevant and cost-effective sludge treatment alternatives and scenarios, as it establish an information base for any appropriate future assessment, as part of the development of sustainable and promising sludge management.

TI A review on organic waste to energy systems in India
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB Waste generation is increasing day-by-day with the growth of population which directly affects the environment and economy. Organic municipal solid waste (MSW) and agriculture sectors contribute towards maximum waste generation in India. Thus, management of organic waste is very much essential with the increasing demand for energy. The present paper mainly focusses on reviewing waste to energy (WtE) potentials, its technologies, and the associated challenges. Different substrates are utilized through various technological options in India. Organic waste has good potential to attain sustainable energy yields with and without affecting the environment. A realistic scenario of WtE technologies and their challenges in line with the existing Indian condition is presented in this paper.

TI Energy, environmental, resource recovery, and economic dimensions of
   municipal solid waste management paths in Mexico city
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Growing municipal solid waste (MSW) generation is a source of environmental, economic, and social concerns, especially in developing world megacities where poor MSW practices prevail. Mexico City (CDMX), one of the world's largest megacities, daily produces similar to 13,073 Mg of MSW whose management poses a tremendous challenge to local authorities and calls for additional research to conceive sound MSW strategies. This study evaluates the fossil energy use, GHG emissions, resource recovery, and economic cost dimensions of current and five alternative MSW paths in CDMX to compare their performance and identify more sustainable MSW practices for the megacity. Impacts and benefits from the MSW paths were modeled using 2018 MSW generation data, information supplied by local authorities, and literature values. Current MSW path consumes similar to 387 MJ(fossil), generates similar to 501 kg-CO(2)e, and costs similar to 57 USD2018 per Mg of MSW managed while it only valorizes < 33% of total MSW mostly via informal truck-picking. The alternative MSW paths considerably reduce GHG emissions (similar to 129-360 kg-CO(2)e/Mg) and enhance MSW valorization (similar to 47-88%) though, they entail higher fossil energy consumption (447-582 MJ(fossil)/Mg) and, in general, higher cost expenditures (43-208 USD2018/Mg). Heavy reliance on landfilling, large GHG emissions, and low MSW valorization make current MSW path in CDMX unsustainable. Incineration-based MSW paths perform better in most aspects evaluated but their high costs seem prohibitive. Results suggest MSW paths featuring open windrow composting, mechanical-biological pretreatment, material recovery facilities, and refuse-derived fuel production may be more appropriate to improve the sustainability of CDMX MSW management.

TI Beyond land application: Emerging technologies for the treatment and
   reuse of anaerobically digested agricultural and food waste
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Effective treatment and reuse of the massive quantities of agricultural and food wastes generated daily has the potential to improve the sustainability of food production systems. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is used throughout the world as a waste treatment process to convert organic waste into two main products: biogas and nutrient-rich digestate, called AD effluent. Biogas can be used as a source of renewable energy or transportation fuels, while AD effluent is traditionally applied to land as a soil amendment. However, there are economic and environmental concerns that limit widespread land application, which may lead to underutilization of AD for the treatment of agricultural and food wastes. To combat these constraints, existing and novel methods have emerged to treat or reuse AD effluent. The objective of this review is to analyze several emerging methods used for efficient treatment and reuse of AD effluent. Overall, the application of emerging technologies is limited by AD effluent composition, especially the total solid content. Some technologies, such as composting, use the solid fraction of AD effluent, while most other technologies, such as algae culture and struvite crystallization, use the liquid fraction. Therefore, dewatering of AD effluent, reuse of the liquid and solid fractions, and land application could all be combined to sustainably manage the large quantities of AD effluent produced. Issues such as pathogen regrowth and prevalence of emerging organic micro-pollutants are also discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Anaerobic digestion potential of urban organic waste: a case study in
   Malmo
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB A study of existing organic waste types in Malmo, Sweden was performed. The purpose was to gather information about organic waste types in the city to be able to estimate the potential for anaerobic treatment in existing digesters at the wastewater treatment plan (WWTP). The urban organic waste types that could have a significant potential for anaerobic digestion amount to about 50 000 tonnes year(-1) (sludge excluded). Some of the waste types were further evaluated by methane potential tests and continuous pilot-scale digestion. Single -substrate digestion and co-digestion of pre-treated, source-sorted organic fraction of municipal solid waste, wastewater sludge, sludge from grease traps and fruit and vegetable waste were carried out. The experiments showed that co-digestion of grease sludge and WWTP sludge was a better way of making use of the methane potential in the grease trap sludge than single-substrate digestion. Another way of increasing the methane production in sludge digesters is to add source-sorted organic fraction of municipal solid waste (SSOFMSW). Adding SSOFMSW (20% of the total volatile solids) gave a 10-15% higher yield than could be expected by comparison with separate digestion of sludge respective SSOFMSW Co-digestion of sludge and organic waste is beneficial not just for increasing gas production but also for stabilizing the digestion process. This was seen when co-digesting fruit and vegetable waste and sludge. When co-digested with sludge, this waste gave a better result than the separate digestion of fruit and vegetable waste. Considering single-substrate digestion, SSOFMSW is the only waste in the study which makes up a sufficient quantity to be suitable as the base substrate in a full-scale digester that is separated from the sludge digestion. The two types of SSOFMSW tested in the pilot-scale digestion were operated successfully at mesophilic temperature. By adding SSOFMSW, grease trap sludge and fruit and vegetables waste to sludge digesters at the wastewater treatment plant, the yearly energy production from methane could be expected to increase from 24 to 43 GWh.

AB Waste destruction through incineration has widely become an acceptable and popular choice globally. Despite being regarded as a sustainable option, if not operated and managed properly, it can be one of the least environmentally preferred options. It is agreed that the waste from municipal solid waste (MSW) can be considered a renewable energy resource due to its potential of being converted from "waste" into useful products and energy. This review for the first time incorporates both municipal solid waste bottom ash (MSW-BA) and municipal solid waste fly ash (MSW-FA); and discusses their physicochemical characterizations, leaching mechanisms, and pre-treatment methods. Additionally, it incorporates, discusses, and critically reviews the recent advances and applications of MSW-BA and MSW-FA, and explore the potential of utilizing ashes as a sustainable option by conserving natural resources.

AB Anaerobic digestion (AD) from organic waste has gained worldwide attention in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, lowering fossil fuel combustion, and facilitating a sustainable renewable energy supply. Biogas mainly consists of methane (CH4) (50-75%), carbon dioxide (CO2) (25-50%), hydrogen sulphides (H2S), hydrogen (H-2), ammonia (NH3) (1-2%) and traces of other gases such as oxygen (O-2) and nitrogen (N-2). Methane can replace fossil fuels in various applications such as heat and power generation and the transportation sector. The degradation of organic waste through an AD process offers many advantages, such as the decrease of pathogens and prevention of odour release. The digestate from anaerobic fermentation is a valuable fertilizer, however, the amount of organic materials currently available for biogas production is still limited. New substrates, as well as more effective conversion technologies, are needed to grow this industry globally. This paper reviewed the latest trends and progress in biogas production technologies including potential feedstock. Recycling of waste has recently become an important topic and has been explored in this paper.

TI Techno-economic and life cycle assessment of an integrated hydrothermal
   carbonization system for sewage sludge
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The need of more effective solutions for sewage sludge management is twofold: i) to alleviate the overall operating costs for wastewater treatment and ii) to ensure proper utilization/disposal considering environmental legislation. A comprehensive solution integrating hydrothermal carbonization and anaerobic digestion to treat sewage sludge was analyzed and compared with that of standalone anaerobic digestion. In order to evaluate its performance, a process simulation model in Aspen Plus (R) served as the main data source of the required input-output inventories to perform both techno-economic and life cycle assessment, which follow conventional methodological standards. It was observed that the integrated strategy generally reduces the environmental impacts compared to the standalone configuration due to the recovery of a hydrochar that could replace fossil fuels. In contrast, the standalone option only recovers a digestate that can generate even a higher impact than its counterfactual alternative. The integration of hydrothermal treatments showed an increase of 14% in the gross energy efficiency of the anaerobic digestion. However, economic concerns make the approach to require further optimization, since the estimated cost for the HTC option were 42% higher in comparison to the conventional anaerobic digestion alternative. Although there is a changing regulatory framework around sewage sludge, especially on nutrient recovery, hydrothermal treatments have been proven as a potentially sustainable route for sewage sludge treatment.

TI Modeling the carbon cycle of the municipal solid waste management system
   for urban metabolism
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB Municipal solid waste management is one of the key subsystems of urban metabolism, which significantly impacts urban carbon cycles. A conceptual model for analyzing the carbon cycle of the municipal solid waste management system was established based on the theory of urban metabolism with regard to urban carbon cycling. The model includes horizontal fluxes, vertical fluxes and carbon stocks of the waste managing processes such as waste collection, transportation, treatment and disposal. The current carbon cycling of the municipal solid waste management system and two other scenarios were analyzed using a jingmen City case study. The results indicate that the input horizontal flux in municipal solid waste between 1989 and 2004 was 293.47 Gg. Among all of the considered scenarios, the landfill formed the largest carbon stocks; incineration showed the largest vertical fluxes of carbon dioxide, and source separation and integrated technologies decreased carbon emissions by adding new carbon sources to the urban system. Improving municipal solid waste management using techniques, such as waste minimization, source separation, recycling, technical innovations of incineration, compost and digestion of organic waste, landfill mining, etc., could impact the urban carbon cycle by reducing carbon emissions.

TI A life cycle analysis-based comprehensive study on municipal solid waste
   management: a case study of Central India
SO ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB Municipal solid waste management (MSWM) is an exigent and emerging problem in India. Despite various MSWM options, landfill continues to be the ultimate disposal destination of solid waste leading to ecosystem damage and leachate generation. The appropriate MSWM options and landfill leachate treatment become a matter of great apprehension to avoid negative impacts on the surrounding environment. In the present study, three LCA-based potential scenarios of systematic solid waste management, including anaerobic digestion, composting and landfilling, were analyzed and compared. The life cycle assessment (LCA) model was created in the Gabi 17.00 software for analyzing the impact of every steps involved in the MSWM system. Further, the study also focuses on leachate management of the Bhandewadi landfill site, situated in Nagpur City, India, using five different types of adsorbents, viz. rice husk, granular activated charcoal, powdered activated charcoal, compost and fly ash. Among the different scenario's analyzed and various impact categories studied, the LCA of all the three scenarios highlights that the global warming potential and human toxicity potential of scenario one is comparatively lower than other scenarios. Further, the adsorbents used in the study have potential for the removal of containments. The diffusion profile analysis of leachate through different types of adsorbents used revealed that the chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency enhances with thickness of the adsorbent. The study emphasized that it is crucial for decision-makers associated with waste management sector to focus on environment friendly MSWM approaches. It is also recommended that the decision and policymakers adhere and follow the stringent implementation of laws and regulations associated to the MSWM system.

SO PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF TROPICAL AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
AB Food waste (FW) has always been a significant issue faced by almost all countries worldwide. The rise in FW does not only influence one's food supply, yet the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission such as methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) gas leads to global warming and health issues. This paper reviews the primary FW treatments available in all countries. Most advanced countries have accomplished that the least cost and most efficient FW treatment is composting. Among all the composting methods available, vermicomposting (VC) that uses redworms (Eisenia fetida) produces nutrients rich bio-compost, as proven in the existing literature. Furthermore, bio-compost produced by the VC method nourishes plant growth. In this study, the primary research data sources are 78 scientific articles over the last few years. This research is the consensus on VC as the FW treatment. Besides, briefly discuss the FW pretreatment methods, the effect of bio-compost on soil properties, and their corresponding effects on the growth of Abelmoschus esculentus L.

AB Correct waste management is one of the main aspects of an environmental policy. According to European guidelines, the reduction of present levels of waste generation and the increase in the recovery of energy and materials are important future requirements for an environmentally sound waste management. Recent policy developments have led to a growth of source separation and composting in Italy. The goal of this contribution is to analyze the suitability of composting as a valid option to recover materials from waste. We performed an emergy analysis of a composting process in order to assess all investments necessary to manage the life cycle of compost. Results showed that the phase with the highest investment is the collection of vegetable refuses, while the cost of plant management, calculated in emergy units, is not particularly high. Finally, we compared composting to incineration and landfilling and demonstrated that composting is a sustainable choice for waste disposal.

TI A quantitative analysis of municipal solid waste disposal charges in
   China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB Rapid industrialization and economic development have caused a tremendous increase in municipal solid waste (MSW) generation in China. China began implementing a policy of MSW disposal fees for household waste management at the end of last century. Three charging methods were implemented throughout the country: a fixed disposal fee, a potable water-based disposal fee, and a plastic bag-based disposal fee. To date, there has been little qualitative or quantitative analysis on the effectiveness of this relatively new policy. This paper provides a general overview of MSW fee policy in China, attempts to verify whether the policy is successful in reducing general waste collected, and proposes an improved charging system to address current problems. The paper presents an empirical statistical analysis of policy effectiveness derived from an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) test on panel data of China. EKC tests on different kinds of MSW charge systems were then examined for individual provinces or cities. A comparison of existing charging systems was conducted using environmental and economic criteria. The results indicate the following: (1) the MSW policies implemented over the study period were effective in the reduction of waste generation, (2) the household waste discharge fee policy did not act as a strong driver in terms of waste prevention and reduction, and (3) the plastic bag-based disposal fee appeared to be performing well according to qualitative and quantitative analysis. Based on current situation of waste discharging management in China, a three-stage transitional charging scheme is proposed and both advantages and drawbacks discussed. Evidence suggests that a transition from a fixed disposal fee to a plastic bag-based disposal fee involving various stakeholders should be the next objective of waste reduction efforts.

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Waste management is necessary for environmental and economic sustainability, but it depends upon socioeconomic, political, and environmental factors. More countries are shifting toward recycling as compared to landfilling; thus, different researchers have presented the zero waste concept, considering the importance of sustainability. This review was conducted to provide information about different well established and new/emerging technologies which could be used to recover nutrients from wastes and bring zero waste concepts in practical life. Technologies can be broadly divided into the triangle of nutrient accumulation, extraction, and release. Physicochemical mechanisms, plants, and microorganisms (algae and prokaryotic) could be used to accumulate nutrients. Extraction of nutrient is possible through electrodialysis and crystallization while nutrient release can occur via thermochemical and biochemical treatments. Primary nutrients, i.e., nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, are used globally and are non-renewable. Augmented upsurges in prices of inorganic fertilizers and required discharge restrictions on nutrients have stimulated technological developments. Thus, well-proven technologies, such as biochar, composting, vermicomposting, composting with biochar, pyrolysis, and new emerging technologies (forward osmosis and electro-dialysis) have potential to recover nutrients from wastes. Therefore, reviewing the present and imminent potential of these technologies for adaptation of nutrient recycling from wastes is of great importance. Since waste management is a significant concern all over the globe and technologies, e.g., landfill, combustion, incineration, pyrolysis, and gasification, are available to manage generated wastes, they have adverse impacts on society and on the environment. Thus, climate-friendly technologies, such as composting, biodegradation, and anaerobic decomposition, with the generation of non-biodegradable wastes need to be adopted to ensure a sustainable future environment. Furthermore, environmental impacts of technology could be quantified by life cycle assessment (LCA). Therefore, LCA could be used to evaluate the performance of different environmentally-friendly technologies in waste management and in the designing of future policies. LCA, in combination with other approaches, may prove helpful in the development of strategies and policies for the selection of dynamic products and processes.

AB Purpose Two biological treatments for biodegradable substrates were assessed: (i) conventional co-digestion of source sorted organic fraction of municipal solid waste (SS-OFMSW) and sewage sludge (SS); (ii) preliminary dark-fermentation pre-treatment of the mixture of SS-OFMSW and SS, followed by a second step of anaerobic digestion. The produced biogas and hydrogen-rich gas are assumed to be used in an internal combustion engine to produce electricity and thermal energy. Methods Life Cycle Assessment and Life Cycle Costing were implemented to assess the two biological treatments, which were also compared with the current treatments (separate aerobic composting of SS-OFMSW and anaerobic digestion of SS). The selected functional unit is the total annual amount of entering waste (189,000 t/y of SS-OFMSW and 15,500 t/y of SS) to an actual Italian plant, which was used as case study for this work. Results The Life Cycle Assessment results show that the co-treatments of SS and SS-OFMSW provide general environmental improvements with respect to the reference case study of separate SS anaerobic digestion and SS-OFMSW aerobic composting. The case based on the preliminary dark fermentation of the mixture of SS-OFMSW and SS followed by digestion always shows better indicator values than the co-digestion one. This result is mainly influenced by the higher energy recovery, which, in turn, is due to the improved specific gas production of the digestion step, after the co-fermentation pre-treatment. The Life Cycle Costing shows that both the studied systems are economically sustainable, however the case based on the preliminary dark fermentation of the mixture of SS-OFMSW and SS followed by digestion has a shorter time of return of investment and a higher net present value than the co-digestion one. Conclusions For the considered study case, the preliminary dark-fermentation pre-treatment of the mixture of SS-OFMSW and SS, followed by a second step of anaerobic digestion is preferable to their simple co-digestion process both from the environmental and economic points of view.

SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ACCOUNTING AND MANAGEMENT
AB The challenges of solid waste are increasing every day as the population in the urban areas is increasing at a rapid pace. The challenge of solid waste such as landfilling is a major issue that requires urgent attention as it degrades the environment and causes adverse health hazards. The major legislation frameworks, policies, scientific handling related to municipal solid waste management (MSWM), and its effective implementation are essential to improve the state of MSWM. In this paper, various parameters of MSWM are evaluated along with the review of MSW generation, collection, characterization of solid waste, treatment, and disposal ways practised in Bengaluru. This paper helps in understanding the scenario of solid waste iu Bengaluru, the challenges it faces, and the opportunities it offers. Various issues like public-private partnerships, decentralization, rag-pickers role, local conununities' initiatives, etc. are discussed. The study concludes that it is the need of the hour to understand the various technological solutions that need to be implemented along with establishing recycling plants, bio-digesters, and other solutions that are presented in this paper could help in generating energy and other resources, and improve the scenario of solid waste in the city.

AB Within Europe, more than 300 islands are inhabited by more than 3 % of the total EU population, i.e. 15 million residents live in areas experiencing permanent disadvantages and vulnerabilities, such as shortage of natural resources, economic and demographic stresses that pose additional pressure to environmental problems. Given that, waste management is considered one of the biggest challenges. This paper presents a comprehensive methodology on the development, implementation and evaluation of an integrated municipal solid waste management scheme in line with the Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/EC in selected communities of Tinos island (Greece). For the first time, in Greek insular communities, a holistic separate collection of dry recyclables and biowaste was implemented in order to facilitate recycling and further valorization of high-purity materials. The applied integrated solid waste management scheme proved to be efficient and effective as it led to satisfactory source separation rates of packaging waste, reaching 86.5 % of total packaging waste generated (including mixed paper). Moreover, approximately 15.5 kg cap(-1) year(-1) biowaste was captured and along with other local practices (e.g. use as animal feed), the total diversion rate from landfill reached 37.0 % of biowaste produced. Overall, the pilot scheme (including local practices) diverted from landfilling 34.2 % of the total Municipal Solid Waste generated, accounting for 148.2 kg cap(-1) year(-1). These results provided guidance to develop an up-scaled sustainable, cost-efficient and flexible waste management plan, using alternative scenarios, to cover the needs of the whole island.

TI Global municipal solid waste infrastructure: Delivery and forecast of
   uncontrolled disposal
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Proper management and treatment of municipal solid waste (MSW) plays a central role towards the reduction or elimination of uncontrolled disposal and the achievement of United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with the reduction of its vast adverse environmental and health impacts. Despite that, till now, there has never been a quantitative analysis of the progress in waste management infrastructure delivery worldwide. In this paper, we provide valuable insights regarding the progress in new MSW infrastructure delivery based on a dataset of 1764 projects from 156 countries, for the period 2014-2019. We also estimate the magnitude of uncontrolled waste disposal practices worldwide by estimating the gap between the current MSW infrastructure delivery and actual changes in MSW generation. Our results show that the new capacity delivered during the six years period amounted to 243 million metric tonnes (Mt) (40 million Mt per year), out of which 45% was delivered in high-income countries, 37.5% in the People's Republic of China and 17.5% in the rest of the world, mainly through thermal treatment (similar to 57%) and landfilling (8%). The average allocated per capita budget of these projects during this period is about US$14, equivalent to US$ 2.33 (cap*year)(-1). Our main conclusion is that the share of uncontrolled disposal will continue to rise at least until 2028, reaching almost 730 million Mt per year. Evidently, the global community continues to face a serious challenge towards the implementation of the UN SDG 12, target 12.4 by 2020. The analysis demonstrates that infrastructure delivery must increase by four folds to eliminate uncontrolled disposal practices.

TI A multi-criteria analysis of alternatives for the treatment of municipal
   solid waste in the municipality of Juazeiro do Norte Ceara
SO ENGENHARIA SANITARIA E AMBIENTAL
AB Worldwide, public managers need to plan and implement sustainable alternatives for the management of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) that consider waste treatment plants. However, the selection of waste treatment alternatives is a complex process which must consider different criteria. In this sense, the present article had the objective of analyzing different MSW treatment alternatives for the municipality of Juazeiro do Norte in Ceara, Brazil, through the evaluation of economic, environmental, social, technical, and regulatory criteria. The Multicriteria Decision Making Method AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) was applied, supported by several quantitative techniques of projection and data collected in the field and in secondary sources. The results show that alternatives 1 (decentralized manual sorting center and composting units) and 3 (decentralized manual sorting center and anaerobic digesters) are the most favorable MSW treatment options for Juazeiro do Norte, with a percentage of 25,11 and 24,97%, respectively. The decentralized alternatives 1 and 3 have an advantage over the centralized alternatives 2 (automated sorting center and centralized composting unit), 4 (automated sorting center and centralized biodigester) and 5 (automated sorting center and incinerator) due, mainly, to the greater generation of jobs and technical feasibility. However, sensitivity analyzes enhances that, in an evaluation in which the economic criteria had a weight greater than or equal to 70%, the overall result would change significantly and the centralized alternatives 2 and 4, alternatives with better economic results, would be considered as the best MSW treatment options.

AB In order to evaluate the environmental and economic performance of continuous thermal hydrolysis (CTH) of sludge disposal, we compare the CTH with three traditional technologies including anaerobic digestion, aerobic composting and dry-incineration. This study uses life cycle assessment (LCA) to assess their environmental impact of the above technologies, and selects ten characteristic indicators from e-Balance analysis software for quantification. We also adopt the cost-benefit ratio (B/C) to evaluate the technologies' economic performances, and come to conclusion that the larger the value is, the more economically feasible it will be. The results show that, as a new sludge disposal technology, CTH has the best performance in both environmental and economic aspects, while dry-incineration and anaerobic digestion have the worst results in environmental and economic aspect respectively. Although sludge compost has a moderating effect on global warming, it could also be potentially toxic. Nevertheless, the use of raw materials and energy contributes significantly to the environmental impact of each scheme.

AB Municipal SolidWaste (MSW) management in China has been transitioning from a mixed collection and treatment system to a separated collection and treatment system. The continuous rise of MSW treatment capacity and the optimization of technology structure provided basic facility support for China to promote MSW separation at source. China preferred a four-type separation system. Regulated recycling should be enhanced to improve the efficiency and sustainability of recycling industry. As food waste is the main composition of MSW in China, 20%-30% of the food waste diversion and land application could maximize the comprehensive environmental performance. Incineration is to be the pillar technology in MSW separated treatment system in China.

TI Assessment of waste incineration power with considerations of subsidies

SO ENERGY POLICY
AB Municipal solid waste in China has increased rapidly in recent years with urbanization and economic development. The establishment of affordable, effective and truly sustainable waste management is a key point for the development of urban areas. However, as a renewable energy, the cost-benefit of supporting and the environmental performance for waste incineration power are seldom discussed. This paper discusses the current situation of waste incineration power industry in China and analyzes the required subsidies and emission reductions. The results show that waste incineration power needs relatively less financial support and perform well on emission reduction. Main obstacles to the development of waste incineration have also been investigated from the perspective of government, enterprises and local residents. Lastly, some suggestions are offered on how to tackle these issues. For instance: more regulation on waste classification; to integrate the informal workers into formal municipal waste management system; to communicate more effectively to the public to dispel general misunderstanding; application of the waste heat from cogeneration plants to local heat supply or central heat supply system.

TI The Study of Economic and Environmental Viability of the Treatment of
   Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste Using Monte Carlo Simulation
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Valorization of municipal solid waste (MSW) plays a crucial role in a sustainable society and provides an opportunity to reduce carbon emissions. The economic and social viability of the treatment of the organic fraction of MSW (OFMSW) with a multi-scenario analysis (composting and anaerobic digestion for renewable electricity or for biomethane injection into natural gas networks) was studied using a Monte Carlo simulation. The cost of treating organic fraction of MSW to neutralize financial net present value (NPV) and social NPV through greenhouse gas emissions avoided was determined for each scenario. The costs considered were the investment and the operating and maintenance costs. The financial benefits from the revenue of subproducts depended on the scenario. The lowest average fee to neutralize the financial NPV was 6.38 euro/tonne treated in anaerobic digestion for biomethane injection into natural gas networks, therefore, it was the most financially viable. The average social NPV calculated for biomethane injection into natural gas networks (16.60 euro/tonne) was higher than that obtained for renewable electricity (13.59 euro/tonne). According to the results, anaerobic digestion for biomethane injection into natural gas networks is the most socially and economically viable alternative for the treatment of OFMSW.

The city struggles with a rapidly increasing flow of municipal solid waste and a foreseeable scarcity of land to continue landfilling, the main treatment of municipal solid waste up to now. Therefore, additional municipal solid waste treatment technologies are needed. The objective of this article is to support decision-making towards more sustainable and cost-effective municipal solid waste strategies in developing countries, in particular Vietnam. A quantitative decision support model is developed to optimise the distribution of municipal solid waste from population areas to treatment plants, the treatment technologies and their capacities for the near future given available infrastructure and cost factors.

TI The myth and the reality of energy recovery from municipal solid waste
SO ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY
AB BackgroundAny manner of development can be sustainable only if the waste generated by it is not allowed to accumulate but is fully reused/recycled/recovered. Among the strategies to attain this goal have been the attempts to recover energy from municipal solid waste (MSW). About 60% of MSW is carbonaceous, consisting of materials which can either be biodegraded into fuels like methane or incinerated, thereby generating utilizable energy. MSW also contains several componentslike metallic scrap and glass pieceswhich can be reused or recycled, thereby achieving energy conservation. Given these attributes, MSW appears to be a potential source of energy and resources. Indeed, this belief that MSW is usable if only we try sincerely enough to do so prompts most of us to keep generating much more MSW than is warranted. But how realizable really is the energy potential of MSW? What perils loom into view when we actually set out to utilize MSW as an energy source? The present study addresses these crucially important questions.MethodsThe work is based on a critical content analysis of the prior art.ResultsThe generation of MSW has consistently outpaced the world's efforts to dispose of it cleanly, and the energy (and material) recovery from MSW is easier said than done. In most instances, what is technically feasible is economically unfeasible. And what is economically feasiblesuch as setting the waste on fire as is often done in developing countriesis exceedingly harmful to the environment and the human health. Measures such as sanitary landfilling and incineration create as many new problems as the old ones they solve. Moreover, despite the use of these less-than-adequate technologies, a major portion of MSW generated in the world lies untreated.ConclusionsAs the MSW output is expected to double by 2025, this situation is only set to become worse. Rising tides of E-waste would compound the problem even further. Hence, enormous stress should be put on the reduction of MSW generation by controlling wanton consumerism and wastage, rather than continuing with it in the false hope that technology will soon provide a magical solution and eliminate the problem.

TI Life Cycle Assessment of Existing and Alternative Options for Municipal
   Solid Waste Management in Saint Petersburg and the Leningrad Region,

SO RECYCLING
AB A waste reform was recently introduced in Russia to divert waste from landfills. To help advance the reform, this paper presents a life cycle assessment of the municipal solid waste management system in Russia's second largest city-Saint Petersburg-and its neighboring Leningrad region. Five scenarios were evaluated: the current state of the system (S0), its expected post-reform state in 2024 (S1), and its state improved by increased landfill gas collection (S2), by increased waste incineration (S3), and by separate collection of waste (S4). The environmental impact was assessed in terms of climate change, acidification, eutrophication, and abiotic resource depletion (fossil fuels). The results showed an overall reduction in the environmental impact of the waste management system across all impact categories and all scenarios studied. The largest reduction in all impact categories (except abiotic resource depletion) was achieved through source separation of municipal solid waste. Particularly, global warming potential was reduced from 0.328 kg CO2-eq./kg waste generated in S0 to 0.010 kg CO2-eq./kg waste in S4. Regarding abiotic resource depletion potential (fossil fuels), the incineration scenario is the most beneficial, since it reduces the impact by 573%.

TI Energy and Nutrient Recovery from Sewage Sludge and Manure via Anaerobic
   Digestion with Hydrothermal Pretreatment
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Global expectation for sustainability has prompted the transition of practices in wastewater treatment plants toward not only waste management but also energy and nutrient recovery. It has been shown that low-temperature hydrotherm (HT) treatment can enhance downstream biogas production via anaerobic digestion (AD). Yet, because the application of combined HT and AD is still at an early stage, a systematic understanding of the dynamic speciation evolution of important elements is still lacking. This study investigates energy and nutrient recovery from sewage sludge and swine manure via combined HT-AD treatment. Bench-scale investigation was conducted to evaluate biogas production and understand the dynamic evolution of organic carbon (C) and phosphorus (P) speciation. C and P speciations were characterized using complementary chemical and spectroscopic techniques, including C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, P X-ray absorption near edge structure ()CANES) spectroscopy, and sequential chemical extraction. Results from this study suggest that low-temperature HT pretreatment can achieve enhanced biogas production for sludge compared to the minimal effect on the biogas production from manure. It also provides guidance for P recovery from liquid digestate and solid residue after the AD process.

TI STEPS IN ORGANIC FRACTION OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE COMPOSTING AND
   COMPOST QUALITY EVALUATION
SO SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES A-AGRONOMY
AB The amount of solid waste generated in Romania has increased in recent years mainly because of the people lifestyle. Since 2015, all local communities are working for a sustainable waste management using composting as the main method of recycling the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW). Composting is a way of obtaining a product from the biological oxidative transformation of OFMSW with less carbon and nitrogen, but more stable, which is called compost and that could enhance plant growth. This paper refers to quality evaluation of compost produced from OFMSW within Covasna-Borofneu Mare Integrated Waste Management Centre. There were used empirical methods. physical and chemical analysis, germination tests with cress (Lepidium sativum L) and plant growing tests with lettuce (Lactuca saliva L). No presence of ammonia was identified within empirical test, and the C/N ratio has a typical value for a mature compost but, in the seed germination tests and plant growing tests the plants are dead. The phytotoxicity could be explained by the higher salts content of compost or by other substances that haven't been analiyzed.

TI Changes in global trends in food waste composting: Research challenges
   and opportunities
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB Increasing food waste (FW) generation has put significant pressure on the environment and has increased the global financial costs of its appropriate management. Among the traditional organic waste recycling technologies (i.e., incineration, landfilling and anaerobic digestion), composting is an economically feasible and reliable technology for FW recycling regardless of its technical flaws and social issues. The global scenario of FW generation, technical advancement in FW composting and essential nutrient recovery from organic waste with waste recycling are discussed in this article. Recent research on various strategies to improve FW composting, including co-composting, the addition of organic/inorganic additives, the mitigation of gaseous emission, and microbiological variations are comprehensively explained. Subsequently, it is shown that the performing FW composting in an existing mechanical facility can improve organic waste degradation and produce value-added mature compost to save on costs and increase the technological feasibility and viability of FW composting to some extent.

TI Estimating seasonal variations of incinerability of municipal solid
   waste using incinerability index
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Estimation of incinerability of municipal solid waste (MSW) is crucial, with the emergence of incineration as an integral element of sustainable solid waste management. The composition of MSW tends to vary seasonally, affected by local weather, festivals etc. subsequently affecting its incinerability. This study aims to demonstrate an easy assessment of the seasonal variations in incinerability of MSW in cities falling in different economies, namely Lahore, Kochi, Raipur, Jalandhar and New York using incinerability index or i-Index. It is observed that MSW generated in summer season exhibited relatively high incinerability, and reduced marginally during winter. The high moisture content during monsoon season significantly affected the incinerability of MSW in the study areas, reducing it by almost 25% in Kochi, a city with relatively high average annual rainfall of 1,570 mm. In areas with low rainfall like New York and Jalandhar, substantial seasonal variations are not observed.

TI Municipal solid waste disposal in Portugal
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB In recent years municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal has been one of the most important environmental problems for all of the Portuguese regions. The basic principles of MSW management in Portugal are: (1) prevention or reduction, (2) reuse, (3) recovery (e.g., recycling, incineration with heat recovery), and (4) polluter-pay principle. A brief history of legislative trends in waste management is provided herein as background for current waste management and recycling activities. The paper also presents and discusses the municipal solid waste management in Portugal and is based primarily on a national inquiry carried out in 2003 and directed to the MSW management entities. Additionally, the MSW responsibility and management structure in Portugal is presented, together with the present situation of production, collection, recycling, treatment and elimination of MSW. Results showed that 96% of MSW was collected mixed (4% was separately collected) and that 68% was disposed of in landfill, 21% was incinerated at waste-to-energy plants, 8% was treated at organic waste recovery plants and 3% was delivered to sorting. The average generation rate of MSW was 1.32 kg/capita/day. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A critical review on co-gasification and co-pyrolysis for gas production
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Sustainable energy resources are a solution to the increasing energy demand caused by the accelerating population growth and the national development in the emerging countries. Biomass wastes, such as municipal solid wastes, sewage sludge, and agriculture wastes have potential to be converted into energy via thermochemical processing methods - pyrolysis and gasification. These waste treatment methods are environmentally friendly compared to direct burning and other advantages include: a reduced carbon footprint, waste emission reduction, abundant availability, and comparable energy efficiencies. The types and quantity of value-added products depend on process types and operating parameters - temperatures, catalyst, particle size and waste type. This review focuses on the production of gaseous fuel, especially syngas, from the co-conversion of biomass with other waste using the co-gasification and co-pyrolysis processes. This review critically discusses experimental and modelling studies and the key parameters - synergistic effects, reactor types, catalyst types, blending ratio, pretreatments processes, performance efficiencies, and gasifying agents. Results reflect that mixing coal with biomass significantly reduces SO2, NOxs, and tar yields while increasing gas yields. The co-conversion of biomass and plastics enhances gas yields; steam with oxygen is found the best gasifying agent; while acid pretreatment and catalysts improves gas yields and reduces tar content. The review proposes future research to improve efficiencies and gas yields, thereby providing cleaner and sustainable energy for future generations, while maintaining an effective sustainable waste management scenario. Future work should study techno-economic feasibility, and environmental sustainability (using life cycle assessments) for large scale adoption of energy technologies.

TI Antibiotic Inhibition on Anaerobic Digestion of Animal Manure and
   Controlling Strategies: A Short Review
SO CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER
AB Despite the efficacy of anaerobic digestion |(AD) in stabilizing animal wastes as well as alleviating global warming associated with natural decomposition of animal manure, the process is susceptible to antibiotics that commonly exist in animal manure. Although antibiotics have served veterinary purposes in large quantities for decades, knowledge concerning their impacts on methane production during AD of animal manure is still in its infancy. Antibiotics used in animal practice are recognized as one of the major contributors to the development of resistant pathogens. Their fate and longterm environmental impacts following land application or disposal of the animal manure into the aquatic environment, with resistance development and associated risks on human health as the primary focus, are well reviewed in many previous publications. To date, to the best of our knowledge, few efforts are made on reviewing the impacts of antibiotics on AD of animal manure and the mitigation strategies. In this review, detailed summaries of earlier and recent works conducted on the inhibition of antibiotics on AD of animal manure are presented, with special interest directed toward available and new controlling strategies in terms of technical and regulatory aspects. Finally, in view of process balance and successive operation, further research should be carried out to gain insight into dynamic interactions of antibiotics and other commonly seen coexistent inhibitors/ intermediates in the AD systems.

TI Proliferation of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms and associated
   genes during composting: An overview of the potential impacts on public
   health, management and future
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Antibiotic residues together with non-antibiotic drugs and heavy metals act as a selective pressure for the spread of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms (ARMs), antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs), and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) during composting of livestock manure. ARMs, ARGs and MGEs have become emerging contaminants since they are regularly implicated in the majority of compost produced from livestock manure. The prevalence of these contaminants in agricultural soil receiving compost has drawn huge attention globally due to the risks they pose to the total environment. Although a large body of literature exists on the application of composting methods in minimizing the relative abundance of these contaminants, there is a paucity of information on the robustness, limitations and opportunities and threats of various composting protocols currently deployed. To address this knowledge gap, the current review compiled literature on the origin and mechanisms of the proliferation of ARMs, ARGs, and MGEs during composting of livestock manure. The effectiveness of current composting protocols in the reduction or removal of emerging contaminants was evaluated. Furthermore, the potential environmental impacts and human health risks of these contaminants following land application of compost were also presented. Finally, we propose some strategic approaches for the reduction of ARGs and MGEs during composting of livestock manure.

SO COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB At the global level, municipal solid waste constitutes a significant portion of the generated waste stream due to the ever-increasing population and booming economy, which has resulted in a worldwide concern. However, waste can be considered as a potential resource in the production of energy-related products, and thus, helping to reduce the immense volume of generated waste, meet the increasing energy demand, and reduce the dependence on natural resources. Accordingly, this study proposes a mixed-integer linear programming model for a waste supply chain problem, which aims to maximize the generation of fuel and energy from the waste feedstock. The model also optimizes the selection of waste conversion technologies, considering their economic and environmental impacts. The results provide an analysis of the economic value of the waste supply chain operations and present sustainable solutions for waste treatment in line with strategic, tactical, and operational targets in the waste management system.

TI Research challenges in municipal solid waste logistics management
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB During the last two decades, EU legislation has put increasing pressure on member countries to achieve specified recycling targets for municipal household waste. These targets can be obtained in various ways choosing collection methods, separation methods, decentral or central logistic systems, etc. This paper compares municipal solid waste (MSW) management practices in various EU countries to identify the characteristics and key issues from a waste management and reverse logistics point of view. Further, we investigate literature on modelling municipal solid waste logistics in general. Comparing issues addressed in literature with the identified issues in practice result in a research agenda for modelling municipal solid waste logistics in Europe. We conclude that waste recycling is a multi -disciplinary problem that needs to be considered at different decision levels simultaneously. A holistic view and taking into account the characteristics of different waste types are necessary when modelling a reverse supply chain for MSW recycling. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The disposal of solid waste was considered a major concern for all developing countries like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The high population growth rate annually in KSA, fast urbanization, and an increase in the number of pilgrims and visitors annually, all lead to an increase in the levels of waste products. The generation rate of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is expected to reach 26.9 million tons per year in 2032. The recent studies show that the major components of MSW in KSA were organic waste, plastics, paper, cardboard, and organic present the highest percentage which indicating its potential for energy generation. This paper explains the current practices of MSW Management systems and the potential opportunities for Waste-to-Energy and Recycling in the country. The use of Waste-to-Energy and recycling technologies will provide eco-friendly and cost-effective solutions for MSW disposal problems in the country. The environmental benefits involve reducing global warming and emissions, carbon pollution, enhancing air quality, and maintaining soil and groundwater.

TI Sustainability of Domestic Sewage Sludge Disposal
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Activated sludge is now one of the most widely used biological processes for the treatment of wastewaters from medium to large populations. It produces high amounts of sewage sludge that can be managed and perceived in two main ways: as a waste it is discharged in landfill, as a fertilizer it is disposed in agriculture with direct application to soil or subjected to anaerobic digestion and composting. Other solutions, such as incineration or production of concrete, bricks and asphalt play a secondary role in terms of their degree of diffusion. The agronomical value of domestic sewage sludge is a proved question, which may be hidden by the presence of several pollutants such as heavy metals, organic compounds and pathogens. In this way, the sustainability of sewage sludge agricultural disposal requires a value judgment based on knowledge and evaluation of the level of pollution of both sewage sludge and soil. The article analyzed a typical Italian case study, a water management system of small communities, applying the criteria of evaluation of the last official document of European Union about sewage sludge land application, the "Working Document on Sludge (3rd draft, 2000)". The report brought out good sewage sludge from small wastewater treatment plants and soils quality suggesting a sustainable application.

TI Comparison of the environmental impact of incineration and landfilling
   in Sao Paulo City as determined by LCA
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Life cycle assessment was employed to compare the environmental impact of incineration and the landfilling of municipal solid waste in Sao Paulo City, Brazil. Incineration with energy recovery and landfilling treatment systems were assessed in five different scenarios. Three incineration scenarios with different ash treatment systems were evaluated: incineration with ash disposal, with ash melting, and with an ash reuse system (brick production). Two landfilling scenarios were evaluated, namely, with and without energy recovery. Energy consumption, recovered resources, and emissions to the air and water were quantified and analyzed in terms of their impact potentials. Global warming, acidification, and nutrient enrichment were assessed as environmental impact categories. Electricity generation in these waste treatment systems did not result in a significant reduction in overall environmental impact, because Brazilian electricity is mainly hydro-based. Incineration with ash disposal to a landfill site resulted in the lowest impact values for all impact categories assessed in this study. Among the incineration scenarios, the reuse of ash for brick production resulted in a higher environmental impact due to an increase in energy consumption. Landfilling had a higher environmental impact than incineration. Landfilling with energy recovery had a slightly lower environmental impact than the landfillingwithout energy recovery.

TI Environmental assessment of energy production from municipal solid waste
   incineration
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT
AB Background, Aims and Scope. During the combustion of municipal solid waste (MSW), energy is produced which can be utilized to generate electricity. However, electricity production from incineration has to be evaluated from the point view of the environmental performance. In this study, environmental impacts of electricity production from waste incineration plant in Thailand are compared with those from Thai conventional power plants.
   Methods. The evaluation is based on a life cycle perspective using life cycle assessment (LCA) as the evaluation tool. Since MSW incineration provides two services, viz., waste management and electricity production, the conventional power production system is expanded to include landfilling without energy recovery, which is the most commonly used waste management system in Thailand, to provide the equivalent function of waste management.
   Results. The study shows that the incineration performs better than conventional power plants vis-a-vis global warming and photochemical ozone formation, but not for acidification and nutrient enrichment.
   Discussion. There are some aspects which may influence this result. If landfilling with gas collection and flaring systems is included in the analysis along with conventional power production instead of landfilling without energy recovery, the expanded system could become more favorable than the incineration in the global warming point of view. In addition, if the installation of deNO(x) process is employed in the MSW incineration process, nitrogen dioxide can be reduced with a consequent reduction of acidification and nutrient enrichment potentials. However, the conventional power plants still have lower acidification and nutrient enrichment potentials.
   Conclusions. The study shows that incineration could not play the major role for electricity production, but in addition to being a waste management option, could be considered as a complement to conventional power production. To promote incineration as a benign waste management option, appropriate deNO(x) and dioxin removal processes should be provided. Separation of high moisture content waste fractions from the waste to be incinerated and improvement of the operation efficiency of the incineration plant must be considered to improve the environmental performance of MSW incineration.
   Recommendations. This study provides an overall picture and impacts, and hence, can support a decision-making process for implementation of MSW incineration. The results obtained in this study could provide valuable information to implement incineration. But it should be noted that the results show the characteristics only from some viewpoints.
   Outlook. Further analysis is required to evaluate the electricity production of the incineration plant from other environmental aspects such as toxicity and land-use.

AB Municipal solid waste problems have become a major concern in Iran. No concrete study has been done yet on developing Waste-to-Energy technology as a complementary solution for the current Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) crisis in Iran. Apart from the available consistent data on waste compositions and quantity, the authors of this paper have conducted a new survey to identify problems and alternatives to improve the current system. The study objectives of the current study are as follows:
   To determine the current integrated solid waste composition and the generation of Refused Drive Fuel (RDF)
   To investigate the current solid waste management system of Isfahan in which the compost site plays a major role.
   The foremost challenge Isfahan city is facing is from landfilling. The examination of the project has been carried out through interviews with municipal authorities, review of existing documents, and field observations.
   The organic fraction of solid waste composition in Isfahan composting plant comprised about 75 percent. The generation of waste in this plant was estimated to be approximately 844 Ton Per Day (TPD) (308,060 tons of MSW per year) of which, about 500 TPD is rejected from the composting lines. The current chain of management system is inefficient, and recommendations are given by the authors of this paper to use Waste-to-Energy technology to improve the present situation.

TI Municipal solid waste management and energy production: A
   multi-objective optimization approach to incineration and biogas
   waste-to-energy supply chain
SO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS
AB Nowadays, the management of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) regarding its harmful impacts, such as acid compounds, carbon dioxide, and sludge waste, on the environment has become prominent. This paper introduces a supply chain model using simultaneously-two power station types, including biogas and incineration, one separation center, and one waste collection center over some districts of one urban region. MSW is collected throughout the town via transportation programming, transferred to the center of collection/separation, and further separated regarding low and high humidity, in which dry waste is assigned to the incineration center and the wet waste to the biogas one. Finally, the waste is converted to electricity and sold to the market. A case study from 11 districts located in Tehran, Iran used to obtain the optimal economic and environmental benefits. Large instance cases could be obtained via a hybrid method (GAs + Gams). A sensitivity analysis is done to minimize the harmful environmental impacts and maximize the economic benefits. Results indicate that the destructive effects of the acid compounds are considerably higher than both the carbon dioxide and the waste sludge. Moreover, practical costs in both power stations have insensitive impacts on the economic objective of the supply chain.

TI Low-temperature hydrothermal pretreatment followed by dry anaerobic
   digestion: A sustainable strategy for manure waste management regarding
   energy recovery and nutrients availability
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB This study evaluated the feasibility of low-temperature hydrothermal (HT) pretreatment for improving dry anaerobic digestion (AD) of swine manure (SM) and nutrient elements reclamation, with specific goals to minimize the drawbacks of conventional HT process including high energy consumption, inhibitory compounds formation and unfavorable pH/alkalinity decrease. Pretreatment at 110-130 degrees C for holding 30 min increased the soluble organic carbon (SOC) concentration in SM by 13-26%. After being mixed with inocula, the pretreated SM was applied for dry AI) tests successfully without initial pH adjustment, achieving a CH4 yield of 280.18-328.93 mlig-VSfed (14-34% increase compared to that from raw SM). Energy assessment indicated a positive net gain of 0.95 Wig-VS by adopting HT pretreatment at 130 degrees C. Except for increment in CH4 yield, low-temperature HT pretreatment also promoted organic-N mineralization, increasing N fractions in the digestate available for plants. After 70 days' dry AD, a high ammonia-N to total nitrogen (TN) ratio of 71% was obtained for the SM sample pretreated at 130 degrees C, in sharp contrast to that of 38% in raw SM. P bioavailability in the final digestate was not greatly affected by the HT pretreatment since the labile organics were mostly degraded after AD, in which P existing forms were influenced by the multivalent metals content in SM. Overall, 23-27% of the total P was potentially bioavailable in all digestates. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Hydrogen as Potential Primary Energy Fuel for Municipal Solid Waste
   Incineration for a Sustainable Waste Management
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) management has always been a challenge for the community impacting environmental sustainability. The anticipated reasons include an increase in population and prosperity. Among all the viable methods for MSW management, incineration technology is the most matured and feasible method. Incineration technology is based on combustion process of waste assisted by fossil fuels. These fuels are not only depleting with every day, but also a source environmental hazards upon burning. Current study investigates the feasibility of hydrogen as a primary combustion fuel for municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration. A vertical shaft type incinerator has been designed with the ability to operate on pure hydrogen. A pre-mixed hydrogen and oxygen fuel in the stoichiometric ratio has been fed through specially designed burners. The burners have been so designed to achieve homogenous heat distribution. To determine the working of incinerator at maximum allowable moisture content, a variety of homogeneous and heterogeneous MSWs with high moisture percentages between 60 and 90% have been tested. The maximum temperature of the incineration has been recorded to be 850 degrees C. A high reduction in weight percent i.e., 86-94%, and loss on ignition (1.74%-6.41%) have been observed. The hydrogen-based incinerator exhibited the highest performance for homogenous paper and food waste (1kg) with 60% and 87% moisture content respectively. The energy consumption was 108Wh and 321Wh respectively and achieved 97.14% and 88.88% reduction in weight respectively. Increase in moisture content of the waste leads to decrease the performance of hydrogen based incineration system.

TI Waste to Energy: A Focus on the Impact of Substrate Type in Biogas
   Production
SO PROCESSES
AB Anaerobic digestion is an efficient technology for a sustainable conversion of various organic wastes such as animal manure, municipal solid waste, agricultural residues and industrial waste into biogas. This technology offers a unique set of benefits, some of which include a good waste management technique, enhancement in the ecology of rural areas, improvement in health through a decrease of pathogens and optimization of the energy consumption of communities. The biogas produced through anaerobic digestion varies in composition, but it consists mainly of carbon dioxide methane together with a low quantity of trace gases. The variation in biogas composition are dependent on some factors namely the substrate type being digested, pH, operating temperature, organic loading rate, hydraulic retention time and digester design. However, the type of substrate used is of greater interest due to the direct dependency of microorganism activities on the nutritional composition of the substrate. Therefore, the aim of this review study is to provide a detailed analysis of the various types of organic wastes that have been used as a substrate for the sustainable production of biogas. Biogas formation from various substrates reported in the literature were investigated, an analysis and characterization of these substrates provided the pro and cons associated with each substrate. The findings obtained showed that the methane yield for all animal manure varied from 157 to 500 mL/gVS with goat and pig manure superseding the other animal manure whereas lignocellulose biomass varied from 160 to 212 mL/gVS. In addition, organic municipal solid waste and industrial waste showed methane yield in the ranges of 143-516 mL/gVS and 25-429 mL/gVS respectively. These variations in methane yield are primarily attributed to the nutritional composition of the various substrates.

TI Synergy of anaerobic digestion and pyrolysis processes for sustainable
   waste management: A critical review and future perspectives
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB The worldwide growing population, challenged by an ever-increasing global demand for food production, is also concomitant with increased waste production, particularly organic wastes. During the last decades, several waste processing technologies have been developed such as anaerobic digestion and pyrolysis. Recently, there has been an increased interest in creating industrial synergies by combining technologies in order to increase the efficacy of the process and improve waste management in the circular economy. In this review, we report on the importance of coupling anaerobic digestion and pyrolysis while providing evidence on the synergistic effects that may occur within such a combined waste bi-functional process. Specific attention has been paid to multiple symbiosis features that exist when coupling both processes, mainly 1) maximizing energy recovery through pyrolysis of solid digestate or feeding of the aqueous bio-oil phase in anaerobic digestion, 2) biogas purification by biochar or activated biochar, and 3) improving anaerobic digestion process stability by biochar addition to the system. In addition, the effects of coupling anaerobic digestate with biochar on soil biochemical properties and crop production were also presented. Improving the dual symbiosis of coupling anaerobic digestion and pyrolysis is likely to be a sustainable based approach that holds promise for wiser and more eco-efficient processing of organic wastes for versatile applications.

TI Municipal Solid Waste Management and Waste-to-Energy Potential from
   Rajshahi City Corporation in Bangladesh
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Waste management is becoming one of the most challenging tasks for developing countries in order to ensure good human health, as well as a healthy environment. Rajshahi City Corporation (RCC) is one of the 12 city corporations in Bangladesh. Various environmental and human health problems have arisen due to a lack of proper knowledge of waste management. Thus, the aim of this work is to illustrate the present status of MSW generation and management in Rajshahi City Corporation, Bangladesh. Fifty households were selected throughout RCC for waste collection, which represent approximately all types of households in RCC. From the qualitative and quantitative analysis, it is estimated that the approximate MSW generation in RCC is 358.19 t/d (tons/day) at an approximate rate of 0.4214 kg/person/d. Calorific values of the wastes have also been determined using the ultimate analysis results of the MSW. A higher calorific value of the dry MSW has been calculated as 14.9 MJ/kg. Moisture content of the MSW has been found to be 48.28%. It is also estimated that the possible power generation (steam energy to electrical power) from MSW generated in RCC is 159.40 MWh/d. Lastly, future scopes of MSW management and different waste management measures that need to be taken are illustrated. Waste-to-energy (WTE) conversion has been given priority and anaerobic digestion (AD) has been found to be an interesting prospect in this sector. Techno-economic analysis of the AD has been conducted. Energy potential from the proposed plant has been calculated as 3.85 MW and the payback period has been found to be 4.9 years. It has been observed that employing AD on a large scale can not only reduce the waste, but also meet a large portion of the energy demand of this city.

TI OPTIMIZING HOUSEHOLD WASTE COLLECTION THROUGH AHP-MEA MODEL: CASE STUDY
   OF KUNMING, CHINA
SO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB The optimization of household waste collection in China is facing more complex and structural problems related to waste reduction and recycling than that of disposal. A rigorous decision-making model of matter-element analysis (MEA) combined with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is developed to validate the feasibility and practicality of five alternatives to separated waste collection. This model is based on a survey of residents' cognition and inclination toward the optimization of the collection of separated household waste. A case study of residential areas in Kunming, Yunnan Province, China, demonstrates that the alternative of two rough categories of household waste (i.e., kitchen waste and other waste) is preferable according to local waste management conditions and urban development status in the short term. The combined AHP-MEA model, validated by AHP hierarchy and evaluated by the MEA process, also facilitates decision-making processes with multiple-alternative evaluation problems, especially in waste management.

TI Simulation of co-incineration of sewage sludge with municipal solid
   waste in a grate furnace incinerator
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Incineration is one of the most important methods in the resource recovery disposal of sewage sludge. The combustion characteristics of sewage sludge and an increasing number of municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration plants provide the possibility of co-incineration of sludge with MSW. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was used to verify the feasibility of co-incineration of sludge with MSW, and predict the effect of co-incineration. In this study, wet sludge and semi-dried sludge were separately blended with MSW as mixed fuels, which were at a co-incineration ratios of 5 wt.% (wet basis, the same below), 10 wt.%, 15 wt.%, 20 wt.% and 25 wt.%. The result indicates that co-incineration of 10 wt.% wet sludge with MSW can ensure the furnace temperature, the residence time and other vital items in allowable level, while 20 wt.% of semi-dried sludge can reach the same standards. With lower moisture content and higher low heating value (LHV), semi-dried sludge can be more appropriate in co-incineration with MSW in a grate furnace incinerator. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

CL Stockholm, SWEDEN
AB The overall goal of the present study is to evaluate different strategies for treatment of solid waste in Sweden based on a life cycle perspective. Important goals are to identify advantages and disadvantages of different methods for treatment of solid waste, and to identify critical factors in the systems, including the background systems, which may significantly influence the results. Included in the study are landfilling, incineration, recycling, digestion and composting. The waste fractions considered are the combustible and recyclable or compostable fractions of municipal solid waste. The methodology used is life cycle assessment (LCA). The results can be used for policy decisions as well as strategic decisions on waste management systems. A waste hierarchy suggesting the environmental preference of recycling over incineration over landfilling is often put forward and used in waste policy making. LCAs can be used to test the waste hierarchy and identify situations where the hierarchy is not valid. Our results indicate that the waste hierarchy is valid as a rule of thumb. The results also suggest that a policy promoting recycling of paper and plastic materials, preferably combined with policies promoting the use of plastics replacing plastics made from virgin materials, leads to decreased use of total energy and emissions of gases contributing to global warming. If the waste can replace oil or coal as energy sources, and neither biofuels nor natural gas are alternatives, a policy promoting incineration of paper materials may be successful in reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.

TI Comparative life cycle assessment of system solution scenarios for
   residual municipal solid waste management in NSW, Australia
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a promising tool to evaluate the environmental impacts of different technologies for sustainable waste management. This study employs LCA to assess environmental impacts of alternative scenarios for residual municipal solid waste (MSW) management in New South Wales (NSW) based on current conditions and policies. Six different scenarios including a baseline scenario (landfilling) were applied for NSW waste management for energy production and their impacts on environment. The initial results showed that the scenario 3 that employed anaerobic digestion for food waste, incineration for combustible waste and plastic waste, and landfilling for non-combustible waste produced electricity of 625 kWh/t, which was maximum compared to the other scenarios. LCA results further suggested that among all scenarios, scenario 5 (similar to scenario 3 except combustible waste was treated through gasification and plastic waste was recycled) has the lowest level of environmental burdens in global warming, freshwater and marine ecotoxicity, and human non-carcinogenic toxicity. The sensitivity analysis for energy conversion rates (23-30%) for incineration and plastic recycling rate (66-913%) for MSW was further conducted and the results showed that energy conversion rate of 30% makes scenario 3 more valuable for electricity generation and less impactful for ecosystems damage category compared to scenario 5. On the other hand, plastic recycling rate of 91.3% has the lowest environmental burdens and by decreasing recycling rate to 66% the environmental impacts increase; however, it was noticed that reduction in recycling rate does not make any change in the order of scenarios. Overall, the study suggests that each waste type in NSW should be treated with a specific technology to achieve the highest resource recovery and lowest environmental impacts where energy conversion and plastic recycling rates have significant impacts.

TI Moisture retention of municipal solid waste mixed with sewage sludge and
   ash in a semi-arid climate
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Mechanisms involved in moisture storage in refuse are explored using data from four sets of experiments in a semi-arid climate. Two laboratory series of experiments contained municipal solid waste (MSW) amended with sewage sludge, one with higher proportions of ash in the MSW than the other. Outdoor experiments contained waste streams with different proportions of ash. Field cells compared moisture retention of refuse and MSW co-disposed with sewage sludge. Sewage sludge at high loads was found to increase the moisture storage relative to unamended MSW. Belt-pressed sludge retained water as bound water that was released by decay and changing pH. Sun-dried sludge also retained more moisture than MSW alone. In gravimetric terms, ash reduced the storage potential of MSW, in laboratory and outdoor experiments. However, outdoor experiments released less leachate from ash-rich refuse than middle-income waste with no ash fraction.

TI The sustainable recovery of the organic fraction of municipal solid
   waste by integrated ozonation and anaerobic digestion
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB The organic fraction of municipal solid waste is commonly handled via biological processes, which enable the production of materials with potential fertilizer properties. When the biological process occurs under anaerobic conditions, the recovery of energy from biogas is also obtained. However, the sustainable recovery of organic solid waste implies the effective utilization of the biological treatment products, namely compost and digestate, which is often limited by the presence of organic contaminants. They enter the biological processes along with the organic waste and, due to their recalcitrance to the biodegradation, end up in either compost or digestate, posing the issue of their safe use on soil. The present study proposes ozonation as a possible strategy to reduce the presence of organic contaminants in the digestate originating from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste. In this view, digestate samples were collected from full-scale reactors operated at hydraulic retention time of 11 and 41 days and ozonated at 0.11 and 0.16 g(O3)/g(TS). Experimental results, including the evaluation of the eco-toxicological potential of differently treated substrates, showed that the integration of ozone and anaerobic digestion can be pursued for the sustainable recovery of organic solid waste, but the identification of the combined process lay-out requires the evaluation of the digestate biological stabilization level.

TI Mapping the Research Trends of Household Waste Recycling: A Bibliometric
   Analysis
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Household waste recycling has been widely considered the key to reducing the pollution caused by municipal solid waste and promoting sustainable development. This article aims to clarify the status and map the research trends in the field of household waste recycling. Bibliometric analysis is performed using bibliometrix based on publications during 1991-2020 in the Web of Science database. Results show that academic output in this field is growing rapidly. The top contributing authors, countries, institutions, and journals are identified. Collaboration network of authors, institutions, and countries are created and visualized. The most influential and cited articles in this field mainly focus on factors influencing residents' recycling behavior from the perspectives of sociopsychology and economics. The theory of planned behavior is the most widely used psychological model. Other research hotspots include electronic waste, source separation, life cycle assessment, sustainability, organic waste, and circular economy. Studies on household waste recycling have become more and more comprehensive and interdisciplinary with the evolution of research themes.

TI A combined approach to improve municipal solid waste management in
   upper-middle-income countries: the case of Sabana Centro, Colombia
SO CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
AB In developing countries, the lack of specific knowledge of the local context and complex interactions among variables influence effective solid waste management. As a result, the formulation of effective strategies to improve waste management is still a challenge. This study draws on the principle that an adequate formulation of recommendations can be achieved through deep knowledge of the context of implementation, specific for each country. This research designs and applies a novel impact analysis combined with participatory workshops to formulate recommendations to enhance municipal solid waste management. The approach includes four components: (i) a systematic literature review to identify the factors that affect municipal solid waste management in upper-middle-income countries; (ii) participatory workshops to collect information directly from relevant stakeholders; (iii) an impact matrix to systematize valuable information obtained from (i) and (ii), and (iv) an impact analysis to classify the obtained information and develop recommendations to improve municipal solid waste management. The combined approach can be applied to upper-middle-income countries. This was exemplified using a region in Colombia (Sabana Centro), which is composed by 11 municipalities, as a case study. Key recommendations to improve sustainable waste management in Sabana Centro emerged from this study, i.e., the need for multiple funding schemes and new public-private partnerships, the promotion of waste treatment technologies, the encouragement of public involvement in source separation activities, and the alignment of local waste management plans in Sabana Centro and with the national waste management policy.

TI Plastic waste management in the context of a European recycling society:
   Comparing results and uncertainties in a life cycle perspective
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB A number of life cycle assessment (LCA) studies have been undertaken within the last 15 years comparing end-of-life treatment options for post-consumer plastic waste, including techniques such as: mechanical recycling, feedstock recycling, incineration with energy recovery and landfilling. These have attempted to support decisions in the formulation of waste management strategies and policies. In light of the introduction of life cycle thinking into European waste policies, specifically in relation to the waste hierarchy, a literature review of publically available LCA studies evaluating alternative end-of-life treatment options for plastic waste has been conducted. This has been done in order to: establish if a consensus exists as to the environmentally preferable treatment option for plastic waste; identify the methodological considerations and assumptions that have led to these conclusions; and determine the legitimacy of applying the waste hierarchy to the plastic waste stream. The majority of the LCA studies concluded that, when single polymer plastic waste fractions with little organic contamination are recycled and replace virgin plastic at a ratio of close to 1:1, recycling is generally the environmentally preferred treatment option when compared to municipal solid waste incineration. It has been found that assumptions relating to the virgin material substitution ratio and level of organic contamination can have a significant influence upon the results of these studies. Although a limited number of studies addressed feedstock recycling, feedstock recycling and the use of plastic waste as a solid recovered fuel in cement kilns were preferred to municipal solid waste incineration. Landfilling of plastic waste compared to municipal solid waste incineration proved to be the least preferred option for all impact categories except for global warming potential. Due to the uncertainty surrounding some assumptions in the studies, it cannot be said with confidence that the waste hierarchy should be applied to plastic waste management as a general rule.

TI Environmental assessments of biological treatments of biowaste in life
   cycle perspective: A critical review
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Municipal biowaste is a major environmental issue. Life-cycle assessment is a valuable tool to assess recycling options, and anaerobic digestion and composting have performed adequately. However, reviews indicate several discrepancies between studies. Thus, we critically review 25 life-cycle assessments of the composting and anaerobic digestion of municipal biowaste. Our objective is to identify decisive factors, methodological gaps and processes that affect environmental performance. We generally identified methodological gaps in expanding systems borders. In energy systems, the replaced energy source did not consider power generation or dynamic regulation. All studies adopted mixed energy sources or marginal approaches. Agroecosystems included the carbon sequestration potential and compensation for the production of synthetic fertilizers only. A limited range of scientifically proven benefits of compost use has been reported. In general, studies provided a limited account of the effects of use on land emissions, but contradictory assumptions emerged, mainly in modelling synthetic fertilizer compensation. Only three studies compensated direct emissions from the use of synthetic fertilizers, and none included indirect emissions. Further studies should include an analysis of the additional benefits of compost use, compensate for the effects of emissions from synthetic fertilizer use on land and mix attributional and consequential approaches in energy system expansion.

TI Integrating wastewater treatment and incineration plants for
   energy-efficient urban biomass utilization: A life cycle analysis
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Sewage sludge and municipal solid waste, defined as urban biomass, are promising energy sources with the potential to lower fossil fuel consumption and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. However, the current process of extracting useable energy from urban biomass has two problems that must be addressed in order to achieve greater energy efficiency: (1) significant fossil fuel consumption is currently needed to dry sewage sludge in wastewater treatment plants, and (2) a huge amount of exhaust heat from incineration plants remains unused. One promising solution is to integrate wastewater treatment and incineration plants. In this way, total energy efficiency could be enhanced by utilizing the exhaust heat generated in the incineration plant to dry sewage sludge in the companion wastewater treatment plant. Aiming to clarify sustainable conditions for integrating the two plants, this paper proposes a method for conducting a life cycle analysis for urban biomass utilization. The proposed method combines scenario storylines and quantitative assessment to provide a better understanding of critical factors and their rationales. Each scenario is quantified by process network modeling and then evaluated in terms of their economic profit and carbon dioxide emissions. A case study involving a Japanese waste water treatment plant and a nearby incineration plant is conducted. The results show that the integration scenario reduces total annual costs by 35% and total annual carbon dioxide emissions by 1% relative to the status quo scenario. This is mainly due to the elimination of several system components, including a digestion tank, made possible by the integration. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Modified landfill design for sustainable waste management
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GLOBAL ENERGY ISSUES
AB Waste management, being one of the most important aspects of urban development, is gaining importance among developing nations. Landfills, which were initiated for hazardous waste management and subsequently transformed into sanitary landfills, have been the most widely adapted practice for municipal solid waste management worldwide. However, the conventional design of landfills not only fails to fulfil the needs of waste management but also fails to target optimal resource recovery and energy generation. In the present study, modified design was proposed for partially engineered landfill system based on theoretical considerations. Its potential for energy generation and resource utilisation was analysed with a case study of Mumbai municipal solid waste. It was found that the system with modified design could yield 0.157 million tons of landfill gas (0.145 million tons of coal equivalent) out of one year of solid waste. Further, this could recover resource valued at US$2.49 million per year.

TI Bioenergy production from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste
   and sewage sludge using mesophilic anaerobic co-digestion: An
   experimental and kinetic modeling study
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Following the rapid surge in global demand for energy as well as the rising generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) worldwide, much more attention has been drawn to sustainable waste management solutions to tackle both problems. The present study investigated the potential for biogas production from the anaerobic codigestion (ACD) of the organic fraction of MSW (OFMSW) and sewage sludge after physical and chemical pretreatments at three inoculum-to-substrate (I/S) ratios (ISR: 2, 4, & 6) and three levels of total solids (TS: 3, 5, & 7%). A series of experiments were further carried out in laboratory-scale (1-L) single-stage digesters in batch mode at the temperature of 35 degrees C (viz. Under mesophilic conditions) for 50 days. The results demonstrated that the digestion produced the best outputs at TS = 5% and ISR = 2, whereby it offered the biogas yield of 0.697, the methane (CH4) production of 0.448 m(3)/Kg-volatile solid (VS)(added), and the total VS (TVS) removal by 65%. Moreover, it was observed that most reactors with TS = 7% encountered the phase separation problem while augmenting the TS content from 3 to 5% increased the biogas yield and CH4 production. The kinetic study of the mesophilic ACD additionally showed that both models of modified Gompertz (GM) equation and logistic function (LF) provided a reasonably accurate description of biogas production, but the first-order (FO) model failed in this task. Furthermore, the amount of sludge (namely, ISR) in the digester enlarged and the models showed a better fit to the experimental data.

TI Opportunities and challenges in waste management within the medicinal
   cannabis sector
SO INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS
AB Medicinal and recreational Cannabis sativa is a sector that has exploded in popularity both in academia and industry due to the relaxation in legislation concerning the controlled substance. This business is currently valued at $37 billion in annual sales. As cultivation of cannabis increases, waste from this sector will increase, providing a challenge, with legislative constraints of Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol, and opportunity in sustainable management of this waste. Research into the waste management of cannabis production waste is vital as sustainability of waste management is a pressing issue and will provide opportunities for businesses to make use of said waste. This paper will use databases such as Scopus, Web of Science and Google scholar to identify literature to review related to cannabis waste and cannabis waste management systems. It has been discovered that the majority of plant biomass waste is generated during the cultivation period, with growing media being a large contributor to waste generated. Currently there are four methods for appropriate cannabis waste management, that are landfilling, composting, incineration and anaerobic digestion. Although there is this current information available further research is required to determine the most efficient method of disposal and pre-treatments, or novel approaches, to improving valorisation of this waste.

TI Environmental impact assessment of municipal solid waste management
   incorporating mechanical treatment of waste and incineration in
   Hangzhou, China
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) management is becoming increasingly popular around the world as a means of accommodating the increasing amounts of waste that the growing global population generates. China currently produces more MSW than any other country. As such, this area of the world is facing challenges on an unprecedented scale. MSW management in China is highly dependent on landfilling, and the development of sanitary landfills is currently a top priority for the Chinese government. Hangzhou is one of the most developed cities in China. In fact, in 2013, the amount of incinerated MSW in Hangzhou represented 56% of total MSW. MSW incineration is primarily performed via a process of co incineration with coal because MSW has a low heating value.
   This paper employs a environmental impact assessment by LCA program to determine whether refuse derived fuel (RDF) production and incineration can have a more positive impact on the environment than the co-incineration of MSW with coal in Hangzhou, China. According to the results, RDF production and incineration could improve Hangzhou's MSW management global warming potential from 33% to 0%, the acidification potential from 90% to 34%, and the eutrophication potential from -1200%-350% in comparison to the co-incineration of MSW with coal. The treatment of organic reject material from RDF production has a significant effect on the results; as such, it should be utilized in energy production rather than landfilled.

TI Co-composting as an oxygen stabilization of an organic fraction of
   municipal solid waste and industrial sewage sludge
SO WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The purpose of this work is to study the characteristics of the co-composting of municipal solid waste (MSW), sewage sludge, grass and sawdust. Differing proportions of biodegradable waste were investigated through changes of temperature, oxygen consumption, organic matters, moisture content, carbon, nitrogen, C/N ratio as well as heavy metals and pathogen microorganisms content. The present study has shown that addition of MSW above 10% had a negative impact on the composting process. The initial C/N of the mixtures with a higher MSW content was below 18. Lower losses of organic matter occurred during composting for the mixture with the highest addition of MSW. Although studies have shown that composting is a good method for the disposal of organic waste additional research is required in order to optimize the organic and nitrogen compounds degradation during the co-composting process. In conclusion, a 1:4:4:1 mixture of MSW: sewage sludge: grass: sawdust is recommended because it can achieve high temperature as well as the highest organic matter degradation and highest N content in the final composting product. The concentration of heavy and light metals in all composts was within the limits of regulation of the Polish Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development.

TI Environmental analysis of organic waste treatment focusing on composting
   scenarios
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The correct disposal of the waste generated by human activities is one of the prevalent challenges that the world faces towards a sustainable development. The lack of suitable sites and the high cost of waste treatment have persuaded many municipalities to implement a policy for integrated waste management, which includes measures such as, source reduction, reuse, recycling, composting and final disposal in landfill. This study examined the alternatives for composting of the organic waste generated in the city of Bauru, in the state of Sao Paulo, which does not have a composting plant, and analyzed the environmental impacts of seven scenarios: current situation, in which all organic waste is disposed at the landfill; dispatch of the organic waste generated in the city to the closest municipality having a composting plant; construction of a composting plant in Bauru; use of home composting for 10%, 25%, 60% and 90% of organic waste. The method consisted of literature review, data collection among the company responsible for the waste management in the municipality, and the Life Cycle Assessment of the scenarios through the software IWM-2 for the Life Cycle Inventory and Recipe2008 conversion factors for the following impact categories: climate change, ozone depletion, particulate matter formation, and human and freshwater toxicity. The results showed that home composting must be followed by a reduction in the organic waste collection days, in order to have a positive effect in the greenhouse emissions derived from transportation and collection. Also home composting has a greater potential to reduce carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per mass of waste composted in comparison with composting plants. The use of transfer station can have a positive effect on composting plants that are located in other municipalities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Co-incineration effect of sewage sludge and municipal solid waste on the
   behavior of heavy metals by phosphorus
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The effects of sewage sludge phosphorus (P) content on heavy metal behavior during co-incineration of sewage sludge and municipal solid waste (MSW) were evaluated. Thermogravimetric differential thermal analysis revealed that MSW incineration was mainly caused by organic matter and fixed carbon, while sewage sludge incineration was caused by volatile matter. During co-incineration, the peak weight loss at 460 C shifted to slightly higher temperatures and the sludge ratio increased, indicating that interaction effects during co -incineration delayed pyrolysis and polymer/fixed carbon incineration. The residual heavy metal ratios after mono-incineration of sewage sludge were higher than those after MSW mono-incineration. The Cl content of MSW (0.757%) was much higher than that of sewage sludge (0.068%), which resulted in the conversion of heavy metals into metal chlorides and then volatilized during MSW mono-incineration. A synergistic effect of co -incineration was evident for Cu, but not for lead (Pb) or cadmium (Cd). X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurement revealed that Cu in MSW ash was in the form of CuO(s), but was Cu3(PO4)2 in sewage sludge and co-incineration ashes. CuO(s) is relatively unstable and may be transformed to CuO(g) or CuCl(s) before volatilizing at high temperature or in the presence of Cl. Phosphorus has the effect of stabilizing Cu in sewage sludge during co-incineration.

TI Sorptive removal of toluene and m-xylene by municipal solid waste
   biochar: Simultaneous municipal solid waste management and remediation
   of volatile organic compounds
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The remediation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from aqueous solution using Municipal solid waste biochar (MSW-BC) has been evaluated. Municipal solid waste was pyrolyzed in an onsite pyrolyzer around 450 degrees C with a holding time of 30 min for the production of biochar (BC). Physiochemical properties of BC were assessed based on X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) analysis. Adsorption capacities for the VOCs (m-xylene and toluene) were examined by batch sorption experiments. Analysis indicated high loading of m-xylene and toluene in landfill leachates from different dump sites. The FTIR analysis corroborates with the Boehm titration data whereas XRF data demonstrated negligible amounts of trace metals in MSW-BC to be a potential sorbent. Adsorption isotherm exhibited properties of both Langmuir and Freundlich which is indicative of a non-ideal monolayer adsorption process taking place. Langmuir adsorption capacities were high as 850 and 550 mu g/g for toluene and m-xylene respectively. The conversion of MSW to a value added product provided a feasible means of solid waste management. The produced MSW-BC was an economical adsorbent which demonstrated a strong ability for removing VOCs. Hence, MSW-BC can be used as a landfill cover or a permeable reactive barrier material to treat MSW leachate. Thus, the conversion of MSW to BC becomes an environmentally friendly and economical means of solid waste remediation.

TI Life cycle assessment of energy consumption and GHG emission for sewage
   sludge treatment and disposal: a review
SO FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH
AB With increasing population and urbanization, the amount of municipal sewage sludge generated is huge and growing rapidly. In order to minimize resource inputs and pollutant emissions in the sludge disposal process, it is crucial to carry out an environmental impact analysis and sustainability assessment of different strategies based on life cycle assessment (LCA). LCA provides a flexible framework for quantifying the consumption and emissions of different processes to determine the energy consumption and environmental impact of sewage sludge treatment and disposal. The aim of this review is to compare the energy consumption and GHG emissions of existing sludge management options for energy and nutrient recovery. At the same time, the characteristics of sewage sludge and the potential to convert sludge from waste to valuable products were assessed. While the excessive moisture content and ash content make sludge unsuitable for use as fuel, and the potential risk of contamination with heavy metals makes it less suitable for use as organic fertilizer, energy and material recovery during disposal can reduce disposal costs and environmental impacts. In the context of the current limitations reviewed, the level of potential GHG emissions of existing sludge treatment and disposal routes is: composting > anaerobic digestion > pyrolysis > incineration. With suitable sludge treatment routes, negative GHG emissions could potentially be achieved by substituting fossil fuels for heat and electricity generation, or as a fertilizer substitute. The development and application of future sludge management strategies should aim at reduction and harmless disposal, thereby reducing the operating costs and environmental burdens through resources.

TI Optimal processing route for the utilization and conversion of municipal
   solid waste into energy and valuable products
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB A systematic design of municipal solid waste (MSW) management system can lead to identify a promising and/or sustainable way of handling MSW by processing it into energy and valuable products. In this study, a systematic framework is developed for the superstructure-based optimization of MSW processing routes. The proposed superstructure includes the potential technological alternatives (such as recycling, composting, anaerobic digestion with electricity generation, gasification followed by catalytic transformation, gasification with electricity generation, plasma arc gasification with electricity generation, pyrolysis with electricity generation, incineration with electricity generation, and landfill with electricity generation) for producing valuable products from MSW. Based on the developed superstructure, a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is developed to identify the optimal MSW processing pathways considering two different MSW handling scenarios. For ease of the solution, the MINLP model is linearized to its equivalent MILP form, and solved in GAMS. The solution to the optimization problem provides the optimal/promising route for the synthesis of useful products from MSW under chosen economic objective function. The developed framework is applied on a case study of Abu Dhabi Emirate to find the optimal processing pathway for handling and processing of MSW into energy and value-added products. The optimization results show that an integrated pathway comprising of recycling the recyclable components of MSW along with the production of bioethanol from the rest of the waste via gasification followed by catalytic transformation can provide potential economic benefits. A sensitivity analysis is also executed to investigate the effect of key economic and technical parameters on the optimization results. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Megacity's pathway toward sustainable food waste management and its
   environmental performance in a developing country: Evidence from
   Shanghai, China
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Due to the far distance impact on resident, aquatic and soil ecosystem health, food waste disposal becomes the focus of municipal waste strategy in developing countries. Shanghai is a leading city in China, its evolution of food waste management can indicate the coming future of the nation. In this city, from 1986 to 2020, the open dumping, landfill and incineration of food waste had been gradually banned, replaced by centralized compost and anaerobic digestion and other recovery ways. This study selected ten scenarios, ever used for food/mixed waste disposal in Shanghai, and analyzed the environmental impact change during the period 1986-2020. Life cycle assessment showed that although the generation of food waste raised rapidly, the total environmental impact, which was dominated by Freshwater Aquatic Ecotoxicity Potential, displayed a sharp decrease as 96.09 %, and Global Warming Potential decreased by 28.14 %. Substantial efforts should be made to improve the collection rate of biogas and landfill gas to reduce environmental impact, and quality of residues from anaerobic digestion and compost plants should be improved and utilized in its legal ways. Driving forces for the goal of sustainable food waste management in Shanghai involved economic development, environmental regulations and the supporting national/local standards.

TI Sustainability Assessment of Waste Management System for Mexico City
   (Mexico)-Based on Analytic Hierarchy Process
SO RECYCLING
AB Mexico City introduced the new legal waste norm Norma NADF-024-AMBT-2013 in July 2017. This report compares the proposed system with three alternatives: a baseline scenario with composting of organics, a scenario which involves anaerobic digestion of organics, and a mechanical-biological treatment scenario with no source separation. The comparison was done using an Analytic Hierarchy Process. Eleven different indicators were chosen for the evaluation: general waste performance indicators (landfill disposal and recycling rates), environmental indicators (greenhouse gas emissions, acid gas emissions, Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), and mercury content in water and soil), economic indicators (investment and operation costs) ($ per Mg municipal solid waste (MSW)), and social indicators (jobs created and social acceptance). The scenario ranking based on pairwise comparison made by 5 experts from Mexico City showed that the most sustainable scenario, environmentally, socially, and economically, is that which corresponds to Norma NADF-024-AMBT-2013 with a ranking priority of 30.78%.

TI Evaluation of food waste disposal options by LCC analysis from the
   perspective of global warming: Jungnang case, South Korea
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The costs associated with eight food waste disposal options, dry feeding, wet feeding, composting, anaerobic digestion, co-digestion with sewage sludge, food waste disposer, incineration, and landfilling, were evaluated in the perspective of global warming and energy and/or resource recovery. An expanded system boundary was employed to compare by-products. Life cycle cost was analyzed through the entire disposal process, which included discharge, separate collection, transportation, treatment, and final disposal stages, all of which were included in the system boundary. Costs and benefits were estimated by an avoided impact. Environmental benefits of each system per 1 tonne of food waste management were estimated using carbon prices resulting from CO2 reduction by avoided impact, as well as the prices of by-products such as animal feed, compost, and electricity. We found that the cost of landfilling was the lowest, followed by co-digestion. The benefits of wet feeding systems were the highest and landfilling the lowest. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI An optimization approach for food waste management system based on
   technical integration under different Water/Grease proportions
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Large quantities of food waste challenge sustainable development and there is significant value in the proper treatment of such waste. There are several food waste treatment technologies available, and food waste valorization requires planning for the collection, transportation, pre-treatment, treatment, and product sales. Managers need comprehensive system management objectives and strategies to promote the circular economy. To determine the optimal network design for food waste management systems, this paper develops a multi-objective mixed integer non-linear model from economic, energy, environmental, and social perspectives that integrates different treatment technologies into the three-phase separation pre-treatment. The proposed model was applied to a food waste management system in Chongqing, China, and the effects of different decision preferences of the managers, the water and grease proportion in the food waste on the optimization results were analyzed and discussed. It was found that different grease and water proportions influenced the optimal application of the technologies and system management decisions. With a 10% to 15% grease proportion, composting was seen to be more suitable than incineration or anaerobic digestion treatments, and the simultaneous application of multiple technologies was seen to be beneficial for food waste management

TI A Perspective on Emerging Inter-Disciplinary Solutions for the
   Sustainable Management of Food Waste
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Since food waste is a contemporary and complicated issue that is widely debated across many societal areas, the world community has designated the reduction of food waste as a crucial aspect of establishing a sustainable economy. However, waste management has numerous challenges, such as inadequate funding, poor waste treatment infrastructure, technological limitations, limited public awareness of proper sanitary practices, and inadequate legal and regulatory frameworks. A variety of microorganisms participate in the process of anaerobic digestion, which can be used to convert organic waste into biogas (e.g., methane) and nutrient-rich digestate. In this study, we propose a synergy among multiple disciplines such as nanotechnology, omics, artificial intelligence, and bioengineering that leverage anaerobic digestion processes to optimize the use of current scientific and technological knowledge in addressing global food waste challenges. The integration of these fields carries with it a vast amount of potential for improved waste management. In addition, we highlighted the relevance, importance, and applicability of numerous biogas-generating technologies accessible in each discipline, as well as assessing the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on waste production and management systems. We identify diverse solutions that acknowledge the necessity for integration aimed at drawing expertise from broad interdisciplinary research to address food waste management challenges.

TI LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT OF SEWAGE SLUDGE PYROLYSIS: ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
   OF BIOCHAR AS CARBON SEQUESTRATOR AND NUTRIENT RECYCLER
SO DETRITUS
AB The pyrolysis of sewage sludge is an alternative method to recycle the contained nutrients, such as phosphorus, by material use of the resulting biochar. However, the ecological effects of pyrolysis are not easy to evaluate. Therefore, a life cycle assessment (LCA) was carried out to determine the environmental impact of sewage sludge pyrolysis and to compare it with the common method of sewage sludge incineration. In order to identify the most sustainable applications of the resulting biochar, four different scenarios were analyzed. The modeled life cycles include dewatering, drying and pyrolysis of digested sewage sludge and utilization paths of the by-products as well as various applications of the produced biochar and associated transports. The life cycle impact assessment was carried out using the ReCiPe midpoint method. The best scenario in terms of global warming potential (GWP) was the use of biochar in horticulture with net emissions of 2 g CO2 eq./kg sewage sludge. This scenario of biochar utilization can achieve savings of 78% of CO2 eq. emissions compared to the benchmark process of sewage sludge mono-incineration. In addition, no ecological hotspots in critical categories such as eutrophication or ecotoxicity were identified for the material use of biochar compared to the benchmark. Pyrolysis of digested sewage sludge with appropriate biochar utilization can therefore be an environmentally friendly option for both sequestering carbon and closing the nutrient cycle.

TI Application of zeolites in organic waste composting: A review
SO BIOCATALYSIS AND AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB While composting is one of the sustainable solutions for the recycling of organic solid waste (OSW) however, it has some drawbacks that need to be addressed properly. For instance, nitrogen loss, mobility of heavy metals (HMs), greenhouse gases emissions, low productivity, and antibiotic-resistant gens enrichment are some of the technical issues of traditional composting processes. The application of zeolite and other additives to the OSW composting process is a very interesting interdisciplinary research topic that are studied by many researchers worldwide. This review intends to discuss the latest advancements on the applications of zeolites to the OSW composting processes and the its effect on the compost quality, soil remediation, nutrient management and plants growth. According to the published reports, modification of OSW compost with zeolite not only improves physicochemical properties of the compost product but also enhances microbial activities by promoting OSW decomposition and reduce the duration of the composting process. Furthermore, zeolitic additives can reduces greenhouse gases and ammonia emissions of the composting process. Zeolite-modified compost has reduced total and available HMs and reduced antibiotic resistance genes. Zeolite can upgrade the compost quality by enhancing maturity, and decreasing salinity. Last but not least, zeolite contributes to the optimization of anaerobic digestion for the production of biogas. Compost modified with zeolite exhibited improved crop yield and water retention and prevent soil nutrient losses. Overall, addition of natural zeolites to composting products are beneficial to agricultural soils and for soil remediation purposes. It is noteworthy that the addition of zeolitic aluminosilicate to soil might change the soil texture in the long term. Therefore, more in-depth researches are necessary to evaluate the cumulative effect of the addition of zeolitic minerals to agricultural lands.

TI Organic amendment effects on cropland soil organic carbon and its
   implications: A global synthesis
SO CATENA
AB Increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) content can promote soil health and crop yield. Organic amendment application is a common practice to accelerate soil carbon sequestration in cropland. The effects of different organic amendments (e.g., compost, slurry) on SOC are uncertain. Previous studies have investigated SOC response to environmental factors but not well addressed the effect of organic amendment characteristics (e.g., source, liquid/solid form, pH). Depending on 1,972 comparisons from 424 articles, we undertook a meta-analysis approach to explore organic amendment effects on SOC content and the related influence factors. The results show that organic amendment addition increased SOC by an average of 26.9% (or 5.1 Mg C ha-1). Specifically, organic amendments can enhance SOC over the long term (>20 years) or within 1.0 m depth. Organic-residue inputs increased more SOC in regions with an arid climate, alkaline soils, or no-mineral nitrogen application soils than the humid climate regions, acidic soils, and nitrogen application soils, respectively. Sewage sludge and municipal solid waste as organic amendments led to high SOC. The organic amendments' pH and liquid/solid form caused significant differences in SOC accumulation. Amendments with a relatively low carbon content or rich nitrogen content have great potential to increase SOC storage. Our results illustrate the importance of amendment characteristics when estimating the potential of organic amendment addition to soil carbon accu-mulation. This study highlights that amendment application might be a sustainable strategy to increase soil carbon storage while promoting organic waste utilization.

TI Understanding the Stakeholders' Involvement in Utilizing Municipal Solid
   Waste in Agriculture through Composting: A Case Study of Hanoi, Vietnam
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Although the involvement of stakeholders is believed to be the key to the success of sustainable municipal waste management, the specific features of stakeholders, as well as their interdependence, have been under-researched. This study employed a multilevel governance approach to understand the manner in which different types of stakeholder networks interact with one another and how their roles should be reinforced. A combination of stakeholder analysis (SA) and social network analysis (SNA) was employed to investigate the perspective of stakeholders in utilizing municipal solid waste (MSW) in agriculture in Hanoi, Vietnam. SA indicated that the local authorities take the main responsibility for the management of MSW in Hanoi. Although other stakeholders express a significant interest in recycling MSW through composting, many of them do not have sufficient power to make any changes to the current system. SNA revealed the fragmentation of the network, as the coordination among the stakeholders is dominated by hierarchical governance, while there is a lack of horizontal cooperation among the sectors. The fragmentation could be attributed to weak legislative framework, lack of trust, financial constraints, and the limited participation of private enterprises. The governance of MSW use in agriculture should be executed through interdependency rather than hierarchy and through a network comprising both state and non-state actors.

SO PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
AB With the rapid development of China's economy, the contradiction of the mismatch between municipal solid waste disposal capacity and its growth has become increasingly prominent, and the need to develop alternative energy sources has become increasingly urgent. Municipal solid waste incineration plays an important role in waste management. In this study, the Grey Relation Analysis (GRA) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) prediction model is constructed to achieve effective prediction of municipal solid waste generation by taking 11 influencing factors of municipal solid waste generation as input indicators in Tianjin. Meanwhile, this study predicts the power generation from municipal solid waste incineration and carbon emissions in Tianjin based on the prediction results. The experimental results show that the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) value of the combined GRA-LSTM model established in this study is 6.759 %, and this model outperforms the other five structural methods in terms of prediction performance. By 2025, the amount of MSW in Tianjin will reach 3.74 million metric tons, the power generation through incineration will be 20.02-39.47 GWh, and the CO2 emission through incineration will be about 1.14 million metric tons. Finally, to cope with the growth of municipal solid waste generation and unbalanced power supply structure in the country's mega-cities, this paper puts forward relevant suggestions for achieving sustainable urban development.

TI Evaluation of the Use of Organic Waste Generated at Hydroelectric Power
   Plants in the Production of Organic Fertilizers
SO WASTE AND BIOMASS VALORIZATION
AB This work evaluated the composting process of different organic wastes produced in a Brazilian hydropower plant (HPP). The experiments were carried out in a composting unit using an initial volumetric proportion of 30 parts of dry grass clippings to one part of other organic wastes (water hyacinth, seeds, manure and carcasses of fish and bird). The efficiency in composting 100% grass clippings was also evaluated. After 90 days the composting end products were examined to verify their quality and maturity. During the composting process the tests performed with vegetable wastes and manure presented higher temperature (around 63 degrees C) in the thermophilic phase than those prepared with animal carcasses (56 degrees C for Fish and 46 degrees C for Birds) and 100% grass (57 degrees C). Vegetable wastes and manure experiments stabilized earlier (after 40-45 day) than the other tests (after 60 days). The pH values of composts prepared with vegetable wastes and manure were higher (around 7) than those prepared with animal carcasses (around 5). These results indicate the need to increase the initial proportion of nitrogen in composting tests using animal carcasses and 100% grass to improve the maturity rate and raise the temperature of thermophilic phase. However, the final composts presented most of chemical and physicochemical parameters within or close to the levels established by the Brazilian legislation for fertilizers produced through composting. About 3 m(3)of humus were produced from composting 20 m(3)of organic wastes, which can be used in the projects that develop seedlings nurseries of native plants in the HPP area.

TI Use of incinerated ashes as aggregate in concrete: a compressive
   strength model
SO MAGAZINE OF CONCRETE RESEARCH
AB Municipal solid waste, described as household waste, and sewage sludge, arising from wastewater treatment, are produced in large quantities around the world. Incineration plays a key role in the management of these materials, although the process leaves behind residual ashes: municipal incinerated bottom ash and sewage sludge ash, respectively. This paper examines the use of these ashes as aggregate in concrete, focusing specifically on developing a model to estimate the compressive strength of the concrete. The data used in this work have been obtained from a comprehensive search of the globally published literature. The strength model, focusing on 28 d results, has been developed using a regression analysis approach, with the renowned Abram's law as the foundation. The validated model demonstrated that, with favourable ash properties and mix design parameters, compressive strength results close to the control can be targeted with the use of the ashes as a low content aggregate component.

TI Application of autothermal thermophilic aerobic digestion as a
   sustainable recycling process of organic liquid waste: Recent advances
   and prospects
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Autothermal thermophilic aerobic digestion (ATAD) has been used to stabilize organic waste since the 1960s and is considered sustainable technology. ATAD has several advantages, including high biodegradation efficiency, pathogen inactivation, and ease of operation. Although ATAD research has a long history, the number of studies on ATAD is much lower than those on similar aerobic processes, particularly composting. Previous review articles addressed the origin, design, operational experiences, metabolism, and the microorganisms at the thermophilic stage of ATAD. This article reviews the digestion systems, applications, and characteristics of ATAD; compares system performance and microbial community structure of ATAD with those of other biological processes such as composting, activated sludge, and anaerobic digestion; and discusses the physicochemical properties and factors of ATAD. The challenges, opportunities, and prospects for the application of ATAD are also discussed. This review suggests that ATAD is feasible for treating organic liquid waste (1-6% total solid content) in small-sized towns and can help establish a sustainable society.

TI The benefits of integrated treatment of wastes for the production of
   energy
SO ENERGY
AB Three wastes are examined: agricultural slurry, municipal solid waste (MSW) and sludge (wastewater bio-solids). The recommended utilisation of biogas generated from the digestion of agricultural slurry and of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) is as a transport fuel. Due to parasitic demands only 50% of biogas is available for export. The lack of a market for thermal product in incinerating the residue of MSW entails wastage of 42% of the energy value of the waste. The treatment of sewage sludge requires input of energy. An integrated system is proposed which overcomes the shortfalls of the separate systems. The sludge is incinerated with the residue of MSW. Electric and thermal products of the incineration process are used in the integrated system. Surplus electricity (67% of the total) is exported. The surplus heat (82% of the total) may be exported if a market is found. The effect of the integrated system is to pull the balance of energy production towards transport fuel production and to ensure sustainability. A system treating the waste from 1,000,000 person equivalents (PE) could power 12,400 cars, provide electricity for 30,900 houses and heat 15,100 houses. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A Critical Review on the Microbial Ecology of Landfill Leachate
   Treatment Systems
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Sanitary landfilling is still considered worldwide as one of the most common methods applied for the management of the municipal solid waste. As a consequence, vast amounts of landfill leachate are generated annually, which are characterized by variability in physicochemical composition, owing to the stabilization process that occurs over the years. However, sustainable management of landfill leachate is a challenging issue, due to diverse chemical composition and high concentration in heavy metals and xenobiotics. Despite the fact that several studies have been reported on the biotreatment of landfill leachate, only in recent years has the microbial composition in such systems have been examined. In the present review, the key role of the microbial ecology involved in depurification and detoxification of landfill leachate in activated sludge and anaerobic systems is interpreted and ecological considerations influencing landfill leachate treatment are stated. Apart from the assessment of landfill toxicity on certain model organisms, this work provides an extensive overview on microbial communities performing key biological processes during landfill leachate treatment, including nitrification-denitrification, anammox and anaerobic digestion. Moreover, microbial aspects affecting nutrient removal efficiency in such biosystems are discussed.

TI The potential of a sustainable municipal waste management system for
   Santiago de Chile, including energy production from waste
SO ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY
AB Background: Due to a rapid urbanization process in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago de Chile (MRS), the amount of municipal solid waste (MSW) generated has increased considerably within the last years. MSW should be managed properly in order to achieve sustainable development. The purpose of this study is to analyze MSW management in MRS on the basis of three different explorative scenarios for the year 2030.
   Methods: The Integrative Sustainability Concept of the Helmholtz Association provided a conceptual framework for the study and was used to evaluate the scenarios. One important topic within the field of management of MSW in the year 2030 will be the contribution of waste treatment technologies to energy production, e.g., by the use of landfill gas and by separated collection of biowaste followed by anaerobic treatment.
   Results: The largest sustainability deficits in the scenarios are the small proportion of MSW being pre-treated before final disposal and the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with MSW disposal. MSW management technologies taken into consideration were mechanical biological treatment, energy recovery from MSW in anaerobic digestion plants with biogas production, the production of refuse-derived fuel and its use as a secondary fuel, as well as electricity generation from landfill gas. Energy generation from MSW in 2030 will be about 6% of electricity consumption in 2010.
   Conclusions: The three scenarios show some sustainability deficits. Even so, there are some improvements such as the reduction of GHG emissions and -even though marginal-energy supply for MRS from renewable energy sources.

TI The prospects of electricity generation from municipal solid waste (MSW)
   in Ghana: A better waste management option
SO FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
AB In 2010, the total generated municipal solid waste (MSW) in Ghana was 4.5 million tons. About 90% of the total MSW generated is not effectively managed but dumped in unauthorized places creating serious burden on human health. With a population growth rate of about 3.4% per year, Ghana is predicted to face big challenges in waste management. One effective way of managing solid waste is to recover the potent energy from them through waste-to-energy (WTE) plants such as engineered landfilling and controlled incineration. Cost assessment of power generation based on MSW in Ghana showed that the average cost of electricity for landfill gas power plants with already existing closed engineered landfill emerged as the cheapest (USD 0.039/kWh) compared to landfilling without engineered sites and controlled incineration. Moreover, the average domestic employment per megawatt energy generated is higher at approximately 185 for existing engineered landfills compared to the other technologies. Engineered landfill sites are under construction in Ghana whose average power extraction would be between 1 and 2 MW. Thus a potentially sustainable way of managing MSW in Ghana is through the construction of WTE plants to generate electricity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Impacts of COVID-19 Outbreak on the Municipal Solid Waste Management:
   Now and beyond the Pandemic
SO ACS ENVIRONMENTAL AU
AB The COVID-19 pandemicdisrupted the municipal essential services,including municipal solid waste (MSW) management. This study has reviewedthe literature on MSW and solid medical waste (SMW) management systems,waste management initiatives specific to this pandemic, as well astheir impacts now and beyond. Waste segregation and separate treatmentof waste streams play important roles in reducing the environmental,health, and social impacts of waste and waste management. The globalwarming potential of MSW and SMW were found to be varied from -0.64to 520 kg CO2 equiv/tonne and -52.1 to 3730 kg CO2 equiv/tonne, respectively, which widely depend on the sterilizationand disposal processes. Similarly, MSW and SMW disposal costs variedfrom 90 to $242/tonne and 12 to $1530.0/tonne, respectively. Variouschanges made to waste collection and management because of the COVID-19pandemic affected waste segregation and recycling. Since the startof the pandemic, various sectors, including the food, waste management,and healthcare sectors, relied on the increased use of single-useplastics to prevent transmission of COVID-19. An environmentally friendlyalternative (biodegradable/compostable) to widely used single-useplastics is desired for easing waste management problems. Althoughvarious initiatives are underway to manage growing volumes of MSWand SMW, while controlling the spreading of infectious diseases, themovable grate incineration technology coupled with an adequate disinfectionprocess presents a potential solution in managing the COVID-19 wastechallenges. The proper disinfection method and technological choicescan mitigate the risk of spreading infections and can improve thewaste management system's sustainability, especially the contaminatedwaste.

TI Sewage sludge drying process integration with a waste-to-energy power
   plant
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Dewatered sewage sludge from Waste Water Treatment Plants (WWTPs) is encountering increasing problems associated with its disposal. Several solutions have been proposed in the last years regarding energy and materials recovery from sewage sludge. Current technological solutions have relevant limits as dewatered sewage sludge is characterized by a high water content (70-75% by weight), even if mechanically treated. A Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) with good thermal characteristics in terms of Lower Heating Value (LHV) can be obtained if dewatered sludge is further processed, for example by a thermal drying stage. Sewage sludge thermal drying is not sustainable if the power is fed by primary energy sources, but can be appealing if waste heat, recovered from other processes, is used. A suitable integration can be realized between a WWTP and a waste-to-energy (WTE) power plant through the recovery of WTE waste heat as energy source for sewage sludge drying. In this paper, the properties of sewage sludge from three different WWTPs are studied. On the basis of the results obtained, a facility for the integration of sewage sludge drying within a WTE power plant is developed. Furthermore, energy and mass balances are set up in order to evaluate the benefits brought by the described integration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Technical feasibility of anaerobic co-digestion of sewage sludge and
   municipal solid waste
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY
AB Experiments were conducted using one-litre anaerobic batch bioreactors operated mesophilically (37 degrees C) and fed a mixture of primary sludge (RAW), thickened waste activated sludge (TWAS) and simulated organic municipal solid waste (MSW). A mixture of 25% MSW and 75% sewage sludge (60% RAW, 40% TWAS) yielded the highest biogas production. Based on biogas production, the most anaerobically biodegradable components were the white paper and grass components of the MSW. The TWAS and the newspaper components of the MSW were found to be the least biodegradable components. Both particle size and total solids concentration of the feed had a significant impact on the performance of the process. Over the operating region studied, the optimal operating conditions in terms of biogas production and volatile solids removal were at small particle sizes (0.85 mm, the smallest studied) and high total solids concentrations (22.1%, the highest studied).

TI Black Soldier Fly biowaste treatment - Assessment of global warming
   potential
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Cities of low and middle-income countries face severe challenges in managing the increasing amount of waste produced, especially the organic fraction. Black Soldier Fly (BSF) biowaste treatment is an attractive treatment option as it offers a solution for waste management while also providing a protein source to help alleviate the rising global demand for animal feed. However, to-date very little information is available on how this technology performs with regard to direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and global warming potential (GWP).
   This paper presents a study that uses a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach to assess the GWP of a BSF waste treatment facility in the case of Indonesia and compares it with respective values for an open wind-row composting facility. Direct CH4 and N2O samples were extracted from BSF treatment units and analyzed by gas chromatography. Results show that direct CO(2)eq emissions are 47 times lower the emissions from composting. Regarding the overall GWP, the LCA shows that composting has double the GWP of BSF treatment facility based on the functional unit of 1 ton of biowaste (wet weight). The main GWP contribution from a BSF facility are from: (1) residue post-composting (69%) and (2) electricity needs and source (up to 55%). Fishmeal production substitution by BSF larvae meal can reduce significantly the GWP (up to 30%). Based on this study, we conclude that BSF biowaste treatment offers an environmentally relevant alternative with very low direct GHG emissions and potentially high GWP reduction. Further research should improve residue post-treatment. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Developing countries like India are facing a predicament scenario because of the solid waste and hence its management is becoming a critical issue. As urbanization is increasing, enhanced municipal solid waste and its unscientific handling are degrading the urban environment and causing health hazard. Various methods like landfilling (major source of methane (CH4) emissions), incineration, composting have been used, but due to too slow operation, these processes have not fully satisfied the growing needs of the waste management. In this paper, we have shown that how CO2 emissions can be prevented from a coal-fired thermal power plant in Delhi, if a better method, i.e., plasma arc gasification (PAG) process is used forwaste management and power generation using the municipal solid waste generated in the city, which is the need of the hour. The plasma gasification process ensures close loop cycle, thereby reducing the pollutants from the air. We have done a complete analysis of waste generation and emission production, and it is concluded that by this approach we can reduce major pollutants causing global warming due to municipal solid waste. In the present work, we have calculated that technology based on CDM (Clean Development Mechanism) like plasma arc gasification is implemented large amount of carbon dioxide emission can be prevented in addition to power generation that could suffice the energy need of the city.

AB Municipal wastes, be it solid or liquid, are rising due to the global population growth and rapid urbanization and industrialization. Conventional management practice involving recycling, combustion, and treatment/disposal is deemed unsustainable. Solutions must be sought to not only increase the capacity but also improve the sustainability of waste management. Research has demonstrated that the nonrecyclable waste materials and bio-solids can be converted into useable heat, electricity, or fuel and chemical through a variety of processes, including gasification, pyrolysis, anaerobic digestion, and landfill gas in addition to combustion, and wastewater streams have the potential to support algae growth and provide other energy recovery options.

AB Extensive agricultural activities have been shown to degrade soils, promoting research into improving soil quality. One such method is to increase the amount of organic matter in the soil, and domestic organic residues (DOR) are commonly used for this purpose. The environmental impact of DOR-derived products, from production to agricultural application, remains unclear in current research. With the aim to have a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities in DOR management and reuse, this study extended the boundaries of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to include the transport, treatment, and application of treated DOR on a national level while also quantifying soil carbon sequestration that has been less addressed in relevant LCA studies. This study focuses on The Netherlands, where incineration predominates, as a representative case to explore the benefits and trade-offs of moving towards more biotreatment for DOR. Two main biotreatments were considered, composting and anaerobic digestion. The results indicate that biotreatment of kitchen and yard residues generally has higher environmental impacts than incineration, including increased global warming and fine particulate matter formation. However, biotreatment of sewage sludge has lower environmental impacts than incineration. Substitution of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilisers with compost reduces mineral and fossil resource scarcity. In fossil-based energy systems like The Netherlands, replacing incineration with anaerobic digestion yields the highest benefit for fossil resource scarcity (61.93 %) due to energy recovery from biogas and the predominant use of fossil resources in the Dutch energy system. These findings indicate that replacing incineration with biotreatment of DOR may not benefit all impact categories in LCA. The environmental performance of substituted products can significantly influence the environmental benefits of increased biotreatment. Future studies or implementation of increased biotreatment should consider trade-offs and local context.

TI SWOT analysis of waste management practices in Chandigarh, India and
   prospects for sustainable cities
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Unscientific disposal of solid waste is common in developing countries, which leads to various environment and human health issues. Considering this, the present study critically investigated the current practices of municipal solid waste (MSW) management in Chandigarh using strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) approach for better policy options. Chandigarh city generates approximately 350 TPD of MSW; which comprises mainly of compostable organics (50-55%), inorganics (15-20%) and inert (19-23%) fraction. The unprocessed MSW has calorific value of 1547 kcal kg(-1) with average moisture content of 50%. The moisture content of the MSW varied significantly in different socio-economic groups including amount of waste generated and its chemical composition (e.g. C, H, N and S). SWOT analysis of MSW management practices highlighted that a single technology (such as refuse drive fuel, RDF) is not effective for complete management of various solid wastes, and hence city specific combination of technologies (e.g. Bio-methanation plant, composting / vermi-composting and recycling unit) should be adopted for sustainable waste management and to reduce its adverse impact. Further, findings of SWOT approach could help in developing a strategic action plans for sustainable cities involving community, private sector and municipal authorities.

TI Management of solid urban waste in Feira de Santana: energy demand and
   carbon footprint
SO ENGENHARIA SANITARIA E AMBIENTAL
AB Municipal Solid Waste Management with the material disposal in landfills is a widely adopted practice in Brazil. The environmental performance quantification in MSWM supports the proposition of optimized practices. The Life Cycle Assessment was applied to evaluate 1 ton of material in the Municipal Solid Waste Management of Feira de Santana, state of Bahia, Brazil. The system boundary of the Municipal Solid Waste Management in this study included the material managed in collection, transportation, treatment, disposal and leachate handling stages. The material disposal in sanitary landfill was evaluated in the base scenario of Municipal Solid Waste Management and the resource recovery options for material (recycling and composting) and energy (sanitary landfill and anaerobic digestion with biogas collection) in the proposed scenarios of Municipal Solid Waste Management. The foreground inventory used representative data for the evaluated scenarios, while the background inventory used the ecoinvent (TM) database in the Simapro (R) software with the Cumulative Energy Demand and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2013 with 100 years global warming potential methods. Cumulative Energy Demand was 215 MJ.t(-1) and Greenhouse Gas emissions were 449 kg CO(2)eq.t(-1) in the base scenario. The largest contribution in the base scenario was the collection and transportation stage in Cumulative Energy Demand and the sanitary landfill in Greenhouse Gas. The proposed scenarios with resource recovery showed a potential to reduce the Cumulative Energy Demand and Greenhouse Gas emissions in Municipal Solid Waste Management, along with supporting the transition to a circular economy.

TI A multiobjective optimization framework for sustainable design of
   municipal solid waste processing pathways to energy and materials
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH
AB A large quantity of municipal solid waste (MSW) is generated worldwide, and its effective management is a major problem in urban areas or particularly the areas where waste is dumped. Numerous technological alternatives are available for waste treatment, each with different costs and environmental footprints. For sustainable waste management, both economic and environmental aspects should be considered. Therefore, this study addresses the systematic design of processing routes for the sustainable management and utilization of MSW under economic and environmental criteria. To address this, a generic superstructure-based multiobjective optimization framework is developed. MSW superstructure composes of the potential processing routes for the waste management where MSW can be utilized for energy generation and other valuable waste-based products. On the basis of superstructure, we develop a multiobjective mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model that simultaneously maximizes the net profit and minimizes the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The developed optimization model is coded and solved in GAMS to determine the optimal most promising routes for the sustainable processing of MSW. A case of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi is employed to test the applicability of the developed framework. The optimization results emphasize that pathway 2 shows a decent trade-off between economic and environmental objectives, whereas the two most environmentally sustainable processing pathways have the potential to reduce GHG emissions by 58% and 80%, compared with business as usual (BAU) scenario, and also possess potential economic benefits. The insights gained from this analysis guide the municipality planners to devise a promising and sustainable waste management strategy.

AB A fundamental aim of EC and UK waste policy is to make waste management more sustainable by moving it up the waste hierarchy, the emphasis changing from disposal to recycling and recovery. This approach is based on the concept of adopting the best practicable environmental option (BPEO) for individual waste;streams and dealing with waste as close as possible to its place of production (the proximity principle). Change is being driven by legislative and economic instruments such as the Landfill Directive and landfill tax, which seek to restrict the use of landfill for biodegradable municipal waste and make alternatives financially viable in the market-glace. These developments have focused attention on the role of composting as the BPEO for dealing with organic waste, This paper focuses on the potential role of centralized waste composting as part of an integrated municipal waste strategy, It reviews composting options in general terms, including the alternative technology of anaerobic digestion, and comments on the role they can play in a sustainable integrated municipal waste system.

TI A Detailed Characterization of Household Municipal Solid Waste
SO WASTE AND BIOMASS VALORIZATION
AB Purpose: The acquisition of reliable data on Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) composition is very important for the development of environmentally sound, sustainable and economically viable integrated waste management systems. However, no standardized universally accepted waste characterization protocol has been developed, as there are various methodologies described in the relevant literature. In this study, a generic and easy-to-apply MSW sampling and sorting protocol is developed and presented.Methods: The MSW composition characterization was used for the development of an innovative waste management strategy in the Municipality of Halandri (Attica region, Greece). The methodology was applied four times, to study the repeatability of the results, as well as the potential impact of seasonality. In each sampling point one collection bin for each waste stream was employed (mixed waste, recyclables, paper/cardboard and food waste in the region where food waste was separately collected at the source) in order to collect all the separate streams and account for the entire MSW production profile. The sampling points were selected in strictly residential areas (no shops, companies nearby). For 7 consecutive days the content of the bins was collected on a daily basis and transported to a sorting facility, where the content was sorted and weighed.Results: The results repeatedly indicated source separation rates of up to 79% and a level of impurities in the recycling waste source separation and collection streams (recyclables and paper/cardboard) not exceeding 20%.Conclusion: The applied methodology proved to generate accurate results, offering a detailed picture of the Municipal Solid Waste management performance.

TI Exploring the development of municipal solid waste disposal facilities
   in Chinese cities: patterns and drivers
SO FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING
AB Rapid urbanization in Chinese cities has led to a surge in municipal solid waste (MSW) generation, necessitating the development of high-quality MSW disposal facilities. This study utilizes multisource data and regression models to examine the status, development pathways, and driving forces of MSW disposal facilities in China. Our findings reveal an inverted U-shaped relationship between the capacities or numbers of MSW disposal facilities and GDP per capita of cities. Historical data show that cities in East and Southeast China preferred incineration, while cities in West and Central China developed landfills more, largely shaped by the imbalance of development levels and endowments among regions in China. The study also identifies mixed and differentiated influences of socioeconomic factors on capacity expansion and increases in the number of MSW disposal facilities. The results suggest the need for updated construction guidelines and regulations, as well as enhanced technological and managerial capabilities for MSW infrastructure. These findings can inform policymakers and practitioners in their efforts to promote sustainable waste management practices in China. (c) Higher Education Press 2023

TI Waste Mismanagement in Developing Countries: A Review of Global Issues
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Environmental contamination due to solid waste mismanagement is a global issue. Open dumping and open burning are the main implemented waste treatment and final disposal systems, mainly visible in low-income countries. This paper reviews the main impacts due to waste mismanagement in developing countries, focusing on environmental contamination and social issues. The activity of the informal sector in developing cities was also reviewed, focusing on the main health risks due to waste scavenging. Results reported that the environmental impacts are pervasive worldwide: marine litter, air, soil and water contamination, and the direct interaction of waste pickers with hazardous waste are the most important issues. Many reviews were published in the scientific literature about specific waste streams, in order to quantify its effect on the environment. This narrative literature review assessed global issues due to different waste fractions showing how several sources of pollution are affecting the environment, population health, and sustainable development. The results and case studies presented can be of reference for scholars and stakeholders for quantifying the comprehensive impacts and for planning integrated solid waste collection and treatment systems, for improving sustainability at a global level.

TI Energetic, economic, and environmental perspectives of power generation
   from residual biomass in Saudi Arabia
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The utilization of biomass energy is important from both an energetic and environmental point of view. Saudi Arabia has a considerable amount of biomass waste that can be converted to renewable energy using different technologies. This study evaluated and analyzed the quantity and energy potential of biomass waste, Greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, and cost estimation of power generation using different conversion techniques. The results showed that the annual biomass waste in Saudi Arabia could reach approximately 31.50 million tons, which can generate 15 TWh of electricity. Municipal solid waste (MSW) is the largest contribution to the total waste and total power generation potential, which is approximately 70% and 74% of the total, respectively. Although incineration of MSW has the highest cost requirements, it has the highest power generation potential compared with the other studied techniques. However, the anaerobic digestion of other biomass types has the advantages of low costs and GHG emissions and generates considerable energy. The findings of this study can support decision-makers in developing sustainability strategies using eco-friendly and economical technologies for efficient power generation from biomass wastes.

TI A multi-criteria analysis of options for energy recovery from municipal
   solid waste in India and the UK
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Energy recovery from municipal solid waste plays a key role in sustainable waste management and energy security. However, there are numerous technologies that vary in suitability for different economic and social climates. This study sets out to develop and apply a multi-criteria decision making methodology that can be used to evaluate the trade-offs between the benefits, opportunities, costs and risks of alternative energy from waste technologies in both developed and developing countries. The technologies considered are mass burn incineration, refuse derived fuel incineration, gasification, anaerobic digestion and landfill gas recovery. By incorporating qualitative and quantitative assessments, a preference ranking of the alternative technologies is produced. The effect of variations in decision criteria weightings are analysed in a sensitivity analysis. The methodology is applied principally to compare and assess energy recovery from waste options in the UK and India. These two countries have been selected as they could both benefit from further development of their waste-to-energy strategies, but have different technical and socio-economic challenges to consider. It is concluded that gasification is the preferred technology for the UK, whereas anaerobic digestion is the preferred technology for India. We believe that the presented methodology will be of particular value for waste-to-energy decisionmakers in both developed and developing countries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO PROCESSES
AB Food waste accounts for a substantial portion of the organic waste generated at an increasing rate worldwide. Organic waste, including food waste, is largely subjected to landfill disposal, incineration, and anaerobic digestion; however, more sustainable methods are needed for treating it. Treatment of organic waste using black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) larvae is an environmentally safe and cost-efficient method that has been attracting increasing attention worldwide. Black soldier fly decomposes various types of organic waste and converts them into high-value biomasses such as oils and proteins. This review introduces the trends in research related to the treatment of organic waste by black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) larvae (BSFL) and their bioconversion efficiencies in Asian countries. Perspectives on the growth of BSFL during waste treatment operation and optimal rearing conditions are provided. The trends in studies related to the application of BSFL as biofuel and animal feed are also discussed. Such use of BSFL would be beneficial in Asia, especially in countries where the technology for processing organic waste is not readily available. This review may provide further directions of investigations including culture techniques for industrial scale applications of BSFL in food waste treatment and resource production in Asian countries.

TI Stakeholders? social acceptance of a new organic waste management policy
   in the city of Florian?opolis (Brazil)
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Incorrect organic waste management can lead to several environmental and health threats. The literature shows that municipalities are adopting several strategies to reduce the improper disposal of organic waste. In 2019, Florian ' opolis, Brazil, became the first Brazilian state capital to approve a law on mandatory organic waste separation and composting, the Florian ' opolis composting law (FCL). Nevertheless, the successful implementation of this new regulation relies on acceptance among urban stakeholders and civil society. The role of social acceptance has not been investigated when dealing with new waste management regulations. To this end, 37 qualitative interviews with local stakeholders were conducted to determine the key factors influencing the acceptance of the FCL by analyzing stakeholders' perceptions of the relevant risks, benefits, hindering and promoting factors. The results show that the law could represent an important first step toward a sustainable municipal solid waste management system; however, several risks may arise in the absence of adequate moni-toring systems. These risks are mainly linked to water contamination and health issues due to harmful insect proliferation. Furthermore, even though Florian ' opolis society seems culturally open, the lack of infrastructure and investments in the city could hinder the effectiveness of the law. Strategies for improving the law's effec-tiveness should be focused on supporting the existing formal and informal composting initiatives that have become widespread in recent decades. This could lead to a decentralized organic waste management system that empowers local initiatives and reduces the initial costs of implementing new composting systems and increases the separation rates at the household level.

TI Moderate separation of household kitchen waste towards global
   optimization of municipal solid waste management
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The sorting treatment of food waste is gradually considered as an available strategy to improve the sustainability of municipal solid waste (MSW) management, but the separation of household kitchen waste (HKW), the main component of food waste, is controversial because of its disperse sources and possible social cost. Social life cycle assessment is applied in this study to integrate environmental, economic, and social analyses, including the time investment of households, aiming to assess the influence of HKW separation comprehensively. The results show HKW separation at different separation rates improve the environmental performance of MSW treatment. When HKW separation rate increases by every 20 percentages, the net carbon emission reduces 5-7%, the acidic gas emission reduces by 3.1-3.5%, and the cumulative energy demand decreases by approximately 2.1-2.2%, owing to the higher heat value of incineration feedstock and more yield of energy products. HKW separation increases the energy consumption of waste collection and transportation system, but its contribution to the overall energy consumption is very limited. The whole MSW management system also has better economic performance along with more HKW separation and more energy output. In contrary, a huge amount of time cost of households increases the total social cost of MSWmanagement, making HWK separation not an attractive option. From the point of view of residents, the external cost, including environmental cost and household time cost, should not exceed zero to ensure residents obtain some benefits from HKW separation, implying that HKW separation rate of 20% is acceptable. HKW water content and proportion in MSWare the two sensitive factors influencing the comprehensive performance of MSW management. Source HKW draining to water content 60% and source reduction by 30% can decrease the total social cost by 124-215% and 66-73%, respectively. The two effective measures are easy and convenient for residents to carry out with significant improvement of social sustainability of MSW management. Based on the effects on social cost, the priority of HKW management strategies should be given to source draining and then source reduction, followed by source separation from MSW at 20%.

AB There is a huge potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the way of disposing municipal solid waste (MSW), and the important role of MSW in global greenhouse gas emissions has attracted much attention. Based on the composition of Tianjin MSW and its content, collaborative emission reduction of three main MSW disposal ways were analysis, including landfill without landfill gas (LFG) utilization (S1), landfill with LFG utilization (S2), and incineration (S3). Taking Tianjin Binhai municipal solid waste incineration power generation CDM project and Tianjin Shuangkou landfill gas recovery and electricity generation CDM project as examples, the calculation methods provided by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines were used to calculate the greenhouse gas emissions and emission reductions, and then compared the collaborative emission reductions of the three scenarios.

TI Assessment of key parameters in municipal solid waste management: a
   prerequisite for sustainability
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
AB Municipal solid waste management was studied for 1 year in a representative urban area of Lahore city for environmental sustainability. The effects of financial status of the household and the seasonal variations on generation rate and compositions of municipal solid waste (MSW) were determined. MSW generation rate and the economic status of the households were positively correlated (p<0.05). Seasonal variations observed were significant only for organics (p=0.001), plastics (p=0.008) and food waste fractions (p=0.009) in MSW. Response surface regression model developed and analysed by Minitab-15 (R) showed that the interaction of season and different economic zones of the town on the MSW generation rate was non-significant (p=0.334). Elemental and heating value analyses of the mixed organic fractions in kitchen waste had carbon 47.93%, hydrogen 6.20%, nitrogen 2.24%, sulphur 0.23%, oxygen 39.01%, and C and N ratio 27.78. Findings concluded that food waste was 56% of total MSW with 71.03% moisture content and a modest heating value of 5566J/g. Existing temporary storage capacity of MSW is 51% of the total MSW generated considering the weighted MSW generation rate of 0.57kg/person/day calculated in this study. Composting could be a possible final disposal option due to high moisture and organic content and can be studied in future research. Development of a transfer station, introduction of home composting programmes and awareness towards proper segregation and reduction of waste at the household level is suggested to attain sustainability in the MSW management system.

TI Biochemical methane potential assessment of municipal solid waste
   generated in Asian cities: A case study of Karachi, Pakistan
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) generation rate in Asian cities is exponentially increasing with rise in urbanization and commercial activities. Beside this, the cities in developing Asia are deficient in adequate waste management and facing energy shortage as well. The ineffectual waste management practice is one of the main causative factors behind the negative repercussions on public health and environment. This paper provides an estimation of power generation potential along with economic and environmental benefits of biochemical methane pro-duction from MSW. The biochemical methane potential (BMP) test of the MSW generated in Karachi, Pakistan was conducted by using the fresh synthetic waste sample. Through the analysis of the results obtained in this study and available data of the MSW generation (quantity, organic fraction and moisture content) in Karachi it is estimated that, every year about 5600 tons of methane are being wasted to atmosphere adding enormous share in global climate change. This study estimated that, about 63 MWe electric power can be generated by establishing biowaste digestion plants with power generation facilities in the city. The generated power can contribute 2.1% share in daily power supply and 21% power shortage can be reduced as well. Additionally, about 401.3 million-PKRs (2.6 million-US$) revenue can be earned every year by selling the power generated by utilizing the MSW in waste to energy plants. Moreover, 0.13 Mt CO2-eq/annum greenhouse effect caused by methane emissions from open disposal of MSW can be eliminated.

TI Recalcitrant compounds formation, their toxicity, and mitigation: Key
   issues in biomass pretreatment and anaerobic digestion
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Increasing energy demands and environmental issues have stressed the importance of sustainable methods of energy production. Anaerobic digestion (AD) of the biodegradable waste, i.e., agricultural residues, organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW), sewage sludge, etc., results in the production of biogas, which is a sustainable and cost feasible technique that reduces the dependence on fossil fuels and also overcomes the problems associated with biomass waste management. To solubilize the organic matter and enhance the susceptibility of hardly biodegradable fraction (i.e., lignocellulosic) for hydrolysis and increase methane production, several pretreatments, including physical, chemical, biological, and hybrid methods have been studied. However, these pretreatment methods under specific operating conditions result in the formation of recalcitrant compounds, such as sugars (xylose, Xylo-oligomers), organic acids (acetic, formic, levulinic acids), and lignin derivatives (poly and mono-phenolic compounds), causing significant inhibitory effects on anaerobic digestion. During the scaling up of these techniques from laboratory to industrial level, the focus on managing inhibitory compounds formed during pretreatment is envisaged to increase because of the need to use recalcitrant feedstocks in anaerobic digestion to increase biogas productivity. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the production mechanism of inhibitory compounds during pretreatment and work out the possible detoxification methods to improve anaerobic digestion. This paper critically reviews the earlier works based on the formation of recalcitrant compounds during feedstocks pretreatment under variable conditions, and their detrimental effects on process performance. The technologies to mitigate recalcitrant toxicity are also comprehensively discussed.

TI Carbon footprint and energy use of food waste management options for
   fresh fruit and vegetables from supermarkets
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Food waste is a problem with economic, environmental and social implications, making it both important and complex. Previous studies have addressed food waste management options at the less prioritised end of the waste hierarchy, but information on more prioritised levels is also needed when selecting the best available waste management options. Investigating the global warming potential and primary energy use of different waste management options offers a limited perspective, but is still important for validating impacts from the waste hierarchy in a local context. This study compared the effect on greenhouse gas emissions and primary energy use of different food waste management scenarios in the city of Vaxjo, Sweden. A life cycle assessment was performed for four waste management scenarios (incineration, anaerobic digestion, conversion and donation), using five food products (bananas, tomatoes, apples, oranges and sweet peppers) from the fresh fruit and vegetables department in two supermarkets as examples when treated as individual waste streams. For all five waste streams, the established waste hierarchy was a useful tool for prioritising the various options, since the re-use options (conversion and donation) reduced the greenhouse gas emissions and the primary energy use to a significantly higher degree than the energy recovery options (incineration and anaerobic digestion). The substitution of other products and services had a major impact on the results in all scenarios. Re-use scenarios where food was replaced therefore had much higher potential to reduce environmental impact than the energy recovery scenarios where fossil fuel was replaced. This is due to the high level of resources needed to produce food compared with production of fossil fuels, but also to fresh fruit and vegetables having a high water content, making them inefficient as energy carriers. Waste valorisation measures should therefore focus on directing each type of food to the waste management system that can substitute the most resource demanding products or services, even when the whole waste flow cannot be treated with the same method.

TI Eco-efficiency optimization for municipal solid waste management
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Carbon emission from municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment is one of the anthropogenic sources to cause climate change, which accounts for 3-5% of global greenhouse gas emissions according to the report of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). At the same time, the gases and liquid discharged from MSW treatment can also cause other environmental impacts, such as climate change, photochemical ozone synthesis, and acidification, especially in huge city with huge population as Beijing, China. This paper proposed an eco-efficiency analysis method, which aimed to yield maximum overall environmental improvement per unit investment cost during its life cycle processing. This method took the overall reduction in the environmental impact of MSW treatment using cost-effective techniques as the objective to optimize waste disposal systems. The separation ratio during MSW collection and the proportion of techniques used for treatment were the major indicators for optimization measures. For Beijing, an increase in the waste separation ratio during collection proved to be the most effective measure, with an eco-efficiency score of 0.144. Adjustment of the proportion of treatment techniques used was less eco-efficient, with an increase in the proportion of composting being the most effective approach. Based on real needs, the objective should be to reduce the proportion of landfills used and increase the amount of composting and incineration. This optimization measure had the lowest cost and an eco-efficiency score of 0.0461, which is 60% higher than that for the measure with the lowest eco-efficiency. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Composting of municipal solid waste is an emerging area in India with great prospects as well as constraints. These developments can be examined from the waste management, agricultural and climate change scenario. The technology is simple and affordable, the product is beneficial for soil and significant saving of land (required for land-filling) is achieved. However, public-private partnership efforts are constrained due to quality requirements, marketing and pricing issues. This paper assesses the current scenario in the light of past developments, its role and potential in the Indian context and ways to make it sustainable on a long-term basis.

AB Management of healthcare waste has gained wide attention in the recent years. This work reviews recent sustainable management of healthcare waste practices, the importance of legalizations, role of clinical waste producing bodies, emerging management trends, and treatment technologies. Furthermore, waste generated in the treatment processes and the health and environmental impacts of recent technologies are also examined. Sustainable assessment of technologies, to this point, revealed that in often cases, autoclave assisted with shredder could be a better alternative for the treatment of hazardous healthcare wastes while landfilling of healthcare waste received the lowest ranking. Studies are required to consider more reliable assessment methods for treatment technologies. This work can serve educators, researchers, as well as all the medical staff from nurses to doctors and volunteers who tirelessly contribute to the society in keeping people away from many diseases including the current global pandemic outbreak due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 through the best and most sustainable practices in medical waste management.

TI Comparative study of municipal solid waste treatment technologies using
   life cycle assessment method
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The aim of the study is to analyze three different waste treatment technologies by life cycle assessment tool. Sanitary Landfill, Incineration and gasification-pyrolysis of the waste treatment technologies are studied in SimaPro software based on input-output materials flow. SimaPro software has been applied for analyzing environmental burden by different impact categories. All technologies are favorable to abiotic and ozone layer depletion due to energy recovery from the waste treatment facilities. Sanitary landfill has the significantly lower environmental impact among other thermal treatment while gases are used for fuel with control emission environment. However, sanitary landfill has significant impact on photochemical oxidation, global warming and acidification. Among thermal technology, pyrolysis-gasification is comparatively more favorable to environment than incineration in global warming, acidification, eutrophication and eco-toxicity categories. Landfill with energy recovery facilities is environmentally favorable. However, due to large land requirement, difficult emission control system and long time span, restriction on land filling is applying more in the developed countries. Pyrolysis-gasification is more environmental friendly technology than incineration due to higher energy recovery efficiency. Life cycle assessment is an effective tool to analyze waste treatment technology based on environmental performances.

TI Composting to Recycle Biowaste
SO SOCIOLOGY, ORGANIC FARMING, CLIMATE CHANGE AND SOIL SCIENCE
SE Sustainable Agriculture Reviews
AB If agriculture is to be made sustainable, few activities like composting are very important. Composting not only allows organic waste of agricultural origin to be recycled and returned to the soil, but also provides a solution for managing much of the waste, which is currently a major problem. If urban organic waste is selectively collected and composted, it no longer represents a problem for the city, and, if wisely applied, will enrich the soil, thus promoting the preservation or improvement of the organic matter reserves of the soil, an important component in the soil protection strategy of the EU. This review paper considers up-to-date aspects of our knowledge on composting, presenting a discussion of materials suitable for composting, the composting process itself, and the biochemical and microbiological aspects of this process. Special attention has been given to the question of maturity, marking the end of the composting process, and to the quality of the end-product. Although it is not part of the composing process, information is also provided on the related field of anaerobic digestion. The use of municipal solid waste (MSW) compost in agriculture has many benefits to soil, crops, and environment. If the fermentation is correctly managed, pathogens are killed during the heat period. Compost can reduce the incidence of variant plant diseases. A very important parameter for the composting material is the C/N ratio, the optimal value is 25-30. Composting recycles organic household, yard waste, and manure into useful humus-like end-product, the compost. There Lire two major approaches to composting. In active (hot) composting there is high temperature and the end-product has high quality, while passive composting is slower and is more common in the garden composting. Composting is a microbiological process, done by aerobic bacteria. The microbes can be classified to the metabolic types on the carbon and energy sources utilized by the cell. Compost is used in the agriculture as organic fertilizer; there is organic matter input to the soil and also reduces P fixation. Maturity means in what stage, of the composting process the material has progressed, and in the mature compost the biological activity has slowed. The maturity can be estimated by the ON ratio, oxygen uptake, and germination test. The parameters for the assured compost quality label are the potentially toxic element content, the organic pollutants, and the hygienic requirements. In the European Union, composting the recycling of biowaste, becomes one solution of sustainable agriculture. It plays an important role in the developing countries also. Although it is not part of the composing process, information is also provided on the related field of anaerobic digestion: it is an alternative way of recycling biowaste producing biogas.

SO DETRITUS
AB The effectiveness of an existing integrated waste treatment plant aimed at the total recovery of waste to replace primary energy was investigated. The cumulative energy demand (CED) (MJ) was quantified using a life cycle approach. Mass and energy balances were determined for all the main inlet and outlet energetic and mass flows from the integrated plant. The current scenario was compared with a modified one where the amount of bio-waste processed was increased by using a new anaerobic digestion section for bio-methane production. The main results showed that there was a higher positive CED for the chemicals needed for operating the flue gas cleaning system. In particular urea gave the highest CED. In both the base and modified case the CED replaced by the recovered energy and fuels was higher than all the CED associated with the inlet flows, leading to a negative value of the net CED.

In Pakistan, neither MSW collection nor disposal is effective due to the lack of institutional, administrative and financial arrangements. The MSW collection rate is about 60% and remainder 40% is leftover either in streets or vacant plots. Pakistan requires an economic and sustainable technology to achieve prompt solution for MSW collection and disposal problems in the country. Whereas, China has shown a progressive improvement in MSW management. Landfilling is a predominant and cost-effective method of MSW management in China. Also it has been revealed that MSW in China is treated by incineration. Whereas, there is neither engineered landfill nor any waste-to-energy treatment facility in Pakistan. Additionally, this study suggests a future potential investment in the waste management sector under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor project.

TI Metamorphosing waste as a resource: Scaling waste management by
   ecomodernist means
SO GEOFORUM
AB Informed by the European Union's waste hierarchy, UK policy has normatively shifted the ontological status of waste from matter out of place to a resource for which uses must be found in order to achieve environmental goals of decarbonisation and waste reduction. Technologies linking waste-management with renewable energy have been supported within an ecomodernist framework of market incentives for stimulating private-sector investment in new waste treatment technologies. Under pressure of EU targets, the UK's policy measures have had several aims: to reduce landfill disposal, increase resource recycling or reuse, expand waste-based renewable energy and thus reduce GHG emissions. As techno-market-fixes, new facilities were meant to convert waste for more beneficial uses, bring it up the hierarchy and localise its management. Consequent tensions can be illuminated by linking concepts of technology scaling and socio-material metamorphosis with critical perspectives on ecomodemism.
   Although the ecomodernist framework stimulated some waste-management improvements, other outcomes contradict the policy objectives of localising and converting waste for more beneficial uses. These contrary outcomes are illustrated by two technologies, anaerobic digestion (AD) and mechanical and biological treatment (MBT), each with multiple possible spatial scalings and techno-configurations. Financial instruments have most incentivised the easiest socio-material metamorphosis for lucrative returns, especially to produce energy (electricity or gas) for grid systems, suiting large operators. For more environmentally beneficial uses of waste, there have been difficulties in overcoming its recalcitrance for producing commercially viable outputs, e.g. digestate replacing chemical fertilisers, compost improving soil and 'dirty' plastics replacing virgin plastics. Techno-configurations and material flows have been scaled towards global goods, distant from the feedstock source. Through the ecomodernist framework, the state's responsibility for such outcomes has been blurred with the private sector and shifted to anonymous markets.

AB Food waste (FW) is one of the most important components of municipal solid waste, including household food waste, food processing waste, canteens and restaurant waste. The accumulation of FW has gradually become a global problem. The FW has the characteristics of high organic matter content, high moisture content, easy spoilage and deterioration, and is easy to produce toxins and malodorous gases during transportation and treatment, thereby polluting the environment. Anaerobic digestion can effectively recover energy from organic waste, and is a common method of handling FW. Anaerobic fermentation techniques, including traditional anaerobic digestion and two-phase anaerobic digestion, are common methods for handling FW. This paper describes the current status of these two methods in FW treatment.

TI Identification of decisive factors for greenhouse gas emissions in
   comparative life cycle assessments of food waste management - an
   analytical review
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB A review of existing life cycle assessments on food waste management was made with two main aims. Firstly, to make an overview of the assessments of the global warming potential from the treatment alternatives incineration, landfill, anaerobic digestion and compost in studies reported in literature. Secondly, to identify decisive factors in general and related to system boundary settings in particular, in reviewed studies. A number of criteria were constructed for identification of relevant comparative life cycle assessments, resulting in selection of nineteen studies, containing 103 different scenarios. The systematic investigation of the studies show examples of several methodological differences as well as choices in systems boundary setting causing misleading comparisons between different treatment options, but also large variations in used input data for modeling of similar processes. The review also shows that the most significant differences in global warming results in many cases can be explained by assumptions made in relation to the background system, rather than by differences in data on emissions surging from to the foreground system. Especially assumptions on the interaction of the waste management system with the background energy system and/or bio-system were found to be decisive to the results. This highlights the importance of identification of induced and displaced marginal products in the modeling of system expansion, as well as need for increased transparency and use of sensitivity analyses related to assumptions made in background system modeling, in order to reveal under which set of assumptions results gained in the assessment are valid.

TI Life Cycle Assessment and Techno-Economic Analysis for Anaerobic
   Digestion as Cow Manure Management System
SO ENERGIES
AB Clean electricity is generated by the anaerobic digestion of biomass waste. The environmental impacts of various biomass waste feedstocks vary, while co-digestion has been reported to improve anaerobic digestion performance. A consequential life-cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic analysis (TEA) are carried out for cow manure waste management for a cow farm. Three scenarios are considered in this study: (S1) mono-digestion of cow manure, (S2) co-digestion of cow manure and maize silage, and (S3) co-digestion of cow manure with cow feed waste, sewage sludge, and returned dairy products. The LCA aims to quantify the environmental impact of each MWh of electricity generated, assuming the plant is located in Malaysia, using OpenLCA software. The TEA economic parameters are quantified and compared between the three scenarios. Net present value (NPV), Internal Return Rate (IRR), and Return of Investment (ROI) are examined. Among the three scenarios, S2 with maize cultivation has a higher environmental impact due to its higher energy requirements. With the integration of closed digestate storage and renewable energy-powered electricity, S3 has the best environmental performance in global warming, eutrophication and acidification. S3 is found to be most economically viable, with MYR 1.28 million NPV, 14% IRR, and 15% ROI, and a Payback Period of 6.56 years with an OPEX of MYR 3491.82/MWh.

TI Environmental Impact Evaluation of University Integrated Waste
   Management System in India Using Life Cycle Analysis
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Decarbonization of university campuses by integrating scientific waste approaches and circular economy principles is the need-of-the-hour. Universities, the maximum energetic corporations and places for clinical studies and social activities, have a duty to assemble low-carbon campuses and play a vital function in lowering CO2 emissions. An environmental life cycle assessment was conducted to compare proposed municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment systems with the existing system in the residential university campus (RUC) in Kharagpur, West Bengal (India). The results show the existing MSW disposal practice in RUC (baseline scenario has the highest GWP (1388 kg CO2 eq), which can potentially be reduced by adopting integrated waste management system with source segregation as represented in futuristic scenarios (S2-50% sorting) and (S3-90% sorting)). Compared to S1, GHG emission was reduced by 50.9% in S2 and by 86.5% in S3. Adopting anaerobic digestion and engineered landfill without energy recovery offsets the environmental emissions and contributes to significant environmental benefits in terms of ecological footprints. Capital goods play a pivotal role in mitigation the environmental emissions. The shift towards S2 and S3 requires infrastructure for waste collection and sorting will contribute to reduction of associated environmental costs in the long-term.

TI Sustainable waste management and waste to energy: Valuation of energy
   potential of MSW in the Greater Bay Area of China
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB The increasing amount of municipal solid waste (MSW) is not only a challenge to our society, but also an opportunity for regional sustainable development. In this paper, we estimate the energy potential of waste through two different waste disposal methods, landfills and incineration, by the years 2030 and 2060, using the Greater Bay Area of China as an example. Also, we estimate the carbon dioxide emission reductions by energy recovery through the two disposal methods. In this paper, a waste generation model and the IPCC default method are used. Our results show that the maximum potential of electricity production from MSW for the GBA could reach 31,346 GWh by 2030 and 77,748 GWh by 2060. Based on these results, we discuss the differences in energy generation efficiency among cities and offer advice to policy makers to mitigate the gap. We suggest that incineration is preferrable compared to landfill from both aspects of energy recovery and climate concern. Furthermore, municipal governments should accelerate waste classification to lower the heating value of MSW in order to increase efficiency.

TI Phosphorus recovery from municipal solid waste incineration fly ash
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The potential of phosphorus (P) recycling from municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) residue is investigated. Vast and ever increasing amounts of incineration residues are produced worldwide; these are an environmental burden, but also a resource, as they are a major sink for the material flows of society. Due to strict environmental regulations, in combination with decreasing landfilling space, the disposal of the MSWI residues is problematic. At the same time, resource scarcity is recognized as a global challenge for the modern world, and even more so for future generations.
   This paper reports on the methods and efficiency of P extraction from MSWI fly ash by acid and base leaching and precipitation procedures. Phosphorus extracted from the MSWI residues generated each year could meet 30% of the annual demand for mineral phosphorus fertiliser in Sweden, given a recovery rate of 70% achieved in this initial test.
   The phosphorus content of the obtained product is slightly higher than in sewage sludge, but due to the trace metal content it is not acceptable for application to agricultural land in Sweden, whereas application in the rest of the EU would be possible. However, it would be preferable to use the product as a raw material to replace rock phosphate in fertilizer production. Further development is currently underway in relation to procedure optimization, purification of the phosphorus product, and the simultaneous recovery of other resources. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI A review on composting of oil palm biomass
SO ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB Nowadays, the biomass produced in oil palm industry, such as oil palm fronds, palm pressed fibers, palm kernel shells, empty fruit bunch, and liquid waste discharged from the palm oil mill effluent and others, may lead to significant environmental concerns. The quantity of produced wastes by oil palm industry is increasing with the growth of this industry day by day. Therefore, the use of these wastes as compost is considered by researchers to overcome their negative impacts and recycle them to produce a useful byproduct for agriculture. This review analyzes the recent composting studies on palm oil biomass and provides useful information about the potential uses of these biomass in composting as an alternative method for enhanced and sustainable use of biomass produced from oil palm industry. In addition, environmental impacts of composting are discussed. This knowledge could build a platform for researchers in this area to understand the recent developments in palm oil biomass composting by means of addressing the environmental pollution concerns as well.

AB Solid waste management, modification of solid waste to useful material without producing any hazardous effect to environment. In environmental engineering management of solid waste plays main roll to keep the environment safe, sources of solid waste from various disciplines, collection, segregation as bio-degradable solid waste, non biodegradable solid waste, hazardous waste, managing of solid waste by technological methods including composting, incineration, sanitary land fill, and chemical neutralization.
   I estimated that the overall average weekly household waste generated is around 6.5kg per household in the studied enumeration areas; this results into 7.5kg per household per week in nalgonda town. The level of waste generated weekly is more dependent on the number of people living within the household. Rapid urbanization, industrialization and globalization are exerting a severe pressure on the environment through many ways including production of huge quantities of organic solid waste. Hence the environmental problems have emphasized for better utilization of waste for various purposes involving suitable cost-effective technologies the present bibliography has been abstracted and is arranged in categories corresponding to the various administration, engineering, and operational phases of solid-waste management

TI Areas on which to focus when seeking to reduce the greenhouse gas
   emissions of commercial waste management. A case study of a hypermarket,
   Finland
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB This study focuses on commercial waste, which has received less attention than household waste in regards to greenhouse gas emission research. First, the global warming potential (GWP) of commercial waste management was calculated. Second, the impacts of different waste fractions and the processes of waste management were recognised. Third, the key areas on which to focus when aiming to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of commercial waste management were determined.
   This study was conducted on the waste generated by a real hypermarket in South-East Finland and included eight different waste fractions. The waste treatment plants were selected based on the actual situation. Three different scenarios were employed to evaluate the environmental impact of managing mixed waste: landfilling, combustion and more accurate source separation. The GaBi software and impact assessment methodology CML 2001 were used to perform a life cycle assessment of the environmental impacts associated with the waste management.
   The results indicated that the total GWP of commercial waste management could be reduced by 93% by directing the mixed waste to combustion instead of landfill. A further 5% GWP reduction could be achieved by more accurate source separation of the mixed waste. Utilisation of energy waste had the most significant influence (41-52%) on the total GWP (-880 to -860 kgCO(2)-eq./t), followed by landfilling of mixed waste (influence 15-23% on the total GWP, 430 kgCO2-eq./t), recycling polyethylene (PE) plastic (influence 18-21% on the total GWP, -1800 kgCO(2)-eq./t) and recycling cardboard (influence 11-13% on the total GWP, 51 kgCO(2)-eq./t). A key focus should be placed on treatment processes and substitutions, especially in terms of substitutions of energy waste and PE plastic. This study also clarified the importance of sorting PE plastic, even though the share of this waste fraction was not substantial.
   The results of this paper were compared to those of previous studies. The output of this analysis indicated that the total GWP can be significantly reduced by identifying an alternative recycling or incineration location for cardboard where it is used to substitute virgin material or replace fossil fuels respectively. In conclusion, it is essential to note that waste management companies have a notable influence on the emissions of commercial waste management because they choose the places at which the waste fractions are treated and utilised.

TI Utilization of energy from waste potential in Turkey as distributed
   secondary renewable energy source
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB Running out of fossil fuels and rising of environmental issues pressurize energy policies in the direction of increasing renewable energy utilization. As a part of full-recycling scheme, Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) can be accounted as an alternative and prevalent source of renewable energy for smart grid applications. This study presents a case study investigating the future of dry combustion in Turkey and gives some projections on Energy from Waste (EfW) utilization potentials as secondary local generators. EfW potential of MSW incineration plants is modeled depending on MSW mass function. An empirical formula for prediction of EfW potential of Turkey is derived by curve fitting to yearly MSW data. Dependence of EfW potential on human population is modeled and thus spread of EfW potential over the territory of Anatolia landscape is illustrated. Analyses reveal that EfW has a potential to be local source of renewable energy for future smart grids due to the fact that EfW exhibits energy generation distribution correlated with city population. We concluded that EfW incineration plants can act on sustainable development of Turkey by serving as a consistent, distributed, near-field generators integrated to waste management systems of cities.

TI The application of Life Cycle Assessment to Integrated Solid Waste
   Management - Part 1 - Methodology
SO PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
AB Integrated Waste Management is one of the holistic approaches to environmental and resource management which are emerging from applying the concept of sustainable development. Assessment of waste management options requires application of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). This paper summarizes the methodology for applying LCA to Integrated Waste Management of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) developed for and now used by the UK Environment Agency, including recent developments in international fora. Particular attention is devoted to system definition leading to rational and clear compilation of the Life Cycle Inventory, with appropriate 'credit' for recovering materials and/or energy from the waste. LCA of waste management is best seen as a way of structuring information to help decision processes.

SO EPITOANYAG-JOURNAL OF SILICATE BASED AND COMPOSITE MATERIALS
AB Cement production demands large amounts of energy. The European cement industry has been increasingly substituting, for many years, natural resources with various alternative fuels, recovered from selected industrial by-product. Various waste streams suitable to cement production in terms of certain criteria (process, environment, product quality and health and safety), in order to be able to supply the society needs in a sustainable way.
   In the first part of the article the Hungarian waste management and the status of sewage sludge have been shown. The different energy-related utilizations of sludge are also compared. The use of alternative fuels in cement manufacture has many advantages for environment, society, economy and industry, so the possibility of cement industrial utilization always has to be taken into account when choosing among the waste-treatment procedures. There are some critical parameters of the burning of sewage sludge (such as high emission, heavy metals content, etc.), but if these problems are solved, then cement production can get away from large amount of sewage sludge in an environment sound way.
   Finally, some conclusions have been made about the Hungarian situation in the field of sewage sludge recycling.

TI Sustainability of the anaerobic digestion of oil refinery secondary
   sludge
SO BIOENGINEERED
AB Among the waste generated at oil refineries, secondary sludge from biological wastewater treatment processes (activated sludge systems) stands out. This paper aimed to assess the use of anaerobic digestion (AD) to treat sludge by SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat) analysis, ranking the different factors based on sustainability criteria. Additionally, the SWOT factors were matched (TOWS matrix) to help interpret the results. AD was found to be compatible with sustainability. The results demonstrated that the strength of AD (reduced organic load) compensates for its weaknesses (need for operational control and initial implementation costs), thereby avoiding the threat (sludge composition) and making the most of the opportunity (lower disposal cost). AD and co-digestion (added with food waste) used to treat oil refinery sludge showed that around 60% of the factors analyzed were confirmed experimentally. It was concluded that AD should be considered in the sustainable treatment of oil refinery waste activated sludge, especially when mixed with other readily biodegradable wastes.

TI Bi-Level Decision-Making Approach for GHG Emissions Control and
   Municipal Solid Waste Management under Parameter Uncertainty: A Case
   Study in Beijing, China
SO POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
AB Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from municipal solid waste (MSW) management significantly contribute to high global warming potential (GWP). However, most studies have failed to facilitate identifying MSW management schemes capable of comprehensively meeting the goals from decision-makers at different hierarchical levels under uncertainties. This study develops an inexact bi-level linear programming (IBLP) model for collaborative control of GHG emissions and waste management in Beijing: MGU-MCL. The MGU-MCL model implies a leader-follower decision process, with the environmental sector providing the upper-level objective and the local authority dominating the lower-level objective. Then, an interactive fuzzy possiblistic approach is introduced to represent the satisfactory degrees of different decision-making levels. Results show that the MGU-MCL model decisions would reduce GHG emissions by about 9%, but increase management costs by 4% compared with the decisions from conventional models; the contribution of the landfill facilities to GHG emissions would be predominant, especially methane emissions; while the composting and incineration facilities would account for a large proportion of management cost. Further comparative analysis among the bi-level and single-level models indicates that the bi-level model could provide coordinated schemes under an integrated consideration of economic efficiency and environmental impact.

TI The Impact of Exogenous Aerobic Bacteria on Sustainable Methane
   Production Associated with Municipal Solid Waste Biodegradation:
   Revealed by High-Throughput Sequencing
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In this work, the impact of exogenous aerobic bacteria mixture (EABM) on municipal solid waste (MSW) is well evaluated in the following aspects: biogas production, leachate analysis, organic waste degradation, EABM population, and the composition of microbial communities. The study was designed and performed as follows: the control bioreactor (R1) was filled up with MSW and the culture medium of EABM and the experimental bioreactor (R2) was filled up with MSW and EABM. The data suggests that the composition of microbial communities (bacterial and methanogenic) in R1 and R2 were similar at day 0, while the addition of EABM in R2 led to a differential abundance of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphlyoccus xylosus, and Pantoea agglomerans in two bioreactors. The population of exogenous aerobic bacteria in R2 greatly increased during hydrolysis and acidogenesis stages, and subsequently increased the degradation of volatile solid (VS), protein, lipid, and lignin by 59.25%, 25.68%, 60.47%, and 197.62%, respectively, compared to R1. The duration of hydrolysis and acidogenesis in R2 was 33.33% shorter than that in R1. At the end of the study, the accumulative methane yield in R2 (494.4 L) was almost three times more than that in R1 (187.4 L). In addition, the abundance of acetoclasic methanogens increased at acetogenesis and methanogenesis stages in both bioreactors, which indicates that acetoclasic methanogens (especially Methanoseata) could contribute to methane production. This study demonstrates that EABM can accelerate organic waste degradation to promote MSW biodegradation and methane production. Moreover, the operational parameters helped EABM to generate 20.85% more in accumulative methane yield. With a better understanding of how EABM affects MSW and the composition of bacterial community, this study offers a potential practical approach to MSW disposal and cleaner energy generation worldwide.

TI Life-Cycle-Based Greenhouse Gas, Energy, and Economic Analysis of
   Municipal Solid Waste Management Using System Dynamics Model
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Sustainable municipal solid waste (MSW) management is a critical issue that requires planning in accordance with population growth, urbanization, and living standards. An evaluation that integrates system dynamics (SD) is newly built for identifying the interactions between social activities to predict future MSW generation. In this study, SD-based greenhouse gas (GHG), energy, and economic evaluations were conducted for MSW management in the Southern Tai Lake Watershed (STWL) area in China. The considered SD factors include the gross domestic product (GDP) growth, total population, population growth, MSW generation per capita, and MSW generation charges. The results indicate that the current MSW strategy (S1) does not perform well in GHG, energy, and cost evaluation, and the current landfill capacity will be depleted in 2022. Co-processing the landfilled waste with fresh MSW in incineration plants (S7) is the most favorable strategy, which indicates the current landfill capacity will be sufficient for the ash generated from incineration over the next decade. S7 also emits 1.5-3 times less GHG, recovers 2-3.2 times more energy, and obtains 1.3-2.0 times more economic benefits than S1 during 2020-2030. This study offers valuable insights regarding the dynamics of MSW generation and an approach to determine an optimal MSW management strategy for the future.

TI Evaluation of food waste disposal options in terms of global warming and
   energy recovery: Korea
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
AB This study is aimed to evaluate and compare environmental impacts of various food waste management systems: anaerobic digestion, co-digestion with sewage sludge, and volume reduction using a garbage dryer followed by incineration from generation to final disposal. An environmental credit using life cycle assessment was employed to compare by-products. The entire disposal process, namely discharge, collection, transportation, treatment, and final disposal, was included in the system boundary. The functional unit was 1 tonne of food waste from households for each treatment option. Global warming potential of the category indicator was selected to assess the environmental impact of food waste disposal options. The net global warming potential (environmental credit) of the options (wet based) was 33 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) for anaerobic digestion and -315 kg of CO2-eq for incineration by renewable energy production as electricity, thermal energy, and primary materials avoided. We found that dryer-incineration option was an available alternative for food waste recycling in a metropolitan area in Korea.

TI Waste management, informal recycling, environmental pollution and public
   health
SO JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
AB With rapid population growth, especially in low-income and middle-income countries, the generation of waste is increasing at an unprecedented rate. For example, annual global waste arising from waste electrical and electronic equipment alone will have increased from 33.8 to 49.8million tonnes between 2010 and 2018. Despite incineration and other waste treatment techniques, landfill still dominates waste disposal in low-income and middle-income countries. There is usually insufficient funding for adequate waste management in these countries and uptake of more advanced waste treatment technologies is poor. Without proper management, many landfills represent serious hazards as typified by the landslide in Shenzhen, China on 20 December 2015. In addition to formal waste recycling systems, approximately 15million people around the world are involved in informal waste recycling, mainly for plastics, metals, glass and paper. This review examines emerging public health challenges, in particular within low-income and middle-income countries, associated with the informal sector. While informal recyclers contribute to waste recycling and reuse, the relatively primitive techniques they employ, combined with improper management of secondary pollutants, exacerbate environmental pollution of air, soil and water. Even worse, insufficient occupational health measures expose informal waste workers to a range of pollutants, injuries, respiratory and dermatological problems, infections and other serious health issues that contribute to low life expectancy. Integration of the informal sector with its formal counterparts could improve waste management while addressing these serious health and livelihood issues. Progress in this direction has already been made notably in several Latin American countries where integrating the informal and formal sectors has had a positive influence on both waste management and poverty alleviation.

SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB How an economically affordable, environmentally effective and socially acceptable municipal solid waste management system can be developed is currently unclear. Considerable research has been carried out on the practical aspects of municipal waste management (i.e. transport, treatment and disposal) and how citizens feel about source separation, recycling, incineration and landfill but the perspective of the waste manager within the context of long term planning is often ignored. In this study, waste managers from 11 different leading-edge European municipal solid waste programs in nine different countries were interviewed. The economic, social, political, environmental, legal and technical factors of their specific programs were explored acid analyzed. The transition of municipal solid waste management to urban resources management was observed and key 'system drivers' for more sustainable waste management practices were identified. Programs visited were: Brescia (I), Copenhagen (DK), Hampshire (UK), Helsinki (FI), Lahn-Dill-Kreis (D), Malmo (SE), Pamplona (E), Prate (I), Saarbrucken (D), Vienna (A), and Zurich (CH).

TI Evaluation of environmental burdens caused by changes of food waste
   management systems in Seoul, Korea
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB During the last decade, there have been remarkable changes in food waste management in Korea following a ban on direct landfilling. To evaluate the environmental impacts of food waste management systems, we examined individual treatment systems with the LCA approach - landfill, incineration, composting, and feed manufacturing - and estimated the change from 1997 to 2005. The efficient system was different in each impact category, but it was evaluated that landfill is the main contributor to human toxicity and global warming (based on fossil (CO2). In contrast, due to the increase of food waste recycling, acidification, eutrophication, and fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity impact was increased. Especially, the high energy consumption and generated residue in recycling systems caused the large burdens in toxicity categories. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Biosolids - A fuel or a waste? An integrated appraisal of five
   co-cornhustion scenarios with policy analysis
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB An integrated appraisal of five technology scenarios for the co-combustion of biosolids in the UK energy and waste management policy context is presented. Co-combustion scenarios with coal, municipal solid waste, wood, and for cement manufacture were subject to thermodynamic and materials flow modeling and evaluated by 19 stakeholder representatives. All scenarios provided a net energy gain (0.58-5.0 kWh/kg dry solids), having accounted for the energy required for transportation and sludge drying. Co-combustion within the power generation and industrial (e.g., cement) sectors is most readily implemented but provides poor water utility control, and it suffers from poor public perception. Co-combustion with wastes or biomass appears more sustainable but requires greater investment and presents significant risks to water utilities. Incongruities within current energy and waste management policy are discussed and conclusions for improved understanding are drawn.

TI CHEMICAL-PROPERTIES OF MUNICIPAL SOLID-WASTE COMPOSTS
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
AB Composting municipal solid waste (MSW) is becoming increasingly recognized as a viable and economical method for waste management in both Europe and the USA. Composting has advantages over land-filling and incineration because of lower operational costs, less environmental pollution, and beneficial use of the end product. There are, however, some uncertanties about potential health hazards resulting from excessive MSW compost application to agricultural lands. This article reviews currently available literature on chemical properties of MSW compost and the effects or compost application on soils. It is concluded that the positive effects resulting from compost application far outweigh the negative effects, but more research is needed on a wide range of MSW composts with more precise determination of the fate of MSW compost-applied trace elements in the environment.

   waste management under deep complexities - A novel multi-objective
   approach
SO SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB Waste-to-energy technologies compatible with recycling are promising solutions for sustainable municipal waste management from both economic and environmental perspectives. This study focuses on the economic -environment-energy (3E) objective-driven integrated waste management optimization problems under deep complexities. A novel multi-objective programming model is developed to assist the optimal decision-making with the consideration of system profit, greenhouse gas emission, and energy recovery simultaneously. Be-sides, it advances existing optimization methods by incorporating interval-valued fuzzy numbers to tackle the ambiguity and the essential fuzziness in experts' judgment. It was verified by a case study from an urban district of Beijing, China. The optimum waste treatment facility planning and waste stream allocation strategies with multi-objective tradeoffs were obtained to support decision-making considering different preferences of impor-tance ranking. In general, incineration and anaerobic digestion would be the main technologies for waste disposal in the study area. Recycling would be greatly encouraged when pursuing more economic profits and greenhouse gas emission reduction. With withdrawing the subsidy in the future, the investment in anaerobic digestion would become less attractive. Meanwhile, the landfill with gas recovery would even become economically infeasible if there is no further reduction in cost. In addition, waste source separation is also a crucial factor for successful integrated waste management. It is suggested that a proper government subsidy and public participation in waste source separation would guarantee the sustainable development of the integrated waste management system.

TI A technique to quantify incinerability of municipal solid waste
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB A technique to quantify the incinerability of municipal solid waste (MSW) called incinerability index or i- Index is formulated. Incorporating the 3-E concept (potential environmental impact, energy recovery and economic sustainability), the incinerability can be quantified into a unique number on a scale of 0-100. This helps to assess the feasibility of incineration of MSW and ascertain the sustainability of the waste management scheme. A detailed account of the formulation of i- Index is presented in this article. Being a complex multi-criteria decision-making problem (MCDM), the opinions of more than 200 experts were collected through the different stages of its formulation. The relative weighting of the parameters was determined through the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and normalisation was done using rating curves. Incinerability of the MSW generated in countries belonging to three economic groups, namely, the United States of America (USA), China and India and the i- Index values were subsequently determined, which amounted to 72.38, 62.68 and 41.94 respectively. Being an increasing scale index, a high i-Index value indicates higher incinerability. This also substantiates how the variation in the composition of MSW across different economies affect the incinerability of the MSW.

TI Life cycle assessment of municipal solid waste management in Nottingham,
   England: Past and future perspectives
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Since the enforcement of the EU Landfill Directive, EU waste directives were successively enforced in EU member states to facilitate the establishment of sustainable MSW management. Various changes have been made in England to reduce the global impact of its MSW management, but the effectiveness of these changes on mitigating the global warming potential (GWP) from MSW management has never been investigated in detail. This study assessed the historical GWP of MSW management in Nottingham throughout the period from April 2001 to March 2017 through life cycle assessment (LCA). The LCA results indicate continuous reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from MSW management during the study period due to improvements in waste collection, treatment and material recycling, as well as waste prevention. These improvements resulted in a net reduction of GHG emission from 1076.0 kg CO2 -eq./t of MSW (or 498.2 kg CO2 -eq./Ca) in 2001/02 to 211.3 kg CO2 -eq./t of MSW (or 76.3 kg CO2 -eq./Ca) in 2016/17. A further reduction to -142.3 kg CO2 -eq./t of MSW (or -40.2 kg CO2 -eq./Ca) could be achieved by separating food waste from incinerated waste, treating organic waste via anaerobic digestion and by pretreating incinerated waste in a material recovery facility.

TI Alternative strategies towards a sustainable municipal solid waste
   management system: A case study in Cairo
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Major cities in transitional and developing countries are facing the ever-growing challenge of managing solid waste in a sustainable manner. While a variety of treatments exist for solid waste, cities are in need of a sustainable integrated municipal solid waste management (MSWM) system. Such a system is meant to assist them in selecting and investing in an appropriate combination of treatments for the waste they generate, depending on the composition and quantity of this waste. This study presents a systems analysis of the MSWM in Cairo. A constrained non-linear mathematical model is developed to represent an underlying model of a MSWM system, with six waste material flows (cardboard and paper, plastics, metals, glass, organic material, and others). The developed model depicts combinations of five treatment alternatives (composting, anaerobic digestion, mechanical biological treatment, incineration, and landfilling). The treatment methods and their capacity are determined by the model, indicating possible optimal design solutions and recommendations. Starting with an evaluation of the status quo of the MSWM system in Cairo, the paper proposes a staged strategy, involving investigating improvements to the current mixed-waste management system, then exploring the possibility of introducing at-source waste sorting. The environmental and economic implications of different scenarios are analyzed and compared. A material flow analysis, including input data uncertainties, is also conducted by applying substance flow analysis. This analysis shows the difference between the status quo and the proposed improved solutions for diverting waste from landfills and, thus, decreasing carbon dioxide emissions.

TI Multi criteria decision analysis to develop an optimized municipal solid
   waste management scenario: a case study in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Since to 1990, Urbanization has occurred due to an increase in the number of unpredicted citizens and migration from the countryside to the city. This has resulted in the development of factories, lack of public transportation, and the expansion of the traditional tent (ger) area. Besides that, as the lifestyle and socio-economic situation of the citizens is changing, in this regards amount of the municipal waste and type of waste are also increasing. This research analyzed each of the waste disposal methods, to develop and select the waste management best option. Also, scenario analysis to forecast the future evolution of municipal solid waste until 2030 under a different waste management plan. The waste management model was developed intending to promote sustainable decision-making, covering four columns: technical, environmental, economic, and social aspects. For it, the System Dynamics to design a mathematical model was based on the waste disposal data from 2011 to 2018. The first, based on the municipal waste disposal budget data, comprises systems engineering models including cost-benefit analysis, forecasting analysis of each scenario exploring opportunities to increase waste revenues and reducing annual costs from waste transportation, collection services, and waste treatment. The second introduces system assessment tools including Life Cycle Inventory (LCI), Scenario Development (SD), Material Flow Analysis (MFA), Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA), and Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA). IPCC-2006 package was used to support the LCA and Emission Quantification Tool (EQT). The analysis includes a LCA, wherein direct and indirect Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during landfilling, waste incineration, Mechanical Biological Treatment (MBT) processing, composting, recycling, and the overall energy consumption from Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) treatment system were considered for the city. In this research, a questionnaire survey has been conducted for experts and Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), the technique, helped to capture the knowledge of the local experts. Also, using the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), and ranked various waste disposal methods. As the result, the possibility of changing the management system that incurs losses each year to cover the costs of waste transportation, waste sorting, and recycling can be offset by waste management activities rather than the state budget. The results have shown that waste incineration is the most cost-effective option in Ulaanbaatar city in terms of saving coal resources and reducing coal production.

TI Impact of High-Intensity Static Magnetic Field on Chemical Properties
   and Anaerobic Digestion of Sewage Sludge
SO WASTE AND BIOMASS VALORIZATION
AB The increasing production of sewage sludge at global level has addressed the search for technical solutions to take advantage from it, reducing the environmental burden originating from its disposal. Anaerobic digestion is a suitable option to handle sewage sludge in accordance with circular economy principles, as it generates a methane-rich biogas and a digestate with potential fertilizing properties. Several techniques have been proposed to enhance anaerobic digestion performances and, among these, the application of static magnetic field (SMF) has recently gained attention. Nonetheless, the effects of high-intensity SMF on the sewage sludge destined to anaerobic digestion and its impact on the anaerobic digestion process have not been evaluated yet. This study aims to determine the effects of a 1.5 T SMF on the chemical composition of sewage sludge as well as on methane generation during anaerobic digestion. The main parameters influencing the SMF (i.e., flow rate, mixing ratio of magnetized to non-magnetized sludge, number of pumping cycles, and total solid content) were varied to evaluate the impact of different exposure conditions on the chemical characteristics and methane potential of sewage sludge. An extensive exposure to the high-intensity SMF applied resulted in a 24% decrease of methane production, reduced the concentration of the monitored ionic species (i.e., NH4+, NO3-, PO43-, SO42- and Mg2+) in the liquid phase of sewage sludge, and promoted the precipitation of compounds with valuable fertilizing properties, e.g., struvite. These outcomes suggest that high-intensity SMF, although negatively influencing methane generation, can promote the precipitation, and possibly the recovery/recycle of valuable compounds from sewage sludge, enhancing its proper management in a circular economy perspective.

TI The Household Use of Food Waste Disposal Units as a Waste Management
   Option: A Review
SO CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) consists of a high proportion of biodegradable matter, which when disposed to landfill decomposes leading to the formation of gas and leachate. Concerns over the environmental impacts of landfill emissions have resulted in efforts to identify alternative management options for MSW. Food waste constitutes a significant fraction of MSW, and its management presents considerable challenges due to its highly putrescible nature and the environmental, public health, and amenity implications. Food waste disposal units (FWDs) were introduced to the United States in 1927 as convenient and hygienic means to grind food waste at source and dispose of it directly to the sewer for treatment with wastewater. However, although FWDs are used in many countries throughout the world, their potential as a waste management option has not been fully considered. The authors review existing literature on the potential impacts of FWD use and investigate whether there are sufficient data to ascertain the sustainability of these units. Findings demonstrate that the use of FWDs is effective in reducing the amount of food waste disposed of to landfill. However, the impacts of their use on water consumption, sewerage system, and wastewater treatment processes require further investigation before this option can be accepted as a sustainable alternative to landfill.

TI LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
   IN CLUJ COUNTY, ROMANIA
SO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a methodology that can be used to evaluate the environmental performance of municipal solid waste management systems (MSWMS). Despite of Waste Directive provisions, this methodology is insufficiently applied as a decision-support method able to identify the best option for the waste management in Romania. In this paper we applied LCA methodology to study of the municipal waste management system of Cluj County, supported by GaBi software. The aim of this study is to identify the most environmentally friendly waste management scenario. To fulfill this goal, four different MSWMS scenarios have been developed and applied for Cluj County. Scenario # 1 represents the current MSW management status in the area of concern, involving the commingled collection systems, transportation and landfilling, while in case of the second Scenario assumes the inclusion of composting, which is applied for the wet part of the MSW, in order to obtain a similar product as the compost (SPC). The quality of SPC is not so good, but the product can be used at least as covering material for landfill rehabilitation (the existing old landfills) or other contaminated areas such as forests, mines, quarries. Scenario # 3 integrates the recycling options for the recyclable materials. In Scenario # 4 incineration was added for the residual waste defined as " other waste" (household hazardous waste). The Life Cycle Inventory analysis was carried out by using the GaBi4 software.
   The environmental impacts of these four scenarios were analyzed with respect to the global warming potential (the highest value was 9.34E+20 kg equiv. CO2 for Scenario 1 and the lowest value was -1.44E+21 kg equiv. CO2 for Scenario 4, the negative value reflecting an avoided impact on the environment), acidification potential (the highest value was 2.68E+15 kg equiv. SO2 for Scenario 1 and the lowest value was -9.63E+16 for the Scenario 4), eutrophication potential (the highest value was 6.30E+14 kg equiv. PO4 for Scenario 4 and the lowest value was 1.60E+14 kg equiv. PO4 for Scenario 1), human toxicity potential (the highest value was 4.26E+08 kg equiv. DCB for Scenario 1 and the lowest value was -2.00E+11 kg equiv. DCB for Scenario 4), freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity potential (the highest value was 9.86E+05 kg equiv. DCB and the lowest value was -2.00E+11 kg equiv. DCB) and photochemical ozone creation potential (the highest value was 1.57E+15 kg equiv. ethene and the lowest value was -7.50E+16 kg equiv. ethene). The results revealed that Scenario # 4 can be identified as the most environmentally friendly one, due to the good results regarding all environmental impacts and higher energy recovery (1.90E+09 MJ for Scenario 4 compared to 7.78E+07 MJ for Scenario 2). In all scenarios, the generated impact for the global warming category has a dominant contribution and the impact on eutrophication potential play an important role. In this study the waste management scenarios were investigated only by the environmental point of view and for the economic and social effects of solid waste management will need to consider other decision-making tools.

TI Modification in the Composting Environment through Additives
SO COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
AB Globally, huge amounts of crop residues are generated that are either fed to animals or are used for other purposes. Recycling crop residues opens new options for converting wastes into valuable products that can be used in farms for meeting crop nutrient requirements, maintaining soil health, crop productivity, and improving soil quality. Composting offers a proven avenue for best utilization of crop residues. Additives are materials that consist of nutrients, readily available forms of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, or other elements, enzymes, and microbial formulations that enhance microbial activity when in contact with the waste material. These materials, apart from modifying physical, chemical, and microbial properties, also help in improving the final quality of the compost. In this review, we summarize the importance of the additives during composting process. The first part of the review describes the composting process in general. Next part explains how the use of organic, inorganic, and biological additives results in various modifications in composting process by changing aeration, porosity, enhancing thermophilic phase, maturity, and nutritive value of compost. The last part explains how decomposed and nutritionally rich composts result in improvement of plant growth, development and modification in soil physical, chemical, and biological properties. Although the use of additives have mixed outputs, their use in composting provides new insights into modification of the composting environment.

TI The effects of aged refuse and sewage sludge on landfill CH4 oxidation
   and N2O emissions: Roles of moisture content and temperature
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB A laboratory-scale experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of mix ratio, moisture content and temperature on the methane oxidation potential (MOP) through a landfill bio-cover of aged refuse and sewage sludge. The CH4 oxidation rate increased considerably when the moisture content and temperature increased from 18% to 30% by mass and 4 to 35 degrees C, respectively. In order to produce the maximum MOP, the optimum conditions for the bio-cover system were as follows: an aged refuse: sewage sludge ratio of 6:4, a moisture content of 30% and an incubation temperature of 35 degrees C. After distilled water addition, N2O emissions from the bio-cover with an aged refuse:aged sludge ratio of 6:4 was 10.2 times higher than the clay soil cover (p > 0.05). Compared to the global warming burden caused by CH4 emissions, the increase in the N2O and CO2 emissions from a bio-cover of aged refuse and sewage sludge could be ignored in terms of overall MSW landfill emissions. Due to its high tolerance for environmental variation and the savings in land resources, the mixture of aged refuse and sewage sludge is a good option for mitigating CH4 emission when applied to municipal solid waste landfill.

AB With the lack of a management budget and weak policy for waste management of local communities in developing countries, especially for clusters that have the amount of garbage less than 5 tons per day, open dumping or open burning is the most common municipal solid waste (MSW) management, leading to severe impact on the environment. This study focuses on the sustainable development and eco-friendly waste management concept for these local communities. First, public participation campaigns with the 3R's concept (Reduced, Reuse and Recycle) must be launched to reduce and separate waste from households to be mixed with combustible waste, organic waste, and recycled waste. If the separation at the source is successful, the treated waste of about 2.5 tons is divided into wet and dry fractions. The wet fraction can be easily treated by conventional composting to produce soil conditioners and generate income for communities. The dry fraction must be treated by an incinerator. However, due to the high moisture content and low heating value of the waste, the incinerator needs to run with additional fossil fuel, causing high operating costs. Therefore, a novel hybrid incineration-gasification system has been introduced in this study to use Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) prepared by dry fraction as feedstock to a downdraft gasifier. The producer gas generated from the gasifier can be used to substitute fossil fuel. This sustainable and eco-friendly model of waste management can be used as a prototype model for other rural areas in low or low-middle income countries. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Traditional landfilling and incineration fall short of the public's. demand for sustainable, affordable, and long term solutions to solid waste and sludge disposal. Masada OxyNol(TM) LLC ("Masada") is currently deploying its CES OxyNol(TM) waste-to-ethanol process that beneficially reuses or recycles up to 90 percent of delivered nonhazardous municipal solid waste (''MSW'') and sewage sludge. Masada ' s first commercial facility in Middletown, New York USA is fully permitted and a groundbreaking is expected in October 2002.
   A typical Masada OxyNol(TM) facility creates hundreds of new jobs and involves three main process areas, all of which are currently in commercial use today:
   Mixed waste materials recovery facility (''MRF") that separates recyclable materials from MSW and prepares a cellulosic feedstock. Acid hydrolysis converts cellulose to sugar and lignin residue, a renewable, biomass solid fuel. Fermentation and distillation converts sugars to ethanol, a renewable fuel.
   The CES OxyNol(TM) process is robust and permanently disposes of waste. Heavy metals are safely controlled and the process produces no hazardous waste or harmful air or water emissions. Masada ' s patented process is economically viable partly because of improved yields, reduced cost of materials of construction, and application of existing and proven processes.
   Masada 's CES OxyNol(TM) process offers an economically viable and environmentally sustainable alternative to burying, burning, or spreading raw waste. Local authorities benefit from economic development opportunities and a long term, sustainable solution to today's waste disposal problems.

TI Intrinsic sustainability assessment at technosphere level by adapting
   entropy based ecologic indicators. A preliminary analysis for some main
   waste treatment processes
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The present study was developed on the following evidence: "what is considered to be environmentally sustainable in the technosphere has to be in compliance with the development tendency of the ecosphere ". Starting from this hypothesis, two entropy-based indicators were proposed: the specific entropy per amount of exergy gained (SEEG); the specific entropy per amount of exergy exploitable in the technosphere (SEEE). These were retrieved from the specific entropy (SE) indicator largely exploited for assessing the health status and the development tendency of ecosystems. Entropy based indicators SEEG and SEEE were used for assessing the environmental sustainability of incineration, anaerobic digestion and composting of waste. The aim of these indicators was to support already available methodologies for environmental impact assessment for better understating the intrinsic sustainability of specific processes, since the only quantification of the emission appears not enough informative for this goal. Concerning the ecosphere, SE minimization follows the Darwinian principle "survival of the fittest ", being the fittest ecosystems those able to make the most efficient and effective use and storage of energy and materials, at the lower relative entropy generation. Consequently, the lower are SEEG and SEEE the fittest is the analysed system (i.e. sustainable). Main findings indicate SEEG ranging from 2.471 to 3.705, for incinerator, from 0.007 to 0.106 for anaerobic digestion whereas resulted constant = 0.266 for composting. The SEEE ranged from 0.433 to 0.484 for incinerator, from < 0.001 to 0.008 for anaerobic digestion and resulted constant = 0.014 for composting. These preliminary results indicates that processes and system able to return chemicals and materials exploitable at technosphere level were characterized by higher ability in returning exergy flows at the lower entropy increase compared to hose returning only energy.

TI A Comparative Life Cycle Assessment of Dry and Wet Anaerobic Digestion
   Technologies for Food Waste Management
SO JURNAL KEJURUTERAAN
AB Anaerobic digestion (AD) is especially useful in the treatment of organic waste sources, such as food waste (FW) since AD can support the generation of clean energy while preventing the hazards of uncontrolled GHG pollution originating from landfills. However, the potential environmental impacts of dry AD and integrated wet AD treatment are largely unknown, particularly in Malaysia. Thus, this study aimed to compare the potential environmental impacts of four FW treatment technologies in Malaysia: landfill (Sc0), dry anaerobic digestion (Sc1), wet anaerobic digestion combined with windrow composting (Sc2), and wet anaerobic digestion combined with windrow composting and landfill (Sc3). The scenario modelling was performed via GaBi v6.0 software using 1 ton of pre-treated FW as a functional unit, with the analysis of environmental impact scores being based on the ReCiPe (H) v1.07 characterization method. At the midpoint assessment, the Sc1 produced extensive improvements in 12 mid-point impact categories, being the most environmentally favoured FW treatment method compared to the other options in critical categories such as global warming, depletion of fossils and agricultural land occupation. The Sc1 mesophilic conducting reactor in this study used less energy for heating, without generating waste water while requiring a small operating area. Sc3 had the lowest environmental performance since the emissions into the air from windrow composting and landfill were discharged completely without any form of treatment like capturing or flaring. Finally, through the single score analysis, Sc1 was regarded as an appropriate FW treatment technology with the least damaging impact on resource depletion, human health, and ecosystems in comparison to all scenarios. This was accomplished through relatively low power demands for the operation, shorter road transport distances, and a substantial reduction in the amount of waste and electricity generation. These analyses provide a useful framework for understanding the important characteristics of anaerobic treatment despite the divergent challenges faced by the different processes.

AB Anaerobic digestion process has been recognized as a promising way for waste treatment and energy recovery in a sustainable way. Modelling of anaerobic digestion system is significantly important for effectively and accurately controlling, adjusting, and predicting the system for higher methane yield. The GM(1, N) approach which does not need the mechanism or a large number of samples was employed to model the anaerobic digestion system to predict methane yield. In order to illustrate the proposed model, an illustrative case about anaerobic digestion of municipal solid waste for methane yield was studied, and the results demonstrate that GM(1, N) model can effectively simulate anaerobic digestion system at the cases of poor information with less computational expense.

AB Incineration technology refers to treatment methods using high-temperature combustion to transform the waste into stable substances and gases with energy or other usable resource recovery. However, the exhaust gas produced by incineration process still generates several problems threatening human's health and environment. Hence, the environmental impact of incineration technology should be discussed more comprehensively. Two type's incinerators including fluidized-bed and mechanical-grate patterns operated in Taiwan were selected to evaluate the environmental impact by life cycle perspective in this study. Through the skills of life cycle inventory and impact assessment, the environmental impacts intensity was illustrated by nine categories. It can be found that the total environmental impacts of mechanical-grate incinerator is 0.74654, which is little higher than fluidized-bed incinerator as 0.70137 in the study cases. The result also shows the heavy metal damage and global warming are the most critical environmental impact in fluidized bed incinerator and mechanical-grate incinerator respectively. The study would be helpful for improving the decision quality for choosing the municipal solid waste treatment system.

TI Municipal solid waste flow and waste generation characteristics in an

SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB In the urban-rural fringe of the Bangkok Metropolitan Region, rapid urbanization is creating a land-use mixture of agricultural fields and residential areas. To develop appropriate policies to enhance recycling of municipal solid waste (MSW), current MSW management was investigated in the oboto (local administrative district) of Bang Maenang in Nonthaburi Province, adjoining Bangkok. The authors conducted a structural interview survey with waste-related organizations and local residents, analysed household waste generation, and performed global positioning system (GPS) tracking of municipal garbage trucks. It was found that MSW was collected and treated by local government, private-sector entities, and the local community separately. Lack of integrated management of these entities complicated waste flow in the study area, and some residences were not served by MSW collection. Organic waste, such as kitchen garbage and yard waste, accounted for a large proportion of waste generation but was underutilized. Through GPS/GIS analysis, the waste collection rate of the generated waste amount was estimated to be 45.5-51.1% of total generation.

TI Heavy metal removal from sewage sludge ash and municipal solid waste fly
   ash - A comparison
SO FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
AB Mixing and pelletizing sewage sludge ash (SSA) or municipal solid waste (MSW) fly ash with CaCl2 and treating these pellets in a rotary reactor at approximately 1000 degrees C lead to a significant decrease of the heavy metal concentration.
   Experiments were carried out in an indirectly-heated laboratory-scale rotary reactor. From SSA, after 10 min at 1050 degrees C, more than 95% of Cu, Pb and Zn could be removed. The heavy metal removal from municipal solid waste (MSW) fly ash proceeded more slowly and often less efficiently. After 45 min at 1050 degrees C, 95% Cd, 60% Cu, 98% Pb and 80% Zn could be removed.
   Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations for possible single reactions were carried out. It was found that SiO2, a main component in sewage sludge ash, accelerates the formation of HCl and Cl-2, CaO, which is contained in CaO-bearing phases in MSW fly ash. decreases the rate of this reaction. Al2O3, also contained in MSW fly ash-phases, leads to the formation of aluminates. Cd-aluminate can be affected by HCl and Cl-2, leading to a lower removal rate. Zn-aluminate can only be affected by Cl-2; Cu-aluminate is stable under chlorination conditions. I.e.. Cu and Zn can easily be incorporated into the MSW fly ash matrix. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI PROSPECTS FOR UTILIZATION OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE (MSW) IN INDIA
SO EVERYMANS SCIENCE
AB Generation of municipal solid waste in India is increasing day by day. The average per capita generation of waste was about 500 g/day in 2007 and it will increase to 925 g/day by 2047. The most important step to be used for management of this waste would be minimising its generation but this is not really possible. Then to manage waste sustainably, the waste to wealth route remains a viable solution although in India it is not common practice. Maximum recycling, composting with organic municipal solid waste and waste to energy generation should be utilised for MSW management. This aproach of sustainable waste management can solve the problem of land required for waste disposal and resulting pollution problems of air, ground, surface water, soil etc.

TI A critical review of the bioavailability and impacts of heavy metals in
   municipal solid waste composts compared to sewage sludge
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB The content, behaviour and significance of heavy metals in composted waste materials is important from two potentially conflicting aspects of environmental legislation in terms of: (a) defining end-of-waste criteria and increasing recycling of composted residuals on land and (b) protecting soil quality by preventing contamination. This review examines the effects of heavy metals in compost and amended soil as a basis for achieving a practical and sustainable balance between these different policy objectives, with particular emphasis on agricultural application.
   All types of municipal solid waste (MSW) compost contain more heavy metals than the background concentrations present in soil and will increase their contents in amended soil. Total concentrations of heavy metals in source-segregated and greenwaste compost are typically below UK PAS100 limits and mechanical segregated material can also comply with the metal limits in UK PAS100, although this is likely to be more challenging. Zinc and Pb are numerically the elements present in the largest amounts in MSW-compost. Lead is the most limiting element to use of mechanically-segregated compost in domestic gardens, but concentrations are typically below risk-based thresholds that protect human health.
   Composted residuals derived from MSW and greenwaste have a high affinity for binding heavy metals. There is general consensus in the scientific literature that aerobic composting processes increase the complexation of heavy metals in organic waste residuals, and that metals are strongly bound to the compost matrix and organic matter, limiting their solubility and potential bioavailability in soil. Lead is the most strongly bound element and Ni the weakest, with Zn, Cu and Cd showing intermediate sorption characteristics. The strong metal sorption properties of compost produced from MSW or sewage sludge have important benefits for the remediation of metal contaminated industrial and urban soils.
   Compost and sewage sludge additions to agricultural and other soils, with background concentrations of heavy metals, raise the soil content and the availability of heavy metals for transfer into crop plants. The availability in soil depends on the nature of the chemical association between a metal with the organic residual and soil matrix, the pH value of the soil, the concentration of the element in the compost and the soil, and the ability of the plant to regulate the uptake of a particular element. There is no evidence of increased metal release into available forms as organic matter degrades in soil once compost applications have ceased.
   However, there is good experimental evidence demonstrating the reduced bioavailability and crop uptake of metals from composted biosolids compared to other types of sewage sludge. It may therefore be inferred that composting processes overall are likely to contribute to lowering the availability of metals in amended soil compared to other waste biostabilisation techniques.
   The total metal concentration in compost is important in controlling crop uptake of labile elements. like Zn and Cu, which increases with increasing total content of these elements in compost. Therefore, low metal materials, which include source-segregated and greenwaste composts, are likely to have inherently lower metal availabilities overall, at equivalent metal loading rates to soil, compared to composted residuals with larger metal contents. This is explained because the compost matrix modulates metal availability and materials low in metals have stronger sorption capacity compared to high metal composts.
   Zinc is the element in sewage sludge-treated agricultural soil identified as the main concern in relation to potential impacts on soil microbial activity and is also the most significant metal in compost with regard to soil fertility and microbial processes. However, with the exception of one study, there is no other tangible evidence demonstrating negative impacts of heavy metals applied to soil in compost on soil microbial processes and only positive effects of compost application on the microbial status and fertility of soil are reported. The negative impacts on soil microorganisms apparent in one long-term field experiment could be explained by the exceptionally high concentrations of Cd and other elements in the applied compost. and of Cd in the compost-amended soil, which are unrepresentative of current practice and compost quality.
   The metal contents of source-segregated MSW or greenwaste compost are smaller compared to mechanically-sorted MSW-compost and sewage sludge, and low metal materials also have the smallest potential metal availabilities. Composting processes also inherently reduce metal availability compared to other organic waste stabilisation methods. Therefore, risks to the environment, human health, crop quality and yield, and soil fertility, from heavy metals in source-segregated MSW or greenwaste-compost are minimal. Furthermore, composts produced from mechanically-segregated MSW generally contain fewer metals than sewage sludge used as an agricultural soil improver under controlled conditions. Consequently. the metal content of mechanically-segregated MSW-compost does not represent a barrier to end-use of the product. The application of appropriate preprocessing and refinement technologies is recommended to minimise the contamination of mechanically-segregated MSW-compost as far as practicable.
   In conclusion, the scientific evidence indicates that conservative, but pragmatic limits on heavy metals in compost may be set to encourage recycling of composted residuals and contaminant reduction measures. which at the same time, also protect the soil and environment from potentially negative impacts caused by long-term accumulation of heavy metals in soil.

TI Sustainability Assessment of Municipal Solid Waste in Baltimore USA
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Sustainability assessment of municipal solid waste management requires a holistic approach in evaluating the impacts of current technology and processes. In this study, the sustainability analysis of the Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) incineration plant in Baltimore city was performed to determine its environmental, economic, and social impacts. The city's major waste-to-energy generation plant has benefitted the city of Baltimore since inception till date in terms of waste processing, resulting in electricity and steam production for more than 40,000 homes and over 200 businesses. The life cycle impact of the incineration plant was analyzed using the Simapro life cycle assessment (LCA) software with the Building for Environmental and Economic Sustainability (BEES) database for correlation. The results obtained upon analysis show larger values of Global Warming Potential and eutrophication potential as 6.46 x 10(8) Gg of CO2 equivalence and 2.27 x 10(6) Gg N equivalence, respectively. These values resulted from the higher amount of fossil CO2 and NOx emitted from the plant. The acidification potential of 1.66 x 10(17) H+ mmole eq resulted from the SO2 emitted by the incineration plant. The incineration plant exceeded the limitations set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on NOx (150 ppm), which is detrimental to the well-being of people as shown by this study. Installing an improved processing technology such as a Selected Catalytic Reactor (SCR) can drastically reduce the NOx emission to 45 ppm. Life Cycle Assessment was confirmed suitable in evaluating the environmental impacts of the MSW-to-energy treatment approach.

TI Quality assessment of compost prepared with municipal solid waste
SO OPEN ENGINEERING
AB One way that helps maintain the sustainability of agro-ecosystems land is the application of compost from municipal solid waste as fertilizer, because it can recover the nutrients contained in them, minimizing the negative impact on the environment. Composting as a method for preparing organic fertilizers and amendments is economically and ecologically sound and may well represent an acceptable solution for disposing of municipal solid waste. In the present work, the quality of compost is studied made from municipal solid waste; the content of mineral nutrients: potassium, calcium, magnesium, sodium, zinc, manganese, cupper, iron, nickel, chromium and lead has been investigated. The objective was to evaluate the changes in mineral nutrient concentration during the composting process. The compost was prepared in a pilot-plant using the turning-pile system. Temperature was used as a monitoring parameter to follow the composting progress, which underwent the typical trend of municipal solid waste composting mixtures. The results showed a similar evolution on the content of mineral nutrients of the mixture of municipal solid waste. This evolution originated in a mature compost (end sample) with an adequate content of mineral elements and physical-chemical characteristics for its use in agriculture. So, the use of compost of municipal solid waste represents an important tool for fertilization requirements for its use in agriculture.

TI Does recyclable separation reduce the cost of municipal waste management
   in Japan?
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) management is a system involving multiple sub-systems that typically require demanding inputs, materials and resources to properly process generated waste throughput. For this reason, MSW management is generally one of the most expensive services provided by municipalities. In this paper, we analyze the Japanese MSW management system and estimate the cost elasticity with respect to the waste volumes at three treatment stages: collection, processing, and disposal. Although we observe economies of scale at all three stages, the collection cost is less elastic than the disposal cost. We also examine whether source separation at home affects the cost of MSW management. The empirical results show that the separate collection of the recyclable fraction leads to reduced processing costs at intermediate treatment facilities, but does not change the overall waste management cost. Our analysis also reveals that the cost of waste management systems decreases when the service is provided by private companies through a public tender. The cost decreases even more when the service is performed under the coordination of adjacent municipalities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB This paper presents material flow and sustainability analyses of novel mechanical biological chemical treatment system for complete valorization of municipal solid waste (MSW). It integrates material recovery facility (MRF); pulping, chemical conversion; effluent treatment plant (ETP), anaerobic digestion (AD); and combined heat and power (CHP) systems producing end products: recyclables (24.9% by mass of MSW), metals (2.7%), fibre (1.5%); levulinic acid (7.4%); recyclable water (14.7%), fertiliser (8.3%); and electricity (0.126 MWh/t MSW), respectively. Refuse derived fuel (RDF) and non-recyclable other waste, char and biogas from MRF, chemical conversion and AD systems, respectively, are energy recovered in the CHP system. Levulinic acid gives profitability independent of subsidies; MSW priced at 50 Euro/t gives a margin of 204 Euro/t. Global warming potential savings are 2.4 and 1.3 kg CO2 equivalent per kg of levulinic acid and fertiliser, and 0.17 kg CO2 equivalent per MJ of grid electricity offset, respectively.

TI Environmental evaluation of waste treatment scenarios for the towns
   Khanty-Mansiysk and Surgut, Russia
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug - Ugra in Siberia has recently started to play a major role in the Russian economy because key oil and gas extraction sites are located in this region. As a result, the extensions of infrastructure and higher incomes have been leading to an accelerated population growth and consequent increase in the generation of solid household waste. The current methods of waste disposal have now reached their limits, especially in the towns Khanty-Mansiysk and Surgut. The key objectives of this study were to identify the influence of waste composition and transport routes on the life cycle assessment (LCA) results and to assess the current waste treatment option for solid household waste and to compare it with proposed scenarios. Furthermore, recommendations for an optimal use of LCA within a decision-making process for a waste management plan are presented. LCA methodology was used to evaluate different waste management scenarios such as landfilling and incineration. One result was that the options 'incineration with recycling' and 'anaerobic mechanical-biological treatment with recycling' demonstrated lower environmental impact in both Khanty-Mansiysk and Surgut. Another finding was that there were hardly any differences in the ranking of the scenarios for Surgut and Khanty-Mansiysk. However, the special socio-cultural circumstances and location of each town have to be considered seriously in the development of a sustainable waste management plan.

TI Biogas generation potential by anaerobic digestion for sustainable
   energy development in India
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB The potential of biogas generation from anaerobic digestion of different waste biomass in India has been studied. Renewable energy from biomass is one of the most efficient and effective options among the various other alternative sources of energy currently available. The anaerobic digestion of biomass requires less capital investment and per unit production cost as compared to other renewable energy sources such as hydro, solar and wind. Further, renewable energy from biomass is available as a domestic resource in the rural areas, which is not subject to world price fluctuations or the supply uncertainties as of imported and conventional fuels. In India, energy demand from various sectors is increased substantially and the energy supply is not in pace with the demand which resulted in a deficit of 11,436 MW which is equivalent to 12.6% of peak demand in 2006. The total installed capacity of bioenergy generation till 2007 from solid biomass and waste to energy is about 1227 MW against a potential of 25,700 MW. The bioenergy potential from municipal solid waste, crop residue and agricultural waste, wastewater sludge, animal manure, industrial waste which includes distilleries, dairy plants, pulp and paper, poultry, slaughter houses, sugar industries is estimated. The total potential of biogas from all the above sources excluding wastewater has been estimated to be 40,734 Mm(3)/year. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Economic and environmental comparison between two scenarios of waste
   management: MST vs thermal treatment
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB The paper examines, under specific local situation of planning of innovative solutions for municipal solid waste treatment, the results obtained from a technical, economic and environmental comparison between two different scenarios for waste management: the first scenario foresees the gasification of the residual waste after separate collection and the energetic utilization of the produced syngas, while the second one is based on a mechanical separation of the residual waste in three fluxes: a combustible flux to be utilized, after quality improvement, as RDF (residue derived fuel), a wet organic flux to be sent to anaerobic digestion and a residual essentially mineral flux. For both the scenarios different levels of separate collection were considered.
   The comparison took into account environmental and economic aspects.
   From the environmental point of view, the tool of LCA (life cycle assessment) has been used to address some key environmental aspects and the global acceptance of the two scenarios. As concerns the economic point of view, conventional economic criteria, i.e. investment and operating costs transferred to citizens, have been considered.
   For the practical implementation of the scenarios and in order to verify the possibility to adopt them in a specific territorial situation, additional aspects of practical management, reliability and need to individuate synergies with other territorial infrastructures have been considered.
   The results of the analysis for this specific case revealed that the MBT (mechanical biological treatment) option is preferable from the environmental point of view, while the pyro-gasification option is better from the economic point of view under the vast majority of operating conditions considered. Different practical implementations problems characterize both the scenarios.
   More generally, the comparison methodology that has been defined and used for the scenarios of the considered case can establish a more general useful approach, in order to help the definition of the best solution for waste management planning. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Deploying Municipal Solid Waste Management 3R-WTE Framework in Saudi
   Arabia: Challenges and Future
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The need for resilience and an agile waste management system in Saudi Arabia is vital to control safely the rapid growth of its municipal solid waste (MSW) with minimal environment toll. Similarly, the domestic energy production in Saudi Arabia is thriving and putting a tremendous pressure on its huge reserves of fossil oil. Waste to energy (WTE) plants provides a golden opportunity for Saudi Arabia; however, both challenges (MSW mitigation and energy production) are usually looked at in isolation. This paper at first explores the potential of expanding the WTE energy production in the eastern province in Saudi Arabia under two scenarios (complete mass burn with and without recycling). Secondly, this study analyzes the effect of 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle) practices implementation in a residential camp (11,000 population) to influence the behavior of the camp's citizens to reduce their average waste (kg/capita). The results of the 3R-WTE framework show a potential may reach 254 Megawatt (MW) of electricity by year 2030. The 3R system implementation in the camp reduced MSW production from 5,625 tons to 3000 tons of household waste every year, which is considered lower than what the surrounding communities to be produced in the same area.

AB Current waste management is not able to handle the disposal rates due to the growing global population and economic expansion are increasing in Malaysia. The waste is expected to rise to 41,035 tonnes per day by the year 2026. The responsibility for the separating waste is critically lacking. The solid waste composition of Malaysia is made up of 45% of food waste, 24% of plastic, 7% of paper, 6% of iron and glass. This garbage condition is wet and mixed. The moisture content of MSW is about 55.01%. Current practices for municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal such as landfill and incineration poses a serious problem on the environment and health. Leachate generated from landfill is polluted liquid and consisted high nitrogen compounds, salts, heavy metal. Incineration generates dangerous gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and oxides of nitrogen (NO and NO2, together known as NOx). Malaysia has more than 900 rivers have been polluting due to the improper solid waste management. The implementation of the thermal treatment plant (incinerator) in Malaysia was failed due the high cost of the operation. The high moisture content of the waste and a poor technical expertise in maintaining the incinerators caused the failure of the incineration operation. Thus, moisture reduction is needed prior before goes for incineration. Therefore, the current waste management system adopted by incinerator to be made improvement based on Torrefaction for effective energy recovery system. The moisture contents must be decrease to 75% before subjecting to pyrolysis or incineration. The high heating value (HHV) of the MSW is a main impact on the cost of the operation. The implementation of the pyrolysis system can be reduced the total amount of MSW before buried in landfill. The MSW pyrolysis is one of the ideas that has become increasingly in recent years. It can prevent the formation acidic substances and reduce the amount of garbage before sending over to the landfill and save the transportation fuel.

TI Composting of municipal solid waste by different methods improved the
   growth of vegetables and reduced the health risks of cadmium and lead
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Reutilization of putrescible municipal solid wastes (MSW) in agriculture can provide valuable plant nutrients. However, it may pose serious noncarcinogenic health risks for a human when contaminants, especially the heavy metals in MSW, end up in plants through the waste-soil-plant continuum. This study examined the effects of composting methods viz. aerobically (AC), anaerobically (ANC), and aerobic-anaerobically (AANC) composted MSW material on (i) fertilizer value: vegetable yield, nitrogen (N) mineralization, and apparent N recovery (ANR); and (ii) associated health risks: selected heavy metal concentration, daily intake of metals (DIM), health risk index (HRI), hazard index (HI), and target hazard quotient (THQ) when applied to a loamy soil. All the aforementioned compost materials were incorporated into the sandy loam soil filled in pots and carrot and spinach were cultivated for 85 and 90days, respectively. After soil application, between 51 and 56% of the applied organic N was mineralized from ANC material, while the values in case of AC and AANC were 26-31% and 34-40%, respectively. Consequently, dry matter yield and vegetable N uptake from composts were in the order ANC>AANC>AC (P<0.05). Further, vegetable ANR was the highest from ANC (56 and 56%) than AANC (42 and 45%), and AC (30 and 33%) for spinach and carrot, respectively (P<0.05). Interestingly, plant uptake of lead and cadmium was lowest from ANC as compared to AC or AANC (P<0.05), irrespective of the vegetable type. Consequently, DIM, HRI, and THQ for these metals were substantially lower in the former as compared to the latter compost materials. Further, HI from ANC material was 50% lower over the unfertilized control indicating the absence of noncarcinogenic human health risks via vegetable intake. This all indicates that from viewpoint of sustainable waste recycling in agriculture, anaerobic composting is superior to the other composting methods.

TI Analysis of Alternative MSW Treatment Technologies with the Aim of
   Energy Recovery in the Municipality of Vari-Voula-Vouliagmeni
SO WASTE AND BIOMASS VALORIZATION
AB The alternative municipal solid waste (MSW) management is directly linked to the reduction of the biodegradable fraction and total waste mass disposed to landfill sites. Nowadays, the design and implementation of flexible plants with thermal or biological treatment methods are recommended by European and National legislations as an extremely sustainable waste management strategy in terms of this purpose, capable of assuring the protection of the environment and human health as well as the production of renewable energy. This paper focuses on the techno-economic analysis of an integrated mechanical-biological treatment scheme which includes the technology of anaerobic digestion (AD) for combined heat and power (CHP). Additionally, the main design and technical parameters of the biogas to energy project under consideration as well as the local conditions and legal requirements are reviewed. The goal is to investigate the prospects of profitability arisen in the longer term by the integration of a small scale MSW concept and the replacement of the current practice of waste disposal for a suburban municipality of Athens.

TI Assessment of the greenhouse effect impact of technologies used for
   energy recovery from municipal waste: A case for England
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Waste management activities contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions approximately by 4%. In particular the disposal of waste in landfills generates methane that has high global warming potential. Effective mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions is important and could provide environmental benefits and sustainable development, as well as reduce adverse impacts on public health. The European and UK waste policy force sustainable waste management and especially diversion from landfill, through reduction, reuse, recycling and composting, and recovery of value from waste. Energy from waste is a waste management option that could provide diversion from landfill and at the same time save a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions, since it recovers energy from waste which usually replaces an equivalent amount of energy generated from fossil fuels. Energy from waste is a wide definition and includes technologies such as incineration of waste with energy recovery, or combustion of waste-derived fuels for energy production or advanced thermal treatment of waste with technologies such as gasification and pyrolysis, with energy recovery. The present study assessed the greenhouse gas emission impacts of three technologies that could be used for the treatment of Municipal Solid Waste in order to recover energy from it. These technologies are Mass Burn Incineration with energy recovery, Mechanical Biological Treatment via bio-drying and Mechanical Heat Treatment, which is a relatively new and uninvestigated method, compared to the other two. Mechanical Biological Treatment and Mechanical Heat Treatment can turn Municipal Solid Waste into Solid Recovered Fuel that could be combusted for energy production or replace other fuels in various industrial processes. The analysis showed that performance of these two technologies depends strongly on the final use of the produced fuel and they could produce GHG emissions savings only when there is end market for the fuel. On the other hand Mass Burn Incineration generates greenhouse gas emission savings when it recovers electricity and heat. Moreover the study found that the expected increase on the amount of Municipal Solid Waste treated for energy recovery in England by 2020 could save greenhouse gas emission, if certain Energy from Waste technologies would be applied, under certain conditions.

TI Municipal Solid Wastes-A Promising Sustainable Source of Energy: A
   Review on Different Waste-to-Energy Conversion Technologies
SO ENERGY RECOVERY PROCESSES FROM WASTES
AB Utilization of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) as a free resource of energy has gained popularity to reduce the use of conventional fuel. India, as a developing country having a major population residing in rural areas with unplanned societies, unscientific waste management is steeping at enormous rate. This paper highlights several waste-to-energy (WTE) conversion technologies incorporated for the utilization of MSW to produce useful energy. With high end research and development, pyrolysis and gasification processes incorporating enormous temperature and heating rates, has paved the way for the utilization of high density polymeric wastes in generating oil and synthetic gas as products for utilization as fuels having high calorific values. Utilization of kitchen, agricultural and other organic wastes is a promising energy resource to mitigate the dependency on conventional fuels, if scientifically adapted all over the geographical area. In particular, since animal rejects, food waste and agricultural remains cannot be altered, their utilization as fuel is a promising free source of energy. These wastes are fed for biogas production, along with production of alternative manure for farming through bio-methanation and composting. In view of applications in automobiles, aircrafts, and domestic purposes, conversion of methane enriched fuel into bio-diesel paves the way towards sustainable future. As the supply of conventional fuels are facing threat in view of scarcity and pollution caused by their usage, energy from MSW will eradicate the problems of landfills, pollution and other waste management issues, also economically benefiting the society with their livelihood.

TI Anammox-mediated municipal solid waste leachate treatment: A critical
   review
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) leachate treatment through the anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) pro-cess has received increasing attention due to less oxygen consumption, carbon source demand, and sludge production. The recent advances in anammox-mediated MSW leachate treatment are systematically reviewed. During MSW leachate treatment, the anammox technology could be flexibly combined with partial nitrification, partial denitrification, fermentation, and methane oxidation. Additionally, this review comprehensively dis-cussed the specific effects on anammox bacteria (AnAOB) of key stressors in MSW leachate such as dissolved organic matters, salinity, and antibiotics, and introduced the corresponding pretreatment methods. The key control strategies focusing on achieving effective AnAOB retention, amelioration of microenvironments, and stable nitrite source were summarized. Moreover, the potential for nitrous oxide emission mitigation in anammox-based MSW leachate treatment systems was evaluated. Finally, this review highlighted the full-scale applications of anammox-mediated MSW leachate treatment and proposed the prospects as well as research gaps in this field.

TI Eco-efficiency for greenhouse gas emissions mitigation of municipal
   solid waste management: A case study of Tianjin, China
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The issue of municipal solid waste (MSW) management has been highlighted in China due to the continually increasing MSW volumes being generated and the limited capacity of waste treatment facilities. This article presents a quantitative eco-efficiency (E/E) analysis on MSW management in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. A methodology for E/E analysis has been proposed, with an emphasis on the consistent integration of life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC). The environmental and economic impacts derived from LCA and LCC have been normalized and defined as a quantitative E/E indicator. The proposed method was applied in a case study of Tianjin, China. The study assessed the current MSW management system, as well as a set of alternative scenarios, to investigate trade-offs between economy and GHG emissions mitigation. Additionally, contribution analysis was conducted on both LCA and LCC to identify key issues driving environmental and economic impacts. The results show that the current Tianjin's MSW management system emits the highest GHG and costs the least, whereas the situation reverses in the integrated scenario. The key issues identified by the contribution analysis show no linear relationship between the global warming impact and the cost impact in MSW management system. The landfill gas utilization scenario is indicated as a potential optimum scenario by the proposed E/E analysis, given the characteristics of MSW, technology levels, and chosen methodologies. The E/E analysis provides an attractive direction towards sustainable waste management, though some questions with respect to uncertainty need to be discussed further. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study was conducted to evaluate. the positive effects of compost application in agriculture and the benefit of the composting process for solid-waste treatment in the Mekong Delta region in southern Vietnam (comprised of 12 provinces and 1 centrally city). A simple prediction model for waste generation based on population and employing time-series analysis was constructed to assess and forecast waste generation to identify the potential of waste for composting and discharging. The greenhouse gas baseline emission from biodegradable components and the greenhouse gas reduction emission for alternative composting options were also calculated in g(CO2 eq.) per capita per day. Scenarios regarding different composting applications for the Mekong Delta region were defined. The estimations focused on such matters as environmental impacts, greenhouse-gas emission and reduction, resource consumption, economic benefits, and the application potential of the composting process. The principal result was that organic-waste composting was beneficial not only for mitigating the waste burden in landfill sites but also for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions compared to baseline emission and the attendant costs. In addition, the compost product was identified as having strong potential to displace chemical fertilizers in agriculture. It was shown that the composting process was a sound alternative for moving toward sustainable development in waste treatment and agriculture.

TI Life-cycle assessment of two food waste disposal processes based on
   anaerobic digestion in China
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB In the Chinese food waste disposal industry, the choice between using liquid-phase anaerobic digestion or solid-liquid mixed anaerobic digestion to effectively dispose of food waste has become a recent source of debate. However, no previous studies have compared or assessed the relevant technological parameters of these two processes for the same feedstock. In this study, the two processes were evaluated from the perspective of energy consumption and environmental impact. Here, hydrothermal pretreatment, anaerobic digestion, combined heat and power, and waste treatment were considered in the system boundaries. First, a biochemical methane potential test was conducted to obtain the liquid phase and solid-liquid mixed anaerobic digestion methanogenic potential. Then, using the actual operating parameters of the food waste disposal plant, a life-cycle assessment was performed for the two treatment processes. For solid-liquid mixed and liquid-phase anaerobic digestion processes, the total energy inputs are 182.81 kWh/t and 192.67 kWh/t, respectively, and the net energy inputs accounts for 26.2% and 30.7% of the total energy input, respectively. Compared with solid-liquid mixed anaerobic digestion, liquid-phase anaerobic digestion demonstrates a higher potential for global warming (77.91 vs. 29.24 kg CO2-eq./t), eutrophication (0.4 vs. 0.19 kg PO43--eq./t), acidification (2.61 vs. 1.22 kg SO2-eq./t), and photochemical ozone creation (0.077 vs. 0.03 kg NMVOC-eq./t). According to the sensitivity analysis, the increased efficiency in total-solids degradation of anaerobic digestion and the total-solids content of the biogas residue were found to have a significant effect on the reduction of eutrophication potential, acidification potential, and photochemical ozone creation potential in solid-liquid mixed anaerobic digestion. For liquid-phase anaerobic digestion, the total-solids content of the separated solid phase is an important factor affecting its environmental impact. These results provide important reference values for the development of food waste treatment processes. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A proposed framework of food waste collection and recycling for
   renewable biogas fuel production in Hong Kong
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Hong Kong is experiencing a pressing need for food waste management. Currently, approximately 3600 tonnes of food waste are disposed of at landfills in Hong Kong daily. The landfills in Hong Kong are expected to be exhausted by 2020. In the long run, unavoidable food waste should be sorted out from the other municipal solid waste (MSW) and then valorized into valuable resources. A simple sorting process involving less behavioural change of residents is, therefore, of paramount importance in order to encourage residents to sort the food waste from other MSW. In this paper, a sustainable framework of food waste collection and recycling for renewable biogas fuel production is proposed. For an efficient separation and collection system, an optic bag (i.e. green bag) can be used to pack the food waste, while the residual MSW can be packed in a common plastic bag. All the wastes are then sent to the refuse transfer stations in the conventional way (i.e. refuse collection vehicles). At the refuse transfer stations, the food waste is separated from the residual MSW using optic sensors which recognize the colours of the bags. The food waste in the optic bags is then delivered to the proposed Organic Waste Treatment Facilities, in which biogas is generated following the anaerobic digestion technology. The biogas can be further upgraded via gas upgrading units to a quality suitable for use as a vehicle biogas fuel. The use of biogas fuel from food waste has been widely practiced by some countries such as Sweden, France, and Norway. Hopefully, the proposed framework can provide the epitome of the waste-to-wealth concept for the sustainable collection and recycling of food waste in Hong Kong.(c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Review of the application of gasification and combustion technology and
   waste-to-energy technologies in sewage sludge treatment
SO FUEL
AB Gasification and combustion processing is deemed reliable and feasible methods in response to concerns about landfilling - a traditional treatment due to rapid growth in disposal capacity and pollution. In gasification and combustion processing, various processes are integrated with different configurations to carry out energy conversion of the thermal treatment process and improve the energy recovery efficiency. This study aimed to propose an effective solution to waste treatment by considering the sustainability and economic perspectives. This paper provided the observation on the technical perspectives of the gasification and combustion processes: the properties of sludge, reactor, combustion or gasification media and operating conditions applied to sewage sludge treatment. In addition, the application of the thermodynamic cycle with various heat recovery strategies for electricity generation was summarized in this paper. According to the research data, sewage sludge combustion efficiency reached up to 99 % at the combustion temperature of 800-850 ?. The maximum hydrogen gas (H-2) content was recorded at 40 mol% under steam/oxygen gasifying agent, and the low heating value of syngas was 6-7 MJ/Nm(3) for sewage sludge gasification. The integration between air gasification, external fired gas turbines (EFGT) without carbon capture process showed the highest exergy efficiency at 37.1 %, which was higher than 35.7 % resulted from waste combustion technology.

TI Quantitative sustainability assessment of household food waste
   management in the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Food waste represents the largest fraction of the municipal solid waste generated in Europe and its management is associated to suboptimal performance in environmental, health, and social dimensions. By processing detailed multi-fold local data as part of a comprehensive and broadly understandable sustainability framework, this study quantifies the environmental and socio-economic impacts of household food waste management in the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area based on priorities set by local stakeholders. Five alternative short-term management options have been assessed against the current system, relying on poor separate collection and incineration. Four options involve separate collection of food waste followed by biological treatments (home/centralised composting and anaerobic digestion) while one involves a mix of separate collection and centralised mechanical-biological treatment followed by anaerobic digestion. Among these, separate collection followed by anaerobic digestion coupled with effective nutrient and energy recovery is, according to our findings, the preferred option to improve the sustainability of the current system in all dimensions considered, except for the economic pillar due to the collection costs. Home and centralised composting as well as mechanical-biological treatment are associated to more adverse impacts based on our findings. The study informs local stakeholders and authorities on the potential consequences of their options, thereby allowing them to make sound choices for a future waste and circular economy strategy.

TI Effects of additives on nitrogen transformation and greenhouse gases
   emission of co-composting for deer manure and corn straw
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Compost can realize the recycling of organic waste. However, it also emits NH3 and greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the environment, which leads to nitrogen loss and global warming. Adding additives to compost can alleviate the emission of NH3 and GHGs. The mechanism of nitrogen transformation and GHGs emission was studied with deer manure and corn straw as compost substrate, and biochar and zeolite as additives. The results showed that the addition of zeolite in compost is good for prolonging high-temperature composting time. The addition of zeolite reduced the transformation of NH3-N and the N2O emission. The addition of zeolite is beneficial to reduce nitrogen loss during composting. CH4 emission is an important factor affecting the global warming potential of composting, and it is necessary to improve ventilation conditions in order to alleviate anaerobic. This study is of great significance to reduce nitrogen loss and improve composting effect.

TI Composting as sustainable strategy for municipal solid waste management
   in the Chimborazo Region, Ecuador: Suitability of the obtained composts
   for seedling production
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Solid waste management is a huge challenge in developing countries mainly due to factors such as population increase, poverty and the lack of proper investment by the respective governments. Composting, if it is properly carried out, can constitute a viable method for organic waste management in these countries, due to its low operational cost and the income generation, with low environmental impact. Thus, this paper studies composting as treatment method for the sustainable management and recycling of the municipal solid wastes generated in the Chimborazo Region (Ecuador), and the use of some of the composts obtained as growing media for seedling production. For this, six piles were elaborated using municipal solid wastes: Piles 1, 2 and 3 were prepared using municipal solid wastes from the Riobamba landfill and Piles 4, 5 and 6 were elaborated using source-separated market waste and urban pruning wastes. After composting, composts C3, C4 and C5 (from Piles 3, 4 and 5, respectively) were used as substrates components, mixed with peat in different percentages (0, 25, 50 and 75%, volume/volume) for seedling production of tomato, courgette and pepper. The composts obtained showed adequate physico-chemical and chemical properties, and a suitable degree of stability and maturity, with absence of phytotoxicity. Regarding their use as growing media, the substrates with 25% (volume/volume) of the compost C3, C4 or C5 had the best properties for their use as substrate components, only C3 reducing the seed germination in the courgette crop. In addition, at an economic level, the alternative of peat substitution at 25% with compost can suppose a reduction of 23% in the cost of the substrate. In the most conservative scenario, this reduction can be of 21%, also with an increase of 2.9% in the business contribution margin. Therefore, composting can be a suitable method not only for the management and recycling of these waste streams, but also for adding value to them, as components of growing media in seedling production.

AB The move towards more sustainable cities involves rethinking various infrastructure systems and supply chains, including those for energy and waste. To provide decision support to local stakeholders, the resilience.io platform provides a series of modules to allow forecasting of socio-demographic changes, simulating spatio-temporal activities and planning investment and operational strategies to meet the sustainable development goals for multiple domains including water, energy, food and cities. In this paper we apply these tools to waste-to-energy pathways, aiming to develop treatment capacity and energy recovery with the lowest cost. Two categories of waste including wastewater (WW) and municipal solid waste (MSW) are analysed as the source of biogas through either direct combustion for combined heat and power generation in incinerators, or anaerobic digestion (AD) for electricity and heating along with digestate produced. Results show that for a case study in Ghana a combination of waste incineration, large-scale AD for WW and MSW and farm-scale AD for plantations, depending on local characteristics for supply and demand, provides waste treatment and energy at lowest cost. This application demonstrates how simulation and optimisation models can provide new insights in the design of value chains, with particular emphasis on whole system analysis and integration.

AB It is estimated that out of the 9,600 tonnes of municipal solid waste (MSW) generated by Delhi only 78% of the waste is collected, 9% is treated by composting, and the remaining gets dumped in one of the three (Okhla, Ghazipur, Bhalswa) open landfill sites located at the outskirts of Delhi. The present article stems out of the assessment of the practice of solid waste management at Okhla Landfill site based on the field study, including survey analysis and primary data collection and investigation. The article looks into the legislative framework and judicial interventions to modernise and organise the waste disposal system on scientific lines. The outcomes of the present study demonstrate that decentralisation, capacity building, and access to the sharing of waste management knowledge, holds the crucial driver for sustainable waste management.

TI Towards energy security by promoting circular economy: A holistic
   approach
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB Dependence on fossil fuels, coupled with continuous supply disruptions by the most important natural gas suppliers, has jeopardized the energy security of most European countries. Therefore, determining the regions that can significantly increase their natural gas independence through the circular economy of their wastes is more important than ever. This work presents a multi-scale analysis to determine the possibility of implementing a circular economy towards reducing the regions dependency on fossil natural gas. A holistic approach is used to evaluate the availability of waste (manure, municipal solid waste, sludge, and lignocellulosic waste) and model the waste treatment processes (gasification and anaerobic digestion), together with a techno-economy analysis of the infrastructure required. A facility location problem optimizes the selection of the technology, the production capacity and the location of the facilities, according to the available budget. The analysis is focused on Spain, where, at the national level, an investment of 9458 M euro and an operating cost of 5000 M euro per year would allow covering 35% of the natural gas demanded. The regional analysis shows that a total of 19 provinces can be self-sufficient with this budget. These provinces have a high biomethane production potential through lignocellulosic waste gasification and a low demand for natural gas. Since energy is a basic commodity, the ability to produce enough biomethane to cover the entire demand for natural gas gives waste valorization strategic importance at both the social and economic levels.

TI Metagenomic and HT-qPCR analysis reveal the microbiome and resistome in
   pig slurry under storage, composting, and anaerobic digestion
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Direct application of pig slurry to agricultural land, as a means of nutrient recycling, introduces pathogens, antibiotic resistant bacteria, or genes, to the environment. With global environmental sustainability policies mandating a reduction in synthetic fertilisation and a commitment to a circular economy it is imperative to find effective on-farm treatments of slurry that maximises its fertilisation value and minimises risk to health and the environment. We assessed and compared the effect of storage, composting, and anaerobic digestion (AD) on pig slurry microbiome, resistome and nutrient content. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing and HT-qPCR arrays were implemented to understand the dynamics across the treatments. Our results identified that each treatment methods have advantages and disadvantages in removal pollutants or increasing nutrients. The data suggests that storage and composting are optimal for the removal of human pathogens and anaerobic digestion for the reduction in antibiotic resistance (AMR) genes and mobile genetic elements. The nitrogen content is increased in storage and AD, while reduced in composting. Thus, depending on the requirement for increased or reduced nitrogen the optimum treatment varies. Combining the results indicates that composting provides the greatest gain by reducing risk to human health and the environment. Network analysis revealed reducing Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes while increasing Firmicutes will reduce the AMR content. KEGG analysis identified no significant change in the pathways across all treatments. This novel study provides a data driven decision tree to determine the optimal treatment for best practice to minimise pathogen, AMR and excess or increasing nutrient transfer from slurry to environment.

TI A water-waste-energy nexus approach to bridge the sustainability gap in
   landfill-based waste management regions
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB The present paper discusses issues, scenarios, new ideas and processes with the specific purpose of quantitatively evaluating the feasibility of applying industrial symbiosis (IS) to regions where Waste-to-Energy (WtE) processes are not fully utilised (e.g. many Mediterranean regions), in order to exploit the potential synergies between 1) wastewater treatment (WWT), 2) WtE and 3) Anaerobic Digestion (AD) processes in a new, holistic approach that is able to maximise the efficient use of resources, while reducing the current environmental impacts.
   The enormous energy that can be obtained from residual waste is partially used, through an IS-based bio-refinery approach, to thermally support the AD and drying processes of organic waste and sludge, thereby allowing 100% of the increased biogas production to be upgraded to biomethane. The need to landfill can be reduced to less than 5-10%, which allows the 2035 EU target to be achieved, with relevant economic and environmental benefits.
   Electricity from the WtE plant is exploited to supply the utilities of the 3 main processes and in particular to lower the costs of the required tertiary WWT and wastewater pumping phases in order to make the reclaimed water cost competitive with that of conventional water resources and thus to make this marginal water resource fully sustainable. The proposed approach can be applied in numerous countries, where landfilling is still predominant, to help stakeholders favouring a cultural shift towards a more sustainable, integrated waste/wastewater management while lowering the sterile "Not In Anyone's BackYard" (NIABY) opposition to WtE plants.

TI Co-pyrolysis of municipal solid waste (MSW) and biomass with Co/sludge
   fly ash catalyst
SO FUEL
AB Catalytic co-pyrolysis of municipal solid waste (MSW) and biomass pine sawdust (PSD) under sludge fly ash (SFA) could be a breakthrough towards the energy challenges and waste management. This paper aims to develop a unique cobalt-alkali-SFA (Co-A-SFA) catalyst, in order to investigate its influence under optimal operating conditions in a fixed bed reactor for syngas production. The catalytic activity was assessed under different Co loading and support ratios. The results indicated that in the presence of Co-A-SFA catalyst, gas production increased due to alkali pretreated fly ash catalyst. Moreover, increasing the Co loading from 5 wt% to 10 wt%, the syngas production increased irrespective of the individual feedstock ratios. Under catalytic conditions of 5 and 10 wt% the H2 yield to 25.4% and 28.3% for 50/50 MSW/PSD compared to 11.5 wt% under no catalyst. Catalytic co-pyrolysis of MSW and PSD also minimized the concentration of complex liquid compounds and heavy hydrocarbons. Therefore, this study establishes a new approach towards energy production and sustainable waste management through useful resource utilization of MSW, PSD and SFA. The outcomes acquired in this investigation showed that blended feedstock in co-pyrolysis of MSW and pine sawdust could enhance production of valuable syngas under SFA-based catalyst.

TI Environmental assessment of the integrated municipal solid waste
   management system in Porto (Portugal)
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB This paper presents the results of the environmental evaluation of the waste treatment processes occurring at LIPOR (the Inter-municipal Waste Management System of Greater Porto - Portugal) in the period 2007-2011. To this aim two methodologies are applied, namely the Energy and Material Flow Analysis (EMFA) and the Ecological Footprint (EF). The benefits of their joint application are explored, as well as the usefulness of the indicators derived to guide the company in the identification of the hot spots and in the improvement of their management practices. The Integrated Waste Management System (IWMS) at LIPOR includes several units, specifically the separation of several materials for valorization (namely, packaging materials -as metals and plastics-, glass and paper and cardboard), the incineration of waste with energy recovery, composting of the organic fraction and the landfilling of pre-treated waste.
   From the EMFA, it can be highlighted that the electricity generated in the energy recovery plant is the most important energy flow and that it largely exceeds the energy demands from the LIPOR system. According to the net EF results, the composting and energy recovery units were found as very beneficial in terms of resources savings. Despite the fact that the composting plant has the largest gross EF (0.28 +/- 0.02 gm(2) kg(-1) in average for the period analyzed, where gm(2) refers to global square meters), a significant counter footprint effect associated with the production of the compost was calculated (-1.51 +/- 0.10 gm(2) kg(-1) of waste composted). The energy recovery plant shows the lower gross EF (0.05 +/- 0.01 gm(2) kg(-1) of waste combusted), but also an important contribution to the counter footprint (-0.78 +/- 0.01 gm(2) kg(-1) in average). These individual results are reported to 1 kg of waste treated at each facility. Meanwhile, the EF for the overall IWMS reaches -0.49 +/- 0.12 gm(2) kg(-1), where this result is reported to the total wastes treated at LIPOR. The negative value means that, in terms of the EF, the global system is environmentally beneficial because of the recovery of resources such as the compost and electricity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI INVESTIGATION INTO EMISSIONS OF GASEOUS POLLUTANTS DURING SEWAGE SLUDGE
   COMPOSTING WITH WOOD WASTE
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT
AB The main environmental problem of sewage sludge treatment and storing processes is unpleasant smell caused by emitted gases, such as NH3, H2S etc.; which are released during organic matter decomposition process. The second environmental problem is that during sewage sludge composting process global warming gases, such as CO2, CH4, and N2O are emitted, the emissions of these gases can be reduced by creating optimal composting conditions (C:N, aeration, pH and humidity) and by adding some additives (wood cuttings, shavings, zeolites, peat etc.) into sewage sludge. In our study we analyse the experimental results on CH4, NH3, H2S and VOC emissions during sewage sludge composting process. For this experiment, centrifuge-dried sewage sludge from Vilnius City Municipal Sewage Treatment Plant were used. Used Ashen bark, oaken cuttings, aspen shavings, shredded deciduous tree branches. The composting process was performed in a compost site-simulating facilities.

TI Sewage Sludge Management and Application in the Form of Sustainable
   Fertilizer
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB One of the most pressing environmental problems worldwide is sewage sludge (SS) management. Every year, wastewater volume increases and thus, the amount of SS produced increases as well. The disposal of SS in landfills, as practiced in many countries, is not a sustainable solution. Instead, SS, rich in organic matter and other nutrients, can be used as an alternative soil additive or fertilizer. The properties of these materials depend on their chemical composition and the method of treatment. Experience from a number of countries, such as the US and Europe, has shown that SS can be transformed from a waste into a valuable resource, provided that the final product fulfils the relevant regulatory standards. This review examines the sustainable conversion of SS to sustainable fertilizers, the impact on waste minimization, and the potential benefits in agriculture.

SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Inadequate management of household solid waste is a serious problem in many developing cities. The study aimed to evaluate the quantities and composition of household solid waste generation in Abuja within different socioeconomic groups. The wastes from 74 households across different socioeconomic levels in Abuja were collected, weighted and classified on a daily basis for seven days in February 2012. The result showed that the average daily per capita household waste generation is 0.634 kg/capita/day. The characteristic of solid waste in Abuja are typical for the developing cities and dominated by organic waste. Households waste consisted of 63.6% organic waste, 9.7% paper, 8.7% plastics, 3.2% metal, 2.6% glass, 1.6% textile and 10.6% others (unclassified) and the bulk density was 240 kg/m(3). The evaluation of relationship between income and daily per capita household waste generation showed a positive relationship. The study revealed a statistically significant difference between household size and daily per capita household waste generation in high-income group; a slight significant difference between household size and daily per capita household waste generation in medium income group and no statistically significant difference between household size and daily per capita household waste generation in low-income group.

TI Comprehensive assessment of cement kiln co-processing under MSW
   sustainable management requirements
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Although cement kiln co-processing (CKC) has been considered an important municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment method in recent years, there however still exist obstacles such as unclear technical feasibility and ambiguous legislation that impede its further development. Addressing these barriers remains difficult as a comprehensive understanding of CKC from an MSW management perspective (which is a major challenge for policy makers) is lacking in existing studies.
   Therefore, this study adopted Material Flow Analysis, Life Cycle Assessment and Net Present Value evaluation methods to quantitatively analyze the waste reduction effect, energy efficiency, environmental impact and economic performance of CKC in order to provide an important basis for determining its feasibility and policy direction in comparison to existing MSW treatment technologies.
   The results showed that CKC had a waste reduction rate of up to 99.5%, and 90% lower environmental emissions than incineration. However, from a life cycle perspective, the net environmental impact of CKC was not as significant as incineration and mechanical biological treatment because its coal saving effect has a relatively lower environmental impact mitigation potential compared to the potential from electricity generation brought by incineration. Furthermore, the proposed MSW treatment fee subsidy for CKC was 59 CNY/tonne, reflecting a 34% reduction from current incineration subsidy fee.
   These findings are important for many countries since the main barriers to CKC development are similar. Improving the comprehensive understanding of CKC could help policymakers formulate precise promotion planning and reasonable incentive policies.

TI A spatial modeling approach for siting, sizing and economic assessment
   of centralized biogas plants in organic waste management
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Disposal of organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) at landfills and direct application of livestock manure onto soil are often restricted by regulations due to environmental concerns. These regulations require the application of different technologies, such as anaerobic digestion, in the management of OFMSW and livestock manure, and creates an opportunity for resource recovery. Since these waste sources are geographically dispersed, siting and sizing of resource recovery facilities to minimize transfer distances are critical for the sustainable management of these waste. This study aims to investigate the sizing, siting, and economic feasibility of municipality owned centralized biogas plants in the management of OFMSW and livestock manure through application of spatial modeling. A stepwise land suitability analysis was performed to determine potential plant sites followed by a location-allocation analysis to analyze siting, sizing and transportation costs for increasing number of plants. Finally, an economic assessment was conducted to compare unit cost of electric energy and existing feed-in tariff for biogas plants. The methodology was applied to the city of Izmir in Turkey. 8 biogas plants could be built in Izmir with a total installation size of 92 MWe and 10 $ cent/kWh unit cost of electric energy. This study represents an important step in the establishment of a local decision support system in Turkey for the utilization of regional bioenergy sources, and organic waste management.

AB Rapid population growth, combined with increased industrialization, has exacerbated the issue of solid waste management. Poor management of municipal solid waste (MSW) not only has detrimental environmental consequences but also puts public health at risk and introduces several other socioeconomic problems. Many developing countries are grappling with the problem of safe disposing of large amounts of produced municipal solid waste. Unmanaged municipal solid waste pollutes the environment, so its use as a potential renewable energy source would aid in meeting both increased energy needs and waste management. This review investigates emerging strategies and monitoring tools for municipal solid waste management. Waste monitoring using high-end technologies and energy recovery from MSW has been discussed. It comprehensively covers environmental and economic relevance of waste management technologies based on innovations achieved through the integration of approaches.

TI Assessment of co-composting of sludge and woodchips in the perspective
   of environmental impacts (EASETECH)
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB To reveal potential impacts to environment and human health quantitatively, co-composting and utilization of sludge and woodchips were investigated using a life-cycle-based model, EASETECH. Three scenarios were assessed through experiments using different material ratios. Emission amounts during co-composting were determined by monitoring data and mass balance. With 100 t sludge treatment, co-composting showed impacts to acidification (29.9 PE) and terrestrial eutrophication (57.7 PE) mainly for ammonia emission. Compost utilization presented savings on freshwater eutrophication (-1.5 PE) because of phosphorus substitution. With the application of fewer woodchips, impacts to acidification and terrestrial eutrophication decreased because more ammonium was reserved rather than released. All impacts to human toxicity were not significant (8.2 +/- 0.6 PE) because the compost was used for urban landscaping rather than farming. Trace gaseous compounds showed marginal impacts to global warming and toxicity categories. The results provide a new perspective and offer evidence for appropriate sludge treatment selection.

SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The conversion of food waste and sludge into biogas via anaerobic digestion technology is gaining attention in recent years, which plays a significant role in waste valorization into bioenergy and promotes environmental sustainability. Biochar is a carbonaceous material produced via thermochemical conversion of biomass waste, and tailoring biochar for diverse environmental applications adheres to the principle of circular economy. The emerging application of biochar as an additive in the anaerobic digestion of food waste and sludge has been intensively investigated in the last few years. However, a comprehensive understanding of multifunctional roles of biochar and its mechanisms in the production of biogas via miscellaneous/complex anaerobic digestion process is yet to be attained. This review scrutinizes the key roles of biochar as an additive and emphasizes the influences of biochar characteristics on the anaerobic digestion processes and their capability to address the foremost challenges. This review also evaluates the techno-economic and environmental impacts of biochar synthesis and its emerging application for biogas production via anaerobic digestion to make the integrated process more economical and environmentally sustainable, and identifies challenges and prospects for future studies.

TI Characterization of municipal solid waste: Measures towards management
   strategies using statistical analysis
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Implementing unified municipal solid waste management (MSWM) is often difficult due to socio-economic variables. However, spatial GIS models and statistical analysis of solid waste characterized by the weekdays, weekends, and festivals can somewhat mitigate the variance and assist with selecting suitable waste management methods. This paper presents the example of Rajouri, India, to propose a suitable MSWM based on Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) intensity maps and statistical findings. The considered region was divided into different sample sites based on the local population density, and Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) was collected from four locations in each site on weekdays, weekends, and festivals. Compositional analysis of the MSW was then used to generate spatial IDW models in QGIS 3.22.7 to interpolate MSW generation over the entire area. Finally, statistical analysis was conducted to gain insight into the waste generation and accumulation trends. The results show that Rajouri produces 245 tonnes of waste daily (per capita: 0.382 kg/day) with a large organic fraction compared to other waste categories. Besides, waste generation is observed to increase over weekends and festivals due to increased consumption of material goods. Composting could serve as a vector for municipal solid waste because of its increased organic component and cost constraints. However, further research on the potential segregation techniques for the organic fraction of solid waste is needed.

TI Municipal food waste management in Singapore: practices, challenges and
   recommendations
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Municipal food waste is a global challenge in solid waste management, especially in Singapore. It is scattered in location, non-ignorable in quantity, and non-uniform in quality. This report focuses on the state of the art and challenges of Singapore municipal food waste management for the first time. The previous studies only focus on general food waste from both industry and municipality. The physical properties of municipal food waste are incompatible to landfill and incineration by creating secondary environmental burdens and lowering treatment efficiency. A decentralized anaerobic co-digestion with other substrates, after comparing with other technologies, is recommended, since bio-energy is a recognized valuable final product in Singapore's context. However, there are four major highlighted challenges of food waste recycling, including low final product demand, inefficient waste collection design, cheap disposal cost, and low social awareness. A "food waste management hierarchy" for Singapore is also proposed. The most to least preferred options are listed as: source reduction, industrial uses, renewable energy, and composting then incineration.

TI Implementation effect of municipal solid waste mandatory sorting policy
   in Shanghai
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB In Shanghai, the biggest metropolis in China, the source classification of domestic waste began in the 1990s but achieved little success over the past thirty years. Surprisingly, the compulsory classification provision of Shanghai residents' domestic waste since 2019 has been successful. In this work, the overall status, and challenges of municipal solid waste (MSW) management in Shanghai under compulsory waste sorting rules are investigated. We tracked the classification efficiency of municipal solid waste, physicochemical characteristics of separated waste, and the carbon emissions arising from waste disposal system. It was found that almost 83.62 % of household food waste has been effectively separated with high purity of 99.50 %, while the lower heating value (LHV) of residual waste was increased by 96.4 % compared to previous years. With effective waste classification, the net carbon emission of separated processing was reduced to 0.11 ton CE/ton waste. However, this system generated some negative outcomes as well such as the lower recovery value of metal in bottom ash and the higher chloride content in fly ash. Moreover, we have documented and discussed several challenges of sustainable waste management system in Shanghai in the text. In order to overcome those challenges, we recommend to: (i) establish a finer source separation and recycling system; (ii) develop highly-efficient resource recovery technologies of byproducts from waste disposal system; and (iii) propose optimization adjustment strategy for overcapacity in incineration facilities.

TI Comparison of waste-to-energy technologies of gasification and
   incineration using life cycle assessment: Case studies in Finland,
   France and China
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Waste-to-Energy (WtE) has gradually constituted one of the most important options to achieve energy recovery from municipal solid waste (MSW). However, the environmental sustainability of a specific WtE system varies with used technologies and geographic differences. As a result, three representative WtE systems are compared using life cycle assessment (LCA): a gasification-based WtE plant in Finland, mechanical-grate incineration in France, and circulating fluidized bed incineration in China. Results show that the overall environmental performance of the gasification system is better than incineration. The use of gasification technology, attributed to an intermediate syngas purification step, can provide benefits of both reducing the stack emissions and increasing the energy efficiency. Regional waste management, especially related to MSW caloric value and emission regulation, are determining factors for a preferable performance of the incineration in France over that in China. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses further address key variations such as choice of MSW composition, basis of displaced electricity, energy recovery mode, and application of "best-available technology" dedicated to incineration. It is found that the most sensitive parameters influencing the LCA results are: electricity recovery, CO2 emission, and NOx emission. In the future, use of the source-separated high caloric waste combined with a more stringent emission standard can efficiently improve MSW incineration in China. Bottom ash recycling for metals and materials is highly applicable regarding incineration in France. This presented study can overall contribute to the development of specific WtE technology and local waste management plan for decisio-makers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Sustainable energy from waste organic matters via ef ficient microbial
   processes
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB This review emphasizes utilization of waste organic matters from water bodies and soil sources for sustainable energy development. These organic waste matters (including microplastics) from a variety of environmental sources have created a big challenge to utilize them for energy development for human needs, maintaining a cleaner environment and thereby, producing useful bioproducts (sustainable bioenergy or other primary-metabolites). Anaerobic digestions as well as other effective wastewater treatment approaches are discussed. From the water bodies, waste organic matter reduction can be achieved by a reduction of chemical oxygen demand and biological oxygen demand after the waste treatment. Other forms of organic waste matter are available in the form of agro wastes or residues (stalk of wheat or rice, maize, corn etc.) due to crop cultivation, which are generally burnt into ashes. Such wastes can be utilized for bioenergy energy production, which would help for the reduction of climate changes or other toxic gases. Hydrogen, bioelectricity, ethanol, butanol, methane and algal diesel or other types of fuel sources would help to provide sustainable source of bioenergy that can be produced from these wastes via degradation by the biological processes. This review will discuss in depths about the sustainable nature of organic matters to produce clean energy via application of efficient biological methods to maintain a clean environment, thereby providing alternative options to fossil energy fuels.

TI Attitude of Chinese public towards municipal solid waste sorting policy:
   A text mining study
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB With the acceleration of urban development, the amount of municipal solid waste (MSW) has increased dramatically. In order to recycle MSW more efficiently, a compulsory policy of sorting MSW has been enacted in China. According to the existing literature, attitude is an important factor affecting public's MSW sorting behavior. To explore the Chinese residents' emotional tendency towards the MSW sorting policy, this study analyzed the data of Sina Weibo users and their comments on related popular posts. Meanwhile, text mining technology was employed to analyze the collected data. Results showed that although a large proportion of the Chinese public has a positive attitude towards the MSW sorting policy, the proportion of people with negative emotions reached nearly half. In addition, it was found that the Chinese people in different regions pay different attentions to the MSW sorting policy. Results further revealed that the main reasons for the public's negative emotions were fines, MSW sorting rules, fees, timing of throwing waste, and irregular recycling procedures. By providing the public sentiment analysis of MSW sorting, this study can serve as a policy guide for practitioners and policymakers to link current research areas into social development.

TI Curbing dioxin emissions from municipal solid waste incineration in
   China: Re-thinking about management policies and practices
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB As one of the countries with large amounts of dioxin releases, the control of dioxins is a major challenge for China. Municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration should be considered a high priority source of dioxin emissions because it is playing an increasingly more important role in waste management. MSW incineration in China has much higher emission rates of dioxins than in the developed countries, partially resulting from the gaps in the technologies of incineration and flue gas cleaning. Moreover, the current management policies and practices also contribute significantly to the problem. We recommend lowering dioxin emission standard, strengthening fly ash management, and improving regulation enforcement to reduce dioxin releases into the environment from MSW incineration. We also propose that alternative strategies should be considered on dioxin control and call for an expansion of economic instruments in waste management to reduce waste generation and thus the need for incineration.

AB Dalian Municipality is composed of Dalian City and its surrounding areas, which includes four satellite towns. The characteristics of municipal solid waste (MSW) and municipal solid waste management (MSWM) in these satellite towns are presented in the current paper. Food waste was the dominant component in all cases, accounting for 29% to 67% of MSW. The per capita daily MSW generation rates of the four towns varied greatly, ranging from 0.95 to 2.86 kg.day(-1). However, the average per capita MSW generation rate of the four towns in 2008 was 1.11 kg.day(-1), which was comparable to that of Dalian City (1.07 kg.day(-1)). The MSWM in the four towns of Dalian Municipality was relatively simple, with old-fashioned and open-air garbage bins and waste transfer vehicles. The terminal disposal method for MSW was mainly simple landfilling. Only two towns besides Dalian City had their own sanitary landfill sites.

TI Design of a robust waste recycling network integrating social and
   environmental pillars of sustainability
SO COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
AB The design of an efficient Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) management network can reduce the network costs, such as investment, operational and recycling costs, and improve its sustainability, from economic to environmental and social perspectives. In this paper, a multi-objective scenario-based robust stochastic optimization model for designing a sustainable MSW management network under uncertainty is proposed. The proposed model has four objectives to seek sustainability from two quantitative and qualitative aspects. Considering the dynamicity of the factors affecting an MSW management network as well as the multiplicity of sustainability perspectives, the proposed model allows, on one hand, reaching a robust solution considering the potential scenarios, and on the other hand, integrating sustainability indicators while creating a balance between the quantitative and quali-tative evaluation of such indicators. Moreover, the waste treatment technologies, as the highest added-value echelon of the MSW management network, which also distinguishes the network from a generic waste recy-cling network, has been investigated in the model. Finally, fuel consumption, have been particularly emphasized as critical factor, highly contributing to transportation costs and Co2 emission that are decisive criteria from both economic and environmental points of view. The proposed model and solution approach are validated through a real case study.

TI From agricultural use of sewage sludge to nutrient extraction: A soil
   science outlook
SO AMBIO
AB The composition of municipal wastewater and sewage sludge reflects the use and proliferation of elements and contaminants within society. In Sweden, official statistics show that concentrations of toxic metals in municipal sewage sludge have steadily decreased, by up to 90 %, since the 1970s, due to environmental programmes and statutory limits on metals in sludge and soil. Results from long-term field experiments show that reduced metal pollution during repeated sewage sludge application has reversed negative trends in soil biology. Despite this Swedish success story, organic waste recycling from Swedish towns and cities to arable land is still limited to only about 20 % of the total amount produced. Resistance among industries and consumers to products grown on land treated with sewage sludge may not always be scientifically grounded; however, there are rational obstacles to application of sewage sludge to land based on its inherent properties rather than its content of pollutants. We argue that application of urban organic wastes to soil is an efficient form of recycling for small municipalities, but that organic waste treatment from large cities requires other solutions. The large volumes of sewage sludge collected in towns and cities are not equitably distributed back to arable land because of the following: (i) The high water and low nutrient content in sewage sludge make long-distance transportation too expensive; and (ii) the low plant availability of nutrients in sewage sludge results in small yield increases even after many years of repeated sludge addition. Therefore, nutrient extraction from urban wastes instead of direct organic waste recycling is a possible way forward. The trend for increased combustion of urban wastes will make ash a key waste type in future. Combustion not only concentrates the nutrients in the ash but also leads to metal enrichment; hence, direct application of the ash to land is most often not possible. However, inorganic fertiliser (e.g. mono-ammonium phosphate fertiliser, MAP) can be produced from metalcontaminated sewage sludge ash in a process whereby the metals are removed. We argue that the view on organic waste recycling needs to be diversified in order to improve the urban-rural nutrient cycle, since only recycling urban organic wastes directly is not a viable option to close the urban-rural nutrient cycle. Recovery and recycling of nutrients from organic wastes are a possible solution. When organic waste recycling is complemented by nutrient extraction, some nutrient loops within society can be closed, enabling more sustainable agricultural production in future.

TI Assessment of the Synergy between Recycling and Thermal Treatments in
   Municipal Solid Waste Management in Europe
SO ENERGIES
AB In 2018, the production of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) in EU-28 reached 250.6 Mt, with the adoption of different management strategies, involving recycling (48 wt %), incineration and thermal valorization (29 wt %) and landfilling (23 wt %). This work was based on the analysis of the baseline situation of MSW management in EU-28 in 2018, considering its progress in 2008-2018, and discussed the possible improvement perspectives based on a framework involving incineration and recycling as the only possible alternatives, specifically evaluating the capability of already-existing incineration plants to fulfill the EU needs in the proposed framework. The results of the assessment showed two main crucial issues that could play a pivotal role in the achievement of Circular Economy action plan targets: the need to increase the recycling quotas for specific MSW fractions through the separate collection, and therefore the improvement of definite treatment process chains; the optimization of the recovery of secondary raw materials from incineration bottom ash, involving the recycling of ferrous and nonferrous metals and the mineral fraction. Both issues need to find an extensive application across all member states to decrease the actual differences in the adoption of sustainable MSW management options.

TI How should greenhouse gas emissions be taken into account in the
   decision making of municipal solid waste management procurements? A case
   study of the South Karelia region, Finland
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The ongoing trend in the public sector is to make more sustainable procurements by taking into account the impacts throughout the entire life cycle of the procurement. Despite the trend, the only deciding factor can still be the total costs. This article answers the question of how greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions should be taken into account in municipal solid waste (MSW) management when selecting an incineration plant for source separated mixed MSW. The aim is to guide the decision making of MSW management towards more environmentally friendly procurements.
   The study was carried out by calculating the global warming potentials (GWPs) and costs of mixed MSW management by using the waste composition from a case area in Finland. Scenarios of landfilling and combustion in three actual waste incineration plants were used to recognise the main processes that affect the results. GWP results show that the combustion of mixed MSW is a better alternative than landfilling the waste. The GHG results from combustion are greatly affected by emissions from the combustion and substituted energy production. The significance of collection and transportation is higher from the costs' perspective than from the point of view of GHG emissions. The main costs, in addition to collection and transportation costs, result from the energy utilization or landfilling of mixed MSW.
   When tenders are invited for the incineration location of mixed MSW, the main focus should be: What are the annual electricity and heat recovery efficiencies and which are the substituted fuels in the area? In addition, in the case of a fluidized bed combustor it is crucial to know the combusted share of mixed MSW after preparing solid recovered fuel (SRF) and the treatment of rejects. The environmental criteria for the waste incineration plant procurements should be made in order to obtain clear instructions for the procurement units. The results can also be utilized more widely. The substituted fuels in the area and the effect of the plant location on the utilization of the produced energy can already be identified when planning an appropriate site for the waste incineration plant.

TI Sustainable recycling of municipal solid waste in developing countries
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
CT 5th Asian-Pacific Landfill Symposium
CY OCT 22-24, 2008
CL Sapporo, JAPAN
AB This research focuses on recycling in developing countries as one form of sustainable municipal solid waste management (MSWM). Twenty-three case studies provided municipal solid waste (MSW) generation and recovery rates and composition for compilation and assessment. The average MSW generation rate was 0.77 kg/person/day, with recovery rates from 5-40%. The waste streams of 19 of these case studies consisted of 0-70% recyclables and 17-80% organics.
   Qualitative analysis of all 23 case studies identified barriers or incentives to recycling, which resulted in the development of factors influencing recycling of MSW in developing countries. The factors are government policy, government finances, waste characterization, waste collection and segregation, household education, household economics, MSWM (municipal solid waste management) administration. MSWM personnel education. MSWM plan, local recycled-material market, technological and human resources, and land availability.
   Necessary and beneficial relationships drawn among these factors revealed the collaborative nature of sustainable MSWM. The functionality of the factor relationships greatly influenced the success of sustainable MSWM. A correlation existed between stakeholder involvement and the three dimensions of sustainability: environment, society, and economy. The only factors driven by all three dimensions (waste collection and segregation, MSWM plan, and local recycled-material market) were those requiring the greatest collaboration with other factors.

TI Biochar promotes methane production during anaerobic digestion of
   organic waste
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB Climate change and energy demand are calling for more sustainable fuels such as biomethane produced by anaerobic digestion of organic waste. Biochar addition to waste is presumed to enhance the efficiency of methane production, yet individual reports disclose contradictory results. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of 27 selected publications containing 156 paired measurements of control and biochar-amended treatments to assess the impact of biochar on the methanogenic performance. Results show that biochar promotes biomethane production substantially with a high Hedge's d value of 5.7 +/- 1.04, yet sporadic publications report a methane decline. Methanogenic performance is statistically controlled by feedstock type, pyrolysis temperature and biochar concentration, but not controlled by pH, size, surface area and methanogen species. These findings should help to tune the parameters of anaerobic digestion with biochar to optimize biomethane productions. Moreover, our results cast some doubt on the efficiency of adding biochar to soil to sequester carbon in soils because biochar promotes methane generation and, in turn, emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas, to the atmosphere.

TI Life cycle-based, energy-related analysis for waste management
   strategies: a case study of two impact indicators in Pyongyang
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) is regarded to be an important source of greenhouse gas emissions, which could result in a significant impact on climate change. This study conducted analyses of both cumulative energy demand (CED) and carbon footprint (CF) indicators per reference flow (RF) and identified the relationship between both the indicators, and additionally, it made some recommendations for MSW management strategies in Pyongyang, DPR Korea, based on life cycle thinking. This present study suggested using a hybrid CED indicator and the energy-related CF indicator for the analysis of the existing MSW management system, while applying system expansion for crediting the recycled materials, the energy recovery, and the compost/fertilizer. The result showed that the CED indicator in the MSW management system accounted for - 9,569.8 MJ/RF of primary energy savings in total, corresponding to the avoided emissions of - 1,522.89 kg CO(2)eq/RF. The recycling and composting of waste presented energy savings due to the recycled materials and the avoided production of mineral fertilizers replaced with the compost, respectively. In addition, the incineration had some potential for energy recovery from waste, and it could result in crediting energy further, while the landfill should be improved in a more sustainable way of making use of the landfill gas and/or replacing the landfill with incineration with energy recovery. The results also indicated that the CED indicator was closely related to the CF indicator, valued as global warming potential, throughout the MSW management options/processes, and both the indicators could serve as an appropriate proxy of the environmental impacts on a life cycle phase.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB The unregulated discharge reams of food waste (FW) causes severe resource loss and environmental pollution. In the present study, a bibliometric analysis was used for research activities and tendencies of food waste from 1991 to 2015. The results indicated that the amount of FW research continually grew by the years, and the number of publications rose significantly from 2012. Bioresource Technology and Waste Management were the two most frequently published journals in the field of FW research. China took a leading position and had a high h-index (38) out of 94 countries/territories, followed by the USA and South Korea. Presently, anaerobic digestion for methane and dark fermentation for hydrogen production are the mainstream techniques in FW disposal. Lactic and ethanol fermentation from FW received more and more attention in recent years. Life cycle assessment (LCA) was an ever-increasingly popular evaluation method for FW-related research. Moreover, cluster analysis indicated microbial community structure, food security, leachate, and pathogens were also the research hotspots.

TI Municipal solid waste charging based on residents' preference, a case of
   Harbin City, China
SO LOCAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Municipal solid waste management (MSWM) has been an increasing challenge for cities in China. Effective and sensible charging mechanism of municipal solid waste (MSW) needs to be designed to abate rapid generation of MSW from its source. This paper investigates four aspects related to public preference on MSW charging, including cleanliness, frequency, time, and cost. A case study was conducted in Harbin, which is a megacity in China and one of the first pilot cities for MSW classification. This study adopted stratified sampling approach in surveying Harbin residents, which generated a final sample of 280 residents for empirical investigation. Conjoint analysis was employed to analyze residents' preference for MSW charging. The results demonstrate that the preference varies with the level of income. High-income and middle-income residents are more favourable to cleanliness, while the low-income group is more concerned about the cost of MSWM. To a large extent, this difference may be related to differences in personal needs and consumption patterns.

TI An analysis of household waste management policy using system dynamics
   modelling
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB This paper analyses the Flemish household waste management policy. Based on historical data from the period 1991-2006, literature reviews and interviews, both mathematical and descriptive relationships are derived that describe Flemish waste collection, reuse, recycling and disposal behaviour. This provides insights into how gross domestic product (GDP), population and selective collection behaviour have influenced household waste production and collection over time. These relationships are used to model the dynamic relationships underlying household waste management in Flanders by using a system dynamics (SD) modelling approach. Where most SD models in literature are conceptual and descriptive, in the present study a real-life case with both correlational and descriptive relationships was modelled for Flanders, a European region with an outstanding waste management track record. This model was used to evaluate the current Flemish household waste management policy based on the principles of the waste hierarchy, also referred as the Lansink ranking. The results show that Flemish household waste targets up to 2015 can be achieved by the current waste policy measures. It also shows the sensitivity of some key policy parameters such as prevention and reuse. Given the general nature of the model and its limited data requirements, the authors believe that the approach implemented in this model can also assist waste policy makers in other regions or countries to meet their policy targets by simulating the effect of their current and potential household waste policy measures.

TI Intensification of microbial decomposition of organic fraction of
   municipal waste: Laboratory and field experiments
SO APPLIED BIOCHEMISTRY AND MICROBIOLOGY
AB Methods of intensifying the anaerobic microbial decomposition of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (MSW) on an MSW landfill and in anaerobic reactors were studied. It was discovered that it is preferable for the initiation and stabilization of the process of anaerobic digestion of organic waste in laboratory bioreactors at 20 and 50A degrees C to use a mixture of activated suspension of soil from the anaerobic zone of the landfill and digested sewage sludge. Stimulation of methanogenesis was shown in field conditions when digested sewage sludge was added directly into the upper layer of anaerobic zone of the landfill. The investigation of methane production during fermentation of concentrated food waste with a mixture of excessive activated sludge in the laboratory under thermophilic conditions (50A degrees C) has shown that the main problem at the first stage of the process was the acidification of the digested mixture due to the accumulation of volatile fatty acids. It was shown that for stable operation of the bioreactor under thermophilic conditions the amount of inoculum added during the start up should be no less than 30-50%-based on the total volatile suspended solids. A sharp decrease in the digestion temperature from 50 to 20A degrees C did not cause methanogenesis termination, since the thermophilically fermented biomass contained both thermophilic and mesophilic methanogens.

TI Review on pretreatment techniques to improve anaerobic digestion of
   sewage sludge
SO FUEL
AB Anaerobic digestion (AD) of sewage sludge is one of the most efficient, effective, and environmentally sustainable remediation techniques; however, the presence of complex floc structures, hard cell walls, and large amounts of molecular organic matter in the sludge hinder AD hydrolysis. Consequently, sewage sludge pretreatment is a prerequisite to accelerate hydrolysis and improve AD efficiency. This review focuses on pretreatment techniques for improving sewage sludge AD, which include mechanical, chemical, thermal, and biological processes. The various pretreatment process effects are discussed in terms of advantages and disadvantages, including their effectiveness, and recent achievements are reviewed for improved biogas production.

TI Updating and testing of a Finnish method for mixed municipal solid waste
   composition studies
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB More efficient recycling of municipal solid waste (MSW) is an essential precondition for turning Europe into a circular economy. Thus, the recycling of MSW must increase significantly in several member states, including Finland. This has increased the interest in the composition of mixed MSW. Due to increased information needs, a method for mixed MSW composition studies was introduced in Finland in order to improve the national comparability of composition study results. The aim of this study was to further develop the method so that it corresponds to the information needed about the composition of mixed MSW and still works in practice.
   A survey and two mixed MSW composition studies were carried out in the study. According to the responses of the survey, the intensification of recycling, the landfill ban on organic waste and the producer responsibility for packaging waste have particularly influenced the need for information about the composition of mixed MSW. The share of biowaste in mixed MSW interested the respondents most. Additionally, biowaste proved to be the largest waste fraction in mixed MSW in the composition studies. It constituted over 40% of mixed MSW in both composition studies. For these reasons, the classification system of the method was updated by further defining the classifications of biowaste. The classifications of paper as well as paperboard and cardboard were also updated. The updated classification system provides more information on the share of avoidable food waste and waste materials suitable for recycling in mixed MSW. The updated method and the information gained from the composition studies are important in ensuring that the method will be adopted by municipal waste management companies and thus used widely in Finland.

TI Assessing Incorrect Household Waste Sorting in a Medium-Sized Swedish

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Source separation is a common method for dealing with the increasing problem of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) in society. The citizens are then responsible for separating waste fractions produced in their home. If the consumers fail to sort the waste according to the source separation scheme, it will lead to an ineffective system. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the environmental, economic and social aspects of incorrect waste sorting in a medium sized Swedish city that has established a source separation system. In order to determine the extent to which citizens correctly sort their waste, food waste (black bags) and combustible fraction (white bags), were collected randomly from a residential area and categorized in different waste fractions. The results show that approximately 68 wt% of the waste in the white and 29 wt% in the black bags were not sorted correctly. This incorrect sorting accrues over 13 million SEK per year cost for this community. In order to improve the inhabitants' participation in the waste management system, it is necessary to change different factors such as convenience and easy access to the recycling stations in the local MSW management systems as well as to review current regulation and policy.

The composting process was monitored by changes in the physico-chemical properties, UV-visible spectra, and fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra. The composting temperature was steady in the thermophilic range for 24 and 12 d in the intensive and maturation phases, respectively, which fulfilled the disinfection requirement. Moreover, the temperature increased rapidly to 76.8 degrees C within three days, and the thermophilic temperatures peaked twice and lasted longer than in traditional composting, which accelerated SS degradation and decreased the composting period necessary to obtain mature compost. FTIR spectroscopic analysis showed a diminished in methyl group derived from methylene C-H aliphatic groups because of organic matter degradation by microorganisms and an increased number of aromatic chains. The new technology may be a viable and sustainable alternative for SS management that converts waste into compost that is useful as a soil amendment.

TI Waste to biogas through anaerobic digestion: Hydrogen production
   potential in the developing world - A case of Bangladesh
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Waste management is one of the greatest global challenges, for which one reason is the composition of waste, which varies not only from one region to another but also over time. Recent studies considered waste treatment options for the developed world, where management schemes include waste to hydrogen generation. Although there is great potential for producing hydrogen from waste (e.g. biogas) in the developing world, this has received less attention. This study explores hydrogen production potential from waste in the developing world, particularly focusing on Bangladesh. Results show that anaerobic digestion is the most suitable waste management technology for the developing world predominantly due to waste's composition. The waste composition is dominated by organic food wastes (varying between 50% and 87%), of which the moisture content is more than 50%, thus being unsuitable for self-combustion. National energy policy making should consider this potential source of energy/hydrogen towards a sustainable future. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Frameworks for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from municipal
   solid waste in Oman
SO MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
AB Purpose The Gulf Cooperation Council member countries not only generate the highest quantity of municipal solid waste (MSW) per capita when compared globally, but also in most of these countries, such waste is just dumped at different landfill stations. In Oman, the total quantity of MSW stood at 2.0 million tons per year. The emission from this waste is estimated at 2,181,034 tons/year (carbon dioxide equivalent). This article attempts to develop frameworks that considered landfilling, composting and recycling of MSW. Design/methodology/approach To know the composition of the municipal solid waste in Oman, a quantitative research method was employed. The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from MSWM in this study focus on three major gases, CO2, CH4 and N2O. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2006 model is used to calculate GHG emissions from landfills and composting (IPCC, 2006). Four frameworks - baseline F0, framework F1, framework F2 and framework F3 - are outlined in this paper. The F0 represents the current situation of the MSW in which most of the waste goes to landfills and dumpsites. In F1, improved MSW collection service and landfilling are incorporated and open burning is restricted. The F2 considered landfilling and composting, while F3 is based on landfilling, composting and recycling. Findings The framework F2, which proposes the composting process for the organic waste which normally goes to landfills, results in the reduction of emissions by 40% as compared to landfill practice. Similarly, the samples of MSW collected in Oman show a good amount of recycling waste. The framework F3, which considers the landfill, composting and recycling, reduced the total GHG emissions from 2,181,034 tons/year to 1,427,998 tons/year (carbon dioxide equivalent), representing a total reduction of 35% in emissions. Research limitations/implications Different values such as CH4 correction factor, the fraction of degradable organic carbon and the fraction of DOC used to determine the GHG emissions from MSW considering landfilling, composting and recycling based on the IPPC model and existing literature review. The actual determination of these values based on the Oman conditions may result in more accurate emissions from MSW in Oman. Practical implications Different frameworks suggested in this research have different practical implications; however, the final framework F3, which produces fewer emissions, required a material recovery facility to recycle the MSW in Oman. For framework F3, it is important that the residents in Oman have enough knowledge and willingness to do the waste segregation at the household level. Apparently, such knowledge and willingness need to be determined through a separate study. Originality/value The frameworks F2 and F3 are considered to be more suitable solutions compared to the current practices for Oman and other gulf countries to reduce its per capita emissions from MSW and protect its local environment. There is a potential for further work that needs to explore the possible solutions to implement the suggested frameworks.

TI Greenhouse gas emissions from organic waste composting
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB There is actually a common consensus in using biological technologies for the treatment of organic wastes. For instance, composting is used for aerobic biological stabilisation of organic wastes. The amount of materials and the variety of wastes composted are increasing. However, composting is inherently a process generating gaseous emissions. Greenhouse gases (GHG) such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide from compost are of special relevance for global warming. Although a part of these gases is inherent to the process, another important part can be abated by low-cost biological technologies such as biofiltration and its variations. This article reviews the emission of GHG from composting gases, from detection and measurement to minimisation and abatement. Special emphasis is given to the measurement of GHG to obtain reliable emission factors for the different composting technologies. These factors will help to compare different waste treatment options based on overall analysis tools such as life cycle assessment. A specific chapter is related to carbon and nitrogen dynamics in the composting matrix, and their consequences on the production of carbon and nitrogen gases. Finally, we present a review of the best available practices to minimise the GHG emissions from composting and the final treatment of composting off-gases.

TI Environmental and economic trade-off-based approaches towards urban
   household waste and crop straw disposal for biogas power generation
   project-a case study from China
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Development and utilization of biomass waste for energy, especially urban household waste and crop straw waste, has garnered global attention. To enable the clean recycling of biomass waste, this study designed a biogas power generation project with a single/mixed raw material input, and established a multi-objective dynamic programming model under an uncertain environment to compare the economic and environmental differences between biogas production and landfill/incineration. Fuzzy membership function was used to deal with the uncertainty problems of daily crop straw yield and methane content in produced biogas. The proposed project and model were then utilized for an actual case area, and scenario analyses were conducted. Through the sensitivity analysis of the profitability expectations and straw input levels, it was found that single-feedstock anaerobic digestion could improve economic benefits while mixed-feedstock anaerobic digestion was more beneficial to reduce carbon emissions. This revealed a mechanism that the project's objectives of environmental protection and economic development could be regulated through the raw material procurement scheme for urban household waste and crop straw, and the allocation plan of processing capacity for anaerobic digestion with single/mixed raw materials. The results showed that the proposed methodology was efficient for the disposal of the biomass waste, and carbon emissions were only about 30% of that achieve via landfill/incineration. The economic benefits included the achievement of 6.74 x 10(6) CNY per year. Compared with previous studies, this study reported the successful development of a practical and effective biogas power generation project for treating biomass waste. Effective management methods have been proposed to optimize the processes of anaerobic digestion and power generation to ensure stable project operations.

TI Review on Indian Municipal Solid Waste Management practices for
   reduction of environmental impacts to achieve sustainable development
   goals
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Open dumping is a common practice for MSW disposal in most of the Indian cities, apart from the metro-cities. This practice poses significant environmental and health risks due to toxic and greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission through direct combustion and/or decay of wastes. Therefore, integrated solid waste management (ISWM) using different methods viz., incineration, composting, anaerobic digestions, refuse derived fuel, material recovery facility and sanitary landfilling, is much needed. Accordingly, three waste management case scenarios were studied for year 2001-2051 by keeping weightage of sustainable development goals 2030 of India. Case I depicts Indian present scenario of waste management where 164-735 tonnes/year of wastes would be generated for year 2001-2051. Further, 60% of waste can be treated in case II that help in reducing the land requirement up to 40% from estimated conditions of 2031 i.e., 83.8 x 10(7) m(3). The case III is most ideal waste management condition for year 2031 to reduce 80% waste hence landfill requirement would minimize up to 16.76 x 10(7) m(3) where population is at controlled conditions. This article concludes the formal handling and treatment of ISWM would minimize the landfilling, where LCA can be an antidote to achieve sustainable development goals.

TI A system dynamics model to evaluate effects of source separation of
   municipal solid waste management: A case of Bangkok, Thailand
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Municipal solid waste has been considered as one of the most immediate and serious problems confronting urban government in most developing and transitional economies. Providing solid waste performance highly depends on the effectiveness of waste collection and transportation process. Generally, this process involves a large amount of expenditures and has very complex and dynamic operational problems. Source separation has a major impact on effectiveness of waste management system as it causes significant changes in quantity and quality of waste reaching final disposal. To evaluate the impact of effective source separation on waste collection and transportation, this study adopts a decision support tool to comprehend cause-and-effect interactions of different variables in waste management system. A system dynamics model that envisages the relationships of source separation and effectiveness of waste management in Bangkok, Thailand is presented. Influential factors that affect waste separation attitudes are addressed; and the result of change in perception on waste separation is explained. The impacts of different separation rates on effectiveness of provided collection service are compared in six scenarios. 'Scenario 5' gives the most promising opportunities as 40% of residents are willing to conduct organic and recyclable waste separation. The results show that better service of waste collection and transportation, less monthly expense, extended landfill life, and satisfactory efficiency of the provided service at 60.48% will be achieved at the end of the simulation period. Implications of how to get public involved and conducted source separation are proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Anaerobic co-digestion of bioplastics as a sustainable mode of waste
   management with improved energy production - A review
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB The world of bioplastics has expanded rapidly in recent decades, and the new waste stream generated is creating major barriers to waste processing. Anaerobic co-digestion is to be considered one of the best options for the efficient processing of bioplastic waste due to its minimal space requirements, lower degrees of environmental pollution, and renewable energy generation. The higher carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio of bioplastics poses a challenge to anaerobic digestion, but co-digestion with lower C/N ratio biowastes can efficiently degrade bioplastics and improve biogas production in the system. In the future, the collection of organic waste in biodegradable plastic bags makes the waste management process easier for anaerobic digestion plants. The present review paper discusses current trends of bioplastic usage, degradation strategies, and the potential of anaerobic co-digestion for waste management with improved energy production in anaerobic digesters.

SO ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
AB Composting of yard waste, sewage sludge and municipal solid waste (MSW) for subsequent application to soils in agricultural, horticultural and recreational areas is being promoted nationwide. Since asbestos is a common contaminant in sewage sludge, an analytical survey was conducted for the presence of asbestos in composts collected from 26 communities nationwide resulting from sludge as well as yard waste and municipal solid waste. Asbestos was detected in 12 of the 26 composts or 46%. Asbestos was most consistently present in compost resulting from source material containing MSW and to a lesser extent sewage sludge rather than yard waste. The possible origins of asbestos in the compost source material, the mechanisms by which humans may be exposed, and the health significance are discussed.

AB Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been introduced in the evaluation of chemical processes and or products in order to take into account the Supply Chain and its environmental constraints and burdens. Regarding to the environmental assessment of chemical processes and/or products two main variables need to be taken into account: Natural Resources Sustainability (NRS) and Environmental Burdens Sustainability (EBS). NRS includes the use of energy, water and materials whereas EBS is given by the environmental sustainability metrics developed by the Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE). The main components of EBS have been classified in 5 environmental impacts to the atmosphere (acidification, global warming, human health effects, stratospheric ozone depletion and photochemical ozone formation), 5 aquatic media impacts (aquatic acidification, aquatic oxygen demand, ecotoxicity (metals), ecotoxicity (others) and eutrophication) and 2 land impacts (hazardous and non-hazardous waste disposal). To reduce the number of variables and thus, the complexity, the development of a normalisation and weighting procedure is required. This work proposes the normalization of EB based on the threshold values of the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) and a similar procedure based on the values given by the BREF document on waste incineration for the NRS normalisation. This procedure will help in the decision making process in the waste management field and in the particular, in Municipal Solid Waste Incineration (MSWI).

TI Energy and emissions benefits of renewable energy derived from municipal
   solid waste: Analysis of a low carbon scenario in Malaysia
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB Ineffective waste management that involves dumping of waste in landfills may degrade valuable land resources and emit methane gas (CH4), a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide (CO2). The incineration of waste also emits polluted chemicals such as dioxin and particle. Therefore, from a solid waste management perspective, both landfilling and incineration practices pose challenges to the development of a green and sustainable future. Waste-to-energy (WtE) has become a promising strategy catering to these issues because the utilisation of waste reduces the amount of landfilled waste (overcoming land resource issues) while increasing renewable energy production. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the energy and carbon reduction potential in Malaysia for various WtE strategies for municipal solid waste (MSW). The material properties of the MSW, its energy conversion potential and subsequent greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions are analysed based on the chemical compositions and biogenic Carbon fractions of the waste. The GHG emission reduction potential is also calculated by considering fossil fuel displacement and CH4 avoidance from landfilling. In this paper, five different scenarios are analysed with results indicating a integration of landfill gas (LFG) recovery systems and waste incinerator as the major and minor WtE strategies shows the highest economical benefit with optimal GHG mitigation and energy potential. Sensitivity analysis on the effect of moisture content of MSW towards energy potential and GHG emissions are performed. These evaluations of WtE strategies provides valuable insights for policy decision in MSW management practices with cost effective, energy benefit, environmental protection.

In this context, the evaluation of economic aspects is imperative since the implementation of a solid waste management system is connected with considerable investment and operating costs. The goal of this study is to assess and report the performance of various waste management scenarios in terms of costs and to determine the most suitable alternative. For this purpose, we analyzed a case study in a typical Romanian urban area, in terms of the economic impacts of four waste management scenarios. The economic evaluation was performed based on a cost structure, which we have elaborated to analyze the waste management scenarios from a cost perspective. The results indicated that the most suitable alternative for implementation from economic viewpoint in the studied area is scenario which included the following treatment/elimination methods: sorting, composting and landfilling.

AB Sustainable development is the projected demand of all nations at present. Only 20 percent of world's primary energy requirement is met by renewable sources like solar and wind energy, hydropower, biomass, municipal and agri-wastes. Biomass, can be utilized to produce biogas due to its high biodegradability, calorific value and nutritive value to microbes, which will reduce our dependency on fossil fuels so that These organic wastes require being managed in a sustainable way to avoid depletion of natural resources, minimize risk to human health, reduce environmental burdens and maintain an overall balance in the ecosystem. The annal of the National Office of Statistics (NOS) indicated that municipal solid waste overtook more and more million tons in 2016, almost 3.5 times the 1992 rates. About 40-70% of civilian solid waste CSW is composed of civilian biomass waste (CBW), such as kitchen waste (KW), fruit/vegetable remains (FVR) and waste water sewage sludge (WWSS). There was a need to find several ways to deal with such wastes. One of these methods is the anaerobic digestion process, as a waste management system, has risen due to it has the usefulness of lowering volume and getting back energy. Several physical and chemical factors influence the creation of methane, and inhibition of bio-methane efficiency by certain materials (salts, oils, ammonia and toxic substrates) may take place when inhibitors levels appear in high concentrations. In addition, high salt in the organic substrates can inhibit the activity of fermentation microbes by impacting the osmotic pressure of the cell wall of bacteria in the anaerobic system. The purpose of this study was to discuss the effect the types of substrates and salt content on biogas generation in anaerobic digestion.

SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Management of Municipal solid waste in low-income countries with high population densities such as India has always been a strenuous task. With perpetual advancements, there are many available tech-nologies dealing with waste management such as incineration, pyrolysis and landfill operations. But such technologies are often accompanied with some limitations (operational and maintenance problems) and have negative environmental impacts. In this regard, continuous efforts are currently spent to develop the sustainable technologies for coping with the problems of waste management. Confronted with such problems, BSF larval composting has emerged as a green approach for waste management which outshi-nes the various current technologies. However, it is not widely explored and therefore in the present study, BSF larval treatment efficiency has been tested against different types of food waste treatments viz., mix food waste (T1), restaurant waste (T2), fruit waste (T3), and vegetable waste (T4). We have also evaluated the Biomass Conversion Ratio (BCR) of BSF larvae. The waste reduction efficiency was found to be 72% for T1 followed by T3 and T2 whereas the efficiency was least for T4 corresponding to lower BCR comparatively. BCR obtained for T1 treatment was almost 25% which was exceptionally high in compar-ison to other published studies. The highest waste reduction efficiency and the BCR values for T1 may be attributed to appropriately balanced food nutrition and C/N ratio Therefore, it may be concluded that substrate type and its nutritional value strongly determines the growth and development of larva influ-encing the waste ingestion rate.

TI Environmental impacts of post-consumer material managements: Recycling,
   biological treatments, incineration
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The environmental impacts of recycling, mechanical biological treatments (MBT) and waste-to-energy incineration, the main management strategies to respond to the increasing production of post-consumer materials are reviewed and compared. Several studies carried out according to life-cycle assessment (LCA) confirm that the lowest environmental impact, on a global scale, is obtained by recycling and by biological treatments (composting and anaerobic fermentations) if compost is used in agriculture. The available air emission factors suggest that, on a local scale, mechanical biological treatments with energy recovery of biogas, may be intrinsically safer than waste-to-energy incinerators. Several studies confirm the capability of biological treatments to degrade many toxic xenobiotic contaminating urban wastes such as dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, an important property to be improved, for safe agricultural use of compost. Further LCA studies to compare the environmental impact of MBTs and of waste-to-energy incinerators are recommended. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Environmental performance of household waste management in Europe - An
   example of 7 countries
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB An attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) of the management of 1 ton of household waste was "conducted in accordance with ISO 14044:2006.and the ILCD Handbook for seven European countries, namely Germany, Denmark, France, UK, Italy, Poland and Greece, representing different household waste compositions, waste management practices, technologies, and energy systems. National data were collected from a range of sources regarding household waste composition, household sorting efficiency, collection, waste treatments, recycling, electricity and heat composition, and technological efficiencies. The objective was to quantify the environmental performance in the different countries, in order to analyze the sources of the main environmental impacts and national differences which affect the results. In most of the seven countries, household waste management provides environmental benefits when considering the benefits of recycling of materials and recovering and utilization of energy. Environmental benefits come from paper recycling and, to a lesser extent, the recycling of metals and glass. Waste-to-energy plants can lead to an environmental load (as in France) or a saving (Germany and Denmark), depending mainly on the composition of the energy being substituted. Sensitivity analysis and a data quality assessment identified a range of critical parameters, suggesting from where better data should be obtained. The study concluded that household waste management is environmentally the best in European countries with a minimum reliance on landfilling, also induced by the implementation of the Waste Hierarchy, though environmental performance does not correlate clearly with the rate of material recycling. From an environmental point of view, this calls for a change in the waste management paradigm, with less focus on where the waste is routed and more of a focus on the quality and utilization of recovered materials and energy.

TI Strategic environmental assessment of alternative sewage sludge
   management scenarios
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) of sewage sludge management in a Danish municipality (Aalborg), with 160,000 inhabitants using alternative methods for aggregation of environmental impacts was performed. The purpose is to demonstrate the use of SEA in relation to sludge management and to improve SEA methodology. Six different scenarios for management of sewage sludge within the Aalborg municipality involving thermal treatment, composting and landfilling of sludge were evaluated. Environmental impact categories considered were global warming, non-renewable resources (nutrients and fossil fuels) and land use. Impact categories human health, ecotoxicity and soil quality were excluded as methodology for their assessment is not yet fully developed. Thermal sludge treatment with energy utilisation was shown to be a promising option for sewage sludge management in Aalborg. Sensitivity of the relative environmental impacts with respect to calculation methodology and input parameter values were evaluated to identify important parameters and calculation methods. The analysis showed that aggregation procedures, sludge biogas potential and sludge production were very important whereas sludge transport was not.

TI Economic and environmental estimated assessment of power production from
   municipal solid waste using anaerobic digestion and landfill gas
   technologies
SO ENERGY REPORTS
AB Waste management has always been one of the main challenges of developing countries. So far, several methods have been proposed to manage municipal solid waste (MSW) and reduce its environmental impact. The purpose of this paper is to determine the amount of MSW generated in two different cities in Asia and to investigate the performance of both landfill gas and anaerobic digestion methods for electric power generation. Both Tehran and Beijing have a high rate of daily waste production and can be a good case study to examine the performance of both energy generations technologies from MSW. However, the use of such technologies requires more and more detailed studies in order to encourage private and government sector investors to use them. In addition, the use of alternative energy sources such as electricity from waste is inevitable due to the current problems in the field of energy. The assessment presented in this paper includes the amount of electricity generated in both technologies, economic feasibility based on Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) and Payback Time (PBT) calculations approaches, and environmental evaluation according to the global warming potential (GWP) under different three Scenarios. It was found that after a 20-year period, the amount of waste generated in regions of Beijing is 1.96% lower than in Tehran. The total electricity generated by anaerobic digestion technology is 45.2% and 41.9% higher than that of landfill gas project in Tehran and Beijing, respectively. In addition, on the average MSW management under scenarios 2 and 3 in the Tehran and Beijing could reduce GWP by 79.16 and 92.65%, respectively. The average PBT value for a 20-year period in Tehran is 1.1 and 0.67 years higher than in Beijing under landfill gas and anaerobic digestion technologies, respectively. (C) 2021 The Authors.

TI THE EFFECT OF COMPOST AND SEWAGE SLUDGE ON SOIL BIOLOGIC ACTIVITIES IN
   SALT AFFECTED SOIL
SO JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
AB Saline soil was amended with 13.3 and 26.6 g kg(-1) of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) compost or sewage sludge, and arylsulphatase (ARY), phosphatase (PHO), dehydrogenase (DEH), beta-glucosidase (beta-GLU), urease (URE) and catalase (CAT) activities as well as physical-chemical properties were determined after 70 day of incubation under laboratory conditions. MSW compost and sewage sludge significantly improved soil physical-chemical properties, especially carbon and nitrogen contents. Accordingly, overall enzyme activities were substantially promoted in presence of both amendments and the higher increases were measured at 13.3 g kg(-1) of MSW compost (increases by 107%, 43%, 20%, 11%, and 148% for, DEH, beta-GLU, PHO, URE, and CAT, respectively). Lower beneficial effects occurred at 26.6 g kg(-1) of sewage sludge possibly because of the increased salinity or the presence of trace elements by sewage sludge application. As a general response, MSW compost supplied at 13.3 g kg(-1) seems to be a useful strategy to enhance biologic activities of salt-affected soil.

TI Municipal solid waste management in China: a comparative analysis
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB This paper illustrates an overview of the past and present MSWM strategies in China. A comparison is made with MSWM in China, and other developed and developing countries to identify and analyze the problems of existing MSWM, and evaluate some effective suggestion to overcome the limitations. Rapid urbanization and economic growth are the main factors of increasing MSW generation in China. The generating MSW has 55.86 % food waste with high moisture contain due to unavailable source separation. Chinese MSWM is dominated by 60.16 % landfilling, whereas incineration, untreated discharge, and other treatments are 29.84, 8.21, and 1.79 %, respectively. In 2014, a total of 604 sanitary landfills, 188 incineration plants, and 26 other units were used for MSWM. With the magnitude of timing, the increasing rate of incineration unit and disposal capacity is higher than the landfill. In 2004-2014, the disposal capacity of landfill and incineration is increased from 68.89 to 107.44 and 4.49 to 53.3 million tons, respectively. However, the heating value in the majority of Chinese incineration plants is 3000-6700 kJ/kg and the inappropriate leachate treatment can be found in 47 % landfill sites. A proper taxation system for MSW disposal is not fully implemented in China, which has a negative impact on overall MSW recycling. From the comparative study of MSWM, it is revealed that the source separation MSW collection, high energy recovery from incineration plants, appropriate leachate treatment, effective landfill location and management, increase waste recycling and proper taxation system for MSW disposal are essential to improve MSWM in China.

TI Estimating pollutant removal requirements for landfills in the UK: I.
   Benchmark study and characteristics of waste treatment technologies
SO ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY
AB Introduction of the EU Landfill Directive is having a significant impact on waste management in the UK and in other member states that have relied on landfilling. This paper considers the length of the aftercare period required by the municipal solid waste streams that the UK will most probably generate following implementation of the Landfill Directive. Data were derived from literature to identify properties of residues from the most likely treatment processes and the probable management times these residues will require within the landfill environment were then modelled. Results suggest that for chloride the relevant water quality standard (250 mg l(-1)) will be achieved with a management period of 40 years and for lead (0.1 mg l(-1)), 240 years. This has considerable implications for the sustainability of landfill and suggests that current timescales for aftercare of landfills may be inadequate.

TI Home and community composting for on-site treatment of urban organic
   waste: perspective for Europe and Canada
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB As a result of urbanization and economic prosperity, which has accelerated the generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) along with its organic fraction, the management of MSW is a challenge faced by urban centres worldwide, including the European Union (EU) and Canada. Within a concept of waste recovery, the source separation and on-site treatment of urban organic waste (UOW) can resolve some of the major economic issues faced by urban centres along with the environmental and social issues associated with landfilling. In this context and in a comparison with the traditional landfilling practice, this paper examines on-site UOW composting strategies using a combination of centralized composting facilities, community composting centres and home composting. This study consisted of a feasibility and economic study based on available data and waste management costs. The results indicate that on-site treatment of UOW using practices such as home and community composting can lower management costs by 50, 37 and 34% for the rich European countries (annual GDP over US$25 000), the poorer European countries (annual GDP under US$25 000), and Canada, respectively. Furthermore, on-site composting can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% for Europe and Canada, despite gas capture practices on landfill sites. However, the performance of home composters and the quality of the compost products are issues to be further addressed for the successful implementation of UOW on-site composting.

TI Biogas as a sustainable energy source for developing countries:
   Opportunities and challenges
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Energy is an indispensable part of modern society and can serve as one of the most important indicators of socio-economic development. Despite advancements in technology, however, some three billion people, primarily in the rural areas of developing countries, continue to meet their energy needs for cooking through traditional means by burning biomass resources (i.e., firewood, crop residues and animal dung) in crude traditional stoves. Such practices are known to be the source of significant environmental, social, economic and public health issues. To achieve sustainable development in these regions, it is imperative that access to clean and affordable (renewable) energy is made available. Within this context, upgrading existing biomass resources (i.e., animal manure, crop residues, kitchen waste and green wastes) to cleaner and more efficient energy carriers (such as biogas from anaerobic digestion) has unique potential to provide clean and reliable energy, while simultaneously preserving the local and global environment. In spite of its significant potential to serve developing nations, however, the high costs and lack of expertise in installation and maintenance of biogas technology preclude widespread adoption in geographically isolated communities. Concerted efforts from both governmental and non-governmental sectors are absolutely essential in facilitating modernization and dissemination of biogas technology to harness the inherent potential that is currently underutilized and unexploited. The intent of this paper seeks to highlight the present status, challenges, and potential of biogas technology to advocate for further research, development and dissemination of the concept in developing countries.

CL Sapporo, JAPAN
AB The generation of waste in urban regions over time is seen to impact the balance of anthropogenic and natural resources. Various national and international initiatives to manage urban solid waste are in place and has thus have evolved at present to form an assortment of different subcomponents involving environmental, administrative, regulatory, scientific, market, technology, and socio-economic factors, which has increasing bearing on the US due to its volume and nature of discards. This paper draws together the various aspects of municipal solid waste (MSW) management as it evolved, particularly in the American society through reviewing works and findings. In many parts of the country, waste management at present, primarily involves landfilling, incineration with and without energy recovery, recycling and composting. Legislation, nature of wastes and market trends continue to redefine management operations and its responsibilities and impacts. Complexities are added to it by the nature of urban development as well. New studies and concepts like 3Rs, cradle-to-cradle, industrial ecology, and integrated waste management are adding new dimensions for solving waste problems towards achieving sustainable resource use. Local initiatives, both public and private are in the forefront of adopting alternate waste management procedures. The assistance from various government and private bodies, supporting shifts in waste management approaches, have immense value, as according to the new paradigms, nothing goes to waste.

TI EVALUATION OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE BY MEANS OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT:
   CASE STUDY IN THE SOUTH-WESTERN REGION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF NORTE DE
   SANTANDER, COLOMBIA
SO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB The main objective of this research was to evaluate the environmental impact generated by municipal solid waste during its collection, transportation, treatment and processing in the south-west region of the department of Norte de Santander, Colombia, by means of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Three strategies for waste management were considered: the current baseline situation, wherein 100% solid waste was taken to the landfill; plus, an optimistic and a pessimistic scenario in which solid waste is properly and moderately recycled, respectively.
   The results show that approximately 72% was organic waste, out of which 40% corresponded to organic material. Twenty seven percent corresponded to inorganic materials such as plastics, metal, glass, rubber and leather. In comparing waste management in the three proposed scenarios in terms of global warming, the optimistic scenario was the greenest one due to better Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) recycling and usage, since it prevents the emission of 460 kg CO(2)Eq inhab(-1) year(-1). Finally, to achieve the reuse and recycling of waste, we propose the creation of small businesses which can improve people's socio-economic conditions. This will undoubtedly become a source of employment for many families in the community. Acceptance of composting is still low in the region because most farmers in rural areas show psychological resistance to products derived from waste, thus being more responsive to fertilizers. Finally, there is no doubt that LCA is definitely a methodology that helps decision making towards finding more sustainable solutions and hence is a good tool for improving environmental sustainability performance within the Municipal Solid Waste of the rural areas.

TI Municipal Solid Waste Characterization according to Different Income
   Levels: A Case Study
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Solid waste generation and characterization are some of the most important parameters which affect environmental sustainability. Municipal solid waste (MSW) characterization depends on social structure and income levels. This study aims to determine the variations in waste components within MSW mass by income levels and seasonal conditions following the analysis conducted on the characterization of solid wastes produced in the Kartal district of the province of Istanbul, which is the research area of this study. To this end, 1.9 tons of solid waste samples were collected to represent four different lifestyles (high, medium, and low income levels, and downtown) in the winter and summer periods, and characterization was made on these samples. In order to support waste characterization, humidity content and calorific value analyses were also conducted and various suggestions were brought towards waste management in line with the obtained findings. According to the results obtained in the study, organic waste had the highest rate of waste mass by 57.69%. Additionally, significant differences were found in municipal solid waste components (MSWC) based on income level. Average moisture content (MC) of solid waste samples was 71.1% in moisture analyses. The average of calorific (heating) value (HHV) was calculated as 2518.5 kcal.kg(-1).

TI Green residues from Bangkok green space for renewable energy recovery,
   phosphorus recycling and greenhouse gases emission reduction
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Effective ways to integrate human life quality, environmental pollution mitigation and efficient waste management strategies are becoming a crisis challenge for sustainable urban development. The aims of this study are: (1) to evaluate and recommend an optimum Urban Green Space (UGS) area for the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA); and (2) to quantify potential renewable resources including electricity generation and potential nutrient recovery from generated ash. Green House Gases (GHGs) emissions from the management of Green Residues (GR) produced in a recommended UGS expansion are estimated and compared with those from the existing BMA waste management practice. Results obtained from this study indicate that an increase in UGS from its current 2.02% to 22.4% of the BMA urban area is recommended. This optimum value is primarily due to the area needed as living space for its population. At this scale, GR produced of about 334 kt.y(-1) may be used to generate electricity at the rate of 206 GWh.y(-1) by employing incineration technology. Additionally, instead of going to landfill, phosphorus (P) contained in the ash of 1077 t P.y(-1) could be recovered to produce P fertilizer to be recycled for agricultural cultivation. Income earned from selling these products is found to offset all of the operational cost of the proposed GR management methodology itself plus 7% of the cost of BMA's Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) operations. About 70% of the current GHGs emission may be reduced based on incineration simulation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Environmental impact analysis of municipal solid waste incineration in
   African countries
SO CHEMOSPHERE
AB Globally, proper management of solid waste has been a massive issue. Incineration is popularly used in waste treatment worldwide due to its ability to minimize waste volume and generate electricity. Despite its advantages, incineration of waste can still generate large amounts of flue gas, which can be harmful if not handled properly. Therefore, the present study seeks to examine the environmental consequences of incineration in Africa. The study used the most accurate secondary data on the municipal solid waste incineration in 56 African countries from literature for the analysis. Due to data availability, the years 2012 and 2025 are considered for the study. The environmental analysis was based on global warming, acidification, and dioxin emission potentials. The emission of greenhouse gases from the incineration plant was estimated based on the method from the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. The acid gases and dioxins emissions were evaluated based on the United States Environmental Protection Agency "Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors" (Acidification Potential-42). Key findings show that the global warming potential of Seychelles is expected to decline from 200.10 kton CO(2)eq to 196.18 kton CO(2)eq in 2025, while that of Saint Helena will be constant at 7.85 kton CO(2)eq. The study found that except for Seychelles and Saint Helena, the global warming potential of incineration projects in all the countries is expected to increase in 2025 compared to 2012. It was realized that the acidification potential of the project in 2012 ranges from 740.56 kg SO(2)eq to 4,297,839.96 kg SO(2)eq, and that of 2025 is expected to be from 740.56 kg SO(2)eq to 9,449,175.32 kg SO(2)eq. The results further indicate that South Africa, Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, and Nigeria have higher dioxin emission potential in 2012 and 2025 compared to other countries in this study. This study will guide decision-making on the environmental sustainability of waste-to-energy incineration projects in Africa. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Methane mitigation strategy for food waste management: Balancing
   socio-economic acceptance and environmental impacts
SO SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
AB Studies on food waste management are focused on specific technologies at various extents, such as landfill, an-aerobic digestion, and composting, whereas few concern dietary, socioeconomic and environmental factors to-gether to evaluate different technologies from a global perspective. This study aims to fill this knowledge gap. Life cycle assessment of food waste treatment baseline scenario (based on national technology market shares as of 2017) and 5 methane mitigation scenarios, including SEM scenario (considering solely economic mitigation effort echoed by social discount rate), LF-70 % scenario (landfill (LF) substituting 70 % of dumpsite disposal (DSD) market share), COM-70 % scenario (composting (COM) substituting 70 % of the market share for LF and DSD) (5) IC-70 % scenario (incineration (IC) substituting 70 % of the market share for LF and DSD), and AD-70 % sce-nario (anaerobic digestion (AD) substituting 70 % of the market share for LF and DSD), was carried out based on dataset from Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nation. The global warming potential was highly skewed to non-perishable food (0.82 Gt CO2 equivalent), accounting for nearly 3 quarters of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the entire food waste management in 2017 (1.1 Gt CO2). Food waste GHG emissions are inversely proportional to technology levels. It is therefore vital to optimize the technology choice in the nexus of specific food waste category and the development status of different countries or regions for effective food waste GHG emission reductions. Considering various dietary choices, together with future de-velopment of economy and demography, food waste GHG emission trajectory was projected with a modified Re-gional Integrated model of Climate and the Economy model. 85.8-88.0 % GHG emission reductions are expected by 2100 across all methane mitigation scenarios though, AD demonstrates multiple additional environmental benefits. Nonetheless, it faces the dilemma of low market penetration globally due to high technological require-ments. In this regard, alternative technology selections, such as composting, need to be combined with local so-cial context to achieve a steady and tangible FW GHG emission reduction effect.(c) 2023 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

TI Survey on the factors and social perspectives to participate in home
   composting schemes in Palestine: Anabta case study
SO AIMS ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB In this study, a survey was conducted to determine the public opinion regarding the acceptance of using home composters as an alternative approach for household organic waste management. This approach is introduced as a method to replace the landfilling of organic municipal solid waste, which is the main solid waste management currently employed in Palestine, considering Anabta town as a case study. The results showed that people in the target area are welcoming of the home composting idea, and about 99% of participants are interested in owning home composters at their properties, which is regarded as a good reference for implementing the proposed home composting scheme in this area. The results showed that people are interested in the new proposed scheme for organic household waste despite their minimal knowledge and understanding about the composting process's importance and effects. The survey tested the people's expectations and thoughts about the home composting concept and found that the main motives for home composting were reducing the cost of house gardening and using the produced compost in soil nutrition, besides being part of environmental sustainability. On the other side, obstacles were due to people's inexperience of the home composting method, as almost half of participants were expecting an exhausting, long process to produce compost, with the related bad smell and insects during composting progression. Hence, the study found that it is important to spread awareness about the right procedures to apply home composting among participants, in line with environmental awareness campaigns through social media, and provide personalized follow-up with participants.

TI Sewage sludge-to-energy approaches based on anaerobic digestion and
   pyrolysis: Brief overview and energy efficiency assessment
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Energy recovery from sewage sludge offers an opportunity for sustainable management of sewage sludge and energy. Anaerobic digestion and pyrolysis are among the most promising processes applicable for sewage sludge-to-energy conversion. Anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge forms methane-rich biogas, which can be utilized as fuel to offset heat and electricity consumption of the wastewater treatment sector. However, the digestion process has the limitation that it cannot sufficiently extract the energy in sewage sludge. The digested sludge is still energy profitable in that it contains considerable organic matter, but poor in biodegradability. Sludge pyrolysis is an innovative process that can convert both raw and digested sludge into useful bioenergy in the form of oil and gas, forming biochar as a byproduct that is environmentally resistant and holds potential for carbon sequestration and soil conditioning. It is expectable that sludge pyrolysis would step into practical deployment in the near future.
   This paper presents a brief overview of anaerobic digestion and pyrolysis in the application to bioenergy production from sewage sludge. An assessment of energy conversion efficiency of two parallel sludge-to-energy pathways is also presented. One pathway relies on an exclusive pyrolysis process (fed with raw sludge) while the other is based on anaerobic digestion followed by pyrolysis (fed with the digested sludge). The pathway via the combination of anaerobic digestion and pyrolysis could achieve higher energy efficiency compared to the pathway employing the pyrolysis alone. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Assessment of the energy recovery potential of municipal solid waste
   under future scenarios
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB Rules on separate collection and recycling of municipal solid waste (MSW) can have a significant impact on the waste-to-energy (WTE) industry. Understanding the future energy recovery potential of MSW is therefore paramount to establish the role of WTE technologies in waste management plans. In this study we applied material flow analysis (MFA) to systematically quantify the energy recovery potential of MSW under plausible scenarios for 2030. These scenarios describe structural changes that are expected to affect the energy recovery potential, such as the increase in the separate collection rates and the implementation of more efficient material recovery facilities (MRFs). The assessment was performed for Madrid, Spain, as a case study. The results reveal that the gross energy recovery potential of MSW, i.e. the maximum amount of energy that could be obtained, is likely to decrease in the future mainly due to a higher diversion of plastic, paper, and cardboard to recycling. The gross energy recovery potential of the MSW generated in Madrid by 2030 ranges from 4,963 to 6,984 TJ year-1 according to the scenarios defined in this study. This means a decrease of 34 - 7% compared with 2017. However, the waste streams susceptible to energy recovery -organic waste streams and MRFs' rejects- account for 48 - 60% of the MSW generated under the 2030 scenarios. Furthermore, the electricity generation potential could increase between 8 and 55% by 2030 with respect to 2017 if more efficient incineration and/or gasification facilities are implemented. All in all, our findings clearly suggest that recycling targets do not necessarily compromise energy recovery.

TI Life-cycle assessment (EASEWASTE) of two municipal solid waste
   incineration technologies in China
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB The environmental profile of two municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) technologies with semi-dry flue gas cleaning, namely grated firing incinerators (GFI) and fluidised bed incinerators (FBI) that are commonly used in China were evaluated and compared by life-cycle assessment (LCA) using the EASEWASTE model. All emissions of key pollutants as well as energy, resource and material inputs and outputs associated with the two MSWI technologies were determined and the corresponding environmental impact potentials were modelled. Incineration of MSW with a lower heating value (LHV) around 4.5 MJ kg(-1) demands that auxiliary fuel is used, and both GFI and FBI caused environmental loads by contributing with environmental impact potentials in most categories except for some saving in global warming (GW100) and hazardous waste (HW). Coal combustion in FBI is a main contributor to the environmental impact potentials and thus should always be limited to a minimum. Auxiliary fuels can be avoided when the LHV of MSW is higher than 5-6 MJ kg(-1). For all scenarios, GFI saves more global warming potentials than FBI due to its higher net power generation from combustion of MSW itself. Leachate from the bunker could be sprayed into the furnace for evaporation under high temperature, as an alternative to waste-water treatment, without major changes in the environmental profile of the incinerator. The presented evaluations may contribute to a more balanced environmental assessment of the two incineration technologies with respect to incineration of MSW with low heating values as often found in Asia and China.

TI Evaluating an anaerobic digestion (AD) feedstock derived from a novel
   non-source segregated municipal solid waste (MSW) product
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB In many nations industrial scale AD of non-agricultural waste materials (such as MSW) has not yet reached its full potential, often constrained by the lack of secure, inexpensive, high quality AD feedstocks, and markets for the resulting digestate material. We tested the output material of a high throughput novel industrial process to define its potential as an AD feedstock (based on quality and consistency). This process, designed to circumvent the constraints of source segregation while still generating segregated waste streams, resulted in the production of a temporally homogenous fibrous material with: an average moisture content of 44.2 (+/- 2.33)%; C:N ratio of 32.9:1 (+/- 3.46:1), C:P ratio of similar to 228:1 and gross calorific value of 17.4 (+/- 0.29) MJ/kg((Dm)). This material provided a CH4 yield of between 201 and 297 m(3) CH4/tonneo((DM)) (271-401 m(3) CH4/tonne((Vs))) comparable to commonly used AD feedstocks. Material contaminant levels were temporally consistent (P > 0.05), (average values being Cd 0.63 (+/- 0.19), Cu 56.3 (+/- 7.45), Cr-tot 51.4 (+/- 4.41), Hg < 0.3, Ni 28.9 (+/- 5.17), Pb 79.2 (+/- 23.71), Zn 202 (+/- 44.5), total polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) 2.2 (+/- 0.3), and total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) (<0.2) mg/kg((DM))). Calculated digestate contaminant levels were below the median contaminant threshold limits for anaerobic digestates of all countries within the European Union i.e. of Cd 3.35, Cu 535, Cr-tot 535, Hg 8.15, Ni 185, Pb 397.5, Zn 2100 mg/kg((DM)). We suggest that novel high throughput processes that produce high quality AD feedstocks, may have a place in further diversion of waste from landfill. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Managing competitive municipal solid waste treatment systems: An
   agent-based approach
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
AB Private sector participation in municipal solid waste (MSW) management is increasingly being applied in many countries recently. However, it remains a largely unexplored issue whether different self-interested treatment operators can co-exist in an economically feasible and sustainable manner. To help the policy maker s understand and manage competitive MSW treatment systems, this paper proposes an agent based waste treatment model (AWTM) that consists of four types of agents, namely the refuse collector, specialized treatment unit (STU), the general treatment unit (GTU), and the regulator. An estimation and-optimization approach is developed for profit-maximizing agents to set optimal gate fee and vie for specific waste in low-information competition. Based on the Singapore case, the experimental results imply that if the regulator deliberately promotes the STUs by intervening in waste allocation, the GTU could give up competing for the waste and greatly increase its gate fees as retaliation. Besides, driven by the increasing gate fee of the GTU, the STUs conservatively raise their gate fee; while the GTU will be the major beneficiary in the AWTM. Finally, to identify the optimal mixed policy under predefined constraints, the AWTM is integrated into a simulation-based optimization problem, which is solved by a genetic algorithm.

TI THE EFFECT OF COMPOST AND SEWAGE SLUDGE ON SOIL BIOLOGIC ACTIVITIES IN
   SALT AFFECTED SOIL
SO REVISTA DE LA CIENCIA DEL SUELO Y NUTRICION VEGETAL
AB Saline soil was amended with 13.3 and 26.6 g kg(-1) of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) compost or sewage sludge, and arylsulphatase (ARY), phosphatase (PHO), dehydrogenase (DEH), beta-glucosidase (beta-GLU), urease (URE) and catalase (CAT) activities as well as physical-chemical properties were determined after 70 day of incubation under laboratory conditions. MSW compost and sewage sludge significantly improved soil physical-chemical properties, especially carbon and nitrogen contents. Accordingly, overall enzyme activities were substantially promoted in presence of both amendments and the higher increases were measured at 13.3 g kg(-1) of MSW compost (increases by 107%, 43%, 20%, 11%, and 148% for, DEH, beta-GLU, PHO, URE, and CAT, respectively). Lower beneficial effects occurred at 26.6 g kg(-1) of sewage sludge possibly because of the increased salinity or the presence of trace elements by sewage sludge application. As a general response, MSW compost supplied at 13.3 g kg(-1) seems to be a useful strategy to enhance biologic activities of salt-affected soil.

TI Co-Composting of Khat-Derived Biochar with Municipal Solid Waste: A
   Sustainable Practice of Waste Management
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Biochar is a way to improve the performance of the composting process and the quality of compost. This study was aimed to investigate the optimum ratio of khat straw (Catha edulis) biochar and organic municipal solid waste mixtures to improve the quality of the resulting co-composts. Khat-derived biochar during pyrolysis at 350 degrees C was added to organic municipal solid waste mix and four co-composting treatments were prepared with the compositions (% w/w): control compost (no biochar) and 5%, 15%, and 25% co-composted biochar in three replicates. The total organic carbon, organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and potassium values ranged as 16.76-21.45%, 30.77-40.26%, 0.97-1.68%, 0.58-0.76%, and 12.72-15.29%, respectively. The results confirmed that 5% and 15% co-composted khat biochars had significantly reduced (p < 0.05) organic matter loss and increased the contents of cation exchange capacity, pH, phosphorous, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and zinc compared to the control compost, while some heavy metals (Fe, Cu, and Mn) and EC values in co-composted biochars are lower than the control compost. Khat-derived biochar could be added to municipal organic waste mix at 5-15% (w/w) in order to get better quality of compost, which can be used as biofertilizer.

SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB This study aims at developing a sustainability assessment framework for assessing the technologies for the treatment of urban sewage sludge based on the logarithmic fuzzy preference programming based fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (LFPPFAHP) and extension theory. LFPPFAHP was employed to determine the weights of the criteria for sustainability assessment, and extension theory was used to prioritize the alternative technologies for the treatment of urban sewage sludge and grade their sustainability performances. An illustrative case including three technologies (compositing, incineration, and resource utilization) was studied by the proposed method, and compositing, incineration, and resource utilization are recognized as "Moderately Sustainable", "Not Sustainable", and "Highly Sustainable", respectively. The sustainability sequence in the descending order is resource utilization, compositing and incineration, and the result is consistent to that determined by the sum weighted method.

TI A review of the use of composted municipal solid waste in agriculture
SO AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) compost is increasingly used in agriculture as a soil conditioner but also as a fertilizer. Proponents of this practice consider it an important recycling tool since MSW would otherwise be landfilled and critics are concerned with its often elevated metal concentrations. Large amounts of MSW compost are frequently used in agriculture to meet crop N requirements and for the addition of organic matter. The main concern is loading the soil with metals that can result in increased metal content of crops. Furthermore, in some cases, metals and excess nutrients can move through the soil profile into groundwater. Municipal solid waste compost has also been reported to have high salt concentrations, which can inhibit plant growth and negatively affect soil structure. A review of relevant agricultural studies is presented as well as recommendations for improving MSW compost quality. Its safe use in agriculture can be ensured with source separation (or triage of MSW to be composted) as well as the development and implementation of comprehensive industry standards.

SO REVISTA DE GESTAO E SECRETARIADO-GESEC
AB This study aimed to identify the research gaps on the theme "Municipal Solid Waste Management", as from the analysis of articles indexed in the SCOPUS database. For this objective to be achieved, an applied research of exploratory nature and qualitative approach was carried out. It is noteworthy that, as method and technical procedures were adopted, respectively, the bibliographic research and the literature review. The data used in the analysis were obtained from the SCOPUS database in May 2018 and treated using Microsoft Excel (R) software. It is noteworthy that as a selection criterion, thirty papers indexed in this base that presented the highest number of citations were analyzed. As main results, it can be highlighted that the identified gaps were grouped into eight categories.

TI Human and veterinary antibiotics during composting of sludge or manure:
   Global perspectives on persistence, degradation, and resistance genes
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Wastewater treatment plant effluent, sludge and manure are the main sources of contamination by antibiotics in the whole environment compartments (soil, sediment, surface and underground water). One of the major consequences of the antibiotics discharge into the environment could be the prevalence of a bacterial resistance to antibiotic. In this review, four groups of antibiotics (Tetracyclines, Fluoroquinolones, Macrolides and Sulfonamides) were focused for the background on their wide spread occurrence in sludge and manure and for their effects on several target and non-target species. The antibiotics concentrations range between 1 and 136,000 mu g kg(-1) of dry matter in sludge and manure, representing a potential risk for the human health and the environment. Composting of sludge or manure is a well-known and used organic matter stabilization technology, which could be effective in reducing the antibiotics levels as well as the antibiotic resistance genes. During sludge or manure composting, the antibiotics removals range between 17-100%. The deduced calculated half-lives range between 1-105 days for most of the studied antibiotics. Nevertheless, these removals are often based on the measurement of concentration without considering the matter removal (lack of matter balance) and very few studies are emphasized on the removal mechanisms (biotic/abiotic, bound residues formation) and the potential presence of more or less hazardous transformation products.
   The results from the few studies on the fate of the antibiotic resistance genes during sludge or manure composting are still inconsistent showing either decrease or increase of their concentration in the final product.
   Whether for antibiotic or antibiotic resistance genes, additional researches are needed, gathering chemical, microbiological and toxicological data to better understand the implied removal mechanisms (chemical, physical and biological), the interactions between both components and the environmental matrices (organic, inorganic bearing phases) and how composting process could be optimized to reduce the discharge of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes into the environment.

TI Application of fuzzy logic for evaluation of the level of social
   acceptance of waste treatment
SO CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
AB The social aspect is very important in sustainability assessment of waste treatment technique, as well as making decision on their application and planning. In recent years, it is becoming evident that a waste treatment technique, which ignores social aspects, is doomed to failure. The most commonly used social indicators are: number of jobs created, level of social acceptance, public knowledge, public health etc. The most of them are qualitative and measuring the sustainability and quantifying the social dimension of sustainability are difficult tasks. This paper presents the application of fuzzy logic for evaluating the social indicator-level of social acceptance. The fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic were used to develop a model for the evaluation of level of social acceptance, due to the lack of data, uncertainties, and qualitative character of indicators and also to provide effective way to include knowledge and gained experience on the process. A questionnaire was applied as instrument for data collection. The fuzzy model was verified using the city of Ni as a case study. The results obtained using the developed fuzzy model, shows that the highest level of social acceptance in the city of Ni is for recycling (57.47 %) and the lowest level of social acceptance is for incineration (17.74 %). The presented study suggests an innovative methodology for evaluation of level of social acceptance of certain waste treatment based on fuzzy logic approach and can be used for ranking of waste management scenarios in the sustainability assessment.

TI ROUTES: innovative solutions for municipal sludge treatment and
   management
SO REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND BIO-TECHNOLOGY
AB Management of sewage sludge is going to be a big challenge in near future due to rapid urbanization and economic growth, in particular in Europe. The Routes project http://www.eu-routes.org (ref. # 265156) is addressed to discover new routes in wastewater and sludge treatment which allow: (a) to prepare sludge for agricultural utilization by transforming it in a very clean and stabilized product with respect to hygienic aspects and phytotoxicity; (b) to minimize sludge production by new solutions including the use of innovative processes based on metabolic uncoupling or of innovative reactors like microbial fuel cells or sequencing batch biofilter granular reactor; (c) to promote recovery of valuable materials from anaerobic digestion, i.e. biopolymers as polyhydroxyalkanoates and fertilizers; (d) to set up and prove at practical scale a novel technique for sludge disposal (wet oxidation) as sustainable alternative to the nowadays the most used incineration; (e) to minimize energy pumping by adjusting solid concentration, on a practical installation. The general objective of the Routes proposal is therefore to set up a portfolio of different solutions to be applied in different conditions and circumstances, strictly following the waste hierarchy of the EU Directive 08/98 on waste. The above solutions will be studied either in the laboratory or at practical scale, depending on the maturity of the technology, in order to provide the Commission, the technical and scientific community and end-users with applicable solutions and new routes for sludge management.

TI AN OVERVIEW OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT IN POLAND. THE CURRENT
   SITUATION, PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES
SO ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION ENGINEERING
AB An overview of municipal solid waste management (MSWM) in Poland has been presented. The processes of waste generation and composition have been described and a comprehensive review of MSWM in Poland has been provided, covering some of the important aspects of waste management, such as the current status of waste collection, transport and disposal in Poland. An additional aim of the present work was to identify the potential barriers and the factors affecting waste management as well as provide recommendations for system improvement in Poland and other similar developing countries. An analysis shows that the state of municipal solid waste (MSW) management in Poland is not yet as developed as in many other EU countries. Landfilling is still the predominant method used for the disposal of MSW. Composting and incineration are also used but refer only to a small percentage of the total. According to the latest data (31st December 2014), around 84% of MSW was collected and transported and that ca. 53% was disposed of in landfill, ca. 7% was incinerated at waste-to-energy plants, ca. 11% was treated at organic waste recovery plants and 23% was delivered to sorting. The average generation rate of MSW was 293 kg/capita/year. Generally, recycling in Poland is on the increase, especially concerning easily collectable and recyclable materials such as paper, plastics, glass and metals. Around 37% of MSW collected selectively is recycled.

TI Anaerobic digestate management, environmental impacts, and
   techno-economic challenges
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Digestate is a nutrient-rich by-product from organic waste anaerobic digestion but can contribute to nutrient pollution without comprehensive management strategies. Some nutrient pollution impacts include harmful algal blooms, hypoxia, and eutrophication. This contribution explores current productive uses of digestate by analyzing its feedstocks, processing technologies, economics, product quality, impurities, incentive policies, and regulations. The analyzed studies found that feedstock, processing technology, and process operating conditions highly influence the digestate product characteristics. Also, incentive policies and regulations for managing organic waste by anaerobic digestion and producing digestate as a valuable product promote economic benefits. However, there are not many governmental and industry-led quality assurance certification systems for supporting commercializing digestate products. The sustainable and safe use of digestate in different applications needs further development of technologies and processes. Also, incentives for digestate use, quality regulation, and social awareness are essential to promote digestate product commercialization as part of the organic waste circular economy paradigm. Therefore, future studies about circular business models and standardized international regulations for digestate products are needed.

TI A general model for air gasification of heterogenous municipal solid
   waste
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB Sustainable management of municipal solid waste (MSW) is crucial due to its huge volume and cash flow. Among the different waste-to-energy solutions, gasification is considered an interesting option compared to incineration, which is the most common technology to valorise MSW, because of higher efficiency, lower environmental impacts, and producing hydrogen or other biofuel and biochemical products. However, mechanical-biological treatment of MSW results in heterogenous materials mainly composed of plastics, paper, and textiles, which troubles a reliable study of gasification. Hence, a flexible model of a fluidized bed air gasifier is developed in Aspen Plus in this work based on the experimental data from the literature to estimate the syngas properties from residual MSW of composting facilities.The developed model gives a low heating value (LHV) of the syngas in the range 4.2-7.3 MJ/Nm3 considering the characteristics of the residual MSW from a real composting facility, which is in line with the experimental values reported in the literature. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is performed varying the composition of the residual waste from the mechanical-biological treatment to support preliminary feasibility analyses of energy production from heterogeneous materials. The results showed a good capability of the model in predicting the energy performance of the fluidized bed gasifiers varying feedstock materials and equivalence ratios.

TI Anaerobic co-digestion: Current status and perspectives
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB Anaerobic digestion is a long-established technology for the valorization of diverse organic wastes with concomitant generation of valuable resources. However, mono-digestion (i.e., anaerobic digestion using one feedstock) suffers from challenges associated with feedstock characteristics. Co-digestion using multiple feedstocks provides the potential to overcome these limitations. Significant research and development efforts have highlighted several inherent merits of co-digestion, including enhanced digestibility due to synergistic effects of co-substrates, better process stability, and higher nutrient value of the produced co-digestate. However, studies focused on the underlying effects of diverse co-feedstocks on digester performance and stability have not been synthesized so far. This review fills this gap by highlighting the limitations of mono-digestion and critically examining the benefits of co-digestion. Furthermore, this review discusses synergistic effect of co-substrates, characterization of microbial communities, the prediction of biogas production via different kinetic models, and highlights future research directions for the development of a sustainable biorefinery.

TI Life cycle assessment of waste-to-energy (WtE) technologies for
   electricity generation using municipal solid waste in Nigeria
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB In this paper, life cycle assessment (LCA) of waste to energy (WtE) treatment plants for electricity generation in twelve selected cities of Nigeria is studied with the aim of evaluating their electricity generation potential, global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP) and dioxin/furan emission potential. The WtE plants are: landfill gas to energy (LFGTE), hybrid of incineration and anaerobic digestion (INC/AD) and hybrid of incineration and landfill gas to energy (INC/LFGTE). The benefits of the WtE plants are thereafter compared to the landfilling (waste management without intention of energy recovery) in each of the locations in order to determine the option that best fit the locations in an environmentally sustainable manner. To achieve this, the waste profile of each of the locations is determined using per capita waste generation and the population data obtained from national population commission (NPC). Some of the key results reveal that the hybrid of INC/AD is potentially viable compared to other methods in terms of GWP and ecosystem potential measured by AP. However, LFGTE technology is the best in terms of carcinogenic reduction potential measured by dioxin/furan emissions. The hybrid of INC/AD has the potential of reducing GWP in the range of 75.7-93.3% compared to land filling without energy recovery. Similarly, hybrid of INC/LFGTE provided a reduction in the range of 75.3-84.8% while LFGTE could reduce the GWP by 75%. This paper could serve as a source of scientific information for decision making on environmental sustainability in waste-to-energy projects in Nigeria. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

SO JOURNAL OF CENTRAL SOUTH UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY
AB Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission is largely associated with the municipal solid waste (MSW) management. In order to analyze the MSW management practices, and their influences on greenhouse gas emission in Chongqing city, China, the waste reduction model(WARM); a specialized model by US EPA, was used to quantify the GHG reduction potentials of various MSW treatment options. Based on the Master Planning for the MSW Treatment Facilities in Chongqing (2005-2020), 2006 plan, 2010 plan and 2020 plan were constructed as the three scenarios of MSW treatment in Chongqing city. These three scenarios work as the baseline scenarios in the corresponding years and as alternative scenarios in the other two planning years. The results show that for the year of 2006, 2010 and 2020, the optimal MSW treatment options in Chongqing city could be 2020 plan, 2010 plan and 2020 plan respectively in terms of GHG emission reduction. As a whole 2020 plan has the largest average. of GHG emission reduction capacity, and the reduction capacity of 2006 plan is the lowest among the three.

TI Sustainable waste management using black soldier fly larva: a review
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Treatment of biodegradable waste using the black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) is an emerging waste treatment technology attracting entrepreneurial activities around the globe, mainly because the larvae grown on the waste have the potential to become starting material for several commercial products such as animal feed, biodiesel, chitin as a biopolymer, and soil fertilizer. Insect-based waste treatment technology offers a financially viable solution for the solid waste problem mitigation, which otherwise has been an arduous task for many parts of the globe, especially for the developing nations. Although considered a better alternative than other well-established technologies such as composting or anaerobic digestion, the technology is still in its infancy. The researchers and entrepreneurs who wish to gain an insight into and develop the BSFL-based waste processing technology further, require to have a holistic understanding of the various ways in which the performance of BSFL technology can be enhanced and its scaling-up can be formulated to solve the waste management problems in community- and city-level. This review article is a collection of state-of-the-art knowledge on various aspects related to the technology development for full-scale utilization for commercialization purposes, such as the artificial rearing techniques of BSF, waste stabilization performances of the BSFL at different environmental conditions, and the effects of micronutrients and associated microorganism communities.

SO ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
AB An inventory of mercury emissions originating from waste incineration in China, including municipal solid waste, rural household waste and agricultural waste, was calculated for the period of 2004-2010. During this period, mercury emissions from waste incineration increased at an average annual rate of 3.9%, and reached 16.6 t y(-1) by the end of 2010. From 2004 to 2010, the mercury emissions from rural household waste incineration accounted for 46.6% of the total waste emissions, followed by agricultural waste (30.7%) and municipal solid waste (22.7%). However, the growth rate of mercury emissions was largest for municipal solid waste incineration, with an annual rate of 37.3%, while the emissions from rural household waste showed a negative growth rate (-5.8%). The mercury emissions from waste combustion is projected to be 18.6 t y(-1) by 2015, with the contribution of municipal solid waste, rural household waste and agricultural waste being 46.4%, 27.1% and 26.5%, respectively.

AB Despite the availability of various environmentally acceptable and economically viable management methods, the valorization of municipal solid wastes, remains a remarkable problem for many communities. During the years the waste management has been enforced through regulations that targeted the stimulation of alternative waste management methods, including recycling, pre-selection and energy recovery. The public on the other hand have developed a critical view toward the various available or applied technologies due to possible implications that these might have on human health and the environmental quality. Hence, a development of innovative strategies is required in order to devise the most appropriate treatment/disposal methods and scientifically prove the applicability and the merits of specific technology or technologies.
   In this study different waste management scenarios have been selected and assessed. This process is aiming at the sustainable management of municipal solid wastes and at the minimization of the volumes of leftovers to be disposed off in landfill sites. The methodological framework of the analysis is based on the Cost-Benefit Analysis and Life Cycle Analysis in combination with social-economic indices. A survey of 1000 participants was realized in order to investigate the societal acceptability of the different technological options. Furthermore, SWOT analysis was applied for developing the qualitative attributes of the different technological options. The approach was applied to the case study of municipal solid waste (MSW) management in the Municipality of Paionia, Kinds, Central Macedonia, Greece. During this analysis special attention was given on the energy and material balances, including potential global and local scale airborne emissions. Results are provided in the format of indices efficiency, effectiveness and environmental and public health impacts. The analysis reveals that the existent management method applied, based on landfilling, is the worst management strategy at a global scale. The investigation on the combined waste treatment scenarios revealed that biological and mechanical integrated systems offer significant benefits in terms of greenhouse gas emission reduction. Additionally, the biological mechanical systems in combination with disposal, demonstrate their environmental benefits against other management options. However, not all options are equally benign to the local environment and to the health of the local population, since both the former and the latter are still affected by non-negligible local emissions. Result analysis revealed that the proper combination of the up-to-date waste management systems can lead to substantial reduction of environmental impacts. It is clear that the developed analytical framework yields different conclusions compared to a simple environmental impact assessment which is based only on estimated or measured emissions. However, the interaction with the national economy, the existent economic depression and the effect on the national development have to be examined in combination with additional tools in order to demonstrate the sustainability of an integrated approach.

TI Current updates on waste to energy (WtE) technologies: a review
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY FOCUS
AB Economic development and related increase in global energy demand has created pressure on the supply of energy resources. To promote sustainable development a safe and renewable energy is required. For this, municipal solid waste (MSW) contributes significantly in creating a safe environment and renewable energy. Currently in developing countries, the scarcities of energy and ordinary ways of MSW disposal have generated a number of environmental and socioeconomic problems. This situation invites researchers to develop different waste to energy (WtE) conversion alternatives under several scenarios. A related review show that energy conversion technologies such as incineration, pyrolysis, gasification, anaerobic digestion, ethanol fermentation, landfill and future trends like microbial fuel cell (MFC) and microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) are the main ways. Among those WtE technologies are ecologically green that convert MSW into electricity, hydrogen gas and other chemical feedstocks. The review suggests that MFC and MEC technologies forecast future WtE for fabrication of biohydrogen from MSW.

TI Municipal solid waste management in Phnom Penh, capital city of Cambodia
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB This paper presents an overview of municipal solid waste management (MSWM) for both technical and regulatory arrangements in the municipality of Phnom Penh (MPP), Cambodia. Problems with the current MSWM are identified, and challenges and recommendations for future improvement are also given in this paper. MPP is a small city with a total area of approximately 374 km(2) and an urban population of about 1.3 million in 2008. For the last 14 years, average annual municipal solid waste (MSW) generated in MPP has increased rapidly from 0.136 million tons in 1995 to 0.361 million tons in 2008. The gross generation rate of MSW per capita was 0.74 kg day(-1). However, the per capita household waste generation was 0.487 kg day(-1). At 63.3%, food waste is the predominant portion of generated waste, followed by plastics (15.5%), grass and wood (6.8%), and paper and cardboard (6.4%). The remaining waste, including metals, glass, rubber/leather, textiles, and ceramic/stone, accounted for less than 3%. Waste recycling through informal sectors is very active; recycled waste accounted for about 9.3% of all waste generated in 2003. Currently, the overall technical arrangement, including storage and discharge, collection and transport, and disposal, is still in poor condition, which leads to environmental and health risks. These problems should be solved by improving legislation, environmental education, solid waste management facilities, and management of the waste scavengers.

TI Enhancing Bioenergy Recovery from Agro-food Biowastes as a Strategy to
   Promote Circular Bioeconomy
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF ENERGY WATER AND ENVIRONMENT
   SYSTEMS-JSDEWES
AB Agro-food industries produce large amounts of wastes challenging innovative and efficient valorisation strategies promoting the circular bioeconomy concept. Anaerobic digestion technology is an interesting route for bioenergy recovery in the agro-food chain sector. In this work, a simple approach is proposed for assessing energy performance of livestock manure and mixed sewage sludge, as substrate by coupling the potential addition of several agro-food biowastes (co-substrate: fruit and vegetable biowastes, fish canning industry, other manures, coffee wastes, and non-edible crops). The results obtained showed an increase of energy performance indicator ranging from 30 to 250% and 62 to 539%, for livestock manure and mixed sewage sludge, respectively. This conceptual approach for feedstocks promotes the circular bioeconomy as it encourages the stakeholders to a smart use of anaerobic biotechnology at rural-level or urban-level.

TI Quantification and characterization of the municipal solid waste for
   sustainable waste management in newly formed municipalities of Nepal
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB This study was conducted to set up a new reference line for municipal solid waste quantification and characterization in the least urbanized cities of a developing nation. A survey was run to collect baseline data from 60 new municipalities of Nepal. The study covered a sample size of 3300 households, 600 institutions and 600 commercial establishments in those municipalities. The municipalities were further stratified according to geographical location, the degree of urbanization, household expenditure and population size to assess the influence on waste generation. The results indicated that the average per capita household waste generation is 115 g day(-1) while the average total municipal waste generation was estimated to be 180 g day(-1) per capita.The study also revealed that size of municipal population, geographic location, household expenditure and degree of urbanization were found to have a significant influence on the unit waste generation. The larger the size of municipal population the higher the per capita household waste generation, degree of urbanization and per capita waste production. Increasing household expenditure revealed an increase in the unit waste generation. The waste categories included organic waste, plastics, paper and paper products, textiles, rubber and leather, metals, glass, and others. The results indicated that organic waste dominated the characterization (62%), followed by plastics (12%) and paper/paper products (11%).

TI A System Dynamics-Based Approach to Help Understand the Role of Food and
   Biodegradable Waste Management in Respect of Municipal Waste Management
   Systems
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The long-term plan of any city in Japan is to become a material recycling society. The use of all types of municipal waste is essential in maximizing the full potential of material recovery. As such, municipalities are responsible for managing their waste, including food and biodegradable waste (FBW), and this results in some complex schemes. This study uses the system dynamics approach to illustrate and investigate the benefits of separate treatment of FBW. At the same time, to understand the dynamic interactions between all aspects and elements of the current municipal solid waste management system in Oita City. The developed model includes total environmental benefit, motivation to manage waste and resources, and yield from treatment facilities. The result shows that with the introduction of an anaerobic digester (AD) plant for FBW increases the efficiency of incineration. Furthermore, the result indicates that strengthening the regulation of waste sorted and the reduction in the amount of FBW treated in incineration will improve the current system. This study concludes that any policy or regulation less than the proposed result will yield less benefit. Thus, strengthening regulation is a crucial part of the sustainability of FBW management in the long run.

TI Life cycle comparison of waste-to-energy alternatives for municipal
   waste treatment in Chilean Patagonia
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB The energy system in the Region of Aysen, Chile, is characterized by a strong dependence on fossil fuels, which account for up to 51% of the installed capacity. Although the implementation of waste-to-energy concepts in municipal waste management systems could support the establishment of a more fossil-independent energy system for the region, previous studies have concluded that energy recovery systems are not suitable from an economic perspective in Chile. Therefore, this work intends to evaluate these technical options from an environmental perspective, using life cycle assessment as a tool for a comparative analysis, considering Coyhaique city as a case study. Three technical alternatives were evaluated: (i) landfill gas recovery and flaring without energy recovery; (ii) landfill gas recovery and energy use; and (iii) the implementation of an anaerobic digestion system for the organic waste fraction coupled with energy recovery from the biogas produced. Mass and energy balances of the three analyzed alternatives have been modeled. The comparative LCA considered global warming potential, abiotic depletion and ozone layer depletion as impact categories, as well as required raw energy and produced energy as comparative regional-specific indicators. According to the results, the use of the recovered landfill gas as an energy source can be identified as the most environmentally appropriate solution for Coyhaique, especially when taking into consideration the global impact categories.

TI Life cycle assesment of municipal solid waste management methods: Ankara
   case study
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Different solid waste management system scenarios were developed and compared for the Municipal Solid Waste Management System of Ankara by using the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. The solid waste management methods considered in the scenarios were collection and transportation of wastes, source reduction, Material Recovery Facility (MRF)/Transfer Stations (TS), incineration, anaerobic digestion and landfilling. The goal of the study was to determine the most environmentally friendly option of MSWM system for Ankara. The functional unit of the study was the amount of solid waste generated in the system area of concern, which are the districts of Ankara. The life cycle inventory analysis was carried out by IWM Model-1. The inputs and outputs of each management stage were defined and the inventory emissions calculated by the model were classified in to impact categories; non-renewable energy sources exhausting potential, final solid waste as hazardous and nonhazardous, global warming, acidification, eutrophication and human toxicity. The impacts were quantified with the weighing factors of each category to develop the environmental profiles of each scenario. In most of the categories, Source Reduction Scenario was found to be the most feasible management method, except the global warming category. The lowest contribution to G-AT was calculated for the anaerobic digestion process. In the interpretation and improvement assessment stage, the results were further evaluated and recommendations were made to improve the current solid waste management system of Ankara.

TI Evaluation of environmental impacts from municipal solid waste
   management in the municipality of Aarhus, Denmark (EASEWASTE)
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB A new computer based life cycle assessment model (EASE-WASTE) was used to evaluate a municipal solid waste system with the purpose of identifying environmental benefits and disadvantages by anaerobic digestion of source-separated household waste and incineration. The most important processes that were included in the study are optical sorting and pre-treatment, anaerobic digestion with heat and power recovery, incineration with heat and power recovery, use of digested biomass on arable soils and finally, an estimated surplus consumption of plastic in order to achieve a higher quality and quantity of organic waste to the biogas plant. Results showed that there were no significant differences in most of the assessed environmental impacts for the two scenarios. However, the use of digested biomass may cause a potential toxicity impact on human health due to the heavy metal content of the organic waste. A sensitivity analysis showed that the results are sensitive to the energy recovery efficiencies, to the extra plastic consumption for waste bags and to the content of heavy metals in the waste. A model such as EASE-WASTE is very suitable for evaluating the overall environmental consequences of different waste management strategies and technologies, and can be used for most waste material fractions existing in household waste.

AB The most common way of solid waste disposal in many countries is landfilling. In Tunisia 65% of the solid waste is landfilled. However, although landfilling is cheap in comparison to other waste management options, it requires significant funds for the construction, the operation phase and the post-closure phase. The mechanical and biological pretreatment processes, applied for decades in developed countries, reduce the economic and environmental costs of landfilling by reducing the volumes of waste to be buried and stabilize them. In addition, recovering valuable materials upstream of the preprocessing can generate a product with high added value. A survey was conducted in 2017 to characterize the municipal solid waste (MSW) composition. Thereto the waste was analyzed during January-February (dry season) and August-September (wet season). Municipal solid waste (MSW) in Gabes includes of a wide range of heterogeneous materials. The organic waste was the main fraction, followed by textiles, fines, paper, plastics, leather, rubber, glass, ceramic, and metal. The average MSW moisture content in Gabes landfill amounts to 69%.

SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB The proper use of alternative fuels and materials in the cement industry is essential for the planning and promotion of different methods that can decrease the environmental impacts, lower the consumption of energy and material resources, and reduce the economic costs of this industry. Because of the great potential for the cement industry to save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), many new research advances associated with the promising approach of introducing waste materials as alternative fuels or sustainable raw materials into the cement manufacturing process have been developed in recent years. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to provide a literature review of these approaches based on previously published research studies. The analysis is specially focused on the technical, economic, and environmental effects of the uses of five solid wastes, namely, municipal solid waste (MSW), meat and bone animal meal (MBM), sewage sludge (SS), biomass, and end-of-life tyres (ELT), in the cement industry.

AB The composition of municipal solid waste (MSW) in the Cairo metropolitan area is investigated. The outputs of MSW sorting analysis at various locations in Cairo with different waste management schemes are presented. Organics (58-75%) and plastic waste (19-28%) are the main components of MSW in Cairo with a higher percentage of organics in landfills compared to dumpsites. The leachate quality is analyzed, and the analysis results indicate that the concentration of macro inorganic pollutants (NH4+, Na+, Ca2+, and Cl-) and heavy metals (e.g., Cd2+ and Zn2+) are exceeding the majority of values reported in the literature in various cities all over the world. There was no evidence of an effect of the recycling process on chloride concentration in leachate, while the concentration of iron was reduced. The variation of leachate quality with time for two samples collected from the same municipal solid waste landfill is presented. The first leachate sample is a two-year-old, and the second sample is a sixteen-year-old. There was a significant increase in the concentration of chloride, sodium, chromium, calcium, and magnesium. The implications of the leachate quality in Cairo on the longevity of barrier systems in an MSW landfill are discussed.

SO ROCK AND SOIL MECHANICS
AB The sewage sludge-municipal solid waste (MSW) mixed landfill is one of the ways of sewage sludge disposal. The dry density parameter of the sewage sludge and MSW mixture have important influence on the strength and stability in landfill. The compaction tests on the mixture are conducted under different compaction energies and sewage sludge contents conditions to study the compaction characteristics. The results show that compared to MSW, the dry density of the mixture is increased by 2.74%-32.50%, improving the compaction characteristics of MSW. The dry density increases with the increase of compaction energy; and a hyperbolic model can be used to express this relationship. The physical meanings of model parameters are also analyzed. The variation laws of model parameters are discussed. It is found that. varies from 0.373 to 0.750, and that. varies from 1.958 to 2.158. The dry density increases with the increase of sewage sludge contents; and this relationship can be described by a logarithmic model. The variation laws of model parameters are also discussed. It is also found that b varies from 0.331 to 0.776, and that c varies from 0.052 to 0.164. Comprehensively utilizing these two models, the dry density parameter of the mixture can be predicted; the workload of testing can be reduced; and the theoretical basis can be provided for the design and analysis of the landfill site. The compaction evaluation method and the compaction mechanism of the mixture are analyzed. According to the variation trend of the dry density, the mixture is judged whether densification.

TI Assessing the "design paradox" with life cycle assessment: A case study
   of a municipal solid waste incineration plant
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB One of the most important processes in an integrated waste management system is incineration, which, among the different waste management disposal options still remains a critical waste treatment system. New dynamics and approaches have to be developed to embrace such a wide and complex topic, and better knowledge and assessment of incineration are strategically significant to define future environmental scenarios.
   Life cycle assessment (LCA), as a tool to optimise process-operating conditions and to support decision making process, is often applied to investigate processes under design in various sectors, since choices made in the development phases can affect the future environmental profile. However, even if the greatest opportunity to improve a process from an environmental perspective is during the design phase, at the same time the knowledge is limited, in accordance with the so-called "design paradox".
   Thus, in this context, this study used LCA methodology to quantitatively assess the extent to which the environmental impact of an incineration line reflects the environmental burdens perceived during the design phase. A comparative LCA was conducted at the design phase and under operating conditions at an Italian municipal solid waste incineration plant.
   The outcomes of the study indicated that for almost all of the categories analysed, the impacts associated with the process under design overestimated the impacts associated with the operating process, with the exception of climate change and water depletion. The results suggested that after the conduction of an LCA at the design phase of a process, an LCA of the operative conditions should be carried out to verify how much the over- or under-estimations affected the results.

This review studies the sustainable transformation of various types of biomass waste such as animal manure, sewage sludge, municipal solid waste, and food waste, into organic fertilizers and their impact on waste minimization and agricultural enhancement. The side effects of these organic fertilizers towards the soil are evaluated as the characteristics of these fertilizers will differ depending on the types of waste used, in addition to the varying chemical composition of the organic fertilizers. This work will provide an insight to the potential management of biomass waste to be produced into organic fertilizer and the advantages of substituting chemical fertilizer with organic fertilizer derived from the biomass waste.

TI Ranking municipal solid waste treatment alternatives considering
   sustainability criteria using the analytical hierarchical process tool
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB The establishment of an integrated rational waste management system is a complex issue, which has to be clearly investigated and a widespread variety of environmental, social and economic criteria should be taken into consideration. Each different waste treatment alternative provides a specific environmental, social and economic performance. Therefore, the crucial environmental, social and economic criteria need to be identified, estimated and thoroughly examined. In this manuscript, mechanical biological aerobic treatment without RDF energy recovery, mechanical biological anaerobic treatment and incineration with energy recovery are compared and finally ranked according to their environmental, social and economic performance. Analytical hierarchical process was used to rank the performance in three examined pillars in the capacity range of 70-90 kt. Incineration with energy recovery provides best performance due to the high amount of generated energy, whereas the other two options provide less capital costs. However, the performance of each treatment alternative is strongly dependent on the selection and weight of criteria. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Municipal solid waste production and composition in Finland - Changes in
   the period 1960-2002 and prospects until 2020
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Waste reduction was recognised as the main goal of waste management policy in the EU in the 1990s. Although knowledge of past waste generation is essential for effective waste reduction policy there are no comprehensive statistics on the past development of municipal solid waste (MSW) production. MSW management is currently under turmoil in many EU countries as the requirements of the EC landfill directive (1999/31/EC) are set into force. In this study, the production and composition of MSW in Finland between 1960 and 2002 is presented using historical data. The impact of population, affluence and technology on MSW production are analysed using the IPAT equation and three scenarios are constructed until year 2020. The results are compared with national future targets on MSW production. Production of MSW increased in Finland until 1990, declined to year 1997, increased to 2000 and then declined again. The share of organic and plastic waste increased over the study period while the share of paper and cardboard declined. The results suggest that so far national targets on MSW reduction have been set fairly low. Moreover, our scenarios depict a wide range of future MSW production, even though the time horizon is not longer than 15 years into the future. In order to narrow this range. continuous improvement of the statistics of MSW is essential. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Greenhouse Gas Emission of Organic Waste Composting: A Case Study of
   Universiti Teknologi Malaysia Green Campus Flagship Project
SO JURNAL TEKNOLOGI
AB Waste generation nowadays is rising in the world and it seems hard to prevent it. Solid Waste Management (SWM) has been a major problem worldwide in most of the fast growing towns and cities among the developing countries all around the world. Food waste and green waste constitute high volumes of municipal solid waste (MSW). The application of compost in the agricultural sector can contribute to sustainable soil health and other co-benefits. The compost produced from biological waste does not contain any chemicals unfavorable to living soil. The objective of this research was to calculate the greenhouse gas emission from the compost processed from the food and green wastes generated oncampus in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) as a pilot project. The result indicated that the composting process promotes the university as a green campus by converting organic wastes into valuable products such as organic fertilizer.

TI Material and energy recovery in integrated waste management system - An
   Italian case study on the quality of MSW data
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB This paper analyses the way numerical data on Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) quantities are recorded, processed and then reported for six of the most meaningful Italian Districts and shows the difficulties found during the comparison of these Districts, starting from the lack of homogeneity and the fragmentation of the data indispensable to make this critical analysis. These aspects are often ignored, but data certainty are the basis for serious MSW planning.
   In particular, the paper focuses on overall Source Separation Level (SSL) definition and on the influence that Special Waste (SW) assimilated to MSW has on it. An investigation was then necessary to identify new parameters in place of overall SSL. Moreover, these parameters are not only important for a waste management system performance measure, but are fundamental in order to design and check management plan and to identify possible actions to improve it.

TI Urban mining of municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) residues with
   emphasis on bioleaching technologies: a critical review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Metals are essential in our daily lives and have a finite supply, being simultaneously contaminants of concern. The current carbon emissions and environmental impact of mining are untenable. We need to reclaim metals sustainably from secondary resources, like waste. Biotechnology can be applied in metal recovery from waste streams like fly ashes and bottom ashes of municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI). They represent substantial substance flows, with roughly 46 million tons of MSWI ashes produced annually globally, equivalent in elemental richness to low-grade ores for metal recovery. Next-generation methods for resource recovery, as in particular bioleaching, give the opportunity to recover critical materials and metals, appropriately purified for noble applications, in waste treatment chains inspired by circular economy thinking. In this critical review, we can identify three main lines of discussion: (1) MSWI material characterization and related environmental issues; (2) currently available processes for recycling and metal recovery; and (3) microbially assisted processes for potential recycling and metal recovery. Research trends are chiefly oriented to the potential exploitation of bioprocesses in the industry. Biotechnology for resource recovery shows increasing effectiveness especially downstream the production chains, i.e., in the waste management sector. Therefore, this critical discussion will help assessing the industrial potential of biotechnology for urban mining of municipal, post-combustion waste.

TI Resource potential and global warming potential of fruit and vegetable
   waste in China based on different treatment strategies
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Fruit and vegetable waste (FVW) contains rich resources that can be recovered by methods such as incineration, anaerobic digestion to generate heat energy, biogas, and preservation by ensiling. However, a horizontal comparison of the resource potential and environmental impact of different recycling methods employed for FVW has not been conducted. This study quantifies and computes the recycling potential and global warming potential (GWP) of anaerobic digestion, ensiling, and incineration of the FVW generated during primary production in China. First, a gray model was employed to estimate the FVW output in 2030, based on the FVW produced between 2002 and 2017. Next, the resource potential and GWP of anaerobic digestion, incineration, and ensiling were evaluated. Finally, an optimization method was utilized to analyze possible strategies of FVW recycling in 2030. Results indicate that FVW output in China is expected to increase to 170 Mt by 2030, highlighting the need for efficient treatment options. Further, the resource potential and GWP of different waste treatment strategies were notably different. The recycling potential of ensiling was the highest at 1950 MJ/t; while the GWP of anaerobic digestion was the lowest at-31 kg CO2eq. An optimization analysis suggested that the optimal target of 100% would be attained if all FVW is ensiled in 2030. The study provides a basis for informed technical decision-making related to FVW recycling options in the future.

TI Swine manure treatment technologies as drivers for circular economy in
   agribusiness: A techno-economic and life cycle assessment approach
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Anaerobic digestion has been employed as a technology capable of adding value to waste coupled with environmental impact mitigation. However, many issues need to be elucidated to ensure the systems viability based on this technol-ogy. In this sense, the present study evaluated technically, environmentally, and economically, four configurations of swine waste treatment systems focused on the promotion of decarbonization and circularity of the swine chain. For this, a reference plant, based on a compact treatment process named SISTRATES (R) (Portuguese acronym for swine ef-fluent treatment system) was adopted to serve as a model for comparison and validation. The results showed the im-portance of prioritization of the energy recuperation routes through anaerobic digestion, providing increased economic benefits and minimizing environmental damage. Thus, the SISTRATES (R) configuration was the one that pre-sented the best designs in a circular context, maximizing the recovery of energy and nutrients, along with the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, ensuring the sustainability of the pig production chain.

TI Stabilisation/solidification of municipal solid waste incineration fly
   ash by phosphate-enhanced calcium aluminate cement
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Landfill disposal of municipal solid waste incineration fly ash (MIFA) presents significant environmental and economic burden. This study proposed a novel and high-efficiency approach for stabilisation/solidification (S/S) of MIFA by phosphate-modified calcium aluminate cement (CAC). Experimental results showed that the presence of Pb (the most leachable metal contaminant in the MIFA) retarded the early-stage reaction of CAC, resulting in an extension of setting time and a significant decline of compressive strength of CAC pastes. The incorporation of phosphate additives (10 wt% of binder), especially for trisodium phosphate, in CAC system effectively mitigated the negative impact of Pb on the CAC reaction and reduced the Pb leachability. Elemental mapping results illustrated that Pb2+ coordinated with phosphate to generate insoluble precipitates (e.g., Pb-3(PO4)(2)). The S/S treated MIFA samples fulfilled the compressive strength and leachability requirements for on-site reuse. Overall, this study demonstrated that phosphate-modified CAC is a promising binder for S/S of hazardous MIFA.

AB The main objective of this study is the evaluation of medical waste management in Thessaly region, Greece. Nowadays, medical waste treatment and disposal is one of the most important problems in many countries. The reason is simple. Medical waste and specifically infectious medical waste disposal could be extremely dangerous, especially if it is not controlled, according to the basic principles of waste management. Our research was carried out in the 5 hospitals (1 university and 4 general hospitals) that operate in the region of Thessaly and our findings have shown that most of hospitals use the method of steam sterilization in a mobile treatment unit for their waste treatment. More specifically, private companies, which deal with medical waste treatment, visit the hospitals once per week and sterilize the waste in the mobile unit. On the other hand, the university hospital uses the method of incineration for its waste treatment. Regarding the incinerator, it should be noticed that it is a double chamber incinerator. The primary combustion chamber is used for the waste incineration and the secondary combustion chamber is used for the incineration of the fumes. This incinerator operates without the necessary equipment for the air pollution minimization. The medical wastes that are produced in the other medical facilities in the region are disposed without specific care for the environment. It is the outcome of our research that planning about the optimal medical waste management is essential in the effort to achieve an integrated medical waste management according to the principles of sustainable development.

Pulandian as a typical medium-sized town in China is investigated in the paper. The daily amount of MSW generated in urban district of Pulandian in 2008 was 0.95 kg/capita, which is comparable to that of some big city in China. Characteristics analysis on MSW was also carried out. The current status of MSW collection, recycling and transportation was introduced and the problems were identified. The MSW treatment and disposal in Pulandian has caused serious contamination. The new MSW treatment plant using integrated disposal technology and transport centre for reduction and recycling of MSW under construction is preferred.

TI Is the finer the better for municipal solid waste (MSW) classification
   in view of recyclable onstituents? A comprehensive social, economic and
   environmental analysis
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB With the accelerating pace of urbanization, the continuous increase of municipal solid waste (MSW) has become a major obstacle to China's economic development. Therefore, China recently regards MSW classification scenario as an important strategy for national ecological civilization. However, published references have not focused on MSW classification in view of environmental, economic and social acceptation simultaneously. This research proposes a new Decision Support System (DSS) model considering all three aspects to analyze the comprehensive benefit of the four MSW classification scenarios in Pudong (Shanghai, China) using cost benefit analysis (CBA), life cycle assessment (LCA) and analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Among them, there is an important boundary factor in the life cycle assessment. This work mainly focuses on the net energy consumption, namely the air and water emission of different substances. The results show that the classification scenario II, dividing MSW into toxic and hazardous waste, recyclable, kitchen waste and combustible waste, is the best option. Although scenario III (MSW is divided into toxic and hazardous waste, recyclable waste (paper, plastic, scrap metal, waste glass and other small class), kitchen waste and combustible wastes) and IV (recyclable waste in Scenario II is further classified, for example, paper is subdivided into newspapers, books, cardboard, etc.) further refine the MSW classification, the DSS model analysis results indicate that neither of these are the most feasible scenario. Therefore, finer classification is not always the better if we consider all three pillars of sustainability. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   incineration
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB This research aims to evaluate the sustainability of alkali-activated binders for the stabilization/solidification (S/ S) of municipal solid waste incineration fly ash (MSWI FA). A detailed environmental assessment of different alkali-activated mixtures was conducted using life cycle assessment (LCA) to identify the factors affecting their environmental burden. Ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) and metakaolin (MK) were used as the precursors. Results showed that all the alkali-activated blocks fulfilled the requirements for landfill and reuse as fill materials. Adopting alkali activation for S/S of MSWI FA instead of OPC allowed up to 70% reduction of global warming potential. However, in other impact categories such as human toxicity and land use, the alkali mixtures recorded higher values than the mix with OPC (+60-70%), primarily because of the impacts related to the production of chemical activators. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated that alternative production methods for sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide could enormously reduce the impacts related to the alkali solution. When the hydrothermal method for sodium silicate and the ODC method for sodium hydroxide were adopted, a reduction of 71%, 22%, and 24% was recorded in global warming potential, fossil resource scarcity, and human toxicity categories, respectively, compared with the mix with OPC. Therefore, this study sheds light on alkali -activated materials as sustainable S/S alternative to OPC for hazardous waste management to promote carbon neutrality.

TI Detailed municipal solid waste composition analysis for Nur-Sultan City,
   Kazakhstan with implications for sustainable waste management in Central
   Asia
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB A detailed characterization of municipal solid waste (MSW) beyond a standard compositional analysis may offer insights useful for improving waste management systems. The present paper contributes to the scarce literature in the field by presenting new data from a rapidly developing Central Asian city, the capital of Kazakhstan, Nur-Sultan. Three sampling campaigns (each 1 week long) have been conducted at the city landfill over a 1-year period (2018-2019), and a detailed characterization for selected waste components and sub-components has been performed. The major fractions of MSW were organics (46.3%), plastics (15.2%), paper (12.8%), and diapers (5.9%). The detailed composition analysis showed high LDPE (low-density polyethylene) content (5.5%) mostly comprised of plastic bags (4.5%), transparent glass (3.2%), pharmaceuticals (0.4%), and fine (i.e., < 12 mm) organic fraction content (29%). The MSW generation rate of Nur-Sultan was estimated as 1.47 kg capita(-1) day(-1) based on the field collection as well as literature data. Among sustainable waste management recommendations addressed for Nur-Sultan and applicable to other cities in Central Asia, composting is recommended due to high organics fraction in MSW and its great potential to reduce the landfilled waste volume and to help valorizing the waste.

TI Exergetic assessment of municipal solid waste management system in south
   Beijing
SO ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY
AB The exergetic analysis model of municipal solid waste (MSW) was established to study the MSW management system in south Beijing. The materials and energy inventory of different processes, including transport, mechanical separation, compost, incineration and landfill, were analyzed. Based on the inventory analysis, the exergetic efficiencies of different unit technologies and management systems were studied, and the main results were: (1) the exergetic efficiency of compost and incineration is 5.98% and 14.23%, higher than landfill, 2.92%; (2) mechanical separation increases the exergetic efficiency of unit technologies. from 2.92% to 4.33% of landfill and from 14.23% to 15.59% of incineration; and (3) integrated treatment increases the comprehensive exergetic efficiency of the MSW management system, exergetic efficiency of MSW management system in south Beijing increased from 2.91% to 4.57% because the processes of mechanical separation and compost were introduced, furthermore, when the incineration facility is applied to treat the plastic and paper, exergetic efficiency of the system will increase to 13.95%. According to the exergetic analysis. HRRIS aims (harmless, recycling, reductive, industrializing and socializing) of MSW management system were put forward, and scavenger management, charging mechanism and integration of technologies were discussed.

TI Effects of co-substrates' mixing ratios and loading rate variations on
   food and agricultural wastes' anaerobic co-digestion performance
SO BIOMASS CONVERSION AND BIOREFINERY
AB Tunisia is one of the developing countries which faces crucial challenges, the most prominent of which are the production of organic waste, the need for an appropriate waste treatment, and the demand for water and energy conservation. To this end, the present research was designed to develop a technical concept on closed cycle "biowaste to bioenergy" treating food waste (FW) through combined biological processes. In this approach, semi-continuous anaerobic co-digestion (ACoD) of FW, wheat straw (WS), and cattle manure (CM) was tested to investigate the relationship between the effect of the feedstock mixtures and C:N ratio on biogas and digestate generation at different organic loading rates (OLRs) ranging from 2 to 3.6 kg VS/m(3).d. Results showed that the mono-digested FW was optimal and reached 565.5 LN/kg VSin at an OLR of 2.4 kg VS/m(3).d, and then a drop of biogas production was recorded. However, for co-digested substrates, the optimum mixture ratio was FW:CM 75:25, where 62%, 39.89%, 91.26%, 130.9%, and 119.97% of the biogas yield improved for OLRs ranging from 2 to 3.6 kg VS/m(3).d, respectively. Admittedly, the target of this work was to enhance the ACoD process, but it also examined the exploitation of different AD effluents. Therefore, special attention was paid to the generated digestates to decide how it can be efficiently upcycled later. Thus, the closed cycle "biowaste to bioenergy" treatment met two of the major Tunisian concerns: efficient organic waste management and sustainable bioenergy production.

TI Environmental and economic feasibility of an integrated community
   composting plant and organic farm in Malaysia
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Waste prevention and management become a significant issue worldwide to achieve sustainable development. Similar to many developing countries, Malaysia has faced severe problems in waste management due to its rapid economic growth and urbanisation. The municipal solid waste (MSW) production rate in Malaysia had increased significantly in a recent year, ranging from 0.8 to 1.25 kg/person.d. The wastes generated contain a high amount of organic portion with high moisture content. Improper MSW management practice or delayed in waste collection and transportation can lead to severe health issues. This paper presents a case study in Johor Bahru, Malaysia (FOLO Farm), in which a composting prototype is used as the waste management technology to recycle the food and vegetable wastes. The greenhouse gases (GHG) mitigation and economic feasibility of the integrated composting and organic farming in this study are reported. This study showed a reduction of 27% of GHG by diverting the food and vegetable wastes from open dumping to the composting plant. Higher reduction rate (similar to 44%) can be achieved with better planning of waste collection route and applying the mitigation strategies during the composting process. By adapting the membership concept, this project not only ensures the economic feasibility of running a composting plant but also secures a channel for the growth of vegetable distribution. This study provides an insight into the feasibility and desirability to implement a pilot-scale composting for organic waste management to achieve the low carbon and self-sustain community.

TI Analysis of Influence Factors on Municipal Solid Waste Generation Based
   on the Multivariable Adjustment
SO ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
AB With the rapid development of economy and urbanization, municipal solid waste (MSW) generation has also increased dramatically. MSW poses great threat to the ecological environment and the survival of humankind, and forms a bottleneck restricting the healthy and sustainable development of an economy. Research on the influence factors of MSW could provide useful information for formulation of pollution control policies. This article develops a multiple regression model to assess the impact of these influencing factors. We find that MSW generations are strongly and positively related to urban population, GDP, the quantity of solid waste transport vehicles, collection area of solid waste, and the per capita disposable income of urban residents. However, we find that MSW generations have strong and negative correlations with the inflation rate and the solid waste treatment rate. Finally, based on the empirical findings, we put forward policy recommendations to help government agencies to design measures that can effectively address the increasing trend of waste generation.

   Black Soldier Fly larvae: A review
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Solid waste management and its stabilization are a sophisticated task and the most challenging one as it requires improved collection and treatment strategies. From the past decades, there is a huge emphasis on valorisation of waste along with its management i.e. an integrated and income generating sustainable approach for solid waste management. Use of Black Soldier Fly (Hermetia illucens) in organic waste composting is a novel and an environment friendly approach which holds enormous potential and therefore, is strongly captivating peoples attention worldwide. The Black Soldier Fly (BSF) larvae composting is a self-sustained cost-effective method promoting high resource recovery and generating value added products thereby developing new economical niches for industrial sector and entrepreneurs in developing countries. Here, we reviewed the importance of BSF larvae in organic waste treatment and delineated the life cycle patterns, feeding habits and environmental conditions affecting the survival of the species. This review paper has also congregated the efficiency of BSF larvae to compost different types of organic wastes or biomasses and a portion of various possible end applications of these avid eaters. Through this literature review the authors have also made an attempt to evaluate the present constraints, research gaps and future directions associated with this technology. BSF larvae composting is a comprehensive approach indeed providing the waste an aforementioned value wherein technological innovations can boost up the efficiency of system. Thus, the present study is an aggregate of applications of BSF larvae for societal benefit in a holistic way.

TI Environmental assessment of solid waste systems and technologies:
   EASEWASTE
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB A new model has been developed for evaluating the overall resource consumption and environmental impacts of municipal solid waste management systems by the use of life cycle assessment. The model is named EASEWASTE (Environmental Assessment of Solid Waste Systems and Technologies) and is able to compare different waste management strategies, waste treatment methods and waste process technologies. The potential environmental impacts can be traced back to the most important processes and waste fractions that contribute to the relevant impacts. A model like EASEWASTE can be used by waste planners to optimize current waste management systems with respect to environmental achievements and by authorities to Set Guidelines and regulations and to evaluate different strategies for handling of waste. The waste hierarchy has for decades been governing waste management but the ranking of handling approaches may not always be the most environmentally friendly. The EASEWASTE model can identify the most environmentally sustainable solution, which may differ among waste materials and regions and can add valuable information about environmental achievements from each process in a solid waste management system.

TI Waste-to-energy innovative system: Assessment of integrating anaerobic
   digestion and pyrolysis technologies
SO SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
AB Anaerobic digestion (AD) of sewage sludge is an already well-developed technology to convert waste to bioenergy and digestate. Despite its deployment, AD process still raises environmental, technical and economic issues and many researches have been done to improve the process yield, reduce environmental burdens from digestate application and allow a better distribution of energy. The integration of thermal processes with anaerobic digestion is explored to overcome some of the anaerobic digestion limitations. In this study, a cradle-tograve life cycle assessment (LCA) is performed to compare a systemintegrating anaerobic digestion and pyrolysis (PY) with single anaerobic digestion, for the co-digestion of sewage sludge and quinoa residue. The results suggest that the environmental impacts of the two pathways are quite similar except for three impact categories: single anaerobic digestion is the best scenario in terms of global warming potential (-769 vs. -604 kg CO2 eq./ t substrate), ozone depletion (-33.7 vs -2.11 mg CFC-11 eq./t substrate) and fossil resources use (-9900 vs -6900 MJ/t substrate). The multifunctional process could be a viable competitor to single anaerobic digestion by improving pyrolysis products upgrading. The application of liquid digestate to crop field revealed to have significant burdens to particulate matter, acidification and terrestrial eutrophication impact categories andmust be carefully monitored in both pathways.

TI Barriers to organic waste management in a circular economy
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Organic waste disposal methods, notably landfilling, not only deplete resources but also contribute to environmental challenges. This research looks at potential barriers to organic waste management solutions. The objective of this study is to identify the barriers to organic waste management solutions from an actor's perspective, and to explore their causal relationships to overcome the organic waste management problem from a system perspective. Several key challenges were identified regarding organic waste management solution, the current intervention overview indicates that promoting and tracking attention towards "value to waste " would be an effective solution approach. Waste collection fees, unethical behavior, and a lack of engagement and commitment in activities show a subsequent effect on consumer-household solutions, which are currently acting as priority barriers in this research. In order to have a better understanding of this complex issue, a detailed knowledge of barriers (leading to organic waste) is discovered and evaluated with the application of fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL). The data for this research has been taken in the context of a developing economy like India. This work can provide structural support to the managers by knowing the cause (influencing) and effect-group (influencing) barriers to the effective implementation of an organic waste management system in a circular economy context.

TI A mini review on the main challenges of implementing mechanical
   biological treatment plants for municipal solid waste in the Latin
   America region: Learning from the experiences of developed countries
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Most of the municipal solid waste (MSW) generated in the Latin America (LATAM) region is currently disposed of in landfills and dumpsites, which results in many negative environmental impacts. Mechanical biological treatment (MBT) is a strategy that combines the mechanical separation of recoverable materials with the biological stabilization of organic matter. MBT plants have proven to be a good alternative for the management of MSW and have been successfully implemented in developed countries for more than 30 years. However, the efficient introduction of these facilities in developing countries, such as those in the LATAM region, requires further feasibility studies. Therefore, this mini review seeks to offer significant insights into the main challenges that must be overcome to facilitate the implementation and operation of MBT plants, considering the unique technological, sociocultural, economic and political context of the LATAM region, through a comparison of the reported experiences of MBT plants in more developed countries with those in the LATAM region. The analysis herein indicates that key actions for the successful operation of MBT plants in the LATAM region include both the implementation of source separation as well as selective collection practices. Moreover, this work shows that other factors, like the establishment of valorization markets with safe working conditions for informal collectors, the development of intermunicipal cooperation schemes and the enforcement of strong regulatory frameworks for waste disposal specifications, are important contextual factors that have allowed the efficient operation of MBT plants in developed countries. Although the implementation of many of these practices will be challenging, such measures are necessary to increase the sustainability of MSW treatment practices in the LATAM region.

TI Optimal utilization of solid residue from phase-separation pretreatment
   before food waste anaerobic digestion
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Food waste (FW) is a significant component of municipal solid waste (MSW) with high recycling value. In FW treatment plants, FW is separated into crude oil, liquid part and solid residue (SR) after pretreatment. Crude oil is used to process biodiesel, liquid part is sent to Anaerobic digestion (AD), but there are different technical options for SR utilization. In this study, four common methods, incineration, AD, composting, and feed processing, are compared in terms of carbon emissions and economic performance. The results show that AD is the best treatment choice for the lowest net carbon emission of-79.28 to-118.73 kg CO2-eq/t SR because of its high efficiency of electricity generation. Composting of SR has the highest net carbon emission with 19.24-116.40 kg CO2-eq/t SR because the carbon reduction effect from compost replacing chemical fertilizers is less than the direct greenhouse gas emissions. Feed processing remains almost all the biogenic carbon in the product, and hence it is the priority option if taking the short-term contribution of biogenic sources to carbon emissions. As for economic performance, feed processing is the best choice with a benefit of 225 CNY/t SR, while incineration of SR results in a high expenditure. From a comprehensive point of view, feed processing and AD are the best choices due to their carbon reduction effects and relatively low treatment cost. These results provide an essential reference for the decision making of FW treatment processes.

TI Assessment of municipal solid waste management system in Lae City, Papua
   New Guinea in the context of sustainable development
SO ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB Lae City (LC) of Morobe Province is the second-largest city in Papua New Guinea. Due to the abundant natural resources it inherits, the resultant urbanization has led to an influx of the human population. This increase in population as a result of industrialization has led to increased municipal solid waste (MSW) accumulation. To address this exigent issue, which affects the nation's carbon footprint, it is imperative to review socio-economic and geographic factors to establish a feasible approach for managing MSW efficiently and sustainably. In the quest to achieve the same, the present assessment focuses on the 3 core waste management hierarchy systems to support sustainable development for LC by reviewing existing opportunities and challenges associated with the current MSW management system and the associated policies. The result shows that as a sustainable approach to MSW management of LC, a zero-waste campaign for resource recovery engaging all stakeholders can be implemented since the organic content of MSW generated in LC is as high as 70%. Moreover, the dumping of MSW at the dedicated dumpsite site can be minimized if policies are strengthened and the proposed waste avoidance pathway is implemented strictly. In addition to this, to avoid the contamination of groundwater and recovery of methane, the use of the Fukuoka approach in the existing landfills has been suggested to capture leachate without any huge expenditure.

AB To achieving the European Union's environmental policy objectives for waste management region of Liepaja, it is necessary to develop a waste management model that is relevant to an existing regional system, taking into account the amount of produced waste, the processing technology and infrastructure, public behavior and regulatory framework, and at the same time it allows to operate the system in a sustainable way.
   The suitable place for main waste treatment infrastructure deployment in the Liepaja region is a landfill "Kivites" because it has already set up the infrastructure for waste mechanical sorting, landfill gas collection and using in combined heat and power, as well as waste disposal.
   The novelty of this study gets mechanical biological processing technologies in using for mixed municipal waste without full mechanical treatment. Such an approach is chosen based on studies of relatively high biological material admixture in recyclable material.
   The study has been developed the management approach not only for processing technology but also provides a theoretical model of municipal solid waste mechanical biological treatment for region Liepaja. The model includes the benefits of the system, the preconditions of implementation, as well as the solutions of short and long term implementation. In addition, the exisiting biodegradable waste management model of Liepaja Region that based on household waste disposal in the energy cells with biogas extraction - is not an effective solution and does not comply with European Union and Latvian environmental policy requirements regarding the biodegradable waste disposal and reduction of waste materials for recycling. In Latvia has not yet been implemented, no mechanical biological treatment technology with dry fermentation reactor, so there is no definition of a sustainable waste management system that would enable the effective separation, collection and treatment of organic waste, thus improving the rest of the waste materials for the quality and use of facilities. Methods of research is the analysis of documents, sociological research methods (deep and structured interviews methods, survey method), random method of case study and content analysis.

TI COVID-19 and municipal solid waste (MSW) management: a review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) represents an inevitable by-product of human activity and a major crisis for communities across the globe. In recent times, the recycling of MSW has drawn attention as the process can add value through resources from the recovered waste materials and facilitates the process of circular economy. However, during the unprecedented coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, the risk of infection with the highly contagious virus has proven detrimental to the continuation of MSW as a valuable resource. The volume of waste, especially household waste, is higher; face masks, PPE (personal protective equipment), and hazardous materials such as batteries and empty chlorine bottles are examples of extra waste that have arisen during the pandemic. Various countries have set up initiatives for MSW management, including safety measurements for employees in the MSW management sector. The use of disinfectant prior to sorting waste, as well as storing waste for 9 days, may help to inactivate the COVID-19 virus, ensuring an appropriate safety level for MSW management. This work aimed at studying different MSW management strategies, specific challenges, and possible solutions for better understanding for those involved in waste management, in addition to providing a possible management strategy during and post-COVID-19 pandemic.

TI Review of municipal solid waste management options in Malaysia, with an
   emphasis on sustainable waste-to-energy options
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB A beautiful and clean environment is the desire of every society. Malaysia is facing an uncontrolled increase in municipal solid waste (MSW) generation due to population growth, economic advancement, and industrialization, but the current, most common waste disposal practice of landfilling is not sustainable. The increasing standard of living also saps more energy from the power generation systems in which fossil fuels are the major source of fuel for the plants. Malaysia generates about 0.5-1.9 kg/capita/day of MSW; a total of about 25,000 tonnes/day of MSW is currently generated and is estimated to exceed 30,000 tonnes/day by 2020. Malaysian MSW is mainly composed of 45 % food waste, 24 % plastic, 7 % paper materials, 6 % metal, 4 % wood and 3 % glass, which are commingled, and is thus characterised by 52-66 % moisture content. Currently, 80-95 % of collected MSW is landfilled and 5 % is recycled, while composting and energy recovery are rarely practiced. This paper reviews the solid waste practice in Malaysia and looks into alternative management options for sustainability. Malaysia MSW represents recyclable power and energy potential if properly sorted. This study considered the practice of sorting at the source and the use of combustible MSW components as fuel to generate heat for a hybrid solar, flue gas, chimney power plant.

TI Circularity indicator for municipal solid waste treatment plants
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Circular Economy (CE) has become an essential paradigm to achieve sustainability, and waste processing plants are an important element to minimise loss of resources in the production and consumption system. To incor-porate CE into decision-making processes, it is essential to have metrics that consider this criterion. To date however, no such indicators can explicitly allow the circularity of waste treatment plants to be assessed straightforwardly. The objective of this study was to develop an indicator to measure the circularity of municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment plants (TP). This work is based on a literature review about efficiency indicators for resource recovery, an analysis of the most used technologies of such plants, and their materials and energy balances. As a result, a new circularity indicator for treatment plants (CITP) is proposed that combines two components: the main one evaluates the material recovery efficiency, and the secondary one quantifies energy recovery. Following the waste management hierarchy, for equality in the first component's value, the alternative with the highest energy component would be better evaluated. CITP was applied to six case studies ranging from a landfill with gas recovery to an MSW processing facility that includes the recovery of materials and the use of rejects as alternative fuel. The analysis of case studies reflects that the best MSW treatment alternatives must contemplate the intensive recovery of recyclable materials and the energy use of combustible rejects. The application results show that CITP can be calculated simply with the required information easily available, which enables different alternatives to be compared as regards CE and leaves the room for improvement of each alternative to be easily identified.

TI Household waste generation, composition and determining factors in
   rapidly urbanizing developing cities: case study of Santa Cruz de la
   Sierra, Bolivia
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Detailed information about waste generation rates, composition, and their influencing factors, is essential for sustainable municipal solid waste (MSW) management systems. While detailed waste characterization studies have been regularly conducted in industrialized countries for decades, they are still incipient and limited in scope in developing countries. Among all MSW streams, household waste (HW) represents a major fraction in developing countries with a distinctive influence on urban life-quality. This study conducts a HW characterization study in Santa Cruz, a rapidly urbanizing city of Bolivia, to (i) estimate HW generation rates and composition; and (ii) identify the main factors that explain variability in these rates. This is achieved through waste sampling and household surveys, manual component separation, and statistical analysis using correlations and multiple linear regressions. Results estimate a median waste generation rate of 0.548 kg/capita/day and a mean generation of 0.711 kg/capita/day for the whole city. Household size, household head (HH) education, children in the family and a kiosk in the household, are the main determinants of waste generation rates. Waste composition is comparable to other developing cities, with a relatively higher fraction of organic waste and fine residue, possibly due to context-specific characteristics of the urbanization process of the city.

AB Trying to respond to the latest policy needs, the work presented in this article aims at developing a life-cycle based framework methodology to quantitatively evaluate the environmental and economic sustainability of European food waste management options. The methodology is structured into six steps aimed at defining boundaries and scope of the evaluation, evaluating environmental and economic impacts and identifying best performing options. The methodology is able to accommodate additional assessment criteria, for example the social dimension of sustainability, thus moving towards a comprehensive sustainability assessment framework. A numerical case study is also developed to provide an example of application of the proposed methodology to an average European context. Different options for food waste treatment are compared, including landfilling, composting, anaerobic digestion and incineration. The environmental dimension is evaluated with the software EASETECH, while the economic assessment is conducted based on different indicators expressing the costs associated with food waste management. Results show that the proposed methodology allows for a straightforward identification of the most sustainable options for food waste, thus can provide factual support to decision/policy making. However, it was also observed that results markedly depend on a number of user-defined assumptions, for example on the choice of the indicators to express the environmental and economic performance.

TI Sustainable management of combustible household waste - Expanding the
   integrated evaluation model
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB A previously described model for the evaluation of sustainability in waste management has been expanded and applied to biodegradable and other combustible household waste. The model was applied to a case-study focusing on the special conditions in a municipality in the sparsely populated region of northern Sweden. In this region it is usual that the collection distances are long, the volume of waste is low and treatment facilities are remote. Four scenarios for the management of municipal household waste were compared: incineration, anaerobic digestion, composting and landfilling. A system analysis was performed to ensure that each scenario fulfil all the functions that the waste could provide (heat, electricity, fuel, and soil with a high nutrient content) and a sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the reliability of the results. The results show that the evaluation model can be used to assess the sustainability aspects of different treatment scenarios for combustible household waste. The model also allows for an individual interpretation of the results presented, depending on the choice of priorities. The effects of varying the time horizons and the difference in impact depending on what fuels are ultimately replaced in energy production are discussed. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Municipal solid waste is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions through decomposition and life-cycle activities processes. The majority of these emissions are a result of landfilling, which remains the primary waste disposal strategy internationally. As a result, countries have been incorporating alternative forms of waste management strategies such as energy recovery from landfill gas capture, aerobic landfilling (aerox landfills), pre-composting of waste prior to landfilling, landfill capping and composting of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste. As the changing global climate has been one of the major environmental challenges facing the world today, there is an increasing need to understand the impact of waste management on greenhouse gas emissions. This review paper serves to provide an overview on the impact of landfilling (and its various alternatives) and composting on greenhouse gas emissions taking into account streamlined life cycle activities and the decomposition process. The review suggests greenhouse gas emissions from waste decomposition are considerably higher for landfills than composting, However, mixed results were found for greenhouse gas emissions for landfill and composting operational activities. Nonetheless, in general, net greenhouse gas emissions for landfills tend to be higher than that for composting facilities. Crown Copyright (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A sustainability analysis of an incineration project in Serbia
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB The only option for municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment adopted so far in Serbia is landfilling. Similarly to other south-eastern European countries, Serbia is not recovering any energy from MSW. Fifty percent of electricity in Serbia is produced in coal-fired power plants with emission control systems dating from the 1980s. In this article, the option of MSW incineration with energy recovery is proposed and examined for the city of Novi Sad. A sustainability analysis consisting of financial, economic and sensitivity analyses was done in the form of a cost-benefit analysis following recommendations from the European Commission. Positive and negative social and environmental effects of electricity generation through incineration were valuated partly using conversion factors and shadow prices, and partly using the results of previous studies. Public aversion to MSW incineration was considered. The results showed that the incineration project would require external financial assistance, and that an increase of the electricity and/or a waste treatment fee is needed to make the project financially positive. It is also more expensive than the landfilling option. However, the economic analysis showed that society would have net benefits from an incineration project. The feed-in tariff addition of only Euro0.03 (KWh)(-1) to the existing electricity price, which would enable the project to make a positive contribution to economic welfare, is lower than the actual external costs of electricity generation from coal in Serbia.

TI Biohydrogen production from solid phase-microbial fuel cell spent
   substrate: A preliminary study
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Bio-based waste management processes, as anaerobic digestion, couple waste treatment with energy production using natural processes based on microbial metabolism. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) combine the production of electric power to the lowering the load of waste organic and mineral nutrients. In this study, the coordinated utilization of MFCs with anaerobic digestion in a two-steps process has been investigated. A single chamber, air cathode, membraneless MFCs with graphite plates as electrodes, fed with the organic fraction of municipal waste, was run for 4 weeks. The energy obtained was characterized by a maximum current density of 42.3 mA/m(2) kg, a power density of 1.98 mW/m(2) kg, and a columbic efficiency eta C-similar to 5%. pH of the slurry was maintained at 6.8 +/- 0.9 along the experiment. MFC spent substrate was then used in a batch experiment for biohydrogen and biomethane production through AD. The biohydrogen increased by 276%, as compared to that produced from the same fresh untreated Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste. A decrease in methane production of 66% was however observed. The analysis of MFC spent substrate revealed the prevalence of Lactobacillaceae, Bacillaceae, Clostridia and Pseudomonadaceae, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonizing the cathode.

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Recycling of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is a significant challenge all over the world. Waste-to-Energy generation solves the problem of MSW recycling and produces power for urban territories. In this study, the researchers implemented complex economic and ecological efficiency analyses of modern Waste-to-Energy technologies. The fundamental challenge of modern Waste-to-Energy generations is finding the balance between economics, ecology, and productivity. Thus, to assess the effectiveness of various thermal technologies, statistics from enterprises were used. The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) method was implemented to calculate an integral effectiveness of a particular Waste-to-Energy technological approach. Environmental and economic analysess of thermal MSW disposal technologies was carried out by selecting the data from at least 146 functioning plants in Canada, China, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Thailand. The research results confirm that gasification technology was the most promising and the most environmentally and cost effective. Incineration Moving Grate technology was the least effective and attractive Waste-to-Energy technology according to the results of the environmental and economic efficiency assessments. The research results can be used for urban planning in waste recycling projects and the new energy national and municipal agenda. The research results can also be useful for municipal strategic energy and sustainable plans and programs.

TI Environmental impact of municipal solid waste management using Life
   Cycle Assessment: The effect of anaerobic digestion, materials recovery
   and secondary fuels production
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB Material and energy recovery from waste is significantly growing its importance in the last decades aiming to reduce the primary resources exploitation and the excessive recourse to incineration and landfilling. Several processes, technologies and methods can be chosen to design a proper waste management system (WMS) so that an objective comparison between alternatives has to be made. To this end, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) can be used to compare possible alternative scenarios and create an evaluation grid where different environmental parameters are reported. The aim of this work was to compare the environmental impacts of four different scenarios already analysed for technological and economic aspects in a previous work. The scenario taken as base case referred to a real waste management system applied in Caserta Province, an area of 924,614 inhabitants in the Campania region of Southern Italy. The base scenario considers the household separation of waste in five fractions addressed to material recovery (polyethylene, polyethylen-terephtalate, polypropylene, metals, cellulosic fibers,...), composting (biowaste) and incineration (residual waste). The results of the LCA demonstrated that the best scenario is that one including the highest separate collection rate technically and economically feasible to be carried out i.e. 60%, the recourse to anaerobic digestion and biogas production to treat the biowaste separately collected and the maximization of the re-processing of recyclable materials such as PET, HDPE, glass, metals,... In particular, the Global Warming Potential decrease of 166% and the Eutrophication Potential decrease of 646%, when the alternative scenario, including the recalled features is compared to the base-case one. The most important result is that the raised separate collection of recyclable materials utilized as substitutes of raw materials and of biowaste utilized for production of renewable energy helps to mitigate the direct and indirect burdens connected to the overall life cycle of goods production.

TI Recent advances in Australian broiler litter utilisation
SO WORLDS POULTRY SCIENCE JOURNAL
AB The global poultry industry is undergoing many changes, one being the need for efficient disposal of its broiler litter (BL) due to a reduction in the land available for cost effective disposal. To date, Australian BL disposal has been achieved by selling the litter as a fertiliser to agricultural sectors. Research indicates BL and other poultry industry waste streams could be used as a food source for vermiculture systems, allowing the sale of vermi-cast as a biologically enhanced fertiliser and worms for protein. If this approach is economically viable then the poultry industry could reduce its environmental impact and operate more like a closed loop system. Integrated bio-systems using vermiculture, composting and waste-to-energy technologies have developed significantly overseas and have shown potential to solve many of the issues associated with poultry waste disposal.

TI Long-term assessment of waste management options - a new, integrated and
   goal-oriented approach
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Selected waste management scenarios were evaluated with regard to the goals of the Austrian Waste Management Act, taking into account long-term environmental protection and resource conservation as well as costs. Municipal solid waste (MSW) and sewage Sludge have been chosen as the system inputs. The scenarios were compared to the status-quo scenario by combining Material Flow Analysis (MFA) and economic evaluation methods. Both, welfare-oriented Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) and Modified Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (MCEA) were applied for this assessment. Unlike CBA, MCEA takes into consideration long-term impacts of landfilled material in non-monetary terms. The results of the CBA correspond to those of the MCEA. Both evaluation methods confirm: If long-term effects are taken into account with the same weight irrespective of when they occur, the Austrian goals of waste management are reached more efficiently by thermal waste treatment scenarios than by mechanical-biological treatment scenarios or by landfilling without pre-treatment.

TI Assessing the sustainable municipal solid waste (MSW) to electricity
   generation potentials in selected Pacific Small Island Developing States
   (PSIDS)
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The Pacific Small Island Developing States (PSIDS) are largely reliant on fossil fuels for electricity generations and this dependency makes these Island States immensely vulnerable to global fuel price volatility since the excess outflow of money on fuel imports not only affects the economic growth but also hinders the sustainable development. Additionally, waste management in these small countries is economically and environmentally expensive and mostly dumped in open/closed-dumps and landfills which decompose and releases notorious greenhouse gases (i.e., methane and carbon dioxide, etc.). Amalgamating these two disparate issues, this study aims to find a mutual solution by exploring the feasibility of waste-to-energy (WtE) potentials via different technologies at the selected sites. Using the population and per capita waste generation data of fifteen selected sites of eight PSIDS, a waste profile of each site is evaluated. Then, the waste generation over the projected 20 years is used to determine the electricity generation potential of each site under the proposed alternative scenarios (i.e., 2 - landfill gas to energy (LFGTE) technology, 3 - mass-burn incineration, 4 - hybrid mechanical-biological treated (MBT) anaerobic digestion (AD) and LFGTE technology, and 5 - hybrid MBT-AD and refuse-derived fuel (RDF) incineration). These four scenarios (2-5) are compared to the Business-as-Usual case denoted as scenario 1. To test the economic viability, the Net Present Value, Levelized Cost of Energy, and Payback Period of each site is ascertained. Further economic benefits are assessed through the recycling of materials including plastics (under scenario 4 only), glass, and metals (under all scenarios). Emissions and energy consumption of each scenario are analysed using the Waste Reduction Model (WARM). The outcome of this study revealed that scenario 3 offers the greatest potential in terms of electricity generation, at Port Moresby (PNG1), Papua New Guinea site having the highest potential (i.e., 78.86 GWh) and Kosrae (FSM4), Federated States of Micronesia has the lowest generation potential of only 92.86 MWh. This scenario 3 (mass-burn incineration) was also supported by the economic assessment. It was also found that recycling brought in additional economic benefits and also helped offset CO2-equivalent emissions and contributed towards energy savings. Multi-level multi-criteria decision analysis (ML-MCDA) was performed to select the most viable waste management alternative based on technical, economic, environmental, and stakeholder preferences. The priorities assigned to the respective scenarios for all fifteen sites were as such: scenario 3 > scenario 5 > scenario 4 > scenario 2 > scenario 1. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Maximizing resource efficiency: opportunities for energy recovery from
   municipal solid waste in Europe
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The integration of renewable energy sources into sustainable development practices has become increasingly important. The municipal solid waste (MSW) utilisation presents a promising renewable energy source, provided that it is combined with modern technologies to optimise its energy conversion. The global population growth and the corresponding rise in living standards have resulted in increased consumption of goods and energy. Whilst such consumption boosts economic development, it also contributes to a significant increase in waste generation. In this article, the possibility of using MSW for energy production is examined, along with an overview of the production of waste and treatment activities in the European Union (EU). Europe generates 1.66 billion tonnes of waste yearly, with construction, demolition and MSW being a major contributor. The European Commission's Waste Legislative Package aims for 60% reuse and recycling readiness by 2025 and a 65% target by 2030, focussing on landfill assessment, waste recycling promotion and other initiatives. In 2020, there were 504 waste to energy (WtE) plants in Europe with 61 million tonnes (137 kg per capita) of total incineration capacity. France has the most WtE (124) plants, whilst Germany has the highest capacity for waste incineration. The total energy produced from waste in 2019 was 41.2 MTOE (million tonnes of oil equivalent), with nearly half of that total was accounted by MSW. This includes non-renewable waste, MSW renewable and non-renewable waste and industrial waste. This statistics represents around 2.5% of the EU's overall energy supply. The majority of energy recovery is used to generate electricity in electricity-only facilities or either in combined heat and power (CHP). In 2020, there was a 69 million tonnes or 58% decline in the amount of MSW that was landfilled in the EU, which represents 4.0% decline on an annual average. Germany recycled most MSW with 66% approximated recycling rate in 2020. Only eight EU countries have recycling rates that are higher than 50%. On average, WtE plants in the EU monitor around 60% of biogenic CO2 emissions, with the remaining 40% being fossil CO2 emissions. In the light of the EU's prioritisation of the circular economy, it is imperative that all Member States, including EEA countries, shift from traditional waste disposal methods towards more intelligent waste treatment strategies, such as gasification and pyrolysis, which embody circular economy principles in their waste management policies.

TI Farm-scale thermophilic co-digestion of dairy manure with a biodiesel
   byproduct in cold regions
SO ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB Conversion of organic wastes into applicable energy sources is the best way to improve organic waste management. In this study, the performance of thermophilic co-digestion of dairy manure (DM) and crude glycerol (CG) in a 60-m(3) farm-scale biogas digester located in a cold region was investigated during the winter. Compared to the anaerobic digestion of DM alone, the methane production increased by approximately twofold during co-digestion of DM and CG. The highest methane yield was 0.323 m(3)/kgVS obtained at 4.2% (v/v) of CG. Despite the increase in methane production with organic loading rate, the methane yield of CG reduced remarkably at 2.64 kgVS(cG)/m(3)d, while the highest was at 1.32 kgVS(cG)/m(3) d. During the co-digestion, a net energy at an average of 25 kWh/d was obtained for farm operation, whereas a supply of kerosene and electricity from national grid were required for the digester and farm operations during anaerobic digestion of DM. During winter, the improvement of biogas yield through the addition of CG enabled the sustainability of a farm-scale biogas production system and reduced its environmental impact.

TI Optimal management of substrates in anaerobic co-digestion: An ant
   colony algorithm approach
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Sewage sludge (SWS) is inevitably produced in urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The treatment of SWS on site at small WWTPs is not economical; therefore, the SWS is typically transported to an alternative SWS treatment center. There is increased interest in the use of anaerobic digestion (AnD) with co-digestion as an SWS treatment alternative. Although the availability of different co-substrates has been ignored in most of the previous studies, it is an essential issue for the optimization of AnD co digestion. In a pioneering approach, this paper applies an Ant-Colony-Optimization (ACO) algorithm that maximizes the generation of biogas through AnD co-digestion in order to optimize the discharge of organic waste from different waste sources in real-time. An empirical application is developed based on a virtual case study that involves organic waste from urban WWTPs and agrifood activities. The results illustrate the dominate role of toxicity levels in selecting contributions to the AnD input. The methodology and case study proposed in this paper demonstrate the usefulness of the ACO approach in supporting a decision process that contributes to improving the sustainability of organic waste and SWS management.

TI Heavy metal accumulation in sugar beet plants grown in soil enriched
   with sewage sludge and municipal solid waste compost
SO LISTY CUKROVARNICKE A REPARSKE
AB A pot experiment was conducted to determine the effects of soil application of sewage sludge and municipal solid waste compost on the accumulation of heavy metals in sugar beet plant. Pots containing different amounts (corresponding to 75 and 150 t/ha) of sewage sludge and municipal solid waste compost were used to grow sugar beet plants under greenhouse conditions. Plant dry weight, sugar rate and Zn, Cu, Ni, Pb, Cd and Cr contents of sugar beet plant were determined after harvest. It was found that the sewage sludge and municipal solid waste compost applications brought about a sharp increase for heavy metals in the plant material. Dry matter and heavy metal contents of sugar beet were increased by increasing applications rates of sewage sludge and municipal solid waste compost. In all treatments, the concentrations of heavy metals in plants were below the phytotoxic levels. In the sewage sludge and municipal solid waste compost treatments, according to background and toxicity limits, heavy metal status of leaves were ranged in normal and high levels. But in the highest sewage sludge treatment, Pb concentrations in sugar beet were exceeded foodstuff index and limit values for edible root plants and feed crops.

AB Today population growth, economic prosperity, and urbanization have led to an increase in municipal solid waste (MSW). The higher -populated and higher -income countries generate higher amounts of MSW. Not only the MSW amount, but the MSW composition can also be diverse in different countries. This study investigates the composition of MSW generated in Bangkok compared to other Asian megacities, for example, Beijing, Tokyo, Seoul, Singapore and Hong Kong. In addition, the MSW management model integrated with the Waste -to -Energy (WtE) concept will be analyzed and compared. With Bangkok as the case study, because of a lack of regulations and public participation, there is no MSW separation at the households; hence, the MSW generated contains higher organic waste which results in less calorific value of MSW compared to other developed countries. Mixed wet MSW is the main shortcoming of WtE development. As Bangkok is the main MSW producer in Thailand, which generates more than one-fourth of the domestic MSW, the WtE project was developed in Bangkok as a demonstration plant of WtE. The 500 ton per day incineration plant coupled with a power generation unit has been constructed for sustainable MSW disposal and for energy security in the megacity.

TI Resource reclamation of municipal sewage sludge based on local
   conditions: A case study in Xi'an, China
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB With the dramatic increase in sludge resulting from rapid urbanization, the need to optimize sludge resource recovery and utilization technologies is particularly urgent. However, there is a large deviation between the optimized technologies using the optimal selection method and the actual situation. This study established an adaptation to local conditions-based sludge recovery technology evaluation mode to solve this problem. The principle of this evaluation method relies on the combination of sludge recovery and local industrial structure, focusing on the resource and energy recovery rate. The Vlsekriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR method) based on the modified entropy weighting method was developed to determine most sustainable option in the decision-making process. An evaluation index system was constructed related to sludge disposal's technical characteristics with 15 indicators under five main dimensions: environmental impact, economic impact, entropy change, resource utilization rate, and regional suitability. The new evaluation method was applied in Xi'an, China. It was found that sewage sludge recovery technologies followed the order: brick-making, cement kiln, composting, power generation, landfill, and incineration, with QJ of 0, 0.222, 0.264, 0.437, 0.598, and 1, respectively. Using brick-making, cement kiln, and composting as critical recovery processes, coupled with power generation as the supplementary process, the sewage sludge can be reasonably recovered in Xi'an, implying that the integrated recovery process achieved environmental and economic apex. The sludge recovery evaluation method based on adaptation to local conditions in this study can provide a helpful reference for municipal sludge disposal and recovery in big and medium-sized cities.

TI Rapid composting techniques in Indian context and utilization of black
   soldier fly for enhanced decomposition of biodegradable wastes - A
   comprehensive review
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB In the present scenario, solid waste management (SWM) has become one of the main concerns for urban waste managers in the developing world. This article reviews the recent trends and technologies associated with the process of composting. Utilization of black soldier fly (BSF) larvae can be one of the rapid methods for treatment of biodegradable wastes. A detailed review of the literature indicated that more importance is to be given on the pre-processing of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) which includes segregation of biodegradables, inerts, metals for preparing the requisite substrate for application of the suitable technology. In developing countries, major emphasis should be given on curtailing the environmental and health impacts caused due to improper management of MSW and for developing some innovative as well as economically feasible systems for proper handling of MSW. BSF can transform the biodegradable wastes into biofuels and byproducts at a minimal cost. The utilization of BSF for treating various organic waste (OW) has been thoroughly studied and discussed in detail. The salient observations on the factors affecting the growth of BSF larvae as well as comprehensive analysis of patents on breeding and utilization of BSF are also presented in this paper. The present review also assesses the potential of various rapid composting techniques and advocates about the planning and development of real-scale treatment systems by the researchers, environmental planners and policy makers to eradicate the problem of solid wastes.

TI Hygienisation and Nutrient Conservation of Sewage Sludge or Cattle
   Manure by Lactic Acid Fermentation
SO PLOS ONE
AB Manure from animal farms and sewage sludge contain pathogens and opportunistic organisms in various concentrations depending on the health of the herds and human sources. Other than for the presence of pathogens, these waste substances are excellent nutrient sources and constitute a preferred organic fertilizer. However, because of the pathogens, the risks of infection of animals or humans increase with the indiscriminate use of manure, especially liquid manure or sludge, for agriculture. This potential problem can increase with the global connectedness of animal herds fed imported feed grown on fields fertilized with local manures. This paper describes a simple, easy-to-use, low-tech hygienization method which conserves nutrients and does not require large investments in infrastructure. The proposed method uses the microbiotic shift during mesophilic fermentation of cow manure or sewage sludge during which gram-negative bacteria, enterococci and yeasts were inactivated below the detection limit of 3 log(10) cfu/g while lactobacilli increased up to a thousand fold. Pathogens like Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli EHEC O:157 and vegetative Clostridium perfringens were inactivated within 3 days of fermentation. In addition, ECBO-viruses and eggs of Ascaris suum were inactivated within 7 and 56 days, respectively. Compared to the mass lost through composting (15-57%), the loss of mass during fermentation (< 2.45%) is very low and provides strong economic and ecological benefits for this process. This method might be an acceptable hygienization method for developed as well as undeveloped countries, and could play a key role in public and animal health while safely closing the nutrient cycle by reducing the necessity of using energy-inefficient inorganic fertilizer for crop production.

TI Composting with additives to improve organic amendments. A review
SO AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Composting and vermicomposting are sustainable strategies to transform organic wastes into organic amendments, valuable as potting media or soil conditioner. However, the negative aspects of these processes are emissions of greenhouse gases and odorous molecules and final product potentially containing toxic compounds. These negative aspects can be limited through the addition of organic, inorganic or biological additives to the composted or vermicomposted mixture. The aims of this review are (1) to present the main characteristics of composting and vermicomposting processes with and without additives, (2) to show the influence of additives on greenhouse gas emissions during waste degradation and (3) to report the effects of additives on the properties of the final products (heavy metal and nutrient contents), in view of their use as a soil conditioner or potting media. Finally, the feasibility and potential environmental benefits of co-composting and co-vermicomposting are discussed. Our results show that additives affect composting parameters such as temperature, pH and moisture and thus have an impact on the composting process. They may be used to reduce gas emissions and mobility of mineral ions. The various additives have contrasting effects on the quality of the final product and its impact on soil quality. The use of worms and additives seems to increase plant available nutrient contents, while decreasing N leaching, heavy metal mobility and composting time. Co-composting and co-vermicomposting strategies need to be locally optimised, involving the generated amendments in a circular economy to improve sustainability of agricultural systems.

TI Nutrient recovery via struvite production from livestock
   manure-digestate streams: Towards closed loop bio-economy
SO PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
AB Phosphorous and Nitrogen are key nutrients for plants growth, usually supplemented by in the form of fertilizers. Therefore, management and utilization of these compounds in a sustainable manner for agriculture is of importance to serve the rising global demand of food. One way is to valorize agricultural wastes in many different ways like anaerobic digestion, struvite production and so on to maximize nutrient recovery and reduce wastage. Struvite recovery is one of the green marketing tools in the fertilizer industry, given the high amount of agriculture and livestock wastes produced. While struvite can be produced from a wide range of wastewater, this article provides an overview about struvite with an emphasis about its production from anaerobic digestates, manure and livestock wastewater and its prospective as a source of fertilizer. Furthermore, discussions about integration with anaerobic digestion, cost benefits and post application plant yields are reviewed to show its practicality and commercial potential. Despite constraints, struvite production promotes circular bioeconomic, sustainable process with a high nutrient recovery and this review will aid to take decisions in implementing this method in the near future.

TI Analysis of the relationship between the amount and type of MSW and
   population socioeconomic level: Bahia Blanca case study, Argentina
SO HELIYON
AB The amount and type of municipal solid waste (MSW) in Bahia Blanca (Argentina) were assessed and correlated with population socioeconomic level. In this sense, seven areas with different quality of life were selected. In addition, a parallel study on a control area was performed and validated for obtaining a representative result to provide analogous conclusions for the whole city. From this study, a combination of sorting methodologies is proposed in order to reduce the actual amount of waste sent to land fill. If these methodologies are implemented in Bahia Blanca city, MSW in land fill could be reduced at least 80%. The proposed strategy is to combine waste sorting at source and at destination. An alternative separation at source could be proposed as follows: packaging (including plastic, cans and Tetra Pak), other plastics, paper and glass. The rest of MSW could be included in a container which would be collected daily or three times a week without changing inhabitants' habits and pro- moting their collaboration. Then, it could be separated at destination for waste-to-energy, composting, and biogas obtaining. Residuals from incinerators and biogas/composting plants would be sent to land fill. On the other hand, regarding the relationship between the proposed strategy and population quality of life, obtained results from this study could be useful to size and to ef ficiently locate disposal bins/containers for source separation as well as to redesign routes of municipal solid waste collection. Also, this strategy allows to add value to different components of MSW, improving working conditions of waste workers and creating new jobs in Bahia Blanca city.

TI Characterisation and composition of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW)
   generated in Sangamner City, District Ahmednagar, Maharashtra, India
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB This paper deals with the characteristics and composition of municipal solid waste (MSW) generated in Sangamner city. The composition of solid waste was studied by segregating it into different component, i.e., kitchen waste, paper, earth and fine material, slaughter house waste, leaves, metals, etc. These components were categorised into organic waste and inorganic waste. It was observed that Sangamner city produces around 61% organic waste, and the rest is inorganic waste. The characteristics of organic solid waste, i.e., pH, electrical conductivity, moisture content, organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium were evaluated. The analysis of organic content of MSW indicates that it is good source of nutrients for the agriculture sector whereas inorganic material can be used for landfill.

TI Review on life cycle assessment of integrated solid waste management in
   some Asian countries
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The problems posed by municipal solid waste in Asia are more complex because here, most nations urbanize rapidly with about 30-50% population increase. In developing countries, the growth rate of most cities exceeds 4% per annum. The issue at stake is that the 20-40% of municipal revenues spent in most countries to manage the waste is not enough to handle the rising trend of the waste generated. The problems are multi-dimensional. In Asia for example, issues ranging from disputes, norms, health concerns have continued to create obstacles and sometimes alarming situations. This had interfered with proper decisions in managing the waste that menaces the environment at a pace faster than the modern technology itself. In the paper some of the municipal solid waste management options are reviewed in some of these Asian countries with emphasis on a life cycle assessment (LCA) to adopt an integrated approach in solving the problem. Some solid waste management options were evaluated where some viable and suitable options could be derived based on Asian approach. Therefore, sustainable scenarios are suggested for stakeholders to manage municipal solid waste properly. The results are specifically intended to be used as a basis for decisions on strategies and policies for waste management and investments for new waste treatment facilities by decision makers in local, regional and national authorities or industries in the region.

TI Biomass Energy Technological Paradigm (BETP): Trends in This Sector
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Renewable energy plays a significant role in the world for obvious environmental and economic reasons with respect to the increasing energy crisis and fossil fuel environmental problems. Biomass energy, one of the most promising renewable energy technologies, has drawn increasing attention in recent years. However, biomass technologies still vary without an integrated framework. Considering the theory of a technological paradigm and implementing a literature analysis, biomass technological development was found to follow a three-stage technological paradigm, which can be divided into: BETP (biomass energy technological paradigm) competition, BETP diffusion, and BETP shift. Further, the literature review indicates that waste, like municipal solid waste (MSW), has the potential to be an important future trend in the world and waste-to-energy (WTE) is designed for sustainable waste management. Among WTE, anaerobic digestion has the potential to produce energy from waste sustainably, safely, and cost-effectively. The new BETP technological framework proposed in this paper may offer new research ideas and provide a significant reference for scholars.

TI A comprehensive review on anaerobic digestion of organic fraction of
   municipal solid waste
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB This article aims to comprehensively review the anaerobic digestion (AD) process utilising the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) substrate. The AD of OFMSW has received considerable attention due to its significant energy and nutrient recovery as well as its greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation potential. AD is a biological process involving treating and stabilising organic matter in the absence of oxygen accomplished by a consortium of microorganisms and occurs under hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis phases. The hydrolysis phase is recognised as the primary rate-limiting step. Thus, exploring the ways to speed up the hydrolysis process will maximise biogas production. The key factors affecting the digestion efficiency include feedstock quality, pre-treatment process, design and selection of digestion process and process conditions including pH, temperature, carbon to nitrogen (C: N) ratio, organic loading rate and hydraulic retention time. The review reveals that solid-state anaerobic digestion (SSAD) is best suited for OFMSW due to its high solid concentration (>15%) and better process performance. The continuous digestion with thermophilic temperatures was found to be the best condition for high solid AD process. The plug flow and continuous stir tank reactors were the best performing options to control the biological conditions for the digestate post-treatment. Proper selection of the parameters for the whole process is crucial in ensuring process feasibility and economic sustainability of AD of OFMSW. The study revealed that the AD of OFMSW could play a significant role to mitigate waste and waste-related problems.

AB India generates nearly 62 million tons of MSW annually that creates huge problems in the environment. Small number of initiatives of waste treatment, e.g., incineration, pyrolysis, bio-refining & biogas plants, composting, recycling and SLFs are available in the country. For the sustainable Solid Waste Management (SWM), an inclusive improvement policy and paradigm shift is necessary. SBM (SBM), flagged off on October 2, 2014, is considered as a paradigm shift in Indian SWM movement. SBM is the country's biggest-ever cleanliness drive costing over 10,600 million USD for 5 years in 4,041 towns in which SWM considered as one of the six components. One of the stated objectives of SBM is to ensure door-to-door garbage collection and proper disposal of municipal solid waste in all the 83,000 wards in urban areas by 2019. Swachh Bharat citizen communities were formed subsequently to generate awareness and citizen participation. Since then, over a period of 12 months, over 335,000 citizens have become part of the various Swachh Bharat citizen communities across more than 100 cities of India. The study reviews the present status and sustainability of the activities undertaken and proposes some improvement scopes in the schemes under the SB mission for effective SWM in India. The study will definitely help in revisiting the scheme periodically for continual improvement. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper presents an insight into benefits of organic waste recycling through composting over landfill on municipal solid waste management in Phnom Penh, in terms of greenhouse gases (GHGs) mitigation. Future waste generation from 2003 to 2020 was forecasted and four scenarios of organic waste recycling were carried out. Organic waste food and garden waste were used for composting and the remaining waste was landfilled. The recycling scenarios were set based on organic waste generated from difference sources; scenario 1: no recycling, scenario 2: household organic waste; scenario 3: market, restaurant, school and hotel organic waste, and scenario 4: all generated organic waste. The results showed that MSW generation in MPP increased significantly from about 0.24 million ton in 2003 to 0.41 million ton in 2010 and was projected to reach 1.02 million tons in 2020. Composting gave better benefit than landfill. It could reduce GHGs emission of 36.2%, 12.8% and 65.0% from scenario 2, scenario 3 and scenario 4 compared with scenario 1 (all generated waste is landfilled), respectively. These percentages reflect the amount of GHGs emission of 3.23, 1.14 and 5.79 million tons CO(2)eq from the above respective scenarios. Hence, composting could be a potential GHGs mitigation option for MPP.

AB The present study aimed to develop a life cycle assessment (LCA) study of municipal solid waste management in Vera Cruz, RS, Brazil, to evaluate conventional waste management system, sorting of recyclable materials and composting treatment; integrated waste management with sorting of recyclable and composting facilities; optimised integrated waste management for recyclable and composting assumptions (80% and 85%, respectively). Results show that in the optimised integrated waste management, it is possible to reduce impacts in the global warming and acidification categories by 65% and 52%, respectively, whereas intermediate scenarios are projected to reduce these impacts by lesser amounts. Transportation and the final destination of the waste are among the waste management stages with the greatest environmental impacts. This LCA can quantify the magnitude of potential environmental impacts and may be used in decision-making process to identify the best scenario management.

   MANAGEMENT
AB Anaerobic digestion (AD) for biogas production forms one of the fundamental building blocks of the bioeconomy, and a research programme has been under way in Northern Ireland, which culminated in the publication of a Biogas Research Action Plan 2020 in 2014. One important element of this programme was the identification of the need for an evidence base for the potential bioresource feedstocks. This paper reports the outputs of the quantification of feedstocks for AD research, which has identified the organic feedstocks available for biogas production on a regional basis and categorised these as: organic (biodegradable) fraction of municipal solid waste, sewage sludge, organic industrial and commercial wastes, manure from livestock, food wastes and energy crops. The research study further quantified the biogas and energy potential of these feedstocks and possible reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The limitations of the research study are acknowledged and opportunities to address these and build on and extend the study are identified, including feedstocks for other bioeconomy processes and the application and further development of the biorefinery concept.

TI A review on technological options of waste to energy for effective
   management of municipal solid waste
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Approximately one-fourth population across the world rely on traditional fuels (kerosene, natural gas, biomass residue, firewood, coal, animal dung, etc.) for domestic use despite significant socioeconomic and technological development. Fossil fuel reserves are being exploited at a very fast rate to meet the increasing energy demands, so there is a need to find alternative sources of energy before all the fossil fuel reserves are depleted. Waste to energy (WTE) can be considered as a potential alternative source of energy, which is economically viable and environmentally sustainable. The present study reviewed the current global scenario of WTE technological options (incineration, pyrolysis, gasification, anaerobic digestion, and landfilling, with gas recovery) for effective energy recovery and the challenges faced by developed and developing countries. This review will provide a framework for evaluating WTE technological options based on case studies of developed and developing countries. Unsanitary landfilling is the most commonly practiced waste disposal option in the developing countries. However, developed countries have realised the potential of WTE technologies for effective municipal solid waste management (MSWM). This review will help the policy makers and the implementing authorities involved in MSWM to understand the current status, challenges and barriers for effective management of municipal solid waste. This review concluded WTE as a potential renewable source of energy, which will partly meet the energy demand and ensure effective MSWM. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Bioenergy II: Bio-Ethanol from Municipal Solid Waste (MSW): The UK
   Potential and Implication for Sustainable Energy and Waste Management
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL REACTOR ENGINEERING
AB This paper investigates the feasibility of using municipal solid waste (MSW) as biomass substrates for bioethanol production. MSW are categorised into three types: paper and card, kitchen organics, and green organics. MSW data are collected from UK Department of Environment, food and rural affairs (DEFRA). Characterisations of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin contents have shown that MSW has high potential as biomass source. Experimental work on waste characterisation and MSW-to-ethanol conversion has been carried out in laboratory. The experimental results have shown that more than 85% of the cellulose from the waste can be converted to glucose which can be easily fermented to ethanol production. This MSW-to-ethanol process provides an alternative solution for both biomass resources for cost reduction and preventing organic fraction of municipal solid waste going into landfill.
   Projected estimates of waste to ethanol bases on London (UK) as a case study are made. Recommendation on both sustainable waste management and biofuel production are developed based on the result findings.

TI Global warming potential and economic performance of gasification-based
   chemical recycling and incineration pathways for residual municipal
   solid waste treatment in Germany
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Chemical recycling could facilitate the transition from a linear to a circular carbon economy, where carboncontaining waste is channeled back into the production cycle as a chemical feedstock instead of being incinerated or landfilled. However, the predominant focus on technological aspects of chemical recycling for plastic waste narrows evaluations of its potential in contributing to such a transition. Moreover, it leads to significant controversy about its role in the waste hierarchy as a possible competitor to mechanical recycling. To address these gaps in the literature, this study assesses ecological and economic impacts associated with chemical recycling of residual municipal solid waste in Germany. Combining approaches of life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis, chemical recycling and conventional incineration-based treatment pathways are comparatively evaluated in terms of global warming potential and economic performance (i.e. fixed capital investment, net present value, dynamic payback period, and levelized cost of carbon abatement). Results indicate that compared to incineration-based conventional pathways, chemical recycling can contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in low-emission energy systems. However, the economic performance of chemical recycling is highly dependent on its scale of operation. Additionally, a price premium for recycling products as well as economic instruments for penalizing CO2 emissions are identified to play important roles in the economic performance of chemical recycling.

SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Waste generation is steadily growing in developing countries such as India due to the continuous growth of industrialization, urbanization, and population. Mismanagement of municipal solid waste (MSW) not only has negative environmental effects but also causes the risk to public health and raises some other socio-economic issues that are worth discussions. Therefore, it is essential to urgently enhance the handling of waste collection, segregation, and safe disposal. Waste-to-energy (WtE) technologies such as pyrolysis, gasification, incineration, and biomethanation can convert MSW, as an appropriate source of renewable energy, into useful energy (electricity and heat) in safe and eco-friendly ways. This review aims at (1) describing the challenges of MSW management, (2) summarizing the health significance of MSW management, (3) explaining the opportunities and requirements of energy recovery from MSW through WtE technologies, (4) explaining several WtE technologies in detail, and (5) discussing the current status of WtE technologies in India. The paper also discusses the challenges to WtE projects in India. Moreover, a number of recommendations are provided for improving the currently implemented solid waste management (SWM) in the Indian context. This review has the potential of helping scholars, researchers, authorities, and stakeholders working on MSW management to make effective decisions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI ENERGY POTENTIAL FROM MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE (MSW) FOR A DEVELOPING
   METROPOLIS
SO JOURNAL OF THERMAL ENGINEERING
AB In many developing cities around the world, the shortage of energy and environmental degradation are currently two vital issues affecting sustainable development. The migration of people from villages to one of Africa's rapidly growing city Lagos, Nigeria has led to the generation of tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) daily. This is one of the important contributors to environmental degradation. Harnessing the useful potential of MSW for power generation adopting the incineration technology will enhance the intermittent power supply and also help with waste management, which has threatening effect on the populace. Therefore this paper focuses on energy stored in waste generated and the power potential of this MSW through an energy recovery method to generate other forms of energy for use has an alternative energy. From the waste characterization exercise, the main components of the Lagos MSW were found to be food, metal and plastic; making the average moisture content of the MSW high. It was illustrated from analysis that a high power potential of over 10,000 MW can be obtained adopting the incineration process, starting with data from 2016 with an exponential increase over the years.

TI Comparative life cycle analysis of municipal waste management systems:
   Kirklareli/Turkey case study
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Waste-to-energy approaches are becoming increasingly important around the world, and municipal solid waste (MSW) as a renewable and sustainable energy source is of great importance to be considered in preventing climate change. On the other hand, since uncontrolled MSW is a threat to the environment and human health, sustainable municipal solid waste management should be evaluated to reduce negative environmental impacts. In this study, various municipal solid waste management options having energy production were selected and analysed by using SimaPro 9.0.0.49 to determine the most environmentally friendly waste management system. One-ton MSW in Kirklareli/Turkey was chosen as the functional unit. Environmental impacts were calculated via the CLM-IA method; impact groups were abiotic depletion, abiotic depletion (fossil fuels), global warming, ozone layer depletion, human toxicity, freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecotoxicities, photochemical oxidation, acidification and eutrophication. The first results indicated that energy recovery reduces the environmental impacts and future waste management plant of Kirklareli (material separation for recycling, biomethanisation and landfilling) is the best option within the scope of the environment at present.

TI A triple bottom line evaluation of solid waste management strategies: a
   case study for an arid Gulf State, Kuwait
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT
AB We extend a life cycle assessment (LCA) embracing both economic and social perspectives to develop an integrated solid waste management system for Kuwait. This study considers the domestic waste generated by households and waste generated commercially. Six municipal solid waste (MSW) scenarios (SR1, SR2, aEuro broken vertical bar, SR6) are evaluated using a triple bottom line (TBL) approach that incorporates environmental, financial, and social bottom lines (social BLs).
   Within the TBL framework, the environmental BL employs LCA in accordance with ISO 14044. The financial BL is calculated using capital and operational costs as well as the associated recycling revenues. The social BL applies macro-economic indicators that examine the effects of a given MSW scenario (SR) on the inhabitants. To integrate the TBLs, we apply an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) because of its advantage of pairwise unit-free rescaling. The relative importance of each BL is determined by considering the political, legal, socio-cultural, and economic climates of the country. The relative weights are cross-multiplied with indicators from each BL to calculate a composite sustainability index (CSI) for the proposed MSW SR.
   The environmental BL (LCA) indicates that global warming, acidification, and human toxicity are the most adversely affected impact categories, considering the local conditions and waste composition. Environmentally, SR1 (landfilling) scored the worst in almost all impact categories and, thus, was labeled the worst-case scenario environmentally. SR6 (composting, recycling, and incineration) performed the best from an environmental perspective. Financially, landfilling (SR1) is the most economical scenario. Any SR that focused on incineration (SR2 and SR5) was financially unfavorable. The scenarios that involved composting were scored as financially reasonable (SR3, SR4, and SR6). From a social acceptability perspective, SR2 (incineration) scored the highest, while SR1 (landfills) scored the lowest. Finally, across the TBL framework, SR4 (composting and incineration) had the highest CSI based on the relative importance scheme adopted for each BL.
   Although they are often overlooked in most LCA studies, the financial and social aspects are indispensable to proving feasibility and credibility at a strategic level. The complexity of financial and social formulations in LCA is inherited from the difficulty in quantifying emissions and other impacts. In addition, from a social perspective, the contingent risks and associated uncertainty vary widely across cultures, ideologies, and degrees of development and are further complicated because of the scarcity and uncertainty of the data.

TI Influence of phase separation, leachate recycle and aeration on
   treatment of municipal solid waste in simulated landfill cells
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB Decomposition in landfills is erratic and influenced primarily by moisture, inoculum, oxygen and accumulation of inhibitory fermentation products. These parameters may be optimized for decomposition by use of controlled landfill cells or bioreactors. This work evaluated the effect of combined-phase and two-phase anaerobic digestion of municipal solid waste (MSW) in laboratory leachbed (LB) cells. Phase separation resulted in increased rates of decomposition and greater process stability. Leachate recycle with an upflow sludge anaerobic reactor resulted in improvement of performance in a LB reactor which was attributed to removal of inhibitory fermentation products and buffering of acids in the leachate. The effects of aeration and leachate flooding of the LB were also studied. Intermittent aeration of the LB enhanced phase separation but inhibition of methanogenesis was not sustainable beyond six days. Conversion of organic matter was similar in the anaerobic and aerated LBs. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Implementing separate waste collection and mechanical biological waste
   treatment in South Africa: A comparison with Austria and England
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The degradation of organic compounds found in municipal solid waste (MSW) under the anaerobic land-fill conditions produces gas and liquid emissions that can protract well into the landfill after-care period. The European Landfill Directives regulate the amount and nature of the organic compounds disposed into landfills. In South Africa and other developing countries, MSW is still landfilled without any kind of pretreatment. This paper presents a pilot project of mechanical biological waste treatment (MBWT) in South Africa implemented at municipal level in the city of Durban using passively aerated open windrows. Based on case studies from Austria, England and South Africa, a waste minimisation model which can facilitate full-scale implementation of MBWT in developing countries is presented. MSW was treated in open windrows for 8 weeks. Composting temperature reached a maximum of 65 degrees C in less than 10 days. The results of eluate tests on waste samples from the windrows at the end of composting show a reduction of BOD5 and BOD5/COD ratios equal to 35.7% and 16.7%, respectively. The percent waste composition of the treated MSW was 28.3% putrescibles, 17.4% garden refuse, 13.3% plastic, 12.4% fabrics, 12% paper and other elements. The waste composition shows that more than 40% of un-treated organic material and also more than 40% non-biodegradable and recyclable materials are still landfilled without any form of biological treatment or resource recovery. A simple wet and dry waste collection model can promote recycling, treatment of biological waste before landfilling, resource recovery, labour intensive jobs and hence sustainable landfilling in the South African scenario as well as in similar developing countries.

TI Waste hierarchy index for circular economy in waste management
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The aim of current European Union waste management directives is to promote prevention of waste and the application of a waste management hierarchy: preparing for reuse, recycling, other recovery, and disposal. The Waste Framework Directive only measures the waste operations recycling, incineration, and landfill individually, not measuring the implementation of the waste hierarchy principle in Member States of the European Union. The present study proposes a waste hierarchy index (WHI) to measure the waste hierarchy within a circular economy context, applied to municipal solid waste. In developing the WHI, recycling and preparing for reuse, as defined by Eurostat, were considered as positive contributors to the circular economy, and incineration and landfill as negative contributors. The WHI was applied at different geographic scales (local and national levels) to verify its potential and limitations. The WHI is a direct and concise indicator that provides a holistic perspective on how waste is being managed. The WHI is more than a source of waste statistics; it is the beginning of a real discussion about how waste statistics should be managed to reach a circular economy through the implementation of waste hierarchy.

TI Mapping incinerability of municipal solid waste in Indian sub-continent
SO CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
AB Effective municipal solid waste (MSW) management is essential for sustainable development of a region. Waste management strategies are, consequently, aimed at waste minimisation with material and energy recovery. Rising MSW generation rates, acute shortage of land resources and improving thermal characteristics have collectively contributed to the growth of waste-to-energy sector in developing countries like India. Negligible source segregation and the resultant heterogeneity of the MSW necessitate ascertaining its incinerability to assess the feasibility of the technology. Incinerability index or i-Index is, hence, used to estimate the incinerability of MSW generated in cities across the Indian sub-continent. An incinerability-based map is developed to illustrate the variations in incinerability across the country. The lifestyle habits, topography, income level of the residents, culture and food habits are found to affect the composition and in turn the incinerability. The variations in incinerability of MSW generated in the northern, southern, eastern and western regions are graphically identified using incinerability plot or i-Plot. The reported power generation potential from MSW in Indian states is also found to be consistent with the incinerability of the MSW feed and the daily waste generation rates.

TI In-depth analysis of the effect of catalysts on plasma technologies for
   treatment of various wastes
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Energy security and waste management are gaining global attention. The modern world is producing a large amount of liquid and solid waste as a result of the increasing population and industrialization. A circular economy encourages the conversion of waste to energy and other value-added products. Waste processing requires a sustainable route for a healthy society and clean environment. One of the emerging solutions for waste treatment is plasma technology. It converts waste into syngas, oil, and char/slag depending on the thermal/nonthermal processes. Most of all the types of carbonaceous wastes can be treated by plasma processes. The addition of a catalyst to the plasma process is a developing field as plasma processes are energy intensive. This paper covers the detailed concept of plasma and catalysis. It comprises various types of plasma (non-thermal and thermal) and catalysts (zeolites, oxides, and salts) which have been used for waste treatment. Catalyst addition improves gas yield and hydrogen selectivity at moderate temperatures. Depending on the properties of the catalyst and type of plasma, comprehensive points are listed for the selection of the right catalyst for a plasma process. This review offers an in-depth analysis of the research in the field of waste-to-energy using plasmacatalytic processes.

TI Sewage sludge-highland barley straw composting in the Tibetan plateau:
   an experimental and simulative study
SO BIOMASS CONVERSION AND BIOREFINERY
AB The huge output of sewage sludge (SS) has become a severe issue for the vulnerable environment of the Tibetan plateau. Composting is a considerable way to answer the SS yield increment and recycle the nutrients. However, the application of composting is limited by the oxygen-deficient environment in Tibet. In this study, the feasibility of applying composting to Tibet was investigated by experiment and simulation. The SS and highland barley straw (HBS) composting was conducted under different aeration rates (ARs). Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and germination index (GI) analysis were applied to assess the maturity and stability. Moreover, a water-waste-nutrient nexus model was established on the basis of experimental data and the actual environmental conditions to estimate the environmental impacts and the economic value of composting in Tibet. The experimental results showed that best performance was obtained when AR was 0.42 L min(-1) kg(-1) in the initial stage and 0.69 L min(-1) kg(-1) in the thermophilic stage. The modelling results showed that applying the compost as a soil amendment could effectively reduce the application of chemical fertilizer, as well as N (12.66%) and P (7.14%) loss from the farmland soil. The annual economic benefit of applying SS/HBS compost fertilizer was 4.53E + 5 CNY (7.02E + 4 $), which correspondingly increased as the SS yield increased. The results provided reliable references for the application of composting in Tibet, and the nexus model offered an effective way to assess the economic potential of composting, which supported the decision making of waste treatment and nutrient recovery in Tibet.

TI Revisiting estimates of municipal solid waste generation per capita and
   their reliability
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Per capita municipal solid waste (MSW) generation, a core indicator of environmental pressure, is a useful measure for evaluating the intensity of waste generation over time and comparing the intensities among cities or countries. We provide an overview of global data on MSW generation per capita at the national and local levels. Although the legal definition of MSW varies from country to country, we conceptualize MSW simply as the waste managed by or for municipalities as a public service. We note the current challenges in estimating MSW generation per capita in developing countries, including a lack of equipment (e.g., weighbridges), lower rates of MSW collection efficiency, and rural-urban migration, all of which may have negative effects on data reliability. Incomplete data compilation systems at the national level also result in lower reliability and reduce the comparability of national data. We suggest technical solutions for estimating MSW generation per capita at the local and national levels to improve reliability and comparability of data.

TI Discussion on methods to include prevention activities in waste
   management LCA
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT
AB Waste prevention has been assigned increasing attention worldwide during recent years, and it is expected to become one of the core elements of waste management planning in the near future. In this framework, this paper presents and discusses two possible LCA approaches for the evaluation of the environmental and energetic performance of municipal solid waste (MSW) management systems which include the effects of waste prevention activities.
   The two approaches are conceived for the comparison of waste management scenarios including waste prevention activities with baseline scenarios without waste prevention. For both of them, the functional unit is defined and the system boundaries are described with reference to different typologies of waste prevention activities identified in an extensive review. The procedure for the calculation of the LCA impacts of scenarios is also reported and an example illustrating the processes to be included in system boundaries for a specific waste prevention activity is provided.
   The presented approaches lead to the same result in terms of difference between the LCA impacts of a waste prevention scenario and of a baseline one. However, because of the partially different upstream system boundaries, different values of the impacts of single scenarios are obtained and the application of the two approaches is more suitable in different situations and in analyses with different purposes. The methodological aspects that can complicate the applicability of the two approaches are discussed lastly.
   The environmental and energetic performance of MSW management scenarios including waste prevention activities can be evaluated with the two LCA approaches presented in this paper. They can be used for many purposes such as, among the most general, evaluating the upstream and downstream environmental consequences of implementing particular waste prevention activities in a given waste management system, complementing waste reduction indicators with LCA-based indicators and supporting with quantitative evidence the strategic and policy relevance of waste prevention.

TI Innovation in solid waste management through Clean Development Mechanism
   in India and other countries
SO PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
AB This paper focuses on the potential of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) for Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) management in India. About 350 MSW projects are implemented through CDM across 56 countries. The maximum MSW management CDM projects are implemented in China (102) followed by Brazil (45) and Mexico (28). Fourteen countries registered two projects individually and twenty-three countries registered a single project individually. About 22 CDM projects for MSW management are registered in India. The annual estimated emission reduction from these 22 projects is 1,467,371 ton CO(2)e/annum. Approved large-scale methodology (AM0025) and approved small-scale methodology (AMS III.F) are the most widely used methodologies. The highest numbers of projects are registered in the state of Delhi. These CDM projects use technologies viz. refuse-derived fuel pelletization, landfill capture, biogas generation, and composting. These technologies assist in reducing pollutants and landfill space, and generating energy and useful by-products. Policy and barriers for MSW management in India are highlighted and plans for implementation of more CDM projects are proposed. Though physical, operational, regulatory, and socio-economic challenges exist for MSW management, India should make the best use of the opportunity that CDM offers and develop projects to benefit in terms of finance, technology and sustainable development.

TI Comprehensive analysis of municipal solid waste rejected fractions as a
   source of Refused Derived Fuel in developing countries (case study of
   Isfahan- Iran): Environmental Impact and sustainable development
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB Refused Derived Fuel (RDF) could be considered as an alternative energy source, which not only helps to improve waste management, but also effectively reduce energy consumption and environmental pollution in huge industries. In the present study, the potential of energy valorization of rejected streams of municipal solid waste (MSW) processed in Isfahan mechanical and biological treatment (MBT) plant is investigated through RDF production. Therefore, various physical and chemical analysis of mechanical treatment rejects (MTR) and composting rejects (CR), as two streams being currently landfilled, were carried out. The results show that, RDF produced from both of these two streams could be classified as net calorific value (NCV): 3, Cl: 1 and Hg: 1 according to the European committee for standardization (CEN standard). Considering the amount of produced RDF from these two streams in Isfahan (300t/d from MTR and 120 t/d from CR) and their NCVs, about 2 million GJ/year would be saved. As a result, in many cities of developing countries with the same condition like Isfahan, MTR and CR can be used as sources of RDF production and alternative fuels in the cement industry.

TI Economic and environmental review of Waste-to-Energy systems for
   municipal solid waste management in medium and small municipalities
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The application of Directive 2008/98/CE on Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) implies the need to introduce technologies to generate energy from waste. Incineration, the most widely used method, is difficult to implement in low populated areas because it requires a large amount of waste to be viable (100,000 tons per year). This paper analyses the economic and environmental costs of different MSW-to-Energy technologies (WtE) in an area comprising of 13 municipalities in southern Spain. We analyse anaerobic digestion (Biomethanization), the production of solid recovered fuel (SRF) and gasification, and compare these approaches to the present Biological Mechanical Treatment (BMT) with elimination of the reject in landfill, and incineration with energy recovery. From an economic standpoint the implementation of WtE systems reduces the cost of running present BMT systems and incineration; gasification presents the lowest value. From the environmental standpoint, Life Cycle Assessment shows that any WtE alternatives, including incineration, present important advantages for the environment when compared to BMT. Finally, in order to select the best alternative, a multi-criteria method is applied, showing that anaerobic digestion is the optimal solution for the area studied. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI A review of the impact of conductive materials on antibiotic resistance
   genes during the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge and animal manure
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB The urgent need to reduce the environmental burden of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) has become even more apparent as concerted efforts are made globally to tackle the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. Con-cerning levels of ARGs abound in sewage sludge and animal manure, and their inadequate attenuation during conventional anaerobic digestion (AD) compromises the safety of the digestate, a nutrient-rich by-product of AD commonly recycled to agricultural land for improvement of soil quality. Exogenous ARGs introduced into the natural environment via the land application of digestate can be transferred from innocuous environmental bacteria to clinically relevant bacteria by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and may eventually reach humans through food, water, and air. This review, therefore, discusses the prospects of using carbon-and iron-based conductive materials (CMs) as additives to mitigate the proliferation of ARGs during the AD of sewage sludge and animal manure. The review spotlights the core mechanisms underpinning the influence of CMs on the resistome profile, the steps to maximize ARG attenuation using CMs, and the current knowledge gaps. Data and information gathered indicate that CMs can profoundly reduce the abundance of ARGs in the digestate by easing selective pressure on ARGs, altering microbial community structure, and diminishing HGT.

TI Renewable municipal solid waste pathways for energy generation and
   sustainable development in the Nigerian context
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
AB The continued concerns over energy prices, increase in population, and climate change issues have led towards a need for alternative and new energy sources. Municipal solid waste (MSW) is generally accepted as a renewable energy resource. This research study presents a techno-economic assessment potential to utilize the energy obtainable from MSW for the generation of electrical power. The assessment was carried out for energy generation by thermochemical (incineration or combustion) and biochemical (landfilling and anaerobic digestion) processes and based on the available data from seven selected municipalities. Due to the broad scope of this topic, life cycle impact of waste management, social acceptance, policy aspects, and emission reduction or fossil fuel offset are not considered and are not part of the assessment. Results presented in tabular form indicate, for example, that the price of steam generated by a fluidized steam generator is in the range of US$0.018/kWh(t) (Lagos) to US$0.044/kWh (Nsukka) and compares favorably with the typical cost of steam at US$0.015/kWh. Electrical power generation using a combined heat and power plant provides electricity at a cost that is in the range of US$0.017/kWh(e) (Lagos) to US$0.040/kWh(e) (Nsukka) and also compares well with the typical cost of electricity in Nigeria at US$0.14/kWh(e) (as of 2012).

TI Life-cycle assessment and geospatial analysis of integrating microalgae
   cultivation into a regional economy
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Microalgae have been recognised as promising feedstock for a bioeconomy. Currently, their environmental sustainability is constrained by a high energy-demand for cultivation, as well as by the provision of carbon dioxide and nutrients. This study evaluates the potential of alternative supply chains based on available waste-streams. For this, the microalgae cultivation process is coupled with anaerobic digestion processes. Consequential life-cycle assessment is applied to compare four different substrates (municipal biowaste, sewage sludge, cattle and swine manure) in three different process designs with a reference scenario using conventional supply chains. A geospatial analysis of the substrate availability was performed to identify the potential for integrated microalgal cultivation facilities. The results indicated that sewage sludge, as well as cattle and swine manure, reduce the environmental burden of microalgae cultivation. It was further found, that cattle stock and the capacities of urban wastewater treatment plants are the most important indicators for the possibility of integrating microalgae cultivation into regional economies.

AB The success of waste management requires accurate data on generation and composition of waste which is pivotal for the decisions towards the appropriate waste management system. At present there is no data available on Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) generation and composition collected systematically in Oman. Hence, this preliminary study was conducted in Al-Multaqaa landfill, the only engineered landfill functioning in Oman. The main objective of this study is to determine the generation rate and composition of municipal solid waste with the intention of providing base line data for development of municipal solid waste management system. The samples were collected from the landfill in two different seasons, in summer and winter. The collected sample was sorted out into various components. Subsequently, the weight and volume of each component were measured and recorded. The daily generation of MSW works out to be 0.97 Kg /day/person by weight, 3.113 x 10(-3) m(3)/day/person by volume with a density of 311.73 Kg/m(3). The study results reveal that the MSW stream has the largest proportion of biodegradable and recyclable waste. If waste management options such as composting, recycling and energy recovery are to be practiced in the future, there is a greater possibility of reducing substantial amount of waste stream getting disposed to the landfill.

TI HCB dechlorination combined with heavy metals immobilization in MSWI fly
   ash by using n-Al/CaO dispersion mixture
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB Municipal solid waste incineration fly ash (MSWI-FA) has been strictly controlled as hazardous waste globally Keywords: because it contains various heavy metals and dioxins. This study prepared a nanometallic Al/CaO (n-Al/CaO) n-Al/CaO dispersion mixture via ball-milling as a reductive stabilization reagent for the simultaneous immobilization of Municipal solid waste incineration fly ash heavy metals and detoxification of POPs like substance in MSWI-FA. Under optimal conditions, Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr, Simultaneous decontamination Ni, and Pb had been significantly immobilized (over 99.9 %) and the leaching concentration of Zn, Cd, Cr, Ni, HCB dechlorination and Pb were below the detectable limit. Simultaneously, 82.43 % of HCB can be destructed into alkanes and Heavy metal amorphous carbon. The porous structure of the fly ash and alkaline surface of n-Al/CaO promoted the adsorption and cracking of HCB. The highly active n-Al/CaO interacted with water as the hydrogen donor to promote the reductive dechlorination process. Hydrocalumite was a new mineral formed from the adsorption and complexation of heavy metal. Therefore, n-Al/CaO can strengthen the control of heavy metals in the S/S treatment of MSWI-FA, effectively detoxify chlorinated organics, and reduce environmental health risks.

TI Leaching potential of stabilized fly ash from the incineration of
   municipal solid waste with a new polymer
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The presence of toxic metals in municipal solid waste incineration fly ash is of great concern due to their leaching potential in landfills. To prevent groundwater or soil contamination caused by metal leaching from fly ash, recently the Chinese government began to require that the leachate concentrations of toxic metals not only satisfied the GB 16889-2008 criteria prior to landfilling but also introduced a series of measures to monitor the groundwater quality in the landfill site and its adjacent areas (GB/T 18772-2017). The stringent hazardous waste measures for pollution control on landfill sites of municipal solid waste demand the development of more efficient chemical stabilizers. To this end, a novel type of chemical stabilizer, a dithiocarboxylate functionalized polymer (TEM_CSSNa) was fabricated. Its efficiency for stabilizing toxic metals was evaluated at different dosages over a range of pH values. To compare with traditional stabilizers, sodium sulfide (Na2S) and thiourea (Tu) were also studied. The results showed that TEM_CSSNa-stabilized fly ash could satisfy the criteria at a dosage of only 3%, while those for Na2S and Tu were around 10%. In addition, this new polymer retained its stabilizing efficiency over a broad pH range. After TEM_CSSNa stabilization treatment, approximately 40-65% of the metals existed in the residual fraction, whereas only 35-55% were converted to the residual fraction using Na2S and Tu stabilization. The formation of a geochemically stable phase reduced the mobility of toxic metals and therefore diminished their leaching potential in landfills.

TI Factors influencing source separation intention and willingness to pay
   for improving waste management in Bangkok, Thailand
SO SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
AB Source separation for recycling has been recognized as a way to achieve sustainable municipal solid waste (MSW) management. However, most developing countries including Thailand have been facing with lack of recycling facilities and low level of source separation practice. By employing questionnaire surveys, this study investigated Bangkok residents' source separation intention and willingness to pay (WTP) for improving MSW service and recycling facilities (n = 1076). This research extended the theory of planned behavior to explore the effects of both internal and external factors. The survey highlighted perceived inconvenience and mistrust on MSW collection being major barriers to carrying out source separation in Bangkok. Promoting source separation at workplace may possibly create spill-over effect to people's intention to recycle their waste at home. Both subjective norms and knowledge on MSW situation were found to be a positive correlation with Bangkok residents' source separation intention and WTP (p < 0.001). Besides, the average WTP values are higher than the existing rate of waste collection service, which shows that Bangkok residents have preference for recycling programs. However, the WTP figures are still much lower than the average MSW management cost. These findings suggest that Bangkok Metropolitan Administration targets improving people knowledge on waste problems that could have adverse impact on the economy and well-being of Bangkok residents and improve its MSW collection service as these factors have positive influence on residents' WTP.

AB Worldwide solid waste generation is nearly 1.3billion tonnes/year, whereas in India 62million tonnes of solid waste is generated per year by 377million urban people. The increasing amount of solid waste in India, nearly 50% of which is organic matter, is the major concern for treatment and waste management. Several technologies are already in practice for the treatment of organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) in India. It is important to assess the sustainability of these processes. In this study, the existing OFMSW technologies in India were examined. Case-study approach was taken for this purpose along with some published secondary reports. It was found that the selection of technology quite depends on the composition of the OFMSW. Food waste rich fractions are recommended for biomethanation, whereas the fractions rich in market waste and household waste are suitable for composting. Fractions rich in lignin and lignocellulosic materials are suitable for pyrolysis and gasification, whereas the rejects are to be sent for RDF preparation. Based on the findings, a sustainable framework has also been proposed, implementation of which may result in better waste management.

TI The impact of prices and pricing units on residual and organic waste:
   Evidence from Wallonia, Belgium
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Waste pricing is important to encourage households to reduce their waste and to increase sorting and recycling. Pricing instruments include differentiated prices for the waste fractions collected and the choice of an appropriate pricing unit (volume, weight, levy). In this paper, we test the effectiveness of those different instruments using an original and complete dataset from Wallonia (the southern region of Belgium), covering 10 years and all the 262 municipalities of the region. Our approach is to estimate the sensitivity of households' production of residual and organic waste to prices i.e., the price elasticities, using sophisticated econometric techniques to control for the endogeneity of prices. For residual waste, we show a significant own-price elasticity, which is higher when organic waste is not collected at the curbside. For organic waste, we found an important and significant cross-price elasticity, but a limited own-price elasticity. Hence, the privileged instrument to encourage waste reduction and sorting should be the price of residual waste. Finally, we show that the weight-based pricing system contributes substantially to the reduction of residual waste.

TI Greening MSW management systems by saving footprint: The contribution of
   the waste transportation
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) management constitutes a highly challenging issue to cope with in order of moving towards more sustainable urban policies. Despite new Standards call for recycling and reusing materials contained in the urban waste, several municipalities still use landfilling as a waste disposal method. Other than the environmental pressure exerted by these plants, waste transportation from the collection points to the landfill needs a specific attention to correctly assess the whole burden of the waste management systems.
   In this paper, the Ecological Footprint (EF) indicator is applied to the actual MSW of the city of Palermo (Sicily). Results show that the effects produced by the involved transportation vehicles are not negligible, compared to those generated by the other segments of the waste management system.
   This issue is further deepened by analysing the role of transportation in an upgraded waste management system that is represented by the newly designed waste management plan of Palermo. The computed saved ecological footprint is used here for suitably comparing the environmental performances of the MSW system in both scenarios.
   Finally, the suitability of the EF method to address not only complete waste management plans but also single segments of the waste management system, is also discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Incineration is the main way to dispose the municipal solid waste (MSW) in Taiwan. The amount of MSW is rapidly decreased during recent 10 years due to the policies implementation of waste reduction and resource recycle since 2003. Assessment of incinerator operation stop and transformation therefore becomes an essential issue. An evaluation framework was constructed and put into practice in this research. With the considerations of service status, operation performance, MSW treatment status and the impact level of stopping operation was integrated and assessed in the first stage. An optimal model was built for re-programming the MSW clean strategies of original service areas by taking account of MSW collection distance, design capacity of incinerators and the heating value of solid waste in the second stage. A case study was implemented for four incinerators in Kaohsiung City of southern Taiwan to demonstrate the feasibility of proposed assessment framework.

TI Implications of municipal solid waste management on greenhouse gas
   emissions in Malaysia and the way forward
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The management of municipal solid waste (MSW) in Malaysia has been mainly focused on collection, transportation and disposal of MSW. To examine the contribution of MSW management to GHG emissions, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2006 Waste Model was used by deploying Tier 2 method. It estimated that 6,898,167 tonnes CO2-eq of GHG emissions were released in 2016 from solid waste disposal sites (SWDS) and are projected to increase to 9,991,486 tonnes CO2-eq in 2030. To reduce GHG emissions from MSW management, Solid-Waste-Management Greenhouse-Gas (SWM-GHG) calculator was used to compare different approaches. SWM-GHG calculator focused on three settings including recycling approach, incineration approach and integrated approach. According to SWM-GHG calculator, in 2016, 15,906,614 tonnes CO2-eq of GHG emissions were released by recycling approximately 16% of MSW and disposing of 84% of MSW in SWDS. Out of the three approaches, integrated approach can result in highest reduction of GHG emissions by 2050 (64%) from GHG emissions in 2016, as compared to recycling approach (50% reduction) and incineration approach (46% reduction). While, recycling has been the main national goal for last 14 years as it has increased up to 17.5% by 2016, the current Malaysian government aims to establish 8 incinerators in Malaysia that will treat approximately 32% of MSW annually. However, estimations of SWM-GHG calculator and some opportunities and threats highlighted by SWOT analysis suggest the integrated approach as the best suited approach for Malaysia for achieving significant and sustainable reductions in GHG emissions.

TI Sustainability of a bio-waste treatment plant: Impact evolution
   resulting from technological improvements
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The aim of this work is to evaluate how the environmental impacts of the Romagna Compost composting plant (central Italy) have changed as a consequence of its expansion and adaptation. This led to a considerable evolution of the plant, from a traditional composting process to an integrated anaerobic aerobic system. For this purpose, the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology was chosen. Inventory analysis was completed using mostly primary data supplied by the company. Plant performances were evaluated for each year of operation and by grouping data to analyze the main stages (storage and pretreatment of the organic waste, anaerobic fermentation, composting, etc.). The modelling was performed using SimaPro software and the ReCiPe analysis method. Seven scenarios were created to simulate the seven-year process. The aim of the study was to assess whether and how the introduction of anaerobic fermenters to produce energy from biowastes has led to a real improvement of the process sustainability with an overall decrease in environmental impacts. After analyzing in detail the performances of the plant, biowaste transportation and the avoided landfill disposal were also assessed. The main problems connected with transportation, and environmental benefits resulting from the avoided disposal of waste, were identified and in order to evaluate the robustness of the model, a sensitivity analysis using the Monte Carlo method was performed.

TI Environmental sustainability assessment of the management of municipal
   solid waste incineration residues: a review of the current situation
SO CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
AB Incineration has become an attractive option for municipal solid waste (MSW) management, due to its several benefits. In fact, it allows volume and mass reduction of waste and energy recovery from MSW combustion. Nevertheless, MSW incineration (MSWI) produces three main types of residues: bottom ash (BA), fly ash (FA) and air pollution control (APC) residues, which require an adequate handling. BA is the most significant by-product from MSWI and is generally considered as non-hazardous waste. Instead, FAs are included as hazardous wastes because are characterised by high content of chlorides, heavy metals and organic compounds. The aim of this paper was to examine the characteristics of MSWI solid residues, the management and reuse of these wastes and their environmental assessment from a life cycle perspective. It was noted that the main components that make up the residues are lead and zinc as well as oxides, mainly CaO, SiO2 and Al2O3. Furthermore, it is necessary to take into account the presence of PCDD/F which characterised FA and APC residues, mainly due to chlorine content. Chemical and physical properties of those residues make possible their reuse as construction material, as adsorbent, as well as in geotechnical and agricultural applications. Nevertheless, several studies have demonstrated that a drawback of the reuse of MSWI residues is the existence of heavy metals in elevated concentrations which may affect the environmental quality. In this regard, many studies were aimed to assess the environmental impact related to the introduction of MSWI residues as secondary material in several fields of application.

TI Beneficial Microorganisms in the Anaerobic Digestion of Cattle and Swine
   Excreta
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The accumulation of solid organic waste is reaching critical levels in almost all regions of the world. It must be managed sustainably to avoid the depletion of natural resources, minimize risks to human health, reduce environmental burdens, and maintain an overall balance in the ecosystem. This research focuses on the anaerobic digestion of bovine and swine excreta with and without applying beneficial microorganisms as a viable option for recycling agricultural solid wastes. Three greenhouse gases (GHGs)-methane, carbon dioxide, and ammonia-produced by cattle and swine excreta that were treated with and without beneficial microorganisms in bioreactors were quantified. A monitoring and gas concentration measurement system was implemented inside the bioreactors. The behavior of the GHGs and the efficiency of the beneficial microorganisms in treating the farm animal waste were analyzed according to the phases of anaerobic digestion. Average reductions in the concentration in units of ppm of CH4 during the composting process of 46.95% and 34.48% were observed for the cattle and swine excreta treatments, respectively. It was concluded that the studied GHGs had different behaviors in the anaerobic digestion of the treatments in cattle and swine excreta with and without beneficial microorganisms due to the different types of feeding. However, it must be emphasized that beneficial microorganisms are an essential tool for reducing GHGs in anaerobic digestion.

TI Waste to energy in Kathmandu Nepal-A way toward achieving sustainable
   development goals
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) explicitly focus on responsible use of resources, production, and consumption, which comprises sensible waste management includes SDG 3, 7, 11, and 12. Yet, gaps between policies and current waste management practices are prevailing globally as well as nationally. This article discusses waste management (WM) in Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) with a focus on cleaner technology. Waste management has always been an issue in KMC with almost all wastes being dumped directly to a landfill site. The article aims to points out challenge with current waste management based on literature- and document reviews. Further, it introduces and analyses technologies to convert waste into energy and evaluates the applicability of the Asian Develop Bank recommendations for waste management in KMC and suggests strategies toward aligning KMC waste management with Nepal's SDG agenda. Findings indicate that Kathmandu has huge potential for implementing waste to energy technologies, and anaerobic digestion seems one of the most promising technologies. Yet, the city lacks a proper waste treatment infrastructure and would benefit from a systematic alignment of technology, policy, and environmental possibilities and challenges in both analysis, planning, and design.

TI An analysis of barriers for successful implementation of municipal solid
   waste management in Beijing: an integrated DEMATEL-MMDE-ISM approach
SO INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT & DATA SYSTEMS
AB PurposeWith rapid industrialization and urbanization, municipal solid waste (MSW) management has become a serious challenge worldwide, especially in developing countries. The Beijing Municipality is a representative example of many local governments in China that are facing MSW management issues. Although there have been studies in the area of MSW management in the literature, less attention has been devoted to developing a structured framework that identifies and interprets the barriers to MSW management in megacities, especially in Beijing. Therefore, this study focuses on identifying a comprehensive list of barriers affecting the successful implementation of MSW management in Beijing.Design/methodology/approachThrough an extensive review of related literature, 12 barriers are identified and classified into five categories: government, waste, knowledge dissemination, MSW management process and market. Using an integrated approach including the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), maximum mean de-entropy algorithm (MMDE) and interpretive structural modeling (ISM), a conceptual structural model of MSW implementation barriers is constructed to provide insights for industrial decision-makers and policymakers.FindingsThe results show that a lack of economic support from the government, imperfect MSW-related laws and regulations, the low education of residents and the lack of publicity of waste recycling knowledge are the main barriers to MSW management in Beijing. Combined with expert opinions, the paper provides suggestions and guidance to municipal authorities and industry practitioners to guide the successful implementation of MSW management.Practical implicationsThe findings of this study can provide a reference for MSW management in other metropolises in China and other developing countries.Originality/valueThis study proposes a hybrid DEMATEL-MMDE-ISM approach to resolve the subjectivity issues of the traditional ISM approach and it analyzes the barriers that hinder MSW management practices in Beijing.

TI A new closed loop heating system for composting of green and food wastes
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Excessive amount of foodwaste in global food supply chain is a serious issue, and additional controlling measures are needed to prevent wastages of food. In our approach to tackle this global problem, we developed an improved composting system, which can be used as a small decentralized unit for treating food and green wastes in urban environment. A new closed loop heating system was developed to enhance the temperature of compost piles, and accelerate the inactivation of pathogens during the process. The system involved a heated bath circulator, an air injector, and a system of copper piping used as heat exchangers in bins. The system was tested under aerated, static, and plowed composting conditions. To test the pathogen inactivation in the composting, the concentrations of Salmonella and Escherichia coli in compost were measured. In addition, the changes in C:N ratio, pH, and moisture content were observed to understand the quality of the compost in terms of nutrient concentrations. Results showed that the Salmonella levels reached to non-detectable limit in 34, 5, and 34 days of composting in aerated, static, and plowed composting system, respectively. The E. coli levels were detectable till day 70 indicating longer survival of E. coli cells compared to Salmonella under composting environment. In the current system, feedstock C:N ratio was reduced by 71, 70, and 62% in static, plowed, and aerated composting, respectively. We anticipate that the proposed system will yield a new composting design with less dependency on environmental conditions. The proposed design can be used for developing an in-door composting system to convert food and green wastes into pathogen free soil amendment. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI ANALYSIS OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT IN AFGHANISTAN, CURRENT AND
   FUTURE PROSPECTS: A CASE STUDY OF KABUL CITY
SO APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB In Asian countries like Afghanistan, the quantity of municipal solid waste (MSW) is rapidly increasing because of increasing population and economic developments. This increased MSW amount and its inappropriate management has severe impacts on Kabul city. The purpose of the current study was to find out the MSW sources, generation rate, physiochemical properties, current and future management practices in Kabul city, Afghanistan. A questionnaire survey of a total number with 1,150 questionnaires was conducted on the basis of stratified random sampling in January, 2021. Quantification/composition of waste was determined by using a standard method of ASTM-D5231-92. The average MSW generation ratio of four (04) categories of residential areas such as (high, middle, low income and rural areas) were considered and ranged from 0.28 +/- 0.10 kilograms per capita per day (kg/c/d) for low income or rural areas to 0.48 +/- 0.10 kg/c/d for high income areas with the maximum quantity of food waste (FW) at 52.4% of the total waste, followed by paper 20.3% and plastic 17.4% in residential areas. Hence, the total generation of MSW was 3,200 tons/day. The mean per capita FW production in Kabul city was 0.35 kilograms/day or 120.10 kilograms/year. MSW includes of fifteen (15) different types, with organic waste >70% as a major constituent of the MSW in the Kabul city. Outcomes of the current study might help the government to design and operate a complete municipal solid waste management (MSWM) structure for Kabul city and other cities all over the Country

TI Improvement of waste management practices in a fast expanding
   sub-megacity in Pakistan, on the basis of qualitative and quantitative
   indicators
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB This paper deals with an analysis of waste management practices in the fast-growing city of Gujranwala with 2.6 million inhabitants, with a fast growing middle income group of 56%, and an urbanization rate of 3.49% per annum. This city is like many other cities in the developing world, characterised by hardly any waste management infrastructure. The study comprises: (1) an inventory of current waste flows, per income group as well as per season, (2) an inventory of waste management shortcomings, (3)) a what if analysis on the carbon footprint of three waste treatment techniques. The inventory of current waste flows is based on a comprehensive site study involving 776 samples in total. The waste management shortcomings have been qualitatively analysed by Wasteaware model, which deals with physical aspects (public health, environmental control, resource management) as well as governance factors (user & provider inclusivity, financial stability, institutions & policies). The what-if analysis of the carbon footprint has been based on an LCA-based tool. The findings of this study are that: (1) the optimum choice of waste treatment scenario differs for the seasons, (2) the high and middle income groups have nearly half of the share of the waste (3) the Wasteaware system appears to be a powerful tool to communicate the weak spots and to make stakeholders aware of the opportunities for improvement. The novelty of this paper is that it focused on the impact of household income groups in combination with seasonal differences while comparing different waste disposal scenarios.

TI Municipal solid waste: Generation, composition and GHG emissions in
   Bangalore, India
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Municipal solid waste in developing countries mainly consists of degradable materials (> 70%), which plays a significant role in GHG (Greenhouse gas) emissions in urban localities. The increasing municipal solid waste generation along with the high fraction of organic waste and its unscientific disposal is leading to emission of GHG (methane, CO2, etc.) in the atmosphere. Proportion of municipal solid wastes collected by the agencies disposed at identified sites is about 60%, while the balance is disposed-off at unauthorized disposal sites leading to the environmental consequences including greenhouse gas emissions. Mitigation strategy necessitates understanding of composition of waste for its treatment and management in an environmentally sound way. The study revealed that the per capita waste generated is about 91.01 +/- 45.5 g/day with the per capita organic waste generation of 74 +/- 35 g/person/day. The household per capita waste generation was positively related with income and education levels, while negatively related with family (household) size. The organic fractions constitute 82% with the strong recovery potential and conversion to energy or compost range. The total organic waste generated is about 231.01 Gg/year and due to mismanagement consequent emissions are about 604.80 Gg/year. Integrated solid waste management strategy is suggested to manage the organic fractions through technology and policy interventions, which helps in mitigating GHG emissions with potential economic benefits.

TI Improving the carbon footprint of food and packaging waste management in
   a supermarket of the Italian retail sector
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB In a consumer society, the retail sector contributes significantly to waste production. Supermarkets play a central role in the challenges of resources efficiency and waste prevention. The circular economy has become a major alternative to the classical economic model and the retail sector has begun moving along this path. The aim of this study is to analyse supermarket waste management systems to identify more sustainable and circular processes. A specific case study was analysed to assess and improve the waste management system of a supermarket. We used the DMAIC (Define - Measure - Analyse - Improve - Control) model from the Lean Six Sigma methodology to collect data and information. We evaluated the environmental performance of the waste management system through its carbon footprint and compared the environmental impacts in terms of CO2-eq of different waste treatments for each waste category. We introduced a new waste management system in the supermarket, which demonstrated better performance. Our comparison of different waste treatments highlights the importance of recycling, particularly in the context of the circular economy. We then focused on organic matter, as the category producing the most waste and compared composting and anaerobic digestion. We found that anaerobic digestion releases less greenhouse gas emissions. Similar improvement programs can be directly adopted by other stores without repeating the analysis. Our study can inform future research into the use of organic waste for obtaining biogas and other sub-products. The integration of the Lean Six Sigma methodology and other environmental tools can also be assessed as a strategy in the circular economy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In Morocco, the destiny of sludge generated from waste treatment plants (WWTP) is one of the major issues in the management of sanitation service. In the absence of sludge disposal options and in the objective to reduce its production, the sludge is accumulated and stored next to station plants without any measures to ensure their harmlessness to the environment, or left recycling longer than necessary in treatment reactors which negatively impacts the treatment system (considerable reduction in treatment performance, premature degradation of equipment, increased energy consumption, etc.)
   In order to contribute to the study of the sludge management issue which is becoming persistent and worrying, this work studies solar drying as a new sludge management route and how it can contribute to overcome the constraints hampering the sustainable sewage sludge disposal and/or recovery in Morocco.
   To carry out our study, a methodological approach was defined based on the bibliographic research and the interviews and surveys with different stakeholders.
   To reduce sludge volumes and achieve overall cost efficiency for disposal and/or recovery, solar sludge drying need to be considered. If this system appears most favored in many countries, it is justified even more for Morocco, given its Mediterranean and arid climate.

TI Using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis to Select Waste to Energy
   Technology for a Mega City: The Case of Moscow
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In a mega city like Moscow, both municipal solid waste management and energy systems are managed in an unsustainable way. Therefore, utilizing the municipal solid waste to generate energy will help the city in achieving sustainability by decreasing greenhouse gases emissions and the need for land to dispose the solid waste. In this study, various Waste to Energy (WTE) options were evaluated using analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to select the most appropriate technology for the Moscow region. The developed AHP model consists of 4 levels, which assessed four WTE technologies, namely landfill biogas, anaerobic digestion, incineration, and refuse derived fuel (RDF), using four criteria and nine subcriteria. The pairwise comparison was achieved by soliciting 16 experts' opinions. The priority weights of various criteria, subcriteria, and alternatives were determined using Expert Choice Software. The developed model indicated that landfill biogas is the preferred option with a global weight of 0.448, followed by the anaerobic digestion with a weight of 0.320 and incineration with a weight of 0.138, while the least preferred technology is the RDF with a weight of 0.094. Sensitivity analysis has shown that the priorities of WTE alternatives are sensitive for the environmental and technical criteria. The developed AHP model can be used by the decision makers in Moscow in the field of WTE.

   management scenarios in Varginha, MG, Brazil
SO ENGENHARIA SANITARIA E AMBIENTAL
AB The present work proposes to evaluate the economic and environmental viability of energy recovery from biogas in the landfill of Varginha-MG, as well to analyze greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and energy consumption in different scenarios of municipal solid waste (MSW) management. A 20-year projection of MSW generation and landfill operation were considered, whose biogas production was estimated through LandGEM software. The economic feasibility analysis was performed using the net present value (NPV), and the internal rate of return (IRR) as indicators. GHG emissions were estimated by applying the WARM model (Waste Reduction Model) considering the current MSW management scenario and three alternative ones. The scenarios diversified into recycling strategies, anaerobic digestion, landfill disposal and incineration with energy recovery. Only the energy recovery with a power of 150 kW resulted in economic viability. Moreover, the largest environmental benefits were obtained by scenario 3, based on the recovery of recyclable materials, anaerobic digestion and incineration of MSW, considerably reducing the volume of MSW landfilled. Among all management practices of the proposed scenarios, recycling resulted in greater energy gains and GHG emission removal.

AB Increased environmental concerns and the emphasis on material and energy recovery are gradually changing the orientation of MSNV management and planning. In this context, the application of optimisation techniques have been introduced to design the least cost solid waste management systems, considering the variety of management processes (recycling, composting, anaerobic digestion, incineration, and landfilling), and the existence of uncertainties associated with the number of system components and their interrelations. This study presents a model that was developed and applied to serve as a solid waste decision support system for MSW management taking into account both socio-economic and environmental considerations. The model accounts for solid waste generation rates, composition, collection, treatment, disposal as well as potential environmental impacts of various MSNV management techniques. The model follows a linear programming formulation with the framework of dynamic optimisation. The model can serve as a tool to evaluate various MSW management alternatives and obtain the optimal combination of technologies fur the handling, treatment and disposal of MSW in an economic and environmentally sustainable way. The sensitivity of various waste management policies is also addressed. The work is presented in a series of two papers: (1) model formulation, and (11) model application and sensitivity analysis.

TI Development of a decision support system for municipal solid waste
   management systems planning
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB A review of the municipal solid waste (MSW) management and planning literature reveals the growing number and complexity of the available mathematical models. A technical survey of practising waste management professionals indicated a general interest in, but lack of practical applications of, mathematical modelling techniques. The creation of knowledge-based systems to interface with individual MSW management and planning models, or assist with model selection and integration is proposed. As a means of demonstrating the validity of the suggested decision support approach, a prototype decision support system was developed to assist with the preliminary planning of MSW management systems. This planning fool combines knowledge-based system components with spreadsheet, optimization and stimulation models to assist with: waste forecasting; technology evaluation; recycling and composting programme design; facility sizing; location and investment timing; waste allocation; and MSW management system analysis using stimulation. A case study application of the planning tool is described. (C) 1996 ISWA

TI Ecological-economic modelling for strategic regional waste management
   systems
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB This paper summarises some recent work exploring the development of a multi-criteria optimisation tool for achieving sustainable solutions for municipal solid waste management systems (MSWMS). The aim of the project was to provide a new methodological background for the regional solid waste management modelling taking into account spatial and temporal patterns of waste generation and processing, environmental as well as economic impacts of the system development with a particular emphasis on public health and biodiversity.
   The research has focused on integrating three different approaches to the spatial-temporal analysis of the MSWMS, namely a life cycle inventory analysis, which helps to identify emission patterns within the MSWMS, a multi-criteria optimisation approach, which helps to find compromise solutions among environmentally and economically preferred options, and a geographic information systems approach, which provides a tool for identifying waste management facilities, transportation environmental and social impacts, as well as analysis of environmental impacts on valuable ecosystems. A Russian methodology for calculating environmental damage was used to weight the importance of different sub-territories covered by the system as well as simplifying the analysis of emissions from the waste treatment plants. The approach provides a new perspective for the analysis of municipal solid waste management systems at the regional scale. The principal novelty of the proposed complex MSW strategic management model is an integration of the different types of data-geographical, environmental and economic-using relational database technology. Simulations using the dataset for Gloucestershire were performed on a simplified version of the model. Simulations were undertaken to explore the potential effects on waste management infrastructure of introducing the EU Landfill Directive. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses inherent in the methods utilised has suggested that a relatively affordable and easy to use tool can be developed for strategic analysis of the municipal solid waste management system in a region, giving useful support to the decision-maker regarding the potential development paths and trade-offs between economic and environmental performance of a proposed waste management system.

TI Determinants of waste characterization in Lebanon and material recovery
   potential
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Waste represents a largely untapped source of raw material in many countries, as resource recovery rates remain generally low despite most of the disposed stream being composed of recoverable material. Reliable waste characterization data are the primary measure in shaping effective waste recovery strategies. Normally, such data are scarce in low and middle-income countries and if it exists, it is generally incompatible and commonly based on assumptions rather than scientific studies. This study aims to assess the determinants of waste characterization in Lebanon and the implications for planning sustainable waste management systems. Accordingly, three thorough and comprehensive waste characterization studies were conducted targeting three Federations of municipalities. Results revealed that the organic fraction is the most prominent in household waste followed by plastics and paper. Unlike the quantity of recyclables that was proportional to income level, organic waste and income level were inversely proportional. The high amount of organic waste along with recyclables make composting and recycling feasible solid waste management processes that can substantially reduce the amount of waste to be landfilled. Thus, negating the need for land particularly in areas where land availability is a challenge.

TI Economic analysis of a shared municipal solid waste management facility
   in a metropolitan region
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) management in dense urban areas is a challenge for municipalities, especially in developing countries, which commonly have deficient waste management. For example, the metropolitan region of Goias State, Brazil, has 19 municipalities that dispose of about 72.5% of total MSW in unlicensed MSW final disposal facilities. Therefore, this study analysed the investment and operating costs, and revenues of a municipal solid waste management facility, projected for 20 years, shared among these 19 municipalities. The economic viability analysis, has shown that, regardless of the management facility type, MSW collection and transport are the most expensive cost components, accounting for about 60% of MSW management operating costs. For an Internal Rate of Return of 0%, anaerobic digestion is 11% more expensive (in total) than using community composting. For 2040 (last year), the monthly MSW management tariffs will vary between 3.5 and 10.8 R$.inhabitant(-1).month(-1), depending on the municipality. So, as the unit price of biowaste treatments lowers with waste quantities, for the municipalities with large biowaste quantities, anaerobic digestion becomes recommended for its economic attractiveness. This study can serve as a model for other municipalities in Brazil and elsewhere, helping public decision makers to establish a strategy for MSW management. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Environmental impacts and optimizing strategies of municipal sludge
   treatment and disposal routes in China based on life cycle analysis
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB The management and utilization of sludge in a sustainable approach require a systematic analysis of the environmental impacts generated from diverse sludge treatment and disposal processes. This study systematically assessed 12 common sludge treatment and disposal routes based on the existing operating and construction conditions of representative sludge disposal projects in China. We evaluated their environmental impacts using a life cycle assessment following the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 14040 and ISO 14044), and found that the routes of co-incineration, mono-incineration, and anaerobic digestion with or without thermal hydrolysis may be useful in terms of simultaneously controlling environmental pollution and carbon emissions in China. Therein, the route of co-incineration was recommended as the best one because its human toxicity potential (-152.31 kg dichlorobenzene (1,4-DB) eq/ton dry solid (t DS)), freshwater ecotoxicity potential (FEP, -127.40 kg 1,4-DB eq/t DS), terrestrial ecotoxicity potential (TEP, -0.81 kg 1,4-DB eq/t DS), and global warming potential (-27.26 kg CO2 eq/t DS) were all negative (environmental benefits). Furthermore, the toxicity impacts of the mono-incineration route were also negative, but it still needed to further enhance energy recovery to reduce carbon emissions. Despite the routes of anaerobic digestion and thermal hydrolysis in combination with anaerobic digestion had the excellent negative carbon emission attributes (-572.44 kg CO2 eq/t DS, -474.92 kg CO2 eq/t DS), they showed serious FEP and TEP owing to the heavy metals pollution caused by subsequent land use of anaerobic digested sludge. Overall, this study selected the most suitable sludge treatment and disposal routes to simultaneously satisfy the requirements of carbon emission reduction and pollution control in China and proposed optimizing suggestions for future technical improvement and development.

TI Environmental performance of municipal solid waste strategies based on
   LCA method: a case study of Macau
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Increasing public attention has been brought to bear on the environmental impacts of municipal solid waste (MSW) management in Macau, due to the continually increasing amount of MSW being generated and the limited space and capacity of waste treatment facilities. This study evaluates the current and potential patterns of MSW management with regard to environmental impacts in Macau, using the life cycle assessment (LCA) method. We also assess the baseline scenario, reflecting the existing MSW management system, as well as five other scenarios, exploring waste treatment innovations, to quantitatively predict potential environmental impact mitigation for Macau. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis is used to investigate the influence of the different assessment methods and recycling rates of valuable resources in the source separation process. The results show that the current management system of MSW in Macau can treat and dispose of the MSW well, and at the same time can generate some environmental benefits. Compared with Scenario 0 (the current MSW management system), Scenario 4 (source separation and incineration) shows the highest potential to increase the environmental benefits. Scenario 5 (integrated waste management) is also a good option, with higher benefits (85.96%) than Scenario 0. The analysis shows that, in each scenario (except Scenario 1, the past process of landfill only), the waste treatment processes, including source separation and incineration, dominate the environmental impacts; while processes such as collection and transportation, composting, and landfill, have a relatively small influence. The sensitivity analysis of recycling rate shows an approximately linear relation of inverse proportion between recycling rate and total environmental impact. Considering the limited financial resources and the current waste management practices in Macau, Scenario 4 would be the preferred choice. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The state of municipal solid waste management in Israel
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Regulation is a key tool for implementing municipal solid waste (MSW) management strategies and plans. While local authorities in Israel are responsible for the storage, collection, and disposal of MSW, Israel's Ministry of Environmental Protection (MoEP) is responsible for the formulation and implementation of waste management policies and legislation. For the past 12 years, about 80% of the MSW in Israel has been landfilled and recycling rates have not increased, despite regulations. This paper presents the state of MSW management in Israel in light of the MoEP's strategic goal of landfilling reduction, the regulations and legislation designed and implemented for achieving this goal, and the ensuing results. Among other things, the results indicate the importance of monitoring and assessing policy and regulations to examine whether regulation is in fact effective and whether it keeps track of its own targets and goals or not. It is also concluded that even when there is an extensive regulation that includes a wide range of laws, economic penalties and financial incentives (such as landfill levy and financing of MSW separation at source arrangements), this does not guarantee proper treatment or even an improvement in waste management. The key to success is first and foremost a suitable infrastructure that will enable achievement of the desired results.

TI Environmental impact assessment of the incineration of municipal solid
   waste with auxiliary coal in China
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The environmental impacts of waste incineration with auxiliary coal were investigated using the life-cycle-based software, EASEWASTE, based on the municipal solid waste (MSW) management system in Shuozhou City. In the current system, MSW is collected, transported, and incinerated with 250 kg of coal per ton of waste. Based on observed environmental impacts of incineration, fossil CO2 and heavy metals were primary contributors to global warming and ecotoxicity in soil, respectively. Compared with incinerators using excess coal, incineration with adequate coal presents significant benefits in mitigating global warming, whereas incineration with a mass of coal can avoid more impacts to acidification, photochemical ozone and nutrient enrichment because of increased electricity substitution and reduced emission from coal power plants. The "Emission standard of air pollutants for thermal power plants (GB13223-2011)" implemented in 2012 introduced stricter policies on controlling SO2 and NOx emissions from coal power plants. Thus, increased use of auxiliary coal during incineration yields fewer avoided impacts on acidification and nutrient enrichment. When two-thirds of ash is source-separated and landfilled, the incineration of rest-waste presents better results on global warming, acidification, nutrient enrichment, and even ecotoxicity in soil. This process is considered a promising solution for MSW management in Shuozhou City. Weighted normalized environmental impacts were assessed based on Chinese political reduction targets. Results indicate that heavy metal and acidic gas emissions should be given more attention in waste incineration. This study provides scientific support for the management of MSW systems dominated by incineration with auxiliary coal in China. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   challenges
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB This paper presents an examination of MSW generation and composition in China, providing an overview of the current state of MSW management, an analysis of existing problems in MSW collection, separation, recycling and disposal, and some suggestions for improving MSW systems in the future. In China, along with urbanization, population growth and industrialization, the quantity of municipal solid waste (MSW) generation has been increasing rapidly. The total MSW amount increased from 31.3 million tonnes in 1980 to 212 million tonnes in 2006, and the waste generation rate increased from 0.50 kg/capita/day in 1980 to 0.98 kg/capita/year in 2006. Currently, waste composition in China is dominated by a high organic and moisture content, since the concentration of kitchen waste in urban solid waste makes up the highest proportion (at approximately 60%) of the waste stream. The total amount of MSW collected and transported was 148 million tonnes in 2006, of which 91.4% was landfilled, 6.4% was incinerated and 2.2% was composted. The overall MSW treatment rate in China was approximately 62% in 2007. In 2007, there were 460 facilities, including 366 landfill sites, 17 composing plants, and 66 incineration plants. This paper also considers the challenges faced and opportunities for MSW management in China, and a number of recommendations are made aimed at improving the MSW management system.

AB Grate incineration is a widely used waste-to-energy (WtE) technology, which has the potential of contributing significantly to clean energy production and sustainable waste management systems. Various research studies have shown that WtE grate incineration in developed countries has contributed to the goal of economic, social and environmentally sustainable development.
   The purpose of this study is to carry out a financial analysis of a WtE grate incineration power plant for a small South African city of North-West Province. Municipal solid waste (MSW) data used in this study was collected from a small municipality in North-West Province.
   A financial model with four different scenarios was formulated. Net present value and internal rate of return were used as financial feasibility indicators. Sensitivity analysis was performed to see how electricity price and MSW accumulation rate affected the financial feasibility of the model. The results proved that the major revenue stream of a WtE plant is electricity sales and medical waste gate fees. High capital cost is the main drawback in implementing a WtE grate incineration power plant.
   A WtE grate incineration power plant also makes a significant contribution to the goal of recycling. The conclusion reached is that WtE could be economically viable if medical waste is diverted to the grate incineration power plant and 150 000 tonnes to 220 000 tonnes of residual MSW is generated annually.

TI Review of higher heating value of municipal solid waste based on
   analysis and smart modelling
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Energy recovery from 252 kinds of solid waste originating from various geographical areas under thermal waste to-energy operation is investigated. A fast, economical, and comparative methodology is presented for evaluating the heating values resulted from burning municipal solid waste (MSW) based on prior knowledge, specialist experience, and data-mining methods. Development of models for estimating higher heating values (HHVs) of 252 MSW samples based on the ultimate analysis is conducted by simultaneously utilising five nonlinear models including Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network in conjunction with Genetic Algorithm (GA), namely GARBF, genetic programming (GP), multivariate nonlinear regression (MNR), particle swarm optimisation adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (PSO-ANFIS) and committee machine intelligent system (CMIS) models to increase the accuracy of each model. Eight different equations based on MNR are developed to estimate energy recovery capacity from different MSW groups (e.g., textiles, plastics, papers, rubbers, mixtures, woods, sewage sludge and other waste). A detailed investigation is conducted to analyse the accuracy of the models. It is indicated that the CMIS model has the best performance comparing the results obtained from different models. The R-2 values of the test dataset for GA-RBF are 0.888, for GP 0.979, for MNR 0.978, for PSO-ANFIS 0.965, and for CMIS 0.985. The developed models with an acceptable accuracy would be followed by a better estimation of HHV and providing reliable heating value for an automatic combustion control system. The results obtained from this study are beneficial to design and optimise sustainable thermal waste-to-energy (WTF) processes to accelerate city transition into a circular economy.

AB The problem of waste management has been the most actual as a result of intensive growth in production and consumption in most countries of the world for decades. Having realized the senselessness of combating raising volumes of waste, increasing the scale of their disposal or incineration, mankind has come to the conclusion that the most promising way to solve this problem is to use several types of waste for several times (for example, as packaging) or recycling with return of materials in the turnover. However, in cases where it is impossible to implement these directions, it is advisable to incinerate the waste generated in an environmentally safe manner and then deposit the slag residues. From the standpoint of ensuring the ecological safety of urban economy, the main aspect in solving the problem of waste management is the environmental aspect, although in the above-mentioned concepts the definition of criteria for the environmental friendliness of waste management systems is not fully disclosed. In addition, an indirect assessment of environmental friendliness in these concepts can only be revealed during the implementation of the waste management stages, i.e. in the process of reducing pollution. The authors propose a fundamentally new approach based on the physical-energy concept of describing pollution processes and reducing environmental pollution in urban areas with municipal solid waste (MSW). The basic principle of the physical-energy concept is to consider MSW as a dispersed system that continuously changes its properties throughout the entire life cycle of waste.

TI Mobility of Cu and Zn in Soil Amended with Composts at Different Degrees
   of Maturity
SO WASTE AND BIOMASS VALORIZATION
AB Purpose This work tackles the mobility of heavy metals in soil after compost addition, with particular attention to the effects of compost feedstock and compost maturity.
   Methods Three types of organic wastes: MSW (municipal solid waste), MSW + GW (municipal solid waste + green waste) and SS + GW (sewage sludge + green waste), were composted and sampled at three different composting times (0, 6 and 12 weeks). These samples were mixed with a cultivated horizon from a silt loam soil in order to pursue column leaching experiments. Columns were built up in three replicates and submitted to leaching with dilute CaCl2 solution, during 1 h, nearly each week during 2 months. Leachates were analysed for organic and inorganic C, pH, Zn and Cu.
   Results The leaching of Cu and dissolved organic C were closely related, while Zn showed a different behaviour. Compost feedstock was the factor with the highest influence in element leaching, which decreased in the sequence MSW > MSW + GW > SS + GW. Within composts obtained from the same feedstock, maturity also had an influence on element leaching, which was expressed at two levels: (1) during the first days after compost addition to soil, leaching decreases at increasing degrees of compost maturity; (2) cumulated amounts of Cu and organic C leached during the 2-month experiments increased with compost maturity. The limited variations of pH during leaching experiments showed no clear relationship neither with the maturation of compost, nor with the mobility of the studied heavy metals.

TI ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION: FINAL DISPOSAL ALTERNATIVES OF SLUDGE FROM
   MUNICIPAL WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS
SO SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION
SE Environmental Remediation Technologies Regulations and Safety
AB Environmental issues concerning wastewater treatment are considerable. Legislation is continuously refining the requirements for the level of removal of various pollutants in treated water. This often leads to a higher production of sludge, although ways to eliminate this sludge are becoming increasingly restricted. Most sludge has traditionally been incinerated (with energy recovery), disposed of in landfill sites or dumped into the sea. Today, however, ocean dumping has been banned in many areas. In Europe, landfill regulations for organic waste will become more and more stringent until 2015, when landfilling will be banned completely. Incineration is heavily regulated and facing strong social opposition, as the incineration of sludge leads to small atmospheric emissions of substances such as mercury and dioxins and generates ashes that need to be landfilled or handled as hazardous waste. Recycling sludge as fertilizer on agricultural soils is held by many governments to be the best environmental option, adding nutrients and organic content to the soil, although is banned in some areas. However, the content of heavy metals, pathogens and persistent and toxic organic compounds in sewage sludge make stringent regulation; necessary; this option is being increasingly questioned by farmers.
   The aim of this study is to assess alternatives for the final disposal of sewage sludge from wastewater treatment from a life cycle assessment (LCA) point of view in order to identify the best environmental alternatives. This study proposes five alternatives for final sludge applications: agricultural uses, compost plant, cement plant, incineration and landfill.
   LCA methodology is used to evaluate the environmental profile of the different studied alternatives in order to establish in a global, rigorous and objective way the most positive environmental alternative.
   Among the alternative final destinations of sludge studied here, the best environmental option is to combine agriculture use (fertilizer replacement) by using the sludge in a cement plant (as fuel replacement and raw material reduction) because this emphasizes their respective advantages and diminishes their respective disadvantages.

TI Sustainable management practices of food waste in Asia: Technological
   and policy drivers
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The policies and technological drivers to manage food waste in Asia have been shaped by the increasing awareness of the countries to this issue, their commitment to national and international development goals, their socio-economic constraints, and their recognition of the potency to recover nutrients and energy from food waste. The concept of reduce, reuse and recycle (the 3R principles) streamline the existing food waste management policies, and scrutinising the gaps and challenges led to a conclusion that most of the countries emphasise food waste segregation and treatment instead of prevention at source itself. Furthermore, a qualitative SWOT analysis of five prevailing treatment options led to a conclusion that animal feeding, incineration, and landfilling are unsustainable since they pose various health and environmental hazard risks. It was further concluded that anaerobic digestion was the preferred option than aerobic digestion (composting) considering the characteristics of the available food waste in Asia as well as the underlying environmental and economic benefits. Moreover, decentralised, community-scale, anaerobic digestion system has been gaining traction over centralised, large-scale system because of their lower energy footprint, ease of operation, need for lesser resources, lower operation and maintenance costs, and higher chances of public acceptance. It was also observed that the policy to gain energy from segregated food waste is a larger driving force for the efforts to promote anaerobic digestion and thereby manage food waste sustainably.

TI Implication of heavy metals distribution for a municipal solid waste
   management system - a case study in Shanghai
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Heavy metal contamination in municipal solid waste (MSW) is of increasing concern. The occurrence and distribution of heavy metals in MSW and their implications for the integrated MSW management system in mega-cities have been investigated by means of material flow analysis based on a case study of Shanghai in China. A good statistical basis was provided through a one-year monitoring program on the mass and metals composition of the waste from three MSW treatment facilities. The results showed that the main heavy metals in the MSW were Zn, Cr, Cu, and Pb (on average > 100 mg kg(-1)), followed by Ni, Cd, and Hg. The MSW contained higher levels of Cu and Ni in metals, Cr and Pb in plastics, and Pb and Zn in the inorganic fractions. Regardless of the sources, the statistically similar heavy metal contents in the organic fractions indicated that effective blending and diffusion of heavy metals had taken place throughout the MSW collection, transfer, transportation, and storage, leading to cross-contamination of the waste fractions. PU (composed of putrescible waste and miscellaneous indistinguishable particles) contributed the majority of the heavy metals to the MSW, followed by plastics, as a result of the predominance in the overall composition of PU and plastics rather than from differences in their heavy metal contents. Therefore, manual or mechanical separation of some significantly heavy metal-rich fractions alone is not sufficient to reduce the heavy metal contents in the MSW. Source separation of organic waste and the diversion of tailored inorganic waste such as hazardous components, construction and demolition waste, etc., are proposed to control the heavy metal contamination in MSW. For the mixed MSW management system, physicochemical fractionation to exclude particles containing high levels of heavy metals can be conducted. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Using textile industrial sludge, sewage wastewater, and sewage sludge as
   inoculum to degrade recalcitrant textile dyes in a co-composting
   process: an assessment of biodegradation efficiency and compost
   phytotoxicity
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Recalcitrant dyes found in textile wastewater represent a threat for sustainable textile production due to their resistance to conventional treatments. This study assessed an alternative co-composting system for the treatment of recalcitrant textile dyes where textile industrial sludge, sewage wastewater, or sewage sludge were used as microbial compost inocula. The biodegradation efficiency of bioreactor trials and compost quality of the co-composting system were assessed by visible spectrophotometry and by a phytotoxicity test. The co-composting system (dry weight (dw) basis) consisted of 200 g of restaurant organic residues + 200 g sewage sludge (or 100 mL sewage wastewater, or 200 g textile sludge) + 100 mL of a 10% dye solution (Reactive Red 195, or Synolon Brown, or Orange Remazol, or Yellow Synozol, or Reactive Orange 122, or Reactive Black 5). After 60 days of composting, all dyes were biodegraded according to spectrophotometric data, with efficiency varying from 97.2 to 99.9%. Inoculum efficiency ranking was textile sludge > sewage sludge > sewage wastewater. Regarding compost quality, a phytotoxicity study with lettuce showed no toxicity effect. Thus, co-composting can be a low-cost and efficient method for recalcitrant textile dye biodegradation and for managing textile sludge in terms of waste recycling, contributing to environmental sustainability.

TI Eco-Efficiency Analysis of Integrated Waste Management Strategies Based
   on Gasification and Mechanical Biological Treatment
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Integrated solid waste management (ISWM) strategies are developed towards promoting sustainable approaches for handling waste. Recently, gasification and mechanical biological treatment (MBT) technologies were recognized as effective processes for treating municipal solid waste. This study investigates the feasibility of integrating gasification and MBT technologies in multiple ISWM strategies, compared to incineration- and anaerobic digestion (AD)-based strategies. A comprehensive techno-economic and environmental assessment was carried out to evaluate the performance of the examined ISWM strategies. The evaluation was based on the energy generation potential, carbon footprint, and life cycle costing (LCC). An eco-efficiency analysis was conducted to quantify the environmental costs by incorporating the carbon footprint and LCC results. The proposed strategies were applied for the city of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, based on local bylaws and guidelines. The analysis revealed that the gasification-based strategy had the highest energy production of 47.0 million MWh, followed by the incineration- (34.2 million MWh), AD- (17.2 million MWh), and MBT-based (14.9 million MWh) strategies. Results of the environmental analysis indicated that the MBT- and AD-based strategies contributed the least to global warming with greenhouse gas emissions of 4442 and 4539 GgCO(2)-eq, respectively, compared to the gasification- (9922 GgCO(2)-eq) and incineration-based (15,700 GgCO(2)-eq) strategies. Furthermore, over a 25-year assessment period, the LCC findings demonstrated that the gasification- and MBT-based strategies were the most financially feasible with a positive net present value (NPV) of USD 364 and USD 284 million, respectively. The eco-efficiency analysis indicated that the MBT and gasification strategies are the most sustainable among the examined strategies. The sustainability of the assessed systems was improved by implementing policy and legal reforms, including incentive programs, less stringent bylaws on digestate, and encouraging source separation of wastes. Overall, this research emphasized the potential environmental and financial benefits of incorporating MBT and gasification technologies into ISWM strategies.

TI Waste as Resource for Pakistan: An Innovative Business Model of
   Regenerative Circular Economy to Integrate Municipal Solid Waste
   Management Sector
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) management is a global concern, especially in low-middle-income countries such as Pakistan, which require the redressal of MSW treatment issues to attain sustainability in the waste sector. The prosperity of municipal solid waste (MSW) collectors, i.e., the sanitary workers, is critical in the waste management hierarchy. Hence, the health, safety, social welfare, economic conditions and overall wellbeing of this tier need to be focused on more. Safeguarding the interests of the sanitary workers will support the MSW management sector in sustainability, which will help to generate revenue and minimize climatic impacts. An innovative MSW business model with waste ownership and technological intervention has excellent potential to support the sector towards a circular economy in Pakistan, the fifth most populous country in the world, generating about 100,000 metric tons of MSW per day. The proposed recycling business model will ensure a daily material recovery of 26,070 tons with 4721 tons of compost manufacturing in the country, which ultimately helps towards achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and meeting the targets of nationally determined contributors (NDCs) by 2030. In addition, the sector's economic potential can contribute 5.5% to the total annual budget and possibly pay 1.4% of the gross domestic product (GDP) per annum to service national foreign debt, thus helping maintain the debt threshold value with an opportunity to accelerate the economic growth of Pakistan.

TI Life cycle assessment of different strategies for energy and nutrient
   recovery from source sorted organic fraction of household waste
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB This study attempted to apply life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology to compare distinctive management strategies when biologically treating source-sorted organic household waste (SSOHW). The management strategies included different pretreatment methods of SSOHW prior to anaerobic digestion and different biogas applications. Biopulp technology, screw press, and disc screen were chosen as three available pretreatment methods and electricity production, combined heat and power (CHP) production, as well as biogas upgrading were selected as three downstream management strategies. In all scenarios, the produced digestate was assumed for nutrient recovery and reject fractions from pretreatment step were considered to be incinerated. A consequential LCA was employed and long term marginal data was adapted to credit the amount of recovered energy and nutrient. The composition of SSOHW collected in Denmark was used to investigate the impact of created scenarios on several damage categories, i.e., Global warming potential, Human health, Ecosystem quality, and Resources. Moreover, the scenarios were also compared in terms of energy ratio to find the strategy resulting in the highest energy payback. The results showed that scenarios developed under the biopulp technology outperformed their counterparts in which other pretreatment methods were used. This was mostly due to the higher energy and nutrient recovery caused by correct sorting of SSOHW into reject and substrate fractions. Moreover, based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that CHP production would be the best downstream management option while the results were so sensitive to the source of substituted energy.

TI Life-cycle modeling of nutrient and energy recovery through mixed waste
   processing systems
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB There is increasing interest in recovering nutrients and energy from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW). Given the costs associated with separate collection of OFMSW, and the potential difficulty in finding clean feedstocks, there are potential benefits in beneficial recovery of OFMSW as part of residual MSW. Therefore, this study compared the life-cycle impacts associated with management alternatives for recovering energy and/or nutrients from the OFMSW through mixed waste processing systems. The considered treatment alternatives include landfilling, mass burn waste-to-energy, gasification and syngas combustion (GC) for electricity production, gasification Fischer-Tropsch (GFT) for transportation fuel production, aerobic composting (AC), and anaerobic digestion (AD). Seven environmental impacts include global warming potential (GWP), cumulative energy demand, acidification, eutrophication, photochemical oxidation, ecotoxicity, and human toxicity were assessed for five sets of state and one U.S. national waste compositions. The mass burn waste-to-energy and GC scenarios generally have the lowest environmental impacts, while landfilling and GFT have the greatest impacts. Separating out organics for AC increased environmental impacts compared to sending them to GC, while sending them to AD decreased GWP and increased the other impacts. Sensitivity analyses suggest that these conclusions are generally robust to uncertainty in input values.

TI Environmental and financial assessments of open burning, open dumping
   and integrated municipal solid waste disposal schemes among different
   income groups
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB This research investigated the cost-effectiveness of twenty-four municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal schemes for four per capita income groups (low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high income groups) using life cycle cost assessment (LCCA). In the study, the LCCA included cash inflow (sales of recycle materials, fertilizer, and surplus electricity), cash outlay (investment and operation and maintenance costs), and environmental costs (based on environmental impacts). The life cycle environmental impacts and costs assessments were carried out using Stepwise2006. The most environmentally and financially preferable MSW disposal scenarios were determined for all four income groups. The LCCA was further applied to existing LCA-based studies on MSW management in India (a lower-middle income country) and Brazil (an upper-middle income country), and results were compared with the original LCA-based findings. The results showed that the environmental impacts of disposal schemes of the lower income groups were the lowest, while the cost-effectiveness were the highest (-284.79 to -1698.77 US$2019 per ton). The findings also revealed that the environmental impacts and per capita income were positively correlated. Composting biodegradable waste (320.16-402.40 US$2019 per ton) and landfilling combustible waste (312.87-350.06 US$2019 per ton) incurred the lowest total environmental costs. The most environmentally and financially preferable MSW disposal scenarios for all four income groups were the disposal scheme that integrates multiple waste disposal processes, including recycling for recyclable waste, incineration for combustible waste, composting for biodegradable waste, and landfill for non-recyclable and noncombustible waste, given the high financial gains and low environmental costs. In essence, LCCA takes into account both the financial and environmental costs, thus closely reflecting the actual cost of MSW management. Therefore, policymakers should adopt the LCCA method in the formulation and implementation of the national MSW management policy and action plans.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY
AB Organic waste management by means of composting produces unpleasant odours. The odour emissions of composting piles composed of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste and sewage sludge were monitored and controlled by means of dynamic olfactometry. This technique is used to determine the odour concentration expressed in European odour units per cubic metres (ou(E)/m(3)). To validate the technique, we analysed both respirometric variables and traditional variables such as total organic carbon and pH during composting. Finally, a dispersion model was used to evaluate the impact of the odour emissions of the wastes on neighbouring areas, not finding any differences in the cases evaluated.

TI Potential for energy recovery and greenhouse gas reduction through
   waste-to-energy technologies
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the energy recovery and greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction potentials from solid waste. Based on the current and proposed solid waste management scenarios of Daejeon Metropolitan City in Korea, this study evaluates the energy recovery and GHG reduction potentials of landfill gas recovery, steam heat recovery by incineration, biogas or solid fuel production from organic waste, and solid refuse fuel from solid waste. The results indicate that the energy recovery potential per one ton of waste was largest for solid recovered fuel (SRF) production from municipal solid waste at 2.94 GJ/ton, followed by steam heat generation (2.34 GJ/ton), solid fuel production from sewage sludge (0.77 GJ/ton), biogas production from food waste (0.443 GJ/ton), and landfill gas recovery (0.177 GJ/ton). The energy recovery potentials of all solid waste materials are expected to increase from 252,130 GJ/year in 2012 to 525,540 GJ/ton in 2021. In 2012, GHG reduction by waste-to-energy was 16,061 ton CO2 eq./year; it is predicted to be 33,477 ton CO2 eq./year in 2021. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment of Electricity Generation from
   Municipal Solid Waste in Nigeria: A Prospective Study
SO ENERGIES
AB Globally, rising population and rapid urbanisation have resulted in the dual issues of increased electricity demand and waste generation. These exacerbate diverse global problems, ranging from irregular electricity supply and inadequate waste management systems to water/air/soil pollution, climate change, etc. Waste-to-Energy (WtE) approaches have been proposed and developed to address simultaneously these two issues through energy recovery from waste. However, the variety of available waste materials and different WtE technologies make the choice of an appropriate technology challenging for decision-makers. The evaluation of the different WtE technologies in terms of their sustainability could provide a solid comparative base for strategic decision making in the power and waste management domains. This paper presents research conducted using a multidimensional Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) approach to estimate and compare the environmental, economic, and social impacts associated with the generation of electricity from Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) in two major cities, Lagos and Abuja, in Nigeria. These cities provide case studies in a developing world context to explore how their similarities and differences may influence the LCSA impacts for four WtE systems (Anaerobic Digestion, Incineration, Gasification, and Landfill Gas to Energy), and this is the first research of its kind. An LCSA ranking and scoring system and a muti-attribute value theory (MAVT) multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) were employed to evaluate the overall sustainability of the prospective use of WtE over a 20-year timeframe. The results from both approaches indicated that the adoption of WtE offered sustainability benefits for both cities, marginally more so for Lagos than Abuja. It was concluded that, for optimal benefits to be achieved, it is vital for decision-makers to think about the various trade-offs revealed by this type of analysis and the varying priorities of relevant stakeholders.

TI Assessment of electricity generation potential and economic analysis
   through different municipal solid waste management scenarios: a case
   study
SO BIOMASS CONVERSION AND BIOREFINERY
AB Waste-to-energy (WTE) technologies are now considered an option for sustainable municipal solid waste (MSW) management and one of the most important renewable energy resources. Indeed, a comprehensive evaluation of the different WTE configurations has not yet been fully investigated in Iran. The present study aims to evaluate both the energy and economic aspects of different WTE technologies in a case study in Iran. The possible strategies evaluated in this study include recovery of landfill gas (LFG), incineration, and anaerobic digestion (AD). Economic analysis was assessed through the net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and the levelized cost of energy (LCOE). All the estimations were computed over a period of 20 years starting in 2020 and ending in 2040. Based on LandGEM, which was used to predict the landfill's annual biogas flow, the maximum biogas production was found to be 27.7 million m(3) in 2034. The average annual energy production of the incineration, AD, and LFG were 20.65, 7.27, and 1.60 GWh, respectively, indicating incineration had the greatest potential for energy generation. Nevertheless, the AD scenario was found to be the most profitable with a positive NPV of 4.72 million USD, IRR of 17%, and the lowest LCOE of 0.05 USD/kWh. On the other hand, the incineration was found to be economically infeasible. Our results show that there is enormous potential to convert MSW into energy. Iranian governors should pay more attention to WTE approaches and promote recycling programs to increase the efficiency of AD plants.

TI Selection of waste-to-energy technology for distributed generation using
   IDOCRIW-Weighted TOPSIS method: A case study of the City of
   Johannesburg, South Africa
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB Waste-to-energy has evolved as a promising solution for sustainable power generation as well and waste management. To effectively harness the potential of the waste-to-energy technologies in a sustainable manner, an optimal choice among the diverse technologies is highly essential. The multi-dimensional nature of waste management makes selection of appropriate waste-to-energy option a complex problem. Therefore, a simple and computationally efficient decision tool is required to aid decision making. In this paper, a novel hybrid multi-criteria method based on IDOCRIW and TOPSIS are proposed for optimal selection of the appropriate waste-to-energy technologies for distributed generation. Fourteen criteria were considered spanning through technical, economic, environmental and social factors. Five technologies such as anaerobic digestion, landfill gas recovery, incineration, pyrolysis and gasification were selected due to their level of maturity and availability. The proposed model was tested using the City of Johannesburg, South Africa as a case study. The overall results indicated that anaerobic digestion is the most attractive technology with a relative closeness of 0.9724 to the ideal solution while incineration is ranked worst with a closeness of 0.6474 to the ideal solution. The result also revealed that the integration of anaerobic digestion and gasification could be more promising in terms of waste management. It could also be a good candidate for distributed generation in a microgrid application by serving as a local power generator when integrated to waste management systems of the City of Johannesburg.

TI Environmental and economic assessment of sustainable municipal solid
   waste management strategies in Iran
SO SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB Waste management in urban areas has always been a major concern for municipalities. The gigantic population growth results in massive waste production, leading to a worrying rise in the level of greenhouse gas emissions, a major global issue. The most common techniques for energy recovery from waste are WTE and landfill gas plants. In this research, four different waste management scenarios have been investigated, and the emitted GHGs are analysed using the IPCC guideline for municipal solid waste (MSW) in Tehran. Furthermore, the total cost of each scenario is calculated. Also, effect of various parameters, such as plant usage, methane recovery factor, and MSW heating value, on the emissions is evaluated. The results depict that among all the investigated alternatives, scenario 3 (in which 50 % of the waste was burned in WTE plant, 30 % landfilled, and 20 % recycled) has the least GHG emissions in the target region. For a more thorough analysis, a cost comparison between the scenarios was performed, indicating that landfilling with recovery is the most economical option. Focusing on various technical, economic, and environmental aspects of waste management, this paper provides a comprehensive framework for a combined plan of action in the waste management sector of Iran.

TI A multi-objective location inventory routing problem with pricing
   decisions in a sustainable waste management system
SO SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB This paper presents a multi-objective optimization model for a sustainable municipal solid waste management system, emphasizing recycling and waste-to-energy technologies. The objective functions attempt to minimize total net cost, greenhouse gas emissions, and total waste collection and treatment time. The social aspect of the system is controlled by assessing the social performance of waste treatment technologies. The novel feature of this study is incorporating pricing decisions into the traditional location-allocation-routing-inventory waste management problems. The model is implemented on a case study in the southeast part of Tehran and is solved using the Lexicographic and AUGMECON2 approaches. Comparing the results of these methods indicates that considering all three objective functions as equally important leads to 21.5% more costs and 27% less environmental effects, comparing when minimizing costs is the priority. Moreover, results suggest establishing a landfill with gas recovery, material recovery facility, and composting plant with capacities of 700, 500, and 1170 tons/day. The model's outcomes suggest considering a minimum social performance score between 1.5 and 2.5 for the system under study regarding the impact of social performance on the objective functions

TI Sustainability of composting as an alternative waste management option
   for developing countries: a case study of the City of Tshwane
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Excessive MSW production is a growing management problem for cities in developing countries, such as South Africa. This study addresses these challenges with particular focus on the City of Tshwane. A major problem in Tshwane is that all the MSW generated in the city, including garden waste, is currently being landfilled. A waste stream analysis of Tshwane reveals the largest fraction of MSW is organic and biodegradable, and therefore suitable for compost production. The study proposes that Tshwane will have to address composting the biodegradable fraction of the MSW stream. This study attempts to understand the economics of composting practices in Tshwane, whether composting in Tshwane is financially viable. A comparative study, applying the dome aeration technology on a conventional static windrow, was conducted with the objective of investigating and proposing alternative improved composting technologies for green waste. Although the study focused on Tshwane, it can be argued that the findings could be implemented in any other South African municipality, and even implemented in other emerging countries.

TI Assessing the environmental sustainability of energy recovery from
   municipal solid waste in the UK
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Even though landfilling of waste is the least favourable option in the waste management hierarchy, the majority of municipal solid waste (MSW) in many countries is still landfilled. This represents waste of valuable resources and could lead to higher environmental impacts compared to energy recovered by incineration, even if the landfill gas is recovered. Using life cycle assessment (LCA) as a tool, this paper aims to find out which of the following two options for MSW disposal is more environmentally sustainable: incineration or recovery of biogas from landfills, each producing either electricity or co-generating heat and electricity. The systems are compared on a life cycle basis for two functional units: 'disposal of 1 tonne of MSW' and 'generation of 1 kWh of electricity'. The results indicate that, if both systems are credited for their respective recovered energy and recyclable materials, energy from incineration has much lower impacts than from landfill biogas across all impact categories, except for human toxicity. The impacts of incineration co-generating heat and electricity are negative for nine out of 11 categories as the avoided impacts for the recovered energy and materials are higher than those caused by incineration. By improving the recovery rate of biogas, some impacts of landfilling, such as global warming, depletion of fossil resources, acidification and photochemical smog, would be significantly reduced. However, most impacts of the landfill gas would still be higher than the impacts of incineration, except for global warming and human toxicity. The analysis on the basis of net electricity produced shows that the LCA impacts of electricity from incineration are several times lower in comparison to the impacts of electricity from landfill biogas. Electricity from incineration has significantly lower global warming and several other impacts than electricity from coal and oil but has higher impacts than electricity from natural gas or UK grid. At the UK level, diverting all MSW currently landfilled to incineration with energy recovery would not only avoid the environmental impacts associated with landfilling but, under the current assumptions, would also meet 2.3% of UK's electricity demand and save 2-2.6 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per year.

TI The circular economy potential of urban organic waste streams in low-
   and middle-income countries
SO ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB There is growing recognition of the potential environmental and socio-economic benefits of applying a circular approach to urban organic waste management through resource recovery. Decisions around planning and implementing circular urban waste systems require estimates of the quantity of resources available in waste streams and their potential market value. However, studies assessing circular economy potential have so-far been conducted mostly in high-income countries, yet cities in low- and middle-income countries have different challenges when developing a circular economy. This paper addresses this gap by estimating the resource recovery potential of organic waste streams in the context of low- and middle-income countries, illustrated with the case of Kampala, Uganda. A simplified material flow analysis approach is used to track the transformation of waste streams, namely faecal sludge, sewage sludge and organic solid waste into the resource recovery products biogas, solid fuel, black soldier fly larvae and compost. Findings indicate that even at current rates of waste collection, the three waste streams combined could annually yield 135,000 tonnes of solid fuel or 39.6 million Nm(3) of biogas or 15,000 tonnes of black soldier fly larvae or 108,000 tonnes of compost and revenues from the products could range from 5.1 million USD from compost to 47 million USD from biogas. The results demonstrate how complex information describing urban waste can be presented to facilitate decision making and planning by stakeholders. By highlighting different resource recovery opportunities, application of this approach could provide an incentive for more sustainable urban sanitation and waste management systems.

AB Municipal solid waste management (MSWM) is one of the major environmental problems of Indian cities. Solid waste is defined as the material, which arises from various human activities and which is normally discarded as useless and unwanted. Improper management of municipal solid waste (MSW) causes hazards to inhabitants. Various studies reveal that about 90% of MSW is disposed off unscientifically in open dumps and landfills, creating problems to public health and the environment. In the present paper a survey of case studies conducted on MSWM in few cities across India is reviewed to gain insight into solid waste management. Several data concerning SWM in Bangalore has been collected to understand the problems being faced by Bangaloreans. An exclusive survey is carried out within the campus of Reva Institute of Technology, Bangalore to quantify the waste generation and to come up with a feasible SWM solution which can be implemented within the campus.

TI Drivers and constraints of waste-to-energy incineration for sustainable
   municipal solid waste management in developing countries
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Implementation of waste-to-energy (WtE) incineration has recently surged in developing countries, but the drivers of this growth and the constraints on WtE project sustainability in local contexts remain incompletely understood. We aimed to identify these drivers and constraints in developing countries using Hanoi Capital, Vietnam, as a case study. Face-to-face interviews and a field survey were employed to investigate stakeholders' opinions and consolidate WtE-related information to identify drivers. The main drivers were the current limited treatment capability, local opposition to current strategies, introduction of legislative incentives and landfilling restrictions, the Hanoi government's involvement, the example set by the existing WtE plant in Can Tho, increasing waste generation with increasing land scarcity, competitive tipping fees, and introduction of a public-private-partnership model. Some of these identified drivers eliminated historical Vietnamese WtE barriers. Constraints were determined by evaluating the interview results and local data from the field survey. These constraints had legal aspects (e.g., overlapping agency responsibilities), as well as financial (e.g., low tipping fees), technical/technological (e.g., unsorted waste), environmental (e.g., lack of stringent flue gas controls), and social (public opposition to plants) aspects. The evidence presented here could help secure waste treatment capacity through sustainable WtE incineration in other fast-growing cities.

Owing to waste variety and its scattered sites of production, selecting the most proper solid waste treatment is difficult. Simultaneously, social concern about environmental sustainability rises every day and, as a consequence, improvement on waste treatment systems is being demanded. However, when a waste treatment system is being designed, not only environmental but also technical and economic issues should be considered.

TI Assessment of Integration between Lactic Acid, Biogas and Hydrochar
   Production in OFMSW Plants
SO ENERGIES
AB Biological treatments such as anaerobic digestion and composting are known to be the most widespread methods to deal with Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste (OFMSW). The production of biogas, a mix of methane and carbon dioxide, is worth but alone cannot solve the problems of waste disposal and recovery; moreover, the digestate could be stabilized by aerobic stabilization, which is one of the most widespread methods. The anaerobic digestion + composting integration converts 10% to 14% of the OFMSW into biogas, about 35-40% into compost and 35-40% into leachate. The economic sustainability could be rather increased by integrating the whole system with lactic acid production, because of the high added value and by substituting the composting process with the hydrothermal carbonization process. The assessment of this integrated scenario in term of mass balance demonstrates that the recovery of useful products with a potentially high economic added value increases, at the same time reducing the waste streams outgoing the plant. The economic evaluation of the operating costs for the traditional and the alternative systems confirms that the integration is a valid alternative and the most interesting solution is the utilization of the leachate produced during the anaerobic digestion process instead of fresh water required for the hydrothermal carbonization process.

TI An Empirical Study on Greenhouse Gas Emission Calculations Under
   Different Municipal Solid Waste Management Strategies
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The Chinese government is committed to ensuring separation of municipal solid waste (MSW), promoting the integrated development of the MSW management system with the renewable resource recovery system, and achieving construction of ecological civilization. Guided by the methods in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions under five waste disposal scenarios in Beijing under the life cycle framework were assessed in this research. The study included collection and transportation, as well as three end disposal methods (sanitary landfill, incineration, and composting), and the emission reduction benefits of electricity generation from incineration and recycling of renewable resources were taken into account. The results show that an emission reduction benefit of 70.82% could be achieved under Scenario 5 in which kitchen waste and recyclables are sorted and recycled and the residue is incinerated, and the selection of the optimal strategy was not affected by changes in the separation rate. In addition, landfill would emit more GHG than incineration and composting. The results of this study are helpful for the government to make a decision on MSW management considering the goal of GHG emission reduction.

AB Environmental life cycle impact assessment (E-LCA) has been widely used to quantify the accompanying environmental impact potentials of municipal solid waste (MSW) management and treatment processes. This study reviewed findings of from various E-LCA of anaerobic digestion of biodegradable MSW fractions. Study findings have shown potential of the AD of biomass in contributing to the universal assess of electricity and limiting the emission of GHG responsible for global warming or climate change. However, majority of E-LCA studies reviewed are from Europe whose biogas production is on the rise. The AD of biodegradable MSW fractions can reduce the environmental impacts across several impact categories with net negative global warming impacts likely due to its renewable energy production capabilities. Governments in Sub Saharan Africa should put in place mechanisms that will address issues regarding to low AD uptake which could potentially contribute to universal access to electricity considering the over 600 million people reported not to have electricity access in SSA. There is also the need to increase the penetration of LCA in Africa to aid the development of AD systems. Issues to do with technical expertise, technical capacity, cost, and incentives for the uptake of AD should be of great consideration amongst policy makers in SSA.

TI Economic and environmental assessment of electricity generation using
   biogas and heat energy from municipal solid waste: A case study of
   Lesotho
SO AIMS ENERGY
AB This study examined the potential of electricity generation from biogas and heat energy arising from municipal solid waste (MSW) collected from the year 2021 to 2045 using anaerobic digestion (AD) and incineration (INC) technologies. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the economic and environmental benefits of implementing the aforementioned technologies in Lesotho. The environmental impact was assessed by using the life cycle assessment strategy based on global warming potential for three scenarios, while the economic assessment was carried out by using the net present value (NPV), levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and total life cycle cost. The key findings show that, over 25 years (2021-2045), MSW generation will range from 185.855 to 513.587 kilotons. The methane yield for the duration of the project for AD technology is 44.67-126.56 thousand cubic meters per year. Moreover, the electricity generation will range from 0.336-0.887 GWh for AD technology and 17.15-45.34 GWh for INC technology. Economically, the results demonstrated that the two waste-to-energy technologies are viable, as evidenced by their positive NPV. The NPV for AD was about USD 0.514 million, and that for INC technology was USD 339.65 million. AD and INC have LCOEs of 0.029 and 0.0023 USD/kWh, respectively. The findings demonstrate that AD can minimize the potential for global warming by 95%, signifying a huge environmental advantage. This paper serves to provide the government, as well as the investors, with current and trustworthy information on waste- to-energy technologies in terms of costs, execution and worldwide effect, which could aid optimal decision-making in waste-to-energy projects in Lesotho.

TI Environmental performance of bioplastic packaging on fresh food produce:
   A consequential life cycle assessment
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Polylactic acid (PLA) is a compostable bio-based plastic that can be used for food packaging, potentially increasing separation of (packaged) food waste for targeted, more circular organic waste management via anaerobic digestion, industrial composting, or (in the future) insect protein meal feed production. Consequential life cycle assessment (LCA) was undertaken to rigorously assess the environmental impact of displacing petrochemical plastic packaging of fresh fruit and vegetables with PLA. Eight end-of-life scenarios of bioplastic packaging were evaluated against a business-as-usual petrochemical packaging scenario, expanding LCA boundaries to include end-of-life impacts of fruit and vegetable food waste within a UK context. PLA production has a higher impact compared with petrochemical plastic production across many impact categories, but diversion of PLA-packaged food waste to organic recycling can compensate for this, improving the overall environmental performance of bioplastic packaging scenarios. Future diversion of organic waste streams to insect feed (following regulatory change) would lead to the best environmental outcomes, followed by anaerobic digestion. Impact categories ameliorated in bioplastic scenarios include human health effects, climate change, freshwater eutrophication, ionising radiation, photochemical ozone formation, resource use energy carriers, and respiratory inorganics. On the other hand, petrochemical plastic scenarios generate smaller burdens for acidification, marine and terrestrial eutrophication, ozone depletion, and water scarcity. Sensitivity analyses indicate high improvement potential for bioplastic scenarios if the energy efficiency of PLA production can be increased, or if globalised production shifts to industrialised countries with cleaner energy mixes (that currently import most of their plastics). Whilst end-of-life management of the fruit and vegetable food waste has a considerable influence on environmental outcomes, plastic packaging represents a surprisingly large share of the dry matter material flow (about 25%) in fresh produce waste streams. Therefore, it is imperative that future LCA studies of food packaging account for both packaging and (diverted) food waste end-of-life flows.

TI Characterization, quantification and management of China's municipal
   solid waste in spatiotemporal distributions: A review
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is a heterogeneous waste stream, which is harmful for human health and the ecological environment if it is not well managed. Based on results from different authors by analyzing the generation, physical components and management of MSW from different cities, this paper presents an overview of the temporal trends and spatial variation characterization of MSW generation and its physical components in China. Total MSW generation has increased from 31,320 thousand tons in 1980 to 178,602 thousand tons in 2014, and MSW generation per capita has also increased from 448.3 g to 653.2 g. The distribution of MSW generation is mostly concentrated in the coastal southeastern region, as well as large point sources of more than 200 thousand tons per year are mostly distributed in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Hebei and Guangdong provinces. The review shows that the largest proportion of food waste, plastics and paper is 61.2% (54.2-65.9%, 95% CI), 9.8% (7.2-14.0%, 95% CI), 9.6% (6.7-12.3%, 95% CI), respectively, in 2014; the best estimates of other waste were as follows: 3.1% textile, 2.1% glass, 1.1% metal, 1.8% wood and grass, 1.3% rubber and leather, 1.8% ceramic, 2.5% rash, 1.2% hazardous waste, and 4.5% miscellaneous. To better manage China's MSW, several possible and appropriate solutions (e.g., concentrating on key regions, intensifying source separation, promoting green lifestyle, and establishing specialized regulations and policies) should be adopted, which might facilitate the application of China's 13th Five, and identify gaps in our knowledge of MSW management subject.

TI Anaerobic co-digestion of sewage sludge, food waste and yard waste:
   Synergistic enhancement on process stability and biogas production
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Anaerobic co-digestion (co-AD) could be a more sustainable waste management solution by sharing the existed anaerobic digestion (AD) facilities and generating more biogas energy. In this study, a series of co-AD of different urban derived organic wastes (sewage sludge-SS, food waste-FW, yard waste-YW) were conducted in a semi-continuous mode, and the corresponding dynamic evolutions of microbial community structure were followed by using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). As for co-AD of two feedstocks, introduction of SS (25%, VS basis) in Mr significantly improved the process stability and archaea/total microbe ratio (from 0.4% to 17.1%), which might be due to the regulating effect of abundant trace metals in SS; co-AD of SS (25%, VS basis) with \NV improved the methane yield by 2.04 times than AD of YW only together with higher methane contents (57.4 +/- 1.3% vs. 50.9 +/- 2.2%); in co-AD of FW and YW, synergistic effects in terms of increased methane production (3.4-19.1%) were observed, which was correlated with more robust growth of both bacteria and archaea. As for co-AD of three feedstocks, high methane yields of 314.9 +/- 17.1 mL/g VS were achieved with a reliable stability. These findings could provide some fundamental and technical information for the co-treatment of urban derived organic wastes in centralized AD facilities. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Scandals and public dangers from the mismanagement and poor disposal of hazardous wastes during the 1960s and 1970s awakened the modern-day environmental movement. Influential publications such as "Silent Spring" (1) and high-profile disposal failures, for example, Love Canal and Lekkerkerk, focused attention on the use of chemicals in everyday life and the potential dangers from inappropriate disposal. This attention has not abated and developments, invariably increasing expectations and tightening requirements, continue to be implemented. Waste, as a surrogate for environmental improvement, is a topic where elected representatives and administrations continually want to do more. This article will chart the recent changes in hazardous waste management emanating from the European Union legislation, now being implemented in Member States across the continent. These developments widen. the range of discarded materials regarded as "hazardous," prohibit the use of specific chemicals, prohibit the use of waste management options, shift the emphasis from risk-based treatment and disposal to inclusive lists, and incorporate waste producers into more stringent regulatory regimes. The impact of the changes is also intended to provide renewed impetus for waste reduction. Under an environmental control system where only certainty is tolerated, the opportunities for innovation within the industry and the waste treatment and disposal sector will be explored. A challenging analysis will be offered on the impact of this regulation-led approach to the nature and sustainability of hazardous waste treatment and disposal in the future.

TI The role of management instruments in the diversion of organic municipal
   solid waste and phosphorus recycling
SO FACETS
AB Organic waste, which contains essential plant nutrients such as phosphorus, constitutes 30%-50% of municipal solid waste in developed countries. Unfortunately, much of this resource is buried in land-fills or incinerated. Many jurisdictions have, therefore, adopted the diversion of organic waste and the recycling of nutrients as policy goals. We used data sets from Europe and Ontario, Canada, to explore the impact of socio-economic and management factors on the rates of organic waste diversion and examined the effect of this diversion on phosphorus recycling. Organic diversion rates were highly correlated with income in Europe and with infrastructure, such as source-separated organic waste collection, in Ontario. Significant correlations were also observed between diversion rates and the use of policy instruments such as economic incentives, legislative organic waste bans, and curbside bag limits. We estimated that 39%-63% of the phosphorus in diverted organics is returned to arable land. Ultimately, we found that although socio-economic factors influence the success of organic waste diversion, policies, accessible infrastructure, economic incentives, and legislative requirements can be leveraged to improve the recycling rate of organic waste and the nutrients they contain.

TI Stakeholder coordination analysis in hazardous waste management: a case
   study in China
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Hazardous waste management (HWM) in chemical industrial parks is an important issue related to sustainable development. Previous researches concentrations on HWM have been transferred from technologies, economic, and ecological benefits to social relations because the coordination and cooperation among different stakeholders determine the efficiency of HWM. To analyze stakeholder coordination in HWM, this paper employed a mixed-method combined with stakeholder analysis(SA) and social network analysis(SNA), for analyzing interests, powers, attitudes, knowledge of different stakeholders, and the characteristics, power quantification of the stakeholders' coordination network, by chosen Shanghai Hangzhou bay economic and technical development park(SHDP) as a case study area. In hazardous waste management, governmental supervision has enough interest but less power and with the complete knowledge on, third-party supervision has a medium interest but less knowledge to support their supervision, firms have the lowest power but interest, waste treatment and disposal company have most power and interest but limited knowledge. NGOs, research institutes and media have interest and knowledge but less power. Most stakeholders have positive attitude. We also find that local supervisions play an important role in stakeholder coordination, and NGOs and research institutes have the most potential to push stakeholder coordination by improving information exchange. Therefore, policy recommendations are proposed, including the establishment of communication mechanisms, the adoption of hazardous treatment regulations and economic instruments, the application of a platform for information exchange, and the encouragement of stakeholders' engagement and public participation.

TI Weight-based pay-as-you-throw pricing model: Encouraging sorting in
   households through waste fees
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Municipal solid waste is associated with different systemic challenges, such as climate change, resource scarcity, and ocean plastic pollution. European countries are striving towards more circular material use and the European Commission has advocated the use of economic incentives to boost recycling. The pay-as-you-throw (PAYT) scheme is an economic instrument that applies the 'polluter pays' principle by charging for waste according to the actual amount of generated waste. Volume-based PAYT fees have shown to be potentially less effective in waste prevention and recycling than weight-based fees. This paper illustrates how waste management operators can price residual waste with weight-based fees that encourage recycling, are fair with respect to service levels, and cover the current income for municipal waste operators. The result, obtained by forming equations satisfying the above conditions, is a model with a linear, discrete price function, where the price of the residual waste generated by the citizen is a function of the service level. This model encourages efficient source separation through internal subsidies, wherein a citizen can decrease the price of household waste by 32% if they increase the sorting efficiency from a default of 40% to 80% efficiency. The application of the model was illustrated in a case example. The model developed in this study can be used to implement weight-based PAYT schemes locally, thereby supporting the formulation of waste management systems that facilitate waste reduction and recycling.

AB The updated Bioeconomy Strategy document "A sustainable bioeconomy for Europe: strengthening the connection between economy, society and the environment", which was issued by the European Commission in October 2018, encourages the exploitation of organic wastes according to a pyramidal hierarchy in which the extraction of valuable biomolecules, which will be used as they are or as precursors of high-added-value compounds, is a priority in biofuel production. This review considers a biorefinery platform in which food waste and sewage sludge are adopted to produce volatile fatty acids (VFAs) through a dark fermentation process. VFA fermentation is optimized by slightly acid pH (6-7), short hydraulic retention time (1-7 days) and high organic load rate (more than 10 gTS L-1 d(-1)). Attention has been focused on VFA exploitation for polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production via a 'feast and famine' strategy performed in sequencing batch reactors. The obtained PHA yields are around 0.4-0.5 gPHA gCOD(-1). Moreover, VFAs allow for the production of biofuels, such as hydrogen and methane, through single- or double-staged anaerobic digestion. Innovative bioelectrochemical upgrade strategies for biogas helps producers to obtain biomethane for the automotive sector. Moreover, biogas has recently been tested for the production of polyhydroxybutyrate, a biodegradable and biocompatible thermoplastic made by microorganisms from C1 carbon sources (CO2 and CH4). Digestates from anaerobic bioreactors are still rich in nitrogen and phosphorus compounds. These latter compounds have been identified as critical raw materials due to their low availability in the European Union and to increasing demand from the growing global population. Thus, nutrient recovery from digestate allows users to close the loop of the 'circular economy' approach. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

TI Statistical analysis in MSW collection performance assessment
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The increase of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) generated over the last years forces waste managers pursuing more effective collection schemes, technically viable, environmentally effective and economically sustainable. The assessment of MSW services using performance indicators plays a crucial role for improving service quality. In this work, we focus on the relevance of regular system monitoring as a service assessment tool. In particular, we select and test a core-set of MSW collection performance indicators (effective collection distance, effective collection time and effective fuel consumption) that highlights collection system strengths and weaknesses and supports pro-active management decision-making and strategic planning. A statistical analysis was conducted with data collected in mixed collection system of Oporto Municipality, Portugal, during one year, a week per month. This analysis provides collection circuits' operational assessment and supports effective short-term municipality collection strategies at the level of, e.g., collection frequency and timetables, and type of containers.

AB Anaerobic fermentation (AF) is a widely used process for the transformation of organic waste into biogas. However, despite its ubiquitous use, it has several limiting factors, including low yield, redox imbalance, high concentration of inhibitors, and a long retention time. Integration of pyrolysis with AF improves efficiency and facilitates effective biomass utilization in a closed-loop approach. Research trends emphasize the inclusion of biochar derived from biomass to improve the stability and efficiency of AF and facilitate biogas up-gradation (H2S removal). However, there is a lack of consolidated scientific understanding regarding the complex interactions of biochar and AF microbial communities, in addition to its potential amendment advantages. Therefore, this review summarizes biomass utilization for biochar production using various pyrolysis methods and its use as an effective inclusion material to improve AF performance. Specifically, the influence of biochar amendments in AF is discussed in terms of microbial colonization, direct interspecies electron transfer, minimization of organic load, and buffering maintenance. Moreover, the role of AF digestate biochar in nutrient recycling and utilization as a soil conditioner is elaborated. The progressive integration of pyrolysis and AF offers the complete decoupling of biomass, enhances AF performance, and promotes the establishment of a sustainable bioprocess by inducing the circular bioeconomy.

TI Contradictory effects of calcium on biological and membrane treatment of
   municipal solid waste leachate: A review and process optimization via
   biogas recirculation
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) leachate is one of highly polluted wastewaters and requires pollution control for advanced treatment. However, high concentrations of calcium in the leachate would always affect the treatment performance. This review first summarized contradictory effects of calcium mainly on granule-based biological process and membrane fouling. From previous results, a calcium concentration of 1-100 mg/L was recommended to stimulate microbial growth and 10-150 mg/L to promote sludge granulation, while high-strength calcium (e. g., higher than 1000 mg/L) would severely suppress microbial activity or cause sludge mineralization. With respect to membrane treatment, 40-400 mg/L of calcium was found to mitigate membrane fouling with a lower or higher calcium content reported to aggravate the fouling. Excessive calcium in the MSW leachate needs to be removed and the carbonatation-based approach for calcium carbonate precipitation appears to be the most effective for the leachate. The carbonating techniques with diverse carbon sources were compared to remove calcium from waste streams, and in-situ biogas recirculation was demonstrated as a promising alternative. Through recirculating biogas into the MSW leachate, an optimized treatment was thus proposed by regulating appropriate calcium content to achieve a sustainable operational performance. Simultaneously, biogas purification by carbon dioxide capture and ammonia stripping by biogas sparging could be expected for better bioenergy recovery and reduced carbon dioxide emission. This novel process would be both economical-and environmental-effective, which supports a sustainable and energy-positive treatment for the MSW leachate.

TI Regional Waste Management: Multicriteria Modelling
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS: SUSTAINABILITY IN PRACTICE
AB This chapter is devoted to sustainable waste management. It summarises sonic recent work exploring the development of a multi-criteria optimisation tool for achieving sustainable solutions for municipal solid waste management systems (MSWMS). Aiming to provide a new methodological background for regional solid waste management modelling it takes into account spatial and temporal patterns of waste generation and processing, environmental as well as economic impacts of the system's development with a particular emphasis on public health and biodiversity.
   Three different approaches to the spatial-temporal analysis of the MSWMS are used together, namely a life cycle inventory analysis, which helps to identify emission patterns within the MSWMS, a multi-criteria optimisation approach, which helps to find compromise solutions among environmentally and economically preferred options, and a geographic information systems approach, which provides a tool for identifying waste management facilities, transportation environmental and social impacts; it also gives an analysis of environmental impacts on valuable ecosystems. A Russian methodology for calculating environmental damage was used to weight the importance of different sub-territories covered by the system as well as simplifying the analysis of emissions from waste treatment plants. The approach provides a new perspective for the analysis of municipal solid waste management systems on the regional scale. The principal novelty of the proposed complex MSW strategic management model is an integration of the different types of data: geographical, environmental and economic, using relational database technology.
   Simulations using the dataset for Gloucestershire illustrate the performance of a simplified version of the model. Simulations were undertaken to explore the potential effects on the waste management infrastructure of introducing the EU Landfill Directive. The chapter shows how methodological synthesis and a systems perspective give useful support to the decision-maker regarding potential development paths and trade-offs between the economic and environmental performance of a proposed waste management system.

TI Does China's Municipal Solid Waste Source Separation Program Work?
   Evidence from the Spatial-Two-Stage-Least Squares Models
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This paper evaluates the impact of the second municipal solid waste (MSW) source separation program on municipal solid waste generation (MSWG) in China. Without considering the spatial interactions between cities, the second MSW source separation program has a nonsignificant adverse effect on the per capita municipal solid waste generation (PMSWG). Relaxing the stable-unit-treatment-value assumption (SUTVA), which holds in most of the previous estimation literature on treatment effects, involving the spatial spillover effect among cities, as well as correcting the endogenous local policy has a significantly negative but not robust impact on the PMSWG. The estimation results of the generalized nesting spatial regression models (GNS) imply that the spatial interaction characteristics among Chinese prefecture-level cities may, if neglected, lead to underestimation of the reduction effects of the second MSW source separation policy on the absolute amount of PMSWG. More importantly, our study indicates that although not all the spatial econometric models support the significant reduction effect of source separation on the absolute amount of PMSWG, the source separation program significantly reduces the relative amount of PMSWG, and this result is robust in all spatial models.

TI Matrix method for evaluation of existing solid waste management system
   in Himachal Pradesh, India
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Effective management of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is an essential function of the city municipal corporation. The present study reports on the existing solid waste management practices in four major cities of Himachal Pradesh (Sunder Nagar, Mandi, Baddi and Solan) in India, and suggests solutions for better management of the MSW generated at these locations. The overall generation of Municipal Solid Waste in Himachal Pradesh (HP) is 350 tons per day (TPD) of which the selected sites accounts for about 25% of the total MSW generated in the state. The collection efficiency of generated MSW in the study regions varies from 60 to 70%. Evaluation of the existing Solid Waste Management (SWM) practices at these study locations was determined using the 'wasteaware' benchmark indicators, which incorporate parameters integrating both qualitative and quantitative indicators for comparing the efficiency of municipal solid waste management system. Further, a simple matrix method has been utilized for comparing the efficiency of the management of the MSW generated at these four selected sites in Himachal Pradesh. Using the matrix method, it was observed that Sunder Nagar and Mandi towns received an overall score of 36% and Solan and Baddi 32%, respectively. The overall results suggest that existing solid waste management practices in four study locations are very poor and need considerable improvement. Some key recommendations have been proposed for the better management MSW at the four study locations in HP.

TI Sustainable Environmental Management Through a Municipal Solid Waste
   Charging Scheme: A Hong Kong Perspective
SO FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) charging is a method of waste management that involves charging residents for garbage disposal. Due to the increasing levels of MSW, Hong Kong has planned to implement an MSW charging scheme in 2023. This article evaluates the potential efficacy and challenges of an MSW charging scheme in Hong Kong. We first summarize the experiences from Taipei and Seoul, which are two typical cities that have successfully implemented the charging scheme to handle MSW. Strong enforcement and good supportive resources in the two cities have resulted in highly effective MSW management. We then provide an IPAT analysis of the urgency of Hong Kong's MSW concerns and a PEST analysis of the readiness of Hong Kong to implement MSW charging. We highlight the challenges with actionable suggestions for sustainable environmental management.

TI Analysis of municipal solid waste incineration plants for promoting
   power generation efficiency in Taiwan
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Taiwan is a developed nation with approximately 98 % of its energy supplied by imported fuels. In this regard, the efficient energy utilization of municipal solid waste (MSW) is thus becoming attractive in Taiwan because the production of electricity from this source in 2012 has increased to 3,057 GWh, of which 2,350 GWh, or 76.8 %, was connected to the public grid system with the revenues of US$ 154 million. According to the official statistics on the operation status of MSW incineration plants with design capacity of over 300 ton/day in Taiwan, a preliminary analysis of power generation efficiencies for 24 large-scale MSW incineration plants was carried out in the paper. It showed that the energy efficiencies of MSW incineration plants in Taiwan were relatively low with a gross value of 16.2 % in recent years (2008-2012). This meant that a majority of produced heat was discharged into the atmosphere without efficient recovery. As a consequence, the central competent authority in Taiwan is currently planning a promotion policy for combining the district heating and cooling system with waste heat from all MSW incineration plants, which aims at a 30 % increase in the overall energy efficiency.

TI The municipal solid waste management of La Paz (Bolivia): Challenges and
   opportunities for a sustainable development
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Municipal solid waste management (MSWM) is considered an important public health, economic and environmental concern, especially in developing countries. This paper introduces the situation of MSWM in La Paz (Bolivia) in 2016, and is based on the Wasteaware indicators and waste flow analysis, useful tools for classifying and comparing waste treatment and management plans among other countries. Taking into account the lack of technology in waste treatment and the presence of a developed informal sector, the paper analyses the main strengths and weak points for implementing a sustainable MSWM. The research conducted revealed that the MSWM of La Paz is not efficient with regard to collection, recycling (8%), financial sustainability, and equity of the service. At the same time, local Government and stakeholders are interested in implementing new MSWM methods for improving the current sanitary state of the city and many efforts were made over the last ten years. In general terms, La Paz could be considered as a good study area for developing plans for waste valorization, becoming an example for a low-middle income developing big city of Latin America. The study provided a few considerations about the affordability of the methodology applied and critically analyzed the case study proposed.

TI Mesophilic co-digestion of municipal solid waste and sewage sludge:
   Effect of mixing ratio, total solids, and alkaline pretreatment
SO INTERNATIONAL BIODETERIORATION & BIODEGRADATION
AB A large number of biogas plants feeding with municipal solid waste (MSW) are installed throughout the world. However, researches are widely conducted with the aim of maximizing the process yield, in order to make it more comparable with fossil fuels. In the present paper, biomethane potential test (BMP) assays (37 degrees C) were conducted to maximize the biomethane production from anaerobic digestion (AD) of municipal solid waste (MSW) under different mixing ratios with sewage sludge (SS) (50:50, 60:40, 80:20, and 90:10), the total solid (TS) concentrations (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%), and pretreatment with sodium hydroxide. Increase in SS ratio up to 40% led to a substantial increase in biomethane yield. After 18 days of retention time, 90% of the methane (280 NmL/g VS) was achieved. The results showed that the methane yield in liquid anaerobic digestion (L-AD) (5%-10% TS) was greater than high-solids anaerobic digestion (HS-AD) (15%-20% TS). Biomethane yield was increased up to 18% with sodium hydroxide pretreatment. The findings shows that such optimization framework can generally increase the biomethane yield up to 57%.

SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
CT 5th Asian-Pacific Landfill Symposium
CY OCT 22-24, 2008
CL Sapporo, JAPAN
AB Life cycle assessment for sewage sludge treatment was carried out by estimating the environmental and economic impacts of the six alternative scenarios most often used in Japan: dewatering, composting, drying, incineration, incinerated ash melting and dewatered sludge melting, each with or without digestion. Three end-of-life treatments were also studied: landfilling, agricultural application and building material application. The results demonstrate that sewage sludge digestion can reduce the environmental load and cost through reduced dry matter volume. The global warming potential (GWP) generated from incineration and melting processes can be significantly reduced through the reuse of waste heat for electricity and/or heat generation. Equipment production in scenarios except dewatering has an important effect oil GWP, whereas the contribution of construction is negligible. In addition, the results show that the dewatering scenario has the highest impact on land use and cost, the drying scenario has the highest impact on GWP and acidification, and the incinerated ash melting scenario has the highest impact on human toxicity due to re-emissions of heavy metals from incinerated ash in the melting unit process. 017 the contrary, the dewatering, composting and incineration scenarios generate the lowest impact on human toxicity, land use and acidification, respectively, and the incinerated ash melting scenario has the lowest impact on GWP and cost. Heavy metals released from atmospheric effluents generated the highest human toxicity impact, with the effect of dioxin emissions being significantly lower. This study proved that the dewatered sludge melting scenario is an environmentally optimal and economically affordable method. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Solid-phase fluorescence spectroscopy to characterize organic wastes
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The production of solid organic waste (SOW) such as sewage sludge (SS) or municipal solid waste (MSW) has been continuously increasing in Europe since the beginning of the 1990'. Today, the European Union encourages the stabilization of these wastes using biologic processes such as anaerobic digestion and/or composting to produce bio-energy and organic fertilizers. However, the design and management of such biologic processes require knowledge about the quantity and quality of the organic matter (OM) contained in the SOW. The current methods to characterize SOW are tedious, time-consuming and often insufficiently informative. In this paper, we assess the potential of solid-phase fluorescence (SPF) spectroscopy to quickly provide a relevant characterization of SOW. First, we tested well known model compounds (tryptophan, bovine serum albumin, lignin and humic acid) and biologic matrix (Escherichia coli) in three dimensional solid-phase fluorescence (3D-SPF) spectroscopy. We recorded fluorescence spectra from proteinaceous samples but we could not record the fluorescence emitted by lignin and humic acid powders. For SOW samples, fluorescence spectra were successfully recorded for MSW and most of its sub-components (foods, cardboard) but impossible for SS, sludge compost (SC) and ligno-cellulosic wastes. Based on visual observations and additional assays, we concluded that the presence of highly light-absorptive chemical structures in such dark-colored samples was responsible for this limitation. For such samples, i.e. lignin, humic acid, SS, SC and ligno-cellulosic wastes, we show that laser induced fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopy enables the acquisition of 2D fluorescence spectra.

TI A Neural Network Model for Decision-Making with Application in Sewage
   Sludge Management
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Wastewater treatment (WWT) is a foremost challenge for maintaining the health of ecosystems and human beings; the waste products of the water-treatment process can be a problem or an opportunity. The sewage sludge (SS) produced during sewage treatment can be considered a waste to be disposed of in a landfill or as a source for obtaining raw material to be used as a fertilizer, building material, or alternative fuel source suitable for co-incineration in a high-temperature furnace. To this concern, this study's purpose consisted of developing a decision model, supported by an Artificial Neural Network (ANN model), allowing us to identify the most effective sludge management strategy in economic terms. Consistent with the aim of the work, the suitable SS treatment was identified, selecting for each phase of the SS treatment, an alternative available on the market ensuring energy and/or matter recovery, in line with the circular water value chain. Results show that the ANN model identifies the suitable SS treatments on multiple factors, thus supporting the decision-making and identifying the solution as per user requirements.

TI Home composting as an alternative treatment option for organic household
   waste in Denmark: An environmental assessment using life cycle
   assessment-modelling
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB An environmental assessment of the management of organic household waste (OHW) was performed from a life cycle perspective by means of the waste-life cycle assessment (LCA) model EASEWASTE. The focus was on home composting of OHW in Denmark and six different home composting units (with different input and different mixing frequencies) were modelled. In addition, incineration and landfilling was modelled as alternatives to home composting. The most important processes contributing to the environmental impact of home composting were identified as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (load) and the avoided emissions in relation to the substitution of fertiliser and peat when compost was used in hobby gardening (saving). The replacement of fertiliser and peat was also identified as one of the most sensible parameters, which could potentially have a significant environmental benefit. Many of the impact categories (especially human toxicity via water (HTw) and soil (HTs)) were affected by the heavy metal contents of the incoming OHW. The concentrations of heavy metals in the compost were below the threshold values for compost used on land and were thus not considered to constitute a problem. The GHG emissions were, on the other hand, dependent on the management of the composting units. The frequently mixed composting units had the highest GHG emissions. The environmental profiles of the home composting scenarios were in the order of -2 to 16 milli person equivalents (mPE) Mg(-1) wet waste (ww) for the non-toxic categories and -0.9 to 28 mPE Mg(-1) ww for the toxic categories. Home composting performed better than or as good as incineration and landfilling in several of the potential impact categories. One exception was the global warming (GW) category, in which incineration performed better due to the substitution of heat and electricity based on fossil fuels. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Metabolic Transformations in the Area of Municipal Solid Waste
   Management in Russian Megalopolises: The City of Moscow Case
SO CHANGING SOCIETIES & PERSONALITIES
AB Based on secondary data analysis and semi-structured expert interviews (n = 90), the study analyses metabolic transformations in the area of municipal solid waste (MSW) management in Russian megalopolises using the city of Moscow as a case study. The findings suggest that the key node that triggered numerous interdependent processes involved the changes introduced in the legislation on MSW management and the decision to shut down several large MSW landfills without the simultaneous implementation of other landfills. These actions affected the health of the population and contributed to environmental inequality. The authors provide recommendations for the mitigation of risks associated with MSW generation, recycling, and storage in large Russian cities.

TI A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF ISSUES, CHALLENGES AND STRATEGIES OF BIO-WASTE
   MANAGEMENT IN INDIA AND ITALY
SO DETRITUS
AB The aim of the present study is to compare the current level of implementation of bio-waste management in Italy and India. Italy generates about 1.33 kg/per capita/ day of municipal solid waste (MSW). Bio-waste makes up about 30% of the whole MSW generated and about 60% is recycled. The main process is by aerobic composting, whereas anaerobic digestion is used to a limited extent. In India waste production ranges from about 0.20 kg/per capita/day to about 0.60 kg/per capita/day. The amount of recycling of this waste is very poor and there is a lack of treatment facilities. Anaerobic digestion for the Indian scenario could be a suitable solution for co-treatment of bio-waste with other biodegradable materials in order to supply energy and fuel in rural areas. The main differences between the two countries concerning waste and in particular bio-waste management are mainly the recycling strategies, end of waste criteria and energy recovery perspective.

AB In many countries, lack of areas for municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills has been increasing the cost of this option. Moreover, problems related to biogas collection and leachate treatment suggest minimization of putrescible material to be landfilled. Therefore, a number of alternative technologies considered anti-economical in the past, deserve to be reconsidered.
   Target of this paper is to provide optimization criteria of overall energetic recovery from anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge and municipal solid waste organic fraction (MSWOF) combined with incineration of the remaining fractions. This work is based on the hypotesis that MSWOF is obtained by separate collection (SC). Therefore, an assessment of the extent to which SC affects potential energy recovery and emissions from incineration processes is also performed. Different technologies for energy production are compared, with special focus on co-generation (electric power and heat). Separate anaerobic digestion of MSWOF and sludge is compared with cc-digestion in terms of biogas generation, and possible modifications of existing sludge digesters are evaluated. Optimization of MSW water balance positively affects co-digestion, since separation of the OF (higher umidity) favours both incineration and anaerobic digestion processes by increasing the combustible fraction's lower heating value (LHV) and improving mixing rates repectively. Gross evaluation of environmental indicators, such as CO2 emissions due to biogas and solid waste combustion, are compared to the case of all MSW landfilled.
   Economical analyses (based on current Italian costs) are also performed considering the following options: co-digestion of MSWOF and incineration of the remaining fractions, separate sludge/MSWOF digestion and incineration, sludge digestion and MSW incineration, sludge digestion and MSW landfill disposal.
   Feasibility of the different options is evaluated considering the city of Milan as a case study. Peculiarity of this city is the absence of a centralized wastewater treatment plant and the lack of substantial alternatives to MSW landfilling. This situation stimulates treatment/disposal planning activities with little constraints.

TI Sustainable waste management in Africa through CDM projects
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Only few Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects (traditionally focussed on landfill gas combustion) have been registered in Africa if compared to similar developing countries. The waste hierarchy adopted by many African countries clearly shows that waste recycling and composting projects are generally the most sustainable. This paper undertakes a sustainability assessment for practical waste treatment and disposal scenarios for Africa and makes recommendations for consideration. The appraisal in this paper demonstrates that mechanical biological treatment of waste becomes more financially attractive if established through the CDM process. Waste will continue to be dumped in Africa with increasing greenhouse gas emissions produced, unless industrialised countries (Annex 1) fund carbon emission reduction schemes through a replacement to the Kyoto Protocol. Such a replacement should calculate all of the direct and indirect carbon emission savings and seek to promote public-private partnerships through a concerted support of the informal sector.

TI Pyrolysis technologies for municipal solid waste: A review (Reprinted
   from Waste Management, vol 34, pg 2466-2486, 2014)
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Pyrolysis has been examined as an attractive alternative to incineration for municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal that allows energy and resource recovery; however, it has seldom been applied independently with the output of pyrolysis products as end products. This review addresses the state-of-the-art of MSW pyrolysis in regards to its technologies and reactors, products and environmental impacts. In this review, first, the influence of important operating parameters such as final temperature, heating rate (HR) and residence time in the reaction zone on the pyrolysis behaviours and products is reviewed; then the pyrolysis technologies and reactors adopted in literatures and scale-up plants are evaluated. Third, the yields and main properties of the pyrolytic products from individual MSW components, refuse-derived fuel (RDF) made from MSW, and MSW are summarised. In the fourth section, in addition to emissions from pyrolysis processes, such as HCl, SO2 and NH3, contaminants in the products, including PCDD/F and heavy metals, are also reviewed, and available measures for improving the environmental impacts of pyrolysis are surveyed. It can be concluded that the single pyrolysis process is an effective waste-to-energy convertor but is not a guaranteed clean solution for MSW disposal. Based on this information, the prospects of applying pyrolysis technologies to dealing with MSW are evaluated and suggested. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Landfill Impacts on the Environment-Review
SO GEOSCIENCES
AB Waste management (WM) is a demanding undertaking in all countries, with important implications for human health, environmental preservation, sustainability and circular economy. The method of sanitary landfilling for final disposal of waste remains a generally accepted and used method but the available scientific evidence on the waste-related environmental and health effects is not conclusive. Comparative studies of various WM methods (landfilling, incineration, composting etc.) show that among the municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment and disposal technological options, sanitary landfilling or open dumping is popular in most countries because of the relative low cost and low-technical requirement. The European Union (EU) Directive on waste landfills has introduced specific goals for reducing the volume of disposed waste and very strict requirements for landfilling and landfill sites. Evaluation of the impact of landfills on the environment is a crucial topic in the literature and has received increased attention recently, given growing environmental concerns. The main goal of this survey was to conduct a comprehensive assessment of possible impacts of MSW landfills on the environment. The main conclusion of the overall assessment of the literature is that the disposal of MSW in landfills entails a number of environmental risks but with respect to the current situation and rich style of living adopted in industrially developed countries, the idea of WM systems functioning without landfilling-at least in the foreseeable future within one generation-seems to be somewhat unreal. The results also provided important information of landfills as a source of environmental risk. Results of this research may have an important impact on landfill management and the disposal of waste. From the literature review, it is evident that even if high levels of waste avoidance, reuse and recycling are achieved, some waste materials will always need to be forwarded for disposal.

TI Trends in the management of organic swine farm waste by composting: A
   systematic review
SO HELIYON
AB Pig farming contributes to the economic development of nations and supplies human food demand; however, it generates a large amount of organic waste which, if not managed properly, becomes a risk to the environment and human and animal health. Considering the relevance of composting and its usefulness for the use of waste, this study aimed to determine the global trends in the management of composting manure, mortality and other organic waste produced on pig farms over the last five years (2017-2022). Systematic search involved four databases: ISI Web of Science, Scopus, Ebsco and Scielo. Of the total findings, 56 articles were included in the review, further classified into 14 categories for their respective analysis: co-substrates/additives, microbial communities, antibiotic resistance, heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, microbiological/parasitological quality, phytopathogens, nitrogen transformation, bioinoculants, comparison/combination with other waste management techniques, factors affecting composting, swine mortality and plant growth promotion/phytotoxicity. The review exemplified the importance of swine mortality composting as an alternative for organic matter management in pig farms, considering that the process also includes manure, vegetable waste and wood chips, among others. Controlled factors throughout the process are a requirement to obtain a stable product with physicochemical and microbiological quality that complies with national and international regulations and that will be useful and safe for application on crops, ensuring environmental, animal, and human health.

TI Subcritical hydrothermal treatment of municipal solid waste incineration
   fly ash: A review
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Municipal solid waste incineration fly ash (MSWI-FA) is a hazardous waste generated from the incineration process, and the harmless treatment of MSWI-FA has attracted widespread attention. Subcritical hydrothermal treatment is competitive in achieving the harmless treatment and resource recycling of MSWI-FA. It exhibits excellent performance in degrading dioxins, stabilizing heavy metals, and converting MSWI-FA into zeolite or tobermorite at low tempera-tures. This paper clearly introduces the characteristics of MSWI-FA, roundly summarizes the current research status of treating MSWI-FA by subcritical hydrothermal methods, and deeply clarifies the mechanisms of dioxins degrada-tion, zeolite/tobermorite synthesis, and heavy metals stabilization. Considering the research status of handling MSWI-FA by subcritical hydrothermal methods, future research directions are proposed. Owing to the advantages of high efficiency, energy-saving, and environmental sustainability, subcritical hydrothermal treatment of MSWI-FA ex-hibits promising prospects for industrialization.

AB Malaysia has been experiencing rapid growth in population, massive development in industrialization and urbanization. It has resulted in the generation of a greater amount of wastes. Usually, the solid wastes are disposed at landfills, which are mostly saturated and overloaded with solid wastes, but, due to the scarcity of land and public complaints, making the building of new landfill almost impossible, hence the disposal of MSW is one of the major environmental issues faced by the country. Meanwhile, in the sewerage industry, sludge that is high in embedded energy is generated and it can be used to produce methane through anaerobic digestion especially in the modern mechanized sewage treatment plant (STP). However, the secondary thickened sludge (STS) is a poor substrate for anaerobic digestion. Studies have shown that the digestibility of STS can be improved my pre-treatment methods such as microwave pre-treatment prior to the anaerobic digestion. Besides that, co-digestion is an effective way to overcome the low biodegradability of STS which also promotes an environmentally and an ecologically friendly way to dispose of the food wastes. Also, it can be used to produce renewable energy which could reduce the dependency on fossil fuel for power generation. Moreover, it also can deliver beneficial synergies for the sewage industry and the MSW industry. This work elucidates the preliminary investigation of the potentials of co-digestion of microwave pre-treated STS and food waste and its effect on biodegradability and methane yield, which proposes a sustainable management of solid waste generated in urban areas while harnessing the resources to generate green electricity.

TI Life-cycle assessment of municipal solid waste management alternatives
   with consideration of uncertainty: SIWMS development and application
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB This paper describes the development and application of the Stochastic Integrated Waste Management Simulator (SIWMS) model. SIWMS provides a detailed view of the environmental impacts and associated costs of municipal solid waste (MSW) management alternatives under conditions of uncertainty. The model follows a life-cycle inventory approach extended with compensatory systems to provide more equitable bases for comparing different alternatives. Economic performance is measured by the net present value. The model is verified against four publicly available models under deterministic conditions and then used to study the impact of uncertainty on Sydney's MSW management 'best practices'. Uncertainty has a significant effect on all impact categories. The greatest effect is observed in the global warming category where a reversal of impact direction is predicted. The reliability of the system is most sensitive to uncertainties in the waste processing and disposal. The results highlight the importance of incorporating uncertainty at all stages to better understand the behaviour of the MSW system. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Landfill leachate valorization: A potential alternative to burden off
   resources and support energy systems
SO FUEL
AB Landfilling is the globally adopted, low cost approach for disposing municipal solid waste. Landfilling contributes to environmental deterioration due to the emission of landfill gases especially methane (CH4), and release of hazardous organic and inorganic substances in the form of landfill leachate (LL). Proliferation of LL in the environment degrades the quality of soil, groundwater and surface water body (if any) and thus needs to be contained and treated before discharge. A wide range of treatment methods have been used for minimizing the contaminant load of LL. Nowadays stakeholders are moving towards more sustainable waste management practices and are utilizing waste as a resource to produce energy, fuel and other value-added products. However, unfortunately, the energy valorization from LL is lacking and it can fascinate global researchers for the treatment of LL with renewable energy production. Therefore in this study, we reviewed (1) the quality of LL generated from landfilling and its impact on the environment, (2) The energy valorization such as biogas, biological hydrogen, and bio-energy from LL through anaerobic digestion, dark fermentation, and Microbial Fuel Cells, respectively, and (3) Challenges and future prospects of energy valorization from LL. The resources present in leachate such as the organic matter, inorganic substances, and nutrients like N&P, can be converted to energy, and other value-added resources through valorization. LL valorisation can be a potential solution not only to reduce the contaminant load from the natural resources (air, water and soil) but also to utilize the energy re-sources in the form of either electricity and/or heat and serve as a potential alternative to non-renewable energy. Beside this, the other advantages of valorisation include amelioration of waste malodours and environmental pollution, and reduction of waste volume etc.

TI Greener cementitious composites incorporating sewage sludge ash as
   cement replacement: A review of progress, potentials, and future
   prospects
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Sewage sludge ash (SSA) is an unavoidable waste during the treatment of wastewater, and because it contains a significant amount of heavy metals, it constitutes a major pollution risk. Therefore, different approaches are proposed worldwide for the safe and sustainable disposal of SSA. One such approach is the incorporation of SSA in the preparation of cementitious composites as cement replacement like other industrial waste materials (e.g., fly ash, silica fume, and slag). This article comparatively analyses the characteristics (chemical composition, pozzolanic activity, and particle morphology) of SSA and properties of SSA modified cementitious composites, including hydration kinetics, mechanical properties, drying shrinkage, porosity, and microstructural properties. The study concludes that SSA can replace cement in the production of greener cementitious composites by 5-10%, which can be further increased to 20% by using pre-treated SSA. However, a detailed experimental investigation is required to assess the full potential of SSA as a cement replacement material and to address some contradictory observations reported by different researchers related to the properties of cementitious composites incorporating SSA.

AB Although the Region of Waterloo implements a waste recycling program as part of its compliance with the 2004 Ontario Waste Diversion Goal a large fraction of its municipal solid waste ends up in the landfill. Landfill waste disposal adversely impacts the environment through the release of air pollutants and greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, and through the generation of leachate that may contaminate water sources. Landfills also require large land areas, which limit their long-term sustainability. This paper presents a quantitative comparison of the environmental, economic, and social impacts of the current waste disposal program in the Region of Waterloo and of three waste management alternatives: (i) expansion of the organics collection program with biogas recovery, (ii) expansion of the recycling program, and (iii) incineration with energy recovery. Environmental impacts were evaluated by performing a life cycle analysis using the US EPA's Waste Reduction Model. Economic impacts were quantified using cost-benefit analysis; social impacts were evaluated using a previously developed scoring scheme. Finally, the overall impacts were ranked and analyzed using the Saaty's Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to determine an optimal alternative to landfill disposal. Results indicate that incineration with energy recovery is ranked the highest overall in all three evaluation criteria categories. Incineration results in the greatest gas reductions (86%) and the lowest cost to implement. Incineration also ranks the highest in the social impacts ranking due to reductions in foul odors, potential for attracting disease vectors, and land requirements. Expanding the recycling collection improves greenhouse gas emissions by 41% of the current method; it also reduces disposal costs. Overall, all three alternatives are better than the current waste disposal method, and incineration is deemed the optimal waste management option for the Region of Waterloo.

TI A Case Study of Sustainable Construction Waste Management in Saudi

SO WASTE AND BIOMASS VALORIZATION
AB The Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC) consistently rank among the top 10% of per capita waste producers in the world. Collectively around 120million tons of waste is produced annually in GCC; 55% construction and demolition (C&D) waste, 20% municipal solid waste (MSW), 18% industrial waste, and 7% hazardous waste. Like other GCC nations, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) generates massive amounts of MSW, C&D waste, and industrial waste. This study aims to examine 81 construction companies in the Eastern Province of KSA to determine which factors critically affect the sustainable management of C&D waste in the country. Only 39.5% of the companies studied had a pollution control plan for their projects. It was also found that only 13.6% of C&D waste is recycled and reused every year, whereas the remaining 86.4% C&D waste eventually goes to the landfills. Most of the C&D waste in the country is a promising source of potential recyclable construction materials such as gravel from debris, metals, and sand. This would not only fulfill the requirements of gravel and metal production of the KSA but also solve the waste disposal issues along with generating huge economic benefits. However, to accomplish the goal of sustainable construction waste management, it is critical to underline the various factors that might impact the construction waste management practices in the country.

TI A baseline scenario of municipal solid waste management
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The baseline scenarios of municipal solid waste management (MSWM) activities that will expose the specific challenges militating against sustainable waste management in many developing countries are not properly documented or not understood. This paper established a baseline scenario of municipal solid waste management (MSWM) in Ghana, through material flow analysis and understanding of MSW handling practices, using the Wa Municipality as a case study. The study was theoretically based on empirical observation and an exploratory design. The findings showed that sustainable waste management has remained elusive because MSWM in the case study area and Ghana in general, consist of some waste collection, transportation and open dumping, where the entire amount of waste is open dumped without pretreatment. The sorting of waste at the generation sources, and the provision of adequate MSWM infrastructure, through an integrated solid waste management system can ensure sustainable waste management in the country.

TI An evaluation of alternative household solid waste treatment practices
   using life cycle inventory assessment mode
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB Waste disposal is an important part of the life cycle of a product and is associated with environmental burdens like any other life-cycle stages. In this study, an integrated assessment for solid waste treatment practices, especially household solid waste, was undertaken to evaluate the impact contribution of household solid waste treatment alternatives towards the sustainable development by using Life Cycle Inventory Assessment method. A case study has been investigated under various possible scenarios, such as (1) landfill without landfill gas recovery, (2) landfill with landfill gas recovery and flaring, (3) landfill with landfill gas recovery and electric generation, (4) composting, and (5) incineration. The evaluation utilized the Life Cycle Inventory Assessment method for multiple assessments based on various aspects, such as greenhouse gas emission/reduction, energy generation/consumption, economic benefit, investment and operating cost, and land use burden. The results showed that incineration was the most efficient alternative for greenhouse gas emission reduction, economic benefit, energy recovery, and land use reduction, although it was identified as the most expensive for investment and operating cost, while composting scenario was also an efficient alternative with quite economic benefit, low investment and operating cost, and high reduction of land use, although it was identified as existing greenhouse gas emission and no energy generation. Furthermore, the aim of this study was also to establish localized assessment methods that waste management agencies, environmental engineers, and environmental policy decision makers can use to quantify and compare the contribution to the impacts from different waste treatment options.

TI Life-cycle assessment of two sewage sludge-to-energy systems based on
   different sewage sludge characteristics: Energy balance and greenhouse
   gas-emission footprint analysis
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB Anaerobic digestion and incineration are widely used sewage sludge (SS) treatment and dis-posal approaches to recovering energy from SS, but it is difficult to select a suitable technical process from the various technologies. In this study, life-cycle assessments were adopted to compare the energy-and greenhouse gas-(GHG) emission footprints of two sludge-to-energy systems. One system uses a combination of AD with incineration (the AI system), whereas the other was simplified by direct incineration (the DI system). Comparison be-tween three SS feedstocks (VS/TS: 57.61-73.1 ds%) revealed that the AI system consistently outperformed the DI system. The results of sensitivity analyses showed that the energy and GHG emission performances were mainly affected by VS content of the SS, AD conversion efficiency, and the energy consumption of sludge drying. Furthermore, the energy and GHG emission credit of the two systems increased remarkably with the increase in the VS content of the SS. For the high-organic-content sludge (VS/TS: 55%-80%), the energy and GHG emis-sion credit of the AI system increase with the increase of AD conversion efficiency. However, for the low organic content sludge (VS/TS: 30%-55%), it has the opposite effect. In terms of energy efficiency and GHG performance, the AI system is a good choice for the treatment of high-organic-content sludge (VS/TS > 55%), but DI shows superiority over AI when dealing with low organic content sludge (VS/TS < 55%).

TI Evaluation of municipal solid waste compost as a plant growing media
   component, by applying mixture design
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB The amount of municipal solid waste (MSW) generated is increasing rapidly in parallel with the increasing size of population. The use of sanitary landfills to dispose of biodegradable wastes is currently restricted by the European Landfill Directive. Moreover, incineration of MSW produces significant amounts of polluting flue gases and toxic solid residues, so that high investments for pollution control in MSW incineration plants are needed. Composting may be a safe and successful strategy for accelerating the decomposition and stabilization of the biodegradable components of biowaste from MSW, for sustainable complete recycling, thereby producing compost that can be used as soil conditioner and/or organic fertilizer. In the present study, municipal solid waste compost from Galicia (NW Spain), obtained on an industrial scale by anaerobic fermentation followed by aerobic stabilization, was characterized and compared with peat and composted pine bark as a component of plant growing media. Due to the high content of salts, the evaluated MSW compost was not appropriated to be used alone as a soil conditioner or organic fertilizer. Mixtures of MSW compost, peat and composted pine bark were evaluated statistically by applying mixture designs and triangular surface. The dependent variables (shoot dry weight of Lepidium sativum and Hordeum vulgare) were adjusted to linear equations, and good statistical parameters for correlation and significance were obtained, allowing accurate description of experimental data. The best results were obtained by mixing MSW compost with composted pine bark, rather than mixing MSW compost with peat. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Comparative LCA of two approaches with different emphasis on energy or
   material recovery for a municipal solid waste management system in
   Gipuzkoa
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Two alternative approaches for an integrated municipal solid waste management system (MSW-MS) have been confronted in the province of Gipuzkoa, in the north of Spain, during the last decade. While one of them prioritizes energy recovery from mixed residual waste in an incineration plant, the other approach gives precedence to material recovery of separately collected waste. Which system would present a lower environmental impact and be more desirable from a sustainability perspective? Answering this question is hindered by the fact that recovered energy and materials are not directly comparable or directly substitutable with each other.
   Based on the powerful framework provided by life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, this work performs a comparative LCA of overall environmental impacts of these two alternative approaches, showing that comparisons of alternative systems in terms of direct energy recovery or direct material recovery should be avoided in favor of other indicators already proposed in the LCA framework, such as the Cumulative Energy Demand category from Ecoinvent, or the global warming potential and the Abiotic Resources Depletion categories from the CML 2001 method.
   Applying the LCA framework, this work shows that when a high share of waste is collected separately, and processes assumed in the background system are adequately characterized, especially the production of the electricity mix, then prioritizing material recovery provides better results even in environmental categories tightly related to fossil energy consumption, such as the global warming potential impact category.

TI Performance Monitoring of Anaerobic Digestion at Various Organic Loading
   Rates of Commercial Malaysian Food Waste
SO FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Application of anaerobic digestion (AD) has become common in treating palm oil mill effluent in Malaysia; however, employing AD in treating the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW), especially food waste, is still scarce. This study aims to characterize the commercial Malaysian food waste (CMFW) and determine its potential as sustainable bioenergy feedstock through biogas production. The sample was digested via the biomethane potential (BMP) test with the variation of organic loading rates (OLRs), ranging from 0.38 to 3.83 gCOD/L. day, under mesophilic conditions. The digestion process was further evaluated in continuous operation using a 6-L continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR). The kinetic properties of the process were also determined. It was found that the CMFW had a significant amount of chemical oxygen demand of 230 g/L and an acidic pH of 4.5 with the carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio at 121:1. A maximum methane composition of 81% was obtained at 1.92 gCOD/L in the BMP test with specific methane production (SMP) at 0.952 L. CH4/L.COD fed. The biogas production was well-fitted with the modified Gompertz model with R-2 at 0.9983 and the maximum biogas potential production rate at R-m 0.1573 L/day, whereas in the CSTR operation, a maximum methane composition of 85% was produced at OLR 6 gCOD/L. day with the SMP of 1.13 L. CH4/L.COD fed. The CSTR system was in high stability as the pH was maintained in a range of 6.6-6.7, with an alkalinity ratio of 0.28. This study indicates the CMFW is a sustainable feedstock for biogas production in Malaysia. Toward a circular economy approach, the authorities shall introduce commercial scale CMFW AD as part of managing municipal solid waste issues in Malaysia.

TI European Union waste management strategy and the importance of biogenic
   waste
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB In the European Union (EU), waste management is almost totally regulated by EU directives, which supply a framework for national regulations. The main target in view of sustainability is the prevention of direct disposal of reactive waste in landfills. The tools to comply with these principles are recycling and material recovery as well as waste incineration with energy recovery for final inertization. The adaptation of the principles laid down in EU directives is an ongoing process. A number of countries have already enacted respective national regulations and their realization shows that recycling and incineration are not in competition but are both essential parts of integrated waste management systems. In the EU, the amount of residual waste available for energy recovery can supply approximately 1% of the primary energy demand. About 50% of the energy inventory of municipal solid waste (MSW) in most EU countries is of biogenic origin, and MSW is to the same extent to be looked upon as regenerative fuel. Hence part of the CO(2) released from waste incineration is climate neutral. In the EU, this share could produce savings of the order of 1% of annual CO(2) emissions if energy from MSW replaced that derived from fossil fuel.

TI Assessment of two-stage anaerobic digestion of blackwater and kitchen
   waste for reducing environmental impact of residential buildings
SO SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY AND PHARMACY
AB In recent years, much attention has been directed towards municipal waste management since these residues has become a global challenge with increasing public health, environmental, so-cial, and economic costs. Therefore, there is an urgent need to adopt widely accepted sustainable alternatives and circular economy approaches. In that sense, the decentralized waste management approach has become a feasible and sustainable strategy to valorise and minimize wastes at source. Among the available technologies, anaerobic digestion is widely used as it allows to recover energy in form of biogas from organic waste. This study proposes a decentralized system based on a two-stage anaerobic digestion for the joint valorisation of organic wastes-blackwater and kitchen wastes-in residential buildings. In the first stage (dark fermentation), different ratios of blackwater:kitchen waste were assessed and a maximum volatile fatty acids production of 5000-7000 mg L-1 was reached when 5 kg of black water and 0.30 kg of kitchen waste were added to the system. Then, during second stage, the volatile fatty acids rich stream was valorised in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor resulting in a biogas production of 5.45 & PLUSMN; 1.34 L d-1, containing 75.6 & PLUSMN; 7.3% of methane and 22.8 & PLUSMN; 5.7% of carbon dioxide while reporting a low content of impurities -0.02% of hydrogen sulphide and 0.002% of hydrogen-.

TI Feasibility study of the unit pricing system for household wastes
   sorting in the context of China
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Although sanitary household waste disposal was achieved in China, an efficient source separation system has not been built yet. The Unit Pricing System has been proved effective for household waste sorting by developed countries and regions, while rare developing countries have successfully introduced the system in their local context. The study, taking an interactive perspective of dominant factors of residents' waste sorting and governments' intervention, combines theoretical analysis with system simulation to dissect the evolution process of residents' waste sorting and local governments' Unit Pricing System policy making, and to provide a Unit Pricing System policy making tool to support policy implementations. The results suggest introducing a Unit Pricing System can significantly push ahead the household waste sorting behaviour for cities with relatively low initial status of environmental awareness, and immediately trigger sorting behaviours for cities with higher initial status of environmental awareness. The study can also benefit other developing countries when imposing waste sorting management instruments.

TI Quantifying capital goods for biological treatment of organic waste
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB Materials and energy used for construction of anaerobic digestion (AD) and windrow composting plants were quantified in detail. The two technologies were quantified in collaboration with consultants and producers of the parts used to construct the plants. The composting plants were quantified based on the different sizes for the three different types of waste (garden and park waste, food waste and sludge from wastewater treatment) in amounts of 10,000 or 50,000 tonnes per year. The AD plant was quantified for a capacity of 80,000 tonnes per year. Concrete and steel for the tanks were the main materials for the AD plant. For the composting plants, gravel and concrete slabs for the pavement were used in large amounts. To frame the quantification, environmental impact assessments (EIAs) showed that the steel used for tanks at the AD plant and the concrete slabs at the composting plants made the highest contribution to Global Warming. The total impact on Global Warming from the capital goods compared to the operation reported in the literature on the AD plant showed an insignificant contribution of 1-2%. For the composting plants, the capital goods accounted for 10-22% of the total impact on Global Warming from composting.

TI A societal transition of MSW management in Xiamen (China) toward a
   circular economy through integrated waste recycling and technological
   digitization
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB Recently Xiamen (China) has encountered various challenges of municipal solid waste management (MSWM) such as lack of a complete garbage sorting and recycling system, the absence of waste segregation between organic and dry waste at source, and a shortage of complete and clear information about the MSW generated. This article critically analyzes the existing bottlenecks in its waste management system and discusses the way forward for the city to enhance its MSWM by drawing lessons from Hong Kong's effectiveness in dealing with the same problems over the past decades. Solutions to the MSWM problem are not only limited to technological options, but also integrate environmental, legal, and institutional perspectives. The solutions include (1) enhancing source separation and improving recycling system; (2) improving the legislation system of the MSWM; (3) improvement of terminal disposal facilities in the city; (4) incorporating digitization into MSWM; and (5) establishing standards and definitions for recycled products and/or recyclable materials. We also evaluate and compare different aspects of MSWM in Xiamen and Hong Kong SAR (special administrative region) under the framework of 'One Country, Two Systems' concerning environmental policies, generation, composition, characteristics, treatment, and disposal of their MSW. The nexus of society, economics of the MSW, and the environment in the sustainability sphere are established by promoting local recycling industries and the standardization of recycled products and/or recyclable materials. The roles of digitization technologies in the 4th Industrial Revolution for waste reduction in the framework of circular economy (CE) are also elaborated. This technological solution may improve the city's MSWM in terms of public participation in MSW separation through reduction, recycle, reuse, recovery, and repair (5Rs) schemes. To meet top-down policy goals such as a 35% recycling rate for the generated waste by 2030, incorporating digitization into the MSWM provides the city with technology-driven waste solutions.

TI An Overview of Solid Waste Management and Plastic Recycling in Qatar
SO JOURNAL OF POLYMERS AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB Municipal solid waste management (MSWM) constitutes one of the most crucial health and environmental problems facing authorities in the Arabian Gulf. Recent literature on current solid waste management (SWM) in Qatar has been reviewed in this paper, and a focused study has been carried out to provide a review on the total amount of municipal solid waste generated, stored, collected, disposed as well as the constituents of the waste. The analysis showed that Qatar produced around 2,000,000 tons of solid municipal waste annually, corresponding to a daily generation rate per capita of about 2.5 kg. About 60% of MSW is organic material and about 300 kg is composed daily. Landfill and composting is considered the most appropriate waste disposal techniques in Qatar. Um-Al-Afai landfill has nearly 80% of MSW. Because of the increased migration in Qatar, there is a sharp rise in the volume and also in the variety of solid waste. It is important to alleviate societal concerns over the increased rate of resource consumption and waste production; thus, policy makers have encouraged recycling and reuse strategies to reduce the demand for raw materials and to decrease the quantity of waste going to landfill. An example of the benefit of mechanical recycling of plastics compared to land filling and composting was conducted by GaBi 4 life cycle analysis tool which showed the benefits to the global warming and human toxicity. Recycling is the favored solution for plastic waste management, because it has a lower environmental impact on the defined impact categories, from Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Human Toxicity Potentials (HTP) indicators.

TI Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions of municipal solid waste management
   system: case study of Chengdu, China
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Municipal solid waste management has become a worldwide concern. Chengdu municipality has decided to adopt the "zero landfilling" strategy for local waste management after 2020. In this study, life cycle assessment is performed to identify the potentials of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Chengdu. The results of this study showed that net greenhouse gas emission of the current municipal solid waste management system is estimated to be 1,775,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent. Furthermore, if incineration is to be the primary waste end-life disposal method, it is critically important to exclude plastic wastes from incineration wastes and improve the energy recovery efficiency, while the landfilling with landfill gas collection still can be a good option for MSW disposal, or expanding the processing capacity of composting plant, to achieve the better outcomes of greenhouse gas mitigation. The results indicate the high potential of reducing greenhouse gas emissions of the local municipal solid waste management system, and detailed recommendations for further improvements on local municipal solid waste management system are proposed at the end of this study, which could be the reference for municipal solid waste management practice in both Chengdu and other cities in China.

TI Life-cycle economic and environmental impacts of municipal solid waste
   reverse logistics in residential areas
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The economic and environmental impacts of the reverse logistics (RL) process (including drop-off, collection and transportation [C&T]) of the waste disposal chain are becoming increasingly prominent with the increasing generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) and promotion of MSW classification. Quantitative evaluation of this process from economic and environmental perspectives is of great significance for MSW management. This study focused on the financial capital, materials, and energy consumption in the RL process in Xi an City, China. Based on field investigation, the magnitude of pollutant emissions from MSW C&T vehicles over their life cycle was predicted using the GREET software and total RL life-cycle cost and life-cycle assessment were analyzed. The results showed that the finical costs of RL were $46.35-$49.03 per ton of food waste and $62.52-$88.84 per ton of residual waste; the environmental impacts caused by the RL process accounted for 79.24%-96.00% and 20.87%-68.55% of the entire food waste and residual waste management chains, respectively. Labor costs were the biggest financial expenditure and the fuel cycle of C&T vehicles caused the majority of the environmental impacts. Source-separated waste management scenarios represented more environmental benefits but poorer economic positions. In the future, improving MSW source-separation accuracy, replacing diesel C&T vehicles with electric ones, and optimizing the RL system could reduce the environmental and economic impacts of the entire waste management system.

TI Hydrothermal carbonization processes applied to wet organic waste
   streams
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH
AB Various organic waste streams are generated daily by human activities such as municipal, agricultural and industrial. The sustainable disposal of these organic wastes is a serious societal challenge. When the disposal process is not efficient, this type of wastes creates important pollution risks for air, soil, underground water and sea. Especially, wastes that have high moisture content cannot be eliminated cost effectively via thermo-chemical conversion by conventional processes such as pyrolysis, gasification and combustion. These processes necessitate the pre-drying of wet wastes which require additional energy input and increase the operational costs. One promising approach for the management and valorization of highly wet waste streams is the use of hydrothermal technologies. Hydrothermal carbonization is a very appropriate approach for valorizing wet organic wastes using water as a medium at high temperature and pressure under subcritical conditions. The generated "hydrochar" is a solid lignite like material that can be used for energy generation (by gasification or combustion) but also for environmental practices such as soil remediation and carbon fixation. This review focuses on the feedstock potential of wet organic wastes of sewage sludge, food wastes, various animal manure and macroalgae, and their valorization by hydrothermal carbonization. Structural, physical and energy conversion characteristics of hydrochars produced from various wet organic wastes are compared and discussed. Usage areas of hydrochars are also assessed.

TI Life cycle assessment of municipal biowaste management-a Czech case
   study
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB As part of coming targets to transition to a sustainable society and actively set a circular economy, one of the EU objectives is to decrease the amount of municipal solid waste and initiate the separation of its organic fraction, i. e., biowaste. Consequently, the question of how to best manage biowaste at the municipal level is of high importance, and previous research has shown the strong influence of local factors on the most sustainable treatment option. Life Cycle Assessment is a valuable tool for comparison of waste management impacts and was used to assess environmental impacts of the current biowaste management in Prague and give insight for im-provements. Different scenarios were created regarding EU and Czech biowaste targets for separated collection. Results show the significant influence of the source of energy that is substituted. Consequently, in the current situation of an energy mix highly based on fossil fuels, incineration is the most sustainable option in most impact categories. However, community composting was found to have a better potential to reduce ecotoxicity and resource use of minerals and metals. Furthermore, it could supply a significant proportion of the minerals need of the region while increasing the autonomy of the Czech Republic regarding mineral fertilisers. To meet targets of EU directives for separated collection of biowaste, a combination of anaerobic digestion, to avoid use of fossil fuels, and composting, to increase circular economy, is most likely the best option. The outputs of this project would be of great significance for municipalities.

TI Evaluating waste management alternatives by the multiple criteria
   approach
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB In the past, justifications on decision making in the environmental (including waste management) field have always been qualitative and implicit in Hong Kong. The use of multiple criteria analysis (MCA) in waste management decision making has the advantage of rendering subjective and implicit decision making more objective and transparent. An additional merit of MCA is its ability to accommodate quantitative and qualitative data. In this paper the MCA approach is made use to find out the preferred waste management option(s) for Hong Kong (HK). Landfilling, waste to energy, composting and source separation of municipal solid waste (MSW) are analysed by the MCA. It is found that source separation is the most preferred option. Waste to energy is found to have a better overall performance than landfilling (with methane recovery). Composting of solid waste is found to be very land intensive and should only be used with care. Incineration without energy recovery is the least desirable option. Landfilling of solid waste although is not the best option, it is indispensable in a waste management system. Thus, it should only be practised in a limited extent. It is also demonstrated in this paper that dominance pairwise comparison is not sensitive to weighting differences. Thus, if decisive criteria exist, then they should be considered prior to the use of dominance pairwise comparison.

TI Uncover Cost-Benefit Disparity of Municipal Solid Waste Incineration in
   Chinese Provinces
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Incineration has been regarded as a promising method to respond to municipal solid waste (MSW) challenges. However, its high cost and health impacts are the main barriers to the development of incineration. This study aims to investigate the cost-benefit of MSW incineration in 31 Chinese provinces to identify the regional disparity of incineration policy in China. Life cycle environmental impacts and costs were analyzed using the life cycle assessment software Gabi 8.0 and method CML-2001. Results show that MSW disposal costs, Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Eutrophication Potential (EP) will decline significantly with the increase in incineration rate for all Chinese provinces, while the environmental impacts of Human Toxicity Potential (HTP), Ozone Layer Depletion Potential (OLDP) and Terrestric Ecotoxicity Potential (TETP) increase the trend. Economically developed and populated provinces such as Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shandong have both a higher incineration volume and incineration potential. As for the cost-benefit analysis, developed provinces such as Guangdong, Chongqing, Shanghai and Tianjin exhibit the highest cost-benefit in toxic impacts of HTP, TETP and ODP. Northern provinces such as Jilin, Xinjiang, Heilongjiang and Hebei have the lowest cost-benefit in toxic impacts but have the highest cost-benefit in GWP and EP. Finally, policy remarks on incineration cost, priority provinces, integration of sorting and incineration are also discussed.

TI Effect of the temperature in a mixed culture pilot scale aerobic process
   for food waste and sewage sludge conversion into polyhydroxyalkanoates
SO JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB The utilisation of urban organic waste as feedstock for polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) production is growing since it allows to solve the main concerns about their disposal and simultaneously to recover added-value products. A pilot scale platform has been designed for this purpose. The VFA-rich fermentation liquid coming from the anaerobic treatment of both source-sorted organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) and waste activated sludge (WAS) has been used as substrate for the aerobic process steps: a first sequencing batch reactor (SBR, 100 L) for the selection of a PHA-producing biomass, and a second fed-batch reactor (70 L) for PHA accumulation inside the cells. The SBR was operated at 2.0-4.4 kg COD/(m(3) d) as OLR, under dynamic feeding regime (feast-famine) and short hydraulic retention time (HRT; 1 day). The selected biomass was able to accumulate up to 48% g PHA/g VSS. Both steps were performed without temperature (T) control, avoiding additional consumption of energy. In this regard, the applied OLR was tuned based on environmental T and, as a consequence, on biomass kinetic, in order to have a constant selective pressure. The latter was mainly quantified by the PHA storage yield (Y-P/S(feast) 0.34-0.45 CODP/CODS), which has been recognized as the main parameters affecting the global PHA productivity [1.02-1.82 g PHA/(L d)] of the process.

TI Fuzzy multi-criteria decision analysis for environmentally conscious
   solid waste treatment and disposal technology selection
SO TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
AB Municipal solid waste management (MSWM) is a major challenge for developing countries due to an enormous and rapid increase in waste generation rates, environmental issues and financial constraints for proper management. Poorly managed municipal solid waste (MSW) causes severe detrimental consequences to society like financial and aesthetic degradation, contamination of natural resources, environmental pollution and is a serious health hazard. The selection of appropriate MSW treatment and disposal technology is a multi-criteria decision-making process. This paper presents an evaluation method that can aid decision-makers to prioritise and select appropriate MSW treatment and disposal methods even under uncertain conditions. It adopts a systematic three-stage evaluation method. The first stage utilizes the Fuzzy Delphi method to obtain the critical factors for the evaluation of technology alternatives. In the second stage, the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process is applied to obtain the weights and importance degree of each criterion as the measurable indices of the technologies by fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices. Finally, the Fuzzy TOPSIS technique is used for the selection of appropriate treatment and disposal technology alternative. The applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated with an illustrative example and the results are analyzed. The fuzzy multiple-criteria approach applied in the study accommodates both quantitative and qualitative data, and thus, makes the uncertain decision-making process more objective and analytical. The study highlights the importance of "appropriate scale" and how the priority order of technologies changes under various domains of experts. The results reveal that the developed model can successfully help the decision-makers to determine the priority sequence of the MSW treatment and disposal scenarios taking into account the interest of relevant stakeholders. In view of the real-world scenario, it is proven to be efficient, practical, and case-independent for effectively managing MSW and supporting the existing MSWM systems in both developed and developing countries.

TI Municipal solid waste management in Rasht City, Iran
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Pollution and health risks generated by improper solid waste management are important issues concerning environmental management in developing Countries. In most cities, the use of open dumps is common for the disposal of wastes, resulting in soil and water resource contamination by leachate in addition to odors and fires. Solid waste management infrastructure and services in developing Countries are far from achieving basic standards in terms of hygiene and efficient collection and disposal. This paper presents an overview of current municipal solid waste management in Rasht city, Gilan Province, Iran, and provides recommendations for system improvement. The collected data of different MSW functional elements were based on data from questionnaires, visual observations of the authors, available reports and several interviews and meetings with responsible persons. Due to an increase in Population and changes in lifestyle, the quantity and quality of MSW in Rasht city has changed. Lack of resources, infrastructure, Suitable planning, leadership, and public awareness are the main challenges of MSW management of Rasht city. However, the present Situation of solid waste management in this city, which generates more than 400 tons/d, has been improved since the establishment of an organization responsible only for solid waste management. Source separation of wastes and construction of a composting plant are the two main activities of the Rasht Municipality in recent years. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Municipal Solid Waste and the Environment: A Global Perspective
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES, VOL 37
SE Annual Review of Environment and Resources
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) reflects the culture that produces it and affects the health of the people and the environment surrounding it. Globally, people are discarding growing quantities of waste, and its composition is more complex than ever before, as plastic and electronic consumer products diffuse. Concurrently, the world is urbanizing at an unprecedented rate. These trends pose a challenge to cities, which are charged with managing waste in a socially and environmentally acceptable manner. Effective waste management strategies depend on local waste characteristics, which vary with cultural, climatic, and socioeconomic variables, and institutional capacity. Globally, waste governance is becoming regionalized and formalized. In industrialized nations, where citizens produce far more waste than do other citizens, waste tends to be managed formally at a municipal or regional scale. In less-industrialized nations, where citizens produce less waste, which is mostly biogenic, a combination of formal and informal actors manages waste. Many waste management policies, technologies, and behaviors provide a variety of environmental benefits, including climate change mitigation. Key waste management challenges include integrating the informal waste sector in developing cities, reducing consumption in industrialized cities, increasing and standardizing the collection and analysis of solid waste data, and effectively managing increasingly complex waste while protecting people and the environment.

TI An overview of the municipal solid waste management modes and
   innovations in Shanghai, China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) management and recycling has become an emerging issue in developing countries. Shanghai, the largest megacity in China, is well-known nationwide due to leading China's MSW separation and recycling. Therefore, this paper introduces the Shanghai mode for MSW management and its current situation to enrich existing MSW management studies. Results show that the total generation volume of MSW and amount of MSW generation per capita were 9.00 million tons and 372.16 kg in 2017, increased approximately eight-fold and four-fold compared with the data in 1978, respectively. The MSW treatment rate reached 100% since 2014, with incineration rate increased to 48.56% in 2017. The cost of MSW management after implementing MSW sorting regulation is increased to 985 CNY/ton, including 390 CNY/ton of MSW sorting cost. Then three key features and innovative MSW management modes, namely, mandatory MSW sorting legislation, Green Account program, and the Combined Network program are introduced. Meanwhile, two main challenges are urgent to be responded, including inadequate collecting vehicles and limited wet waste treatment capacity. Finally, policy recommendations on strengthening MSW recycling process, constructing complete terminal treatment industry, and making systematic policies were provided to respond existing challenges.

TI The path to sustainable municipal solid waste management: Do human
   development, energy efficiency, and income inequality matter?
SO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB This paper explores the economic, social, and technical dynamics affecting municipal solid waste (MSW) per capita in organisation for economic co-operation and development (OECD) countries from 2003 to 2018. Static and dynamic panel data methods are followed for empirical analysis. According to the estimation results, there is an inverted-U-shaped relationship between economic growth and MSW. The turning point income level, where technological and structural effects occur, is calculated in the range of $20,000-$34,000. Human development and energy efficiency have mitigating effects on MSW. Energy efficiency and human development are critical for sustainable MSW management. Credit expansion has an increasing effect on MSW generation. Financial development draws attention as a negative indicator in sustainable waste management targets. All models confirm that income inequality has an increasing effect on MSW generation. In addition, poverty reduction is associated with an increase in MSW generation. Thus, income inequality and poverty reduction are a major constraint for sustainable MSW management. After all, the empirical findings of this paper can guide authorities in designing waste management policies.

TI Climate Change Impact of the Development in Household Waste Management
   in China
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB The potential climate change impacts of the development in Chinese household waste management, with less landfilling, more incineration with energy recovery, and sourceseparated food waste treated in biorefineries, were assessed through a life cycle assessment. When the waste management system interacts with a fossil-based energy system, landfilling produces a load of 144 kg CO2-eq/ton wet waste, while incineration shows a saving of 36 kg CO2-eq/ton wet waste. The introduction of food waste source separation lowers climate change impacts by an additional 33 kg CO2-eq/ton at a 60% sorting efficiency. As the Chinese energy system lowers its climate change impact over the next 30 years, energy recovery from waste treatment will change its relative contribution to climate change. In nonfossil energy systems, landfilling is estimated to have a climate change load of 180-240 kg CO2-eq/ton wet waste, while incineration, including combinations with the source-separation of food waste, will have a load of 310-540 kg CO2-eq/ton wet waste. These large intervals are due to waste composition uncertainty. However, considering a 20 year CH4 characterization factor representing a shorter time perspective, the impacts from landfilling are more dramatic due to the large methane release. This significant climate change impact calls for an increased focus on the developments in Chinese household waste management. The key issues identified may also apply to other countries.

TI Evaluation of waste management options using rapid impact assessment
   matrix and Iranian Leopold matrix in Birjand, Iran
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Population growth and the corresponding production of more waste as well as considering the lack of appropriate municipal solid waste management strategies in recent years have confronted the city of Birjand with huge waste disposal problem. This study evaluated different waste management options in Birjand, including open dumping, sanitary landfill, composting and recycling. Environmental impact assessment of these options was performed using two methods: rapid impact assessment matrix and Iranian Leopold matrix (modified Leopold matrix). The rapid impact assessment matrix method provides fast and accurate ways of analysis and reanalysis of specified components. Iranian Leopold matrix chiefly is used for the reorganization of the project impacts in both the building and operation stages. Composting option, with final scores of -0.5 and -2.34, respectively, in rapid impact assessment matrix and Iranian Leopold Matrix, had the least negative environmental impact. Also, as a result of both methods, open dumping had the most negative environmental impact. The result of sustainability determination for four alternatives showed that the composting, with S-Value equal 0.01 and -0.162, respectively, in rapid impact assessment matrix and Iranian Leopold matrix, is more sustainable than the other options. Therefore, composting option was introduced as first priority and the most logical strategy for municipal solid waste management in Birjand. Unfortunately, open dumping is currently the most common method of waste management in this city.

TI Municipal solid waste management and landfilling technologies: a review
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB The USA, China and India are the top three producers of municipal solid waste. The composition of solid wastes varies with income: low-to-middle-income population generates mainly organic wastes, whereas high-income population produces more waste paper, metals and glasses. Management of municipal solid waste includes recycling, incineration, waste-to-energy conversion, composting or landfilling. Landfilling for solid waste disposal is preferred in many municipalities globally. Landfill sites act as ecological reactors where wastes undergo physical, chemical and biological transformations. Hence, critical factors for sustainable landfilling are landfill liners, the thickness of the soil cover, leachate collection, landfill gas recovery and flaring facilities. Here, we review the impact of landfill conditions such as construction, geometry, weather, temperature, moisture, pH, biodegradable matter and hydrogeological parameters on the generation of landfill gases and leachate. Bioreactor landfills appear as the next-generation sanitary landfills, because they augment solid waste stabilization in a time-efficient manner, as a result of controlled recirculation of leachate and gases. We discuss volume reduction, resource recovery, valorization of dumped wastes, environmental protection and site reclamation toward urban development. We present the classifications and engineered iterations of landfills, operations, mechanisms and mining.

TI Inventory of Wastes Generated in Polish Sewage Sludge Incineration
   Plants and Their Possible Circular Management Directions
SO RESOURCES-BASEL
AB A dynamic development of sewer networks and municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) leads to the formation a large amounts of municipal sewage sludges (MSSs) which have to be disposed. One of the MSS disposal practices is thermal conversion in mono-incineration plants. Nowadays, there are 11 such installations in Poland, with the total capacity 160,300 Mg d.w. of MSSs per year. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of wastes generated in Polish MSS mono-incineration plants. As a consequence of MSSs incineration, various types of waste are generated including, for example, bottom and fly ash, dust or solid waste. The most valuable waste is sewage sludge ash (SSA), which can be used in other industries, as fertilizer or construction sectors. In the circular economy (CE) model, SSA should be treated as a secondary source of raw materials, such as phosphates (replacement of nutrients by P-rich ashes in fertilizers) or sand (replacement of sand by ashes in construction materials). Current practices of SSA management include landfilling, recovery at WWTPs or management by external companies (recovery, disposal or collection). To preserve the utility value of SSA, it should be stored selectively, and then directed to raw materials recovery. This creates the possibility of turning waste into a secondary resource, after meeting certain conditions which depend on which product the waste is directed to. Moreover, this waste management practice is recommended in the Polish documents regarding the usage of SSA, and it can strengthen the accomplishment of the European Green Deal, which is the newest roadmap for making the EU's economy sustainable and circular.

TI Risk of municipal solid waste compost and sewage sludge use on
   photosynthetic performance in common crop (Triticum durum)
SO ACTA PHYSIOLOGIAE PLANTARUM
AB The effect of composted municipal solid waste (MSW) and sewage sludge (SS) on photosynthetic activity of wheat (Triticum durum L.) was investigated. Chlorophyll fluorescence and gas exchange parameters were assessed following application of up to 300 t ha(-1) of MSW compost or SS. 100 t ha(-1) MSW compost was optimal for the plant growth, which showed 78% stimulation as compared to the control. This was associated with higher maximum quantum efficiency (F (v) /F (m)) of photosystem II (PSII) and the actual quantum efficiency of PSII open centers at light adapted state (Delta F/F'(m)). Maximal values of net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance were recorded at 100 t ha(-1) MSW compost (+40 and +116%, respectively). Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO) activity was also significantly stimulated at 100 t ha(-1), while less significant impact was found in SS treatment. A marked accumulation of Ni, Pb, Cu, and Zn in concomitance with membrane lipid peroxidation were observed at 200-300 t ha(-1) MSW compost and SS, resulting in lower photosynthetic activity and altered PSII functional integrity. Altogether, these results suggest that the MSW compost at 100 t ha(-1) would be suitable for wheat cultivation, within the critical limits of heavy metal accumulation. However, long-term field experiments seem necessary to more accurately evaluate the safety of MSW application.

TI Organic waste biorefineries: Looking towards implementation
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The concept of biorefinery expands the possibilities to extract value from organic matter in form of either bespoke crops or organic waste. The viability of biorefinery schemes depends on the recovery of higher-value chemicals with potential for a wide distribution and an untapped marketability. The feasibility of biorefining organic waste is enhanced by the fact that the biorefinery will typically receive a waste management fee for accepting organic waste. The development and implementation of waste biorefinery concepts can open up a wide array of possibilities to shift waste management towards higher sustainability. However, barriers encompassing environmental, technical, economic, logistic, social and legislative aspects need to be overcome. For instance, waste biorefineries are likely to be complex systems due to the variability, heterogeneity and low purity of waste materials as opposed to dedicated biomasses. This article discusses the drivers that can make the biorefinery concept applicable to waste management and the possibilities for its development to full scale. Technological, strategic and market constraints affect the successful implementations of these systems. Fluctuations in waste characteristics, the level of contamination in the organic waste fraction, the proximity of the organic waste resource, the markets for the biorefinery products, the potential for integration with other industrial processes and disposal of final residues are all critical aspects requiring detailed analysis. Furthermore, interventions from policy makers are necessary to foster sustainable bio-based solutions for waste management. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This waste management center will be equipped with two plants for energy production, from waste and from landfill gas. These plants will annually produce about 216 GWh of electricity and about 174 GWh of heat. The importance of such a project is manifold because it solves the long-standing problem of waste management in Belgrade based on landfilling at the non-sanitary landfill Vinca, which is a great burden on the environment with potential risk to human health, while introducing a new dimension in energy production in Serbia.

TI Sustainable disposal of excess sludge: Incineration without anaerobic
   digestion
SO WATER RESEARCH
AB Handling excess sludge produced by wastewater treatment is a common problem worldwide. Due to limited space available in landfills, as well as difficulties involved in using excess sludge in agriculture, there is a need for alternative disposal methods. Although anaerobic digestion (AD) is widely used in processing sludge, only partial energy recovery from methane and sludge volume reduction can be achieved, resulting in a substantial amount of sludge remaining, which needs to be disposed of. Direct incineration after sludge drying is one possible option, a practice that is already in place in some cities in China. A comparison between direct incineration and conventional AD (with or without pretreatment by thermal hydrolysis) has to be made with respect to the energy balance and investment & operational (I & O) costs. This comparison reveals direct incineration to have the lowest energy deficit and I & O costs. Therefore, it is expected that direct incineration without AD will become the preferred sustainable approach to handling sludge. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB The integrated management of sludge and bio-waste by co-digestion and composting were investigated in a life cycle perspective. The working operations of a full-scale digester of an existing wastewater treatment plant for waste-mixed sludge (WMS) stabilization were reproduced using a pilot-scale apparatus. The effect of WMS co-digested with fruit and vegetable waste (FVW) was investigated at different organic loading rates (OLR), from 1.46 kg VS/m(3) day to 2.8 kg VS/m(3) day, and at reduced hydraulic retention time, from 14 days to about 10 days. Methane production per unit of digester volume increased from about 140 NL/m(3) day to a maximum of about 900 NL/m(3) day when OLR was increased from 1.46 kg VS/m(3) day to 2.1 kg VS/m(3) day. The maximum electrical energy producible from the full-scale anaerobic facility was about 3,500,000 kW h/year. In these conditions the electrical power output and the net efficiency of the co-generator were 470 kW and 37%, respectively. The life cycle analysis study highlighted the benefits achievable in terms of avoided resource depletion and ozone depletion potential. The best environmental performances were for an ORL of 2.1 kg VS/m(3) day. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Environmental Impact Assessment of Food Waste Management Using Two
   Composting Techniques
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Food waste is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and therefore global warming. As such, the management of food waste can play a fundamental role in the reduction of preventable emissions associated with food waste. In this study, life cycle assessment (LCA) has been used to evaluate and compare the environmental impact associated with two composting techniques for treating food waste using SimaPro software; windrow composting and the hybrid anaerobic digestion (AD) method. The study, based on a 1 tonne of food waste as a functional unit for a case study in the State of Qatar, concludes that anaerobic digestion combined composting presents a smaller environmental burden than windrow composting. The majority of the emissions generated are due to the use of fossil fuels during transportation, which correspond to approximately 60% of the total impact, followed by the impact of composting with 40% of the impact especially in terms of global warming potential. Environmental assessment impacts were the highest in windrow composting for the acidification impact category (9.39 x 10 - 1 kg SO2 eq). While for AD combined composting the impact was highest for the human toxicity impact category (3.47 x 10 kg 1,4 - DB eq).

TI Is anaerobic digestion a reliable barrier for deactivation of pathogens
   in biosludge?
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB As World Health Organization advocates, the global burden of sanitation related disease and access to safely managed sanitation and safely treated wastewater should be monitored strictly. However, the spread of pathogens through various agricultural applications or direct discharge of sewage sludge generated in municipal wastewater treatment plants poses a serious challenge on the environment and public health. Anaerobic digestion (AD), the principal method of stabilizing biosolids, can efficiently and largely deactivate viable pathogens, including parasite, virus, and the pathogens harboring antibiotic resistance genes. This review aims to provide a critical overview regarding the deactivation of sludge-associated pathogens by AD, through which a serious concern on the effectiveness and rationality of AD towards sludge pathogens control was raised. Meanwhile, the underlying deactivation mechanisms and affecting factors were all discussed, with the focus on pathogen-associated modeling, engineering design and technological aspects of AD. Lastly, a matric method incorporating the operating strategy of AD with the risk assessment was proposed for evaluating the reliability of AD-based pathogen deactivation, while the research agenda forward was also outlined.

AB Overall in Latvia every year there are 600,000 to 700,000 tonnes of waste, about half of this amount is considered to be biodegradable municipal waste. The municipal solid waste management in their administrative areas is the responsibility of municipalities. Approximately 77% of Latvian household waste is disposed of in landfills or dumps, and every year the amount of waste disposed increases. Besides, the amount of hazardous waste is increasing and hazardous waste in the most part consists of metal production waste. Currently, hazardous waste is temporarily stored in a specially equipped commercial and waste storage sites. However, hazardous waste collection and disposal is improved, as well as the amount of recycled packaging.
   Also, the construction process creates a large amount of waste. The construction waste is referred to as waste from construction, renovation and demolition, as well as debris and damaged materials resulting from the construction process, or materials used in the construction site temporarily. Usually the construction waste from residential buildings contains concrete, wood, metal, plaster panels, oil, chemicals and roof trim materials. Construction waste can contain environment and human health hazardous substances. It can cause soil contamination if improperly disposed. Precipitation may result in contaminated groundwater.
   These processes have defined the topicality of this article; the aim of the article is to analyze construction waste management processes, identify problems and possible solutions. This paper addresses problems related to construction waste separation, storage, transportation and disposal and the problems associated with waste management in Latvian context of sustainable construction.

TI A comparison of the Analytic Hierarchy Process and the Analysis and
   Synthesis of Parameters under Information Deficiency method for
   assessing the sustainability of waste management scenarios
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The selection of an appropriate Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis method or a combination thereof, is essential to support sustainability decision-making in the waste management sector. None of the methods is ideal, so that sometimes a combination of methods may be necessary. The aim of this study is to examine the ability the Analysis and Synthesis of Parameters under Information Deficiency method to be used in sustainable waste management, as never been used method in this sector. In order to do this, scenario ranking is done using the Analytic Hierarchy Process, and the results are compared with results obtained by the Analysis and Synthesis of Parameters under Information Deficiency method. Four waste treatment scenarios were developed based on the waste composition in city of Nit, and nine indicators were selected. The obtained results indicate that there is no significant difference in the scenario ranking, regardless of the method used, the Analytic Hierarchy Process or the Analysis and Synthesis of Parameters under Information Deficiency method. The best sustainable waste management scenario is the scenario which involves composting of organic waste and recycling of inorganic waste (393% ranking priority). This study has illustrated how the Analysis and Synthesis of Parameters under Information Deficiency method, that has a capability to work with a lack of information, which is often the case in waste management, can be applied to assessment sustainability of waste management scenario.

TI Municipal solid waste generation, composition, and management: the
   global scenario
SO SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL
AB Purpose
   Due to the increasing population and prosperity, the generation rate of municipal solid waste (MSW) has increased significantly, resulting in serious problems on public health and the environment. Every single person in the world is affected by the municipal solid waste management (MSWM) issue. MSWM is reaching a critical level in almost all areas of the world and seeking the development of MSW strategies for a sustainable environment. This paper aims to present the existing global status of MSW generation, composition, management and related problems.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A total of 59 developed and developing countries have been grouped based on their gross national income to compare the status of various MSWM technologies among them. A total of 19 selection criteria have been discussed to select appropriate MSWM technology(s) for a city/town, which affects their applicability, operational suitability and performance. All risks and challenges arising during the life cycle of the waste to energy (WtE) project have also been discussed. This paper also gives a comparative overview of different globally accepted MSWM technologies and the present market growth of all WtE technologies.
   Findings
   It was found that most developed countries have effectively implemented the solid waste management (SWM) hierarchy and are now focusing heavily on reducing, reusing and recycling of MSW. On the other hand, SWM has become very serious in low-income and low-middle-income countries because most of the MSW openly dumps and most countries are dependent on inadequate waste infrastructure and the informal sector. There are also some other major challenges related to effective waste policies, availability of funds, appropriate technology selection and adequacy of trained people. This study clears the picture of MSW generation, composition, management strategies and policies at the worldwide context. This manuscript could be valuable for all nations around the world where effective MSWM has not yet been implemented.
   Originality/value
   This study clears the picture of solid waste generation, composition, management strategies and policies at the worldwide context. This manuscript could be valuable for all nations around the world where effective MSWM has not yet been implemented. In this study, no data was generated. All supporting data were obtained from previously published papers in journals, the outcomes of the international conferences and published reports by government organizations.

TI Potentiality of Waste-to-Energy Sector Coupling in the MENA Region:
   Jordan as a Case Study
SO ENERGIES
AB Population growth, urbanization, and changes in lifestyle have led to an increase in waste generation quantities. The waste management system in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is still considered an adolescent system, while developed countries have made great progress in this field, including regulation, financing, administration, separation at source, recycling, and converting waste to energy. At the same time, in the MENA region, the best performance of the recycling process is around 7-10% of total waste. Nowadays, many developed countries like Germany are shifting from waste management to material flow systems, which represent the core of a circular economy. Also, it should be stated here that all countries that have a robust and integrated waste management system include waste-to-energy (W-to-E) incineration plants in their solutions for dealing with residual waste, which is still generated after passing through the entire treatment cycle (hierarchy). Therefore, this paper illustrates the potentiality of embedding waste incineration plants in the MENA region, especially in large cities, and addressing the economic and financial issues for the municipalities. Cities in these countries would like to build and operate waste treatment plants; however, municipalities do not have the sustainable investment and operating costs. The solution is to maximize the income from the output, such as energy, recycling materials, etc. In addition, the MENA region is facing another dilemma, which is water scarcity due to climate change, increasing evaporation, and reduction of precipitation. This research illustrates a simulated model for a waste incineration plant in the MENA region. The EBSILON 13.2 software package was used to achieve this process. Furthermore, the simulated plant applies the concept of waste-to-energy-to-water, so that not only is waste converted to energy but, by efficient usage of multi-stage flash (MSF) technology, this system is able to generate 23 MWe of electric power and 8500 m(3)/day of potable water. A cost analysis was also implemented to calculate the cost of thermal treatment of each ton of municipal solid waste (MSW) during the life span of the plant. It was found that the average cost of treatment over 30 years would be around US$39/ton.

TI Opportunities and challenges in sustainable treatment and resource reuse
   of sewage sludge: A review
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB Sludge or waste activated sludge (WAS) generated from wastewater treatment plants may be considered a nuisance. It is a key source for secondary environmental contamination on account of the presence of diverse pollutants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, dioxins, furans, heavy metals, etc.). Innovative and cost-effective sludge treatment pathways are a prerequisite for the safe and environment-friendly disposal of WAS. This article delivers an assessment of the leading disposal (volume reduction) and energy recovery routes such as anaerobic digestion, incineration, pyrolysis, gasification and enhanced digestion using microbial fuel cell along with their comparative evaluation, to measure their suitability for different sludge compositions and resources availability. Furthermore, the authors shed light on the bio-refinery and resource recovery approaches to extract value added products and nutrients from WAS, and control options for metal elements and micro-pollutants in sewage sludge. Recovery of enzymes, bio-plastics, bio-pesticides, proteins and phosphorus are discussed as a means to visualize sludge as a potential opportunity instead of a nuisance.

TI Effect of Nutrient Removal and Resource Recovery on Life Cycle Cost and
   Environmental Impacts of a Small Scale Water Resource Recovery Facility
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB To limit effluent impacts on eutrophication in receiving waterbodies, a small community water resource recovery facility (WRRF) upgraded its conventional activated sludge treatment process for biological nutrient removal, and considered enhanced primary settling and anaerobic digestion (AD) with co-digestion of high strength organic waste (HSOW). The community initiated the resource recovery hub concept with the intention of converting an energy-consuming wastewater treatment plant into a facility that generates energy and nutrients and reuses water. We applied life cycle assessment and life cycle cost assessment to evaluate the net impact of the potential conversion. The upgraded WRRF reduced eutrophication impacts by 40% compared to the legacy system. Other environmental impacts such as global climate change potential (GCCP) and cumulative energy demand (CED) were strongly affected by AD and composting assumptions. The scenario analysis showed that HSOW co-digestion with energy recovery can lead to reductions in GCCP and CED of 7% and 108%, respectively, for the upgraded WRRF (high feedstock-base AD performance scenarios) relative to the legacy system. The cost analysis showed that using the full digester capacity and achieving high digester performance can reduce the life cycle cost of WRRF upgrades by 15% over a 30-year period.

TI MONITORING OF HEAVY METALS, EOX AND LAS IN SEWAGE SLUDGE FOR
   AGRICULTURAL USE: A CASE STUDY
SO DETRITUS
AB Subsequent to the increasing diffusion of wastewater treatment, particularly in high- and middle-income countries, the sewage sludge generated should be treated and valorised in an ecological and economic way, thus contributing to the circular economy. In this study, the monitoring of Heavy Metals (HM), Extractable Organic Halogens (EOX) and Linear Alkylbenzene Sulphonate (LAS) in sewage sludge from 10 different wastewater treatment plants located in Friuli Venezia Giulia (Italy) was reported, and their macronutrient content provided. The obtained results showed, for all tested samples, that HM content in sewage sludge was below the maximum permitted limits provided for by Italian and European regulations for agricultural reuse. Comparison with a similar monitoring campaign carried out in 2006 revealed how, while wastewater treatment plants efficiently resolved water pollution, they accumulated heavy metals and other persistent toxic compounds in sludge, thus restricting their potential reuse. Consequently, consistent and regular sludge monitoring should be undertaken to prevent soil and groundwater contamination. These outcomes could be of particular relevance for the future perspective of agricultural reuse of sewage sludge in waste management practices.

TI The effect of substrate ratio and total solids on biogas production from
   anaerobic co-digestion of municipal solid waste and sewage sludge
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Recycling waste and converting municipal solid waste (MSW) to useful materials, especially energy sources, is one of the most useful environmental effort, which prevent biological pollution and minimizes the stress on natural resources. This study investigates the improvement of biogas gained from MSW. Anaerobic digestion (AD) MSW and sewage sludge (SS) were studied at different mixing ratios at mesophilic condition. Higher methane yield but longer hydraulic retention time (HRT) was observed by increasing the percentage of MSW. The optimal mixing ratio for biogas production was determined. After 20 days, approximately 90% (376.84 mL/g VS) of the cumulative methane was produced. The same ratio was used for further study on the effect of total solids (TS) (5-25%) on biogas yield. It was found that lower TS levels (5-10%) yield more methane. Biogas production at 5% TS was 64% higher than that of 25% TS. The amounts of methane produced at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25% TS were 230.3, 196.8, 159.5, 129.4, and 83.3 mL/g VS, respectively.

TI Municipal solid waste management in Pudong New Area, China
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The increase in population, the rapid economic growth and the rise in community living standards accelerate municipal solid waste (MSW) generation in developing cities. This problem is especially serious in Pudong New Area, Shanghai, China. The daily amount of MSW generated in Pudong was about 1.11 kg per person in 2006. According to the current population growth trend, the solid waste quantity generated will continue to increase with the city's development. In this paper, we describe a waste generation and composition analysis and provide a comprehensive review of municipal solid waste management (MSWM) in Pudong. Some of the important aspects of waste management, such as the current status of waste collection, transport and disposal in Pudong, will be illustrated. Also, the current situation will be evaluated, and its problems will be identified. Crown Copyright (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Municipal solid waste management in Beijing City
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB This paper presents an overview of municipal solid waste (MSW) management in Beijing City. Beijing, the capital of China, has a land area of approximately 1368.32 km(2) with an urban population of about 13.33 million in 2006. Over the past three decades, MSW generation in Beijing City has increased tremendously from 1.04 million tons in 1978 to 4.134 million tons in 2006. The average generation rate of MSW in 2006 was 0.85 kg/capita/day. Food waste comprised 63.39%, followed by paper (11.07%), plastics (12.7%) and dust (5.78%). While all other wastes including tiles, textiles, glass. metals and wood accounted for less than 3%. Currently, 90% of MSW generated in Beijing is landfilled, 8% is incinerated and 2% is composted. Source separation collection, as a waste reduction method, has been carried out in a total of 2255 demonstration residential and commercial areas (covering about 4.7 million people) up to the end of 2007. Demonstration districts should be promoted over a wider range instead of demonstration communities. The capacity of transfer stations and treatment plants is an urgent problem as these sites are seriously overloaded. These problems should first be solved by constructing more sites and converting to new treatment technologies. Improvements in legislation, public education and the management of waste pickers are problematic issues which need to be addressed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Design of a laboratory scale bioreactor for treating landfill waste
SO APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE
AB This article documents the design and construction of a laboratory-scale (1.5 m(3)) bioreactor system that can be used to simulate anaerobic microbial processes in landfills. This design has use in feasibility studies of landfill bioreactor operation and management technologies. The system was designed for gas collection and to provide leachate recirculation and moisture addition to accelerate biodegradation. Two bioreactors were located with fresh municipal solid waste (MSW) from a sanitary landfill and instrumented to monitor temperature, mass, leachate production, and preferential flow of leachate within the heterogeneous material. One of the bioreactors received a layer of municipal sewage sludge to assess the feasibility of co-disposal. In this initial phase of the study, the decomposition of landfill waste in the bioreactors was monitored over 15 months. The decomposition was not intense, and it was concluded that microbial biodegradative activity was limited by a high C:N ratio and a high proportion of paper and plastic (ca. 70%-wt/wt) of the MSW.

TI Integrated decision-support methodology for combined
   centralized-decentralized waste-to-energy management systems design
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB The rapid expansion of urban populations and concomitant increase in the generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) exert considerable pressure on the conventional centralized MSW management system and are beginning to exceed disposal capacities. To tackle this issue, the conventional centralized MSW management system is more likely to evolve toward a more decentralized system with smaller capacity waste treatment facilities that are integrated at different levels of the urban environment, e.g., buildings, districts, and municipalities. In addition, MSW can become an important urban resource to address the rising energy consumption through waste-to-energy (WTE) technologies capable of generating electricity, heat, and biogas. This shift toward the combined centralized-decentralized waste-to-energy management system (WtEMS) requires an adapted decision-support methodology (DSM) that can assist decision-makers in analyzing MSW generation across large urban territories and designing optimal long-term WtEMS.
   The proposed integrated DSM for WtEMS planning relies on: i) an MSW segregation and prediction methodology, ii) an optimization methodology for the deployment of multi-level urban waste infrastructure combining centralized and decentralized facilities, and iii) a multi-criterion sustainability framework for WtEMS assessment. The proposed DSM was tested on a case study that was located in Singapore. The proposed WtEMS not only reduced the total operational expenses by about 50%, but also increased revenues from electricity recovery by two times in comparison with the conventional MSW management system. It also allowed more optimal land use (capacity-land fragmentation was reduced by 74.8%) and reduced the size of the required transportation fleet by 15.3% in comparison with the conventional MSW system. The Global Warming Potential (GWP) was improved by about 18.7%.

TI Stabilization of Municipal Solid Waste Fly Ash, Obtained by
   Co-Combustion with Sewage Sludge, Mixed with Bottom Ash Derived by the
   Same Plant
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB This study presents an innovative stabilization method of fly ash derived from co-combustion of municipal solid waste and sewage sludge. Bottom ash, obtained from the same process, is used as a stabilizing agent. The stabilization method involved the use of two other components-flue gas desulfurization residues and coal fly ash. Leaching tests were performed on stabilized samples, aged in a laboratory at different times. The results reveal the reduction of the concentrations of heavy metals, particularly Zn and Pb about two orders of magnitude lower with respect to fly ash. The immobilization of heavy metals on the solid material mainly depends on three factors-the amount of used ash, the concentrations of Zn and Pb in as-received fly ash and the pH of the solution of the final materials. The inert powder, obtained after the stabilization, is a new eco-material, that is promising to be used as filler in new sustainable composite materials.

TI Discrete event simulation to aid decision-making and mitigation in solid
   waste management
SO MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB This article aims to evaluate municipal solid waste (MSW) management schemes in order to promote sustainability and eco-efficiency, core elements in global mitigation strategies in both public and private policies. A discrete event simulation (DES) approach was used to integrate the economic, environmental, and social aspects related to aseptic carton packages (ACP) in Itajuba, Brazil. The simulated scenarios consider three alternatives for disposing ACP: landfills, recycling, and incineration with energy recovery. According to our findings, incineration alternatives are preferred from an eco-efficiency perspective, given the potential greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions and due to the possibility of energy recover, which reinforces the contribution of this technology to promote sustainability as largely found in the international literature. Given the context of MSW management in Brazil, this represents a significant opportunity to increase the effectiveness of mitigation strategies adopted in the country. Taking into account that this is by far the least applied technology, the authors strongly advocate that global strategies for mitigation consider different approaches to integrate carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reductions related to the entire MSW management system and its alternatives, thus advancing from a waste disposal-oriented system to a life cycle-oriented system.

AB End-of-life (EoL) tires are a non-degradable waste, which is generated annually in large amounts all over the world. Due to the high carbon content, EoL tires have a large energetic potential, which currently is not fully used. Moreover, municipal solid waste (MSW) and sewage sludge have a significant growing potential for energy recovery. The aim of the study it is to assess the environmental impact and potential benefits generated during the gate-to-gate life cycle of preparation of the end-of life tires and solid recovered fuels from selected waste for energy recovery. The paper presents the impact assessment results of fuel preparation for energy recovery from waste derived fuels according to three selected fuels' scenarios: (a) shredded EoL tires, (b) solid recovered fuel produced from MSW, and (c) solid recovered fuel produced from pre-composted sewage sludge combined with biomass residues.

TI A comprehensive review of green policy, anaerobic digestion of animal
   manure and chicken litter feedstock potential - Global and Irish
   perspective
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Renewable energy has become increasingly popular in the recent times as countries have shifted focus towards carbon-neutral and environmentally sustainable sources of energy. Biogas and biomethane derived energy from Anaerobic Digestion of organic waste have proved to be excellent alternative to fossil-fuel based energy. Many countries around the world are actively adopting biomethane as an alternative to petrol/diesel or use biogas to provide energy for the domestic sector through combined heat and power plants. The contribution of anaerobic digestion in the Irish energy sector remains quite low as compared to its European union counterparts due to related legislation and lack of government incentives. Nevertheless, Ireland is rich in biomass with a huge potential for developing its renewable energy sector from anaerobic digestion of agricultural waste, which is relatively inexpensive and available here in abundance. Chicken litter is one such waste which offers a variety of environmental benefits as anaerobic digestion feedstock. In comparison to cow manure and pig manure, chicken litter was relatively unpopular in anaerobic digestion due to its high nitrogen and lignocellulose content. Further, the global production of chicken manure has been increasing constantly thus making its disposal challenging across the world. However, researchers have identified many optimisation strategies to overcome these issues and demonstrated the advantages of using chicken litter in anaerobic digestion including odor reduction, greenhouse gas mitigation, production of gaseous biofuel, avoiding eutrophication of water bodies and significantly improving global production of renewable energy to help countries reduce their carbon emissions.

TI Environmental impact of rejected materials generated in organic fraction
   of municipal solid waste anaerobic digestion plants: Comparison of wet
   and dry process layout
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Anaerobic digestion of source separated organic fraction of municipal solid waste is an increasing waste valorization alternative instead of incineration or landfilling of untreated biodegradable wastes. Nevertheless, a significant portion of biodegradable wastes entering the plant is lost in pre-treatments and post-treatments of anaerobic digestion facilities together with other improper materials such as plastics, paper, textile materials and metals. The rejected materials lost in these stages have two main implications: (i) less organic material enters to digesters and, as a consequence, there is a loss of biogas production and (ii) the rejected materials end up in landfills or incinerators contributing to environmental impacts such as global warming or eutrophication.
   The main goals of this study are (i) to estimate potential losses of biogas in the rejected solid materials generated during the pre- and post-treatments of two full-scale anaerobic digestion facilities and (ii) to evaluate the environmental burdens associated to the final disposal (landfill or incineration) of these rejected materials by means of Life Cycle Assessment.
   This study shows that there is a lost of potential biogas production, ranging from 8% to 15%, due to the loss of organic matter during pre-treatment stages in anaerobic digestion facilities. From an environmental point of view, the Life Cycle Assessment shows that the incineration scenario is the most favorable alternative for eight out of nine impact categories compared with the landfill scenario. The studied impact categories are Climate Change, Fossil depletion, Freshwater eutrophication, Marine eutrophication, Ozone depletion, Particulate matter formation, Photochemical oxidant formation, Terrestrial acidification and Water depletion.

TI Combined Use of an Information System and LCA Approach to Assess the
   Performances of a Solid Waste Management System
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB A municipal solid waste information system, named W-MySir, is utilised to acquire high-quality data to implement an attributional life-cycle assessment (LCA) focused on the evolution of the environmental performances of municipal solid waste management in a specific area. The main aim was to investigate how this combined approach can be used for monitoring progress of the management scheme toward important targets, such as being CO2-neutral, increasing the circularity of the service, and planning a transparent approach to cost evaluation. The analysis was applied to the municipality of Procida, one of the three islands of Naples Bay (Italy), and focused on the last ten years of activity of the local solid waste service. The results of the life cycle impact assessment are reported in terms of the main impact categories. They indicate a positive evolution of the environmental performances, with improvements of up to 140% for global warming potential. The positive results are mainly due to the large increase in household source separation and separate collection in Procida during the period under analysis, together with the availability of a more integrated and sustainable regional system of solid waste management. Further improvements may be achieved through better performance at the sorting and remanufacturing stages of dry recyclable fractions and the availability of anaerobic digestion units to produce biomethane from organic fractions of municipal solid waste. The combined approach indicates potential further benefits for both the tools: LCAs could provide reliable results in shorter times; information systems could offer a wider spectrum of services for monitoring and planning waste management systems in a sustainable way.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB The rapidly increasing generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) threatens the environmental integrity and well-being of humans at a global level. Incineration is regarded as a technically sound technology for the management of MSW. However, the effective management of the municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) ashes remains a challenge. This article presents the global dynamics of MSWI ashes research from 1994 to 2018 based on a bibliometric analysis of 1810 publications (research articles and conference proceedings) extracted from the Web of Science database, followed by a comprehensive summary on the research developments in the field. The results indicate the rapid growth of annual publications on MSWI ashes research, with China observed as the most productive country within the study period. Waste Management, Journal of Hazardous Materials, Chemosphere and Waste Management & Research, which accounted for 35.42% of documents on MSWI research, are the most prominent journals in the field. The most critical thematic areas on this topic are MSWI ashes characterisation, dioxin emissions from fly ash, valorisation of bottom ash and heavy metal removal. The evolution of MSWI ashes treatment technologies is also discussed, together with the challenges and future research directions. This is the first bibliometric analysis on global MSWI ashes research based on a sufficiently large dataset, which could provide new insights for researchers to initiate further research with leading institutions/authors and ultimately advance this research field.

TI Anaerobic digestion disposal of sewage sludge pyrolysis liquid in cow
   dung matrix and the enhancing effect of sewage sludge char
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Sewage sludge pyrolysis liquid (SSPL) is a mixture of various toxic organic compounds and moisture, its disposal or valorization are crucial for the sustainability of any pyrolysis plant of sewage sludge (SS). As SSPL showed strong inhibition on anaerobic digestion (AD), in order to fulfill its clean disposal, the study investigates its AD in cow dung matrix under thermophilic condition with sewage sludge char (SSC) addition. Three SSCs produced at different temperatures and two biochars were added into the AD system for comparison. Batch experiments (55 degrees C, 26 days) reveal that addition of SSCs/biochars could increase cumulative methane yield by 57.5-128.7%/120.7-133.7% compared with the group without char addition. Among three SSCs, the one produced at 550 degrees C (550SSC) shows the best effect and has similar promotion effects to those of conventional biochars. The mechanism involved is explained by the following facts: SSCs/biochars addition alleviated microbial inhibition effect of SSPL by adsorbing the toxic organic compounds in the liquid at the early stage, hosting microbes to grow, improving the reaction rate and stabilizing the pH of AD system at around 8, finally helping to obtain an earlier occurrence of daily methane yield peak and contributing to higher methane yields. The rich trace elements contained in SSCs, especially in 550SSC, help to promote the growth of microbes and contribute to the decomposition of toxic organic compounds. GC-MS analyses of digestates reveal that SSPL can be well degraded with help of SSCs/biochars addition after AD process. The obtained results suggest that AD of SSPL in cow dung matrix with 550SSC addition is a reliable and economy alternative for its treatment and valorization. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis on the Use of LCA to Assess the
   Environmental Impacts of the Composting Process
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Following the industrial revolution, major economic and populational growth took place, and, therefore, solid waste generation increased exponentially. Nowadays, waste management still generates major impacts because the current wide offer of waste management strategies includes many solutions that produce suboptimal results, such as landfill or waste incineration. From a circular economy perspective, composting is a potentially sustainable option to treat the organic fraction of solid waste and has the advantage of recycling many organic compounds that can be reintroduced into the natural processes. This study aimed to provide a meta-analysis using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method to evaluate the impacts of composting by performing a systematic literature review of the diversity of approaches and assessing environmental impacts. The results of the impact assessment were highly dependent on the choices made over the system boundary and the functional units. The most cited environmental impacts were Global Warming Potential, Acidification Potential, Eutrophication Potential, Photochemical Oxidation Potential, and Ozone Layer Depletion, as gaseous emissions from the transport and decomposition represent the main contributors to these categories. Using a smaller dataset and evaluating the use of the CML method and the most cited impacts categories, it was found that In-vessel Composting and Home Composting were considered the best environmental options among the studied composting methods. Composting environmental impacts were also highly related to the use of non-renewable energy sources, which puts composting at a disadvantage when compared with the use of anaerobic digestion. Such results emphasize the benefits of using these waste management technologies as complementary instead of substitutes.

TI Sustainable solid waste management in Yemen: environmental, social
   aspects, and challenges
SO BIOMASS CONVERSION AND BIOREFINERY
AB Rapid population growth, urbanization, economic progress, and changing lifestyles all contributed to an increase in resource consumption and waste generation. Global solid waste generation was about 1.3 BT/year and was predicted to further increase to a tremendous amount of 2.2 BT/year by 2030. Municipal solid waste generation is increasing at a high rate, creating immense pressure on municipalities and pollution concerns for the environment. In Yemen, the quantity of municipal solid waste per capita in urban areas is 0.6 kg/day, while in rural areas it is 0.35 kg/day and the increase in the generation of Municipal solid waste is about 3%. Municipal solid waste is characterized by its diverse nature and therefore requires immediate attention for its effective management and disposal. Like most developing countries, the solid waste generated in Yemen is disposed into the landfills due to its simplicity and economical aspects while composting and incineration are rarely utilized. The disposal of waste at landfills is associated with long-term problems, such as leachate pollution, the release of greenhouse gases (GHGs), odor issues, and health concerns for the people living in nearby vicinities. Therefore, the pedal of solid waste management needs to be pressed to protect the resources, environment, and human population. Sustainable solid waste management plays an important role as it encompasses minimization of solid waste at the generation point, proper collection and disposal, utilization, and recovery of waste for energy production. The challenges and the improvement measures for solid waste management are varied for each country, depending on their social, economic, and technological development. The challenges and the improvement measures for solid waste management are varied for each country, depending on their social, economic, and technological development. The situation is gruesome in some of the countries in the Arabian Peninsula, such as Yemen. Thus, this article focused on the present condition of solid waste management, the problems associated with improper solid waste management, and the possible sustainable measures to improve the system in Sana'a, Yemen. The main landfill in Sana'a city is the Al-Azraqain, and the amount of solid waste received is 500,000 tons per year. This study also compared the condition of solid waste management in Yemen with the neighboring countries, which are similar in terms of lifestyle, climatic conditions, and topography. There are too many studies based on the other developing countries in Asia and the rest of the world. But fewer studies are available based on the details of solid waste management in Sana'a, Yemen, because of the unstable and struggling conditions prevailing there. Hence, this study will be beneficial to understand the problem and corrective measures for policymakers and environmental engineers.

TI A review of waste management in Brazil and Portugal: Waste-to-energy as
   pathway for sustainable development
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB In this study, projections and current status of municipal solid waste generation worldwide and its collection, final destination, and waste-to-energy technologies are reviewed. Firstly, an overview of waste generation worldwide is presented comparing income levels and the material composition of residues in several regions. This paper focused on contrasting Brazil and Portugal in terms of waste production and its management from generation to disposal or treatment. Furthermore, it is presented a summary of leading waste-to-energy technologies such as incineration, anaerobic digestion, gasification, pyrolysis, co-combustion, co-gasification, among others. Technical aspects of these thermo-chemical, biological, and physic-chemical processes for the production of biofuels such as biogas, syngas, biodiesel, and hydrogen-enriched gases are presented. Additionally, current aspects of the waste-to-energy market are exposed regarding the major players, investments, and expectations for the future of this activity with the elaboration of SWOT analyses. Finally, a review of greenhouse gases emissions worldwide is presented, specifically from Brazil and Portugal, as well as some consequences of these pollutant gases on the society and the environment and which are the main technologies for carbon dioxide capturing and sequestration as promising solutions for lower pollutant gases concentration in the atmosphere. This review paper aims to provide information for the management of municipal solid waste in Brazil and Portugal considering the mutual objective of meeting sustainable development goals.

TI Systematic Evaluation of Industrial, Commercial, and Institutional Food
   Waste Management Strategies in the United States
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB New regulations and targets limiting the disposal of food waste have been recently enacted in numerous jurisdictions. This analysis evaluated selected environmental implications of food waste management policies using life-cycle assessment. Scenarios were developed to evaluate management alternatives applicable to the waste discarded at facilities where food waste is a large component of the waste (e.g., restaurants, grocery stores, and food processors). Options considered include anaerobic digestion (AD), aerobic composting, waste-to-energy combustion (WTE), and landfilling, and multiple performance levels were considered for each option. The global warming impact ranged from approximately -350 to -45 kg CO(2)e Mg-1 of waste for scenarios using AD, -190 to 62 kg CO(2)e Mg-1 for those using composting, -350 to -28 kg CO(2)e Mg-1 when all waste was managed by WTE, and -260 to 260 kg CO(2)e Mg-1 when all waste was landfilled. Landfill diversion was found to reduce emissions, and diverting food waste from WTE generally increased emissions. The analysis further found that when a 20 year GWP was used instead of a 100 year GWP, every scenario including WTE was preferable to every scenario including landfill. Jurisdictions seeking to enact food waste disposal regulations should consider regional factors and material properties before duplicating existing statutes.

AB Landfills within the City of Johannesburg (CoJ) are running out of airspace. To slow down airspace consumption rate, waste discharged at these landfills must be minimised, and where possible recover useful resources. A multi-criteria decision tool, the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was employed to appropriate technologies for fruit and vegetables waste discharge at Robinson Deep landfill. The goal of the approach is environmental sustainability. Pairwise comparison of four criteria and four technology alternatives were investigated. Data used were retrieved from a research group and consultations with waste to energy experts. Of the four technology alternatives, anaerobic digestion (AD) is the most preferred. Incineration technology has 49.42% preference to AD because it is perceived to reduce the bulkiness of waste discharged at the landfill. Composting has 25.24% preference to AD and it is believed to encourage home management of waste. Consistency ratio for all pairwise comparison was less than 0.1.

TI Assessment of supercritical water gasification of food waste under the
   background of waste sorting: Influences of plastic waste contents
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Waste sorting is being gradually implemented as a key measure for circular and sustainable development in China, food waste will be separately collected and separated from municipal solid waste (MSW), thus the plastic content in food waste also will be reduced. In this study, supercritical water gasification (SCWG) of food waste with different contents of plastic (0-3.5 wt%) was experimentally investigated to simulate the influence of waste sorting on the food waste treatment. The results showed that lower plastic content in food waste favored higher gas yield and gasification efficiencies. The highest H-2 yield and total gas yield were 3.11 mol/kg and 8.41 mol/kg in the plastic-free case, respectively. When the plastic content decreased from 3.5 wt% to 0 wt%, the cold gas efficiency (CGE), carbon conversion efficiency (CE) and hydrogen gasification efficiency (HE) increased by 125.97%, 173.48% and 94.09%, respectively. However, lower plastic content negatively affected the quality of produced syngas through decreasing H2 mole fraction and LHV. The solid residues from SCWG of food waste with lower plastic content had higher ratio of fixed carbon to volatile matter (FC/VM). Based on the analysis of pyrolysis properties and combustion behavior, decreasing the plastic content in food waste helped to improve the thermal stability of solid residues. Moreover, lower plastic content resulted in a decrease of total organic carbon (TOC) concentration in liquid effluent, which is favorable for further treatment of liquid effluent.

TI Experimental investigation of lab scaled sink and float-based
   segregation process for mixed municipal solid waste
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Segregation of municipal solid waste at source lies at the heart of good waste management. Source segregation improves collection and processing efficiency of municipal solid waste management system. But ensuring segregation at source requires better infrastructure and strict compliance systems. That is why most of the urban local bodies of the different developing countries are struggling to manage their solid waste. Such scenario project a need to intervene a segregation approach which can minimise the dependency over source segregation practice. Hence, for inspecting an economical approach for MSW segregation, an experimental investigation has been done to analyse the effect of sink and float separation process on varied sample quantity of mixed MSW. This paper presents the experimental observations and the performance analysis of the segregation process, which will help to check the feasibility of approach and bring out the optimised working model of the lab scaled setup.

TI Estimation of heavy metal transformations in municipal solid waste
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The behaviour of heavy metals bound to municipal solid waste (MSW) and exposed to 2 decades of anaerobic waste stabilization processes have been estimated. Heavy metal solid forms in a waste degradation residue have been compared with a reconstructed waste similar to that initially disposed of in 1973. The initial waste was composed of a mixture of shredded MSW (95% dry wt.) and anaerobic sewage sludge (5% dry wt.). A sequential chemical extraction method has been used to fractionate the heavy metals into five categories of available and reactive solid forms. The results imply that these forms can be ascribed to approximately 30% of the total content of the heavy metals in the degraded waste and the portion of heavy metals bound to oxidizable solid forms seems to be higher in the degraded than the fresh MSW. The bulk of the remaining heavy metals are assumed to be less available and bound into resistant lattice structures, such as metal and polymer items. A comparison between fractionation patterns of the waste in this study and of a few sediments collected from different environments imply similarities between the fresh MSW and an oxic sediment from one site and the sewage sludge and anoxic sediments from another site. Fractionation patterns of the degraded waste are found to be quite similar to those of the anoxic sediments, except for Pb, Ni and Cd which are more similar to fresh MSW.

TI Sustainability analysis of implementing sludge reduction in overall
   sludge management process: Where do we stand?
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB Sustainable sludge management has significance due to the great potential of recovering energy and resources, potentially achieving carbon neutrality and energy positivity in the process. However, whether the sludge reduction strategy really benefits the aim of a sustainable sludge management process requires a holistic analysis. In this study, nine scenarios involving different sludge management strategies with or without sludge reduction methods were environmentally and economically assessed to clarify the necessity of adopting a sludge reduction or not. Results reveal that direct sludge incineration without prior in-plant sludge reduction generates the least environmental impacts (less than 25-120 %), but it increases operation costs by 103-110 % compared to landfilling with prior in-plant sludge reduction. Chemical Oxygen Demand flows indicate that direct sludge incineration is superior in converting organic matter into energy compared to employing sludge reduction followed by landfilling or land application. This converted energy offsets environmental impacts from electricity consumption, but these electricity benefits are insignificant in the overall cost. Case studies suggest that direct sludge incineration could facilitate potential nutrient and energy recovery, especially for metropolis. While sludge reduction strategies are more suited for developing regions relying on landfills or land application, to lower the economic burdens. The findings of this study tend to shed light on the decision-making of adopting sludge reduction strategies and sustainable sludge management.

TI Techno-economic analysis of single-stage and temperature-phase anaerobic
   co-digestion of sewage sludge, wine vinasse, and poultry manure
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD) is a mature and consolidated waste management technology that can transform agro-industrial by-products into biogas and digestate. This study conducted a techno-economic assessment of bioenergy and agricultural fertilizer production from AcoD of sewage sludge, wine vinasse, and poultry manure. In this case study, three configurations were investigated: i) Scenario 1, AcoD in thermophilic temperature; ii) Scenario 2, AcoD in mesophilic temperature; and iii) Scenario 3, AcoD in a temperature phase (TPAD) system, where the digestate produced in the first reactor (thermophilic) feeds the second reactor (mesophilic). The process was designed to manage 24,022 m3 wine vinasse y-1, 24,022 m3 sewage sludge y-1, and 480 m3 poultry manure y-1. The major cost was the fixed capital investment for the single-stage (320,981 USD) and TPAD processes (379,698 USD). The TPAD process produced the highest electricity (1058.99 MWh y-1) and heat (4765.47 GJ y-1) with the lowest cost of manufacturing for electricity (84.99 USD MWh-1), heat (0.019 USD MJ-1), and fertilizer (30.91 USD t-1). Regarding the profitability indicators, the highest net present value (509,011 USD) and the lowest payback time (4.24 y) were achieved for Scenario 3. In conclusion, TPAD is a profitable and sustainable waste-to-energy management technology that can be applied in a circular economy framework to recover bioenergy and fertilizer, contributing to decreasing the carbon footprint of the agri-food sector.

AB The aim of this study is to assess the environmental impacts and benefits from municipal solid waste management systems in Xicheng district in Beijing. EASEWASTE, a life-cycle-based model, was used to evaluate different levels of the waste systems, including waste generation, collection, transportation, treatment and disposal technologies. Three integrated models were established according to the current and modified solid waste systems in Xicheng district. The investigation on the current waste system showed that, long distance transportation brought many impacts to photochemical ozone formation, acidification and global warming due to the fuel combustion during transportation. Furthermore, the methane emission from landfill was the dominate contributor to photochemical ozone formation and global warming. Introduction of a large transfer station could reduce the fuel consumption of transportation. The modified system where source separation of food waste was introduced and the remaining waste was assumed to be incinerated was then modeled. The results presented a significant improvement on photochemical ozone formation and global warming, which benefited from efficient incineration with energy recover. LCA methodology and a model like EASEWASTE were thus proven suitable for evaluating the environmental consequences and supporting the strategic decision making on municipal solid waste system.

SO RESOURCES-BASEL
AB There are many problems with the waste management systems (WMSs) in developing countries. In order to provide applicable strategies for improving the WMSs in these countries, there is a need to identify the barriers and challenges at the community level. Our aim in the present study was to explain the challenges and barriers in front of the citizen's participation in the Source Separation of Waste (SSW) program in Tabriz, Iran. In this qualitative research, 13 citizens were invited to participate and were then interviewed. Data were analyzed with the content analysis approach. MAXQDA(10) was applied to facilitate the organization of data. Four core categories of the barriers to sourcing the separation of household waste were identified: (a) problems in the collecting system of waste; (b) a lack of responsibility among citizens; (c) insufficient awareness among citizens, and (d) the expectation of receiving incentives. The findings of the study indicated the potential infrastructure barriers that may hinder in-process household solid waste separation attempts. Recycling investors, environmental health policymakers, and stakeholders should take into account these barriers while designing, implementing, and/or reorienting the Source Separation of Waste (SSW) programs.

TI Support for designing waste sorting systems: A mini review
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB This article presents a mini review of research aimed at understanding material recovery from municipal solid waste. It focuses on two areas, waste sorting behaviour and collection systems, so that research on the link between these areas could be identified and evaluated. The main results presented and the methods used in the articles are categorised and appraised. The mini review reveals that most of the work that offered design guidelines for waste management systems was based on optimising technical aspects only. In contrast, most of the work that focused on user involvement did not consider developing the technical aspects of the system, but was limited to studies of user behaviour. The only clear consensus among the articles that link user involvement with the technical system is that convenient waste collection infrastructure is crucial for supporting source separation. This mini review reveals that even though the connection between sorting behaviour and technical infrastructure has been explored and described in some articles, there is still a gap when using this knowledge to design waste sorting systems. Future research in this field would benefit from being multidisciplinary and from using complementary methods, so that holistic solutions for material recirculation can be identified. It would be beneficial to actively involve users when developing sorting infrastructures, to be sure to provide a waste management system that will be properly used by them.

AB Directive 1994/62 concerning packaging and packaging waste and Directive 1999/31 related to waste disposal will substantially modify the management and treatment of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) in Europe. In this study, a life cycle analysis has been carried out of the different possibilities of managing Municipal Solid Waste in Asturias. The "Integrated Waste Management" (IWM-1) model was employed, analysing the different alternatives for collection and treatment of MSW This model predicts overall environmental burdens of MSW management systems and includes a parallel economical model. The sources of costs in the different systems of collection and treatment of MSW were considered in the economical analysis, as well as the Sources of resource gathering that may be obtained via the sale of recovered materials. What emerges from this Study is the soundness of management strategies based on biological treatment technologies in comparison with thermal treatments, together with the need to increase the level of collection at source.

This article highlights strategic partnerships as a way to affect a distributed agency among several sets of stakeholders to break so-called path dependencies, which occur when such unsustainable pathways arise, stabilize and become self-reinforcing over time. Experiences from a North-South collaborative effort provide some lessons in such partnership building: In Uganda and Denmark, respectively, the World Wildlife Fund and the network organization access2innovation have mobilized stakeholders around improving the municipal solid waste management system in Kasese District. Through a municipal solid waste management system characterization and mapping exercise, some emergent lessons and guiding principles in partnership building point to both pitfalls and opportunities for designing sustainable pathways. First, socio-technical lock-in effects in the municipal solid waste management system can stand in the way of partnerships based on introducing biogas or incineration technologies. However, opportunities in the municipal solid waste management system can exist within other areas, and synergies can be sought with interlinking systems, such as those represented with sanitation.

TI Life cycle assessment of capital goods in waste management systems
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The environmental importance of capital goods (trucks, buildings, equipment, etc.) was quantified by LCA modelling 1 tonne of waste treated in five different waste management scenarios. The scenarios involved a 240 L collection bin, a 16 m(3) collection truck, a composting plant, an anaerobic digestion plant, an incinerator and a landfill site. The contribution of capital goods to the overall environmental aspects of managing the waste was significant but varied greatly depending on the technology and the impact category: Global Warming: 1-17%, Stratospheric Ozone Depletion: 2-90%, Ionising Radiation, Human Health: 2-91%, Photochemical Ozone Formation: 2-56%, Freshwater Eutrophication: 0.05-99%, Marine Eutrophication: 0.03-8%, Terrestrial Acidification: 2-13%, Terrestrial Eutrophication: 1-8%, Particulate Matter: 11-26%, Human Toxicity, Cancer Effect: 10-92%, Human Toxicity, non-Cancer Effect: 1-71%, Freshwater Ecotoxicity: 3-58%. Depletion of Abiotic Resources - Fossil: 1-31% and Depletion of Abiotic Resources - Elements (Reserve base): 74-99%. The single most important contribution by capital goods was made by the high use of steel. Environmental impacts from capital goods are more significant for treatment facilities than for the collection and transportation of waste and for the landfilling of waste. It is concluded that the environmental impacts of capital goods should always be included in the LCA modelling of waste management, unless the only impact category considered is Global Warming.

TI Future Perspectives for Bio-Energy Production in the Province of Turin
SO WASTE AND BIOMASS VALORIZATION
AB The present work investigates waste management in the Province of Turin and discusses different policy instruments, taking into account the potential of biogas obtained from Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), separated source collection, livestock effluents and energy crops. MSW from a large Turin landfill can produce 98.8 kWh(e)/t and the energy yearly produced correspond to 3.85% of the domestic requirements for the whole province. As far as the separated source collection is concerned, a substantial decrease in the production of biogas in land-fills has been observed. The organic fraction instead could be sent to anaeroblic digestion plants to produce energy. Finally, waste from livestock and agricultural products could make a significant contribution to energy recovery (even more than 5% of the domestic requirements).

TI Rethinking sustainability: a review of Liberia's municipal solid waste
   management systems, status, and challenges
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB The appalling state of Liberia's municipal solid waste management system (MSWM) is the motivation for this review and analysis. Solid waste management protocols and system dynamic modeling support policy development as it uses waste prevention to explain the complex waste management systems and suggests methods for effective management. However, creating an effective waste system goes beyond the formulation of policies and legislation; it involves financial and technological proficiency, skilled human capacity, technical, social, resource recycling, educational awareness programs, and active public participation. Because of urbanization, Liberia's municipal solid waste (MSW) problems have become heightened, thereby impacting the economic, social, and political fabric of society by overburdening infrastructure and social facilities. The impact of urbanization must be addressed because urbanization, amongst several factors, including unsustainable management of MSW, degrades the environment and presents risks to public health. The purpose of this review was to highlight the current waste management activities in Liberia and provide information to the readers about the challenges facing the waste management sector and the challenges impeding the development of a sustainable waste management system. In Liberia, waste management activities are getting worse daily due to shortage of a comprehensive waste management framework, the absence of guidelines regarding the responsibilities of waste generators, and the decision-makers' lack of intent to design and implement a sustainable and integrated management system. Recommendations for collaborative efforts are made by focusing on delivering a waste strategy which concentrates on waste minimization, recycling, resource recovery, and promoting sustainable waste management practices for communities, small businesses, corporations, and government institutions in Liberia and other developing countries.

AB The increase in population, the rapid economic growth and the rise in community living standards accelerate municipal solid waste (MSW) generation in developing cities. This problem is especially serious in Hefei, Anhui, China. The daily amount of MSW generated in Hefei was about 0.32 kg per person in 2010. According to the current population growth trend, the solid waste quantity generated will continue to increase with the city's development. The aim of this paper is to review the current status and identify the problems and challenges related to municipal solid waste management (MSWM) in Hefei. Firstly, some of the important aspects of waste management, such as the current status of waste generation, collection and disposal in Hefei, were illustrated. Also, the current situation was evaluated, and its problems were identified. Secondly, the legal framework and system of MSWM were discussed and finally, future challenges and recommendations were discussed.

TI Life cycle assessment of the present and proposed food waste management
   technologies from environmental and economic impact perspectives
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Proper food waste management has been a growing concern for densely populated urban cities, like Singapore. The current practice of incineration is questionable in terms of environmental and economic sustainability. In order to alleviate the environmental impacts and improve resource recovery, alternative solutions for food waste management i.e. food waste-to-energy biodiesel and anaerobic digestion have been proposed through life cycle assessment. The functional unit of the study was set to be 1 tonne of food waste. The system boundary included the collection, processing, waste conversion and disposal of food waste with three product outputs, electrical energy, hydrochar, and glycerol. Process data were obtained from lab-scale experiments, literature, and SimaPro 7.3 libraries. The impact categories were assessed in terms of acidification potential, eutrophication potential, global warming potential for 100 years, and cumulative energy demand using the CML 2 baseline 2000 version 2.05 method and the CED version 1.08 method. A cost-benefit analysis was also performed for the studied scenarios. The life cycle assessment results show that food waste-to-energy biodiesel system is favoured for food waste with oil content > 5% and anaerobic digestion for those with oil content <= 5%. The cost-benefit analysis results show that anaerobic digestion is the best choice if applicable in the local environment. Otherwise, food waste-to-energy biodiesel is the preferred choice over incineration. In conclusion, this study presents the advantages of anaerobic digestion and food waste-to-energy biodiesel system in comparison with incineration of food waste. The results from this study suggest a need for adaptive strategy based on the food waste type and composition, and provide decision makers in Singapore with insights into the three food waste management strategies and directions to improve the existing system.

TI Flow analysis of metals in a municipal solid waste management system
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB This study aimed to identify the metal flow in a municipal solid waste (MSW) management system. Outputs of a resource recovery facility, refuse derived fuel (RDF) production facility, carbonization facility, plastics liquefaction facility, composting facility, and biogasification facility were analyzed for metal content and leaching concentration. In terms of metal content, bulky and incombustible waste had the highest values. Char from a carbonization facility, which treats household waste, had a higher metal content than MSW incinerator bottom ash. A leaching test revealed that Cd and Pb in char and Pb in RDF production residue exceeded the Japanese regulatory criteria for landfilling, so special attention should be paid to final disposal of these substances. By multiplying metal content and the generation rate of outputs, the metal content of input waste to each facility was estimated. For most metals except Cr, the total contribution ratio of paper/textile/plastics, bulky waste, and incombustible waste was over 80%. Approximately 30% of Cr originated from plastic packaging. Finally, several MSW management scenarios showed that most metals are transferred to landfills and the leaching potential of metals to the environment is quite small. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

TI ENGINEERING GEOLOGICAL TYPIFICATION OF TERRITORIES FOR ALLOCATION OF
   MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT FACILITIES
SO PERIODICO TCHE QUIMICA
AB The management of municipal solid waste (MSW) appears to be one of the major ecological problems at present. Selecting sites for the disposal of municipal solid wastes or waste utilization facilities is one of the most contentious aspects of waste management. The present study aimed to develop the methodology to assess the natural protection of the geological environment from contamination upon the implementation of large ecological projects due to the allocation of MSW utilization facilities. The case of the Central Federal District of Russia (CFD) is taken as an example. The suitability of territories for municipal solid waste disposal is assessed according to the presence of weakly permeable deposits in the geological cross-section and their occurrence mode. A "map of engineering geological zoning CFD by the conditions of allocation MSW disposal sites and utilization facilities" has been compiled to a scale 1:2500000. The map gives a general indication of the suitability of the planned sites for waste disposal within the regarded region and showed that, for the bulk of territory, the allocation of MSW disposal and management facilities requires undertaking additional measures for the geoenvironmental protection from contamination.

TI Anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge pretreated by high pressure
   homogenization using expanded granular sludge blanket reactor:
   Feasibility, operation optimization and microbial community
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB Biogas production via anaerobic digestion from sewage sludge have been investigated in different reactors. However, the efficient conversion of sewage sludge into biogas via continuous operational reactor with short retention time, have been overlooked. Considering the liquid-like property of sewage sludge pretreated by high pressure homogenization (HPH), in this study, the biogas production from HPH-pretreated sewage sludge was investigated in an expanded granular sludge blanket (EGSB) reactor for 219 d. Under optimized hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 6 d, upflow velocity of 4 m/h and organic loading rate (OLR) of 1.66 kg total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD)/(m(3).d), the raw sludge was digested with a biogas production, methane content in biogas, TCOD and volatile solid (VS) removal of 215 mL/(gTCOD).d, 52 %, 43 % and 35 %, respectively. After sludge HPH pretreatment, the HRT was shortened to 5 d due to the sludge disintegration of 24 % and enhanced growth of acetolastic Methanosaeta and hydrogenotrophic Methanolinea, subsequently, the biogas production, methane content in biogas, TCOD and VS removal increased to 240 mL/(gTCOD).d, 57 %, and 58 % and 43 %, respectively. Abundance of dominant bacterial phylum Chloroflexi and archaeal genera Methanosaeta significantly increased for the improvement of organic biodegradation and methane production, respectively, reflecting the successful EGSB operation. Due to the good performances of EGSB reactor for the anaerobic digestion of HPH-pretreated sewage sludge, the combined HPH-pretreatment and EGSB reactor is promising to be applied in sustainable wastewater treatment plants.

TI Regionalization of municipal solid waste management in Japan: Balancing
   the proximity principle with economic efficiency
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The proximity principle-disposing of waste close to its origin-has been a central value in municipal solid waste (MSW) management in Japan for the last 30 years and its widespread adoption has helped resolve numerous "Not in My Backyard" issues related to MSW management. However, MSW management costs have soared, in large part because of aggressive recycling efforts and because most MSW is incinerated in a country that has scarce landfill capacity. In addition, smaller, less sophisticated incinerators have been closed because of high dioxin emissions. Rising costs combined with the closure of smaller incinerators have shifted MSW management policy toward regionalization, which is the sharing of waste management facilities across municipalities. Despite the increased use of regionalized MSW facilities, the proximity principle remains the central value in Japanese MSW management. Municipal solid waste management has become increasingly regionalized in the United States, too, but different driving forces are at work in these two countries. The transition to regionalized MSW management in Japan results from strong governmental control at all levels, with the central government providing funds and policy direction and prefectures and municipalities being the primary implementing authorities. By contrast, market forces are a much stronger force with US MSW management, where local governments-with state government oversight-have primary responsibility for MSW management. We describe recent changes in Japan's MSW programs. We examine the connections between MSW facility regionalization, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the proximity principle, coordination among local governments, central government control, and financing mechanisms.

TI Does anaerobic digestion improve environmental and economic benefits of
   sludge incineration in China? Insight from life-cycle perspective
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB This study comprehensively compares the anaerobic digestion followed by incineration (ADI), and incineration without digestion (INC) routes based on energy balance, material flows, environmental impacts, emergy analysis (EA), and investment and operational (I&O) from life-cycle perspective. Traditional anaerobic digestion (AD) exhibits low AD efficiency and volatile solid (VS) content, and INC outperforms ADI in terms of environmental impacts and economic performance, whereas the ADI shows greater sustainability potential. With high total solids (TS), the AD energy consumption decreases significantly, and the energy gap between ADI and INC routes is expected to be eliminated at TS content of 7%. Furthermore, the higher AD efficiency tends to produce more biogas and decreases energy consumption and operational costs of thermal drying. According to the I&O and EA results, sludge with higher VS, that is, above 60%, exhibits better ecological and economic benefits, even though 65% extra capital investment is required for biogas equipment.

TI Sustainability analysis of landfilling and composting-landfilling for
   municipal solid waste management in the north of Iran
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB This study evaluates the energy use, exergy demand and the main hot spots of two municipal solid waste (MSW) management scenarios including landfilling (100% landfilling) and composting-landfilling (48% composting, 50.5% landfilling, 1.5% recycling), available in Rasht, Iran. The functional unit was defined as 100 t MSW. The system boundaries encompassed activities ranging from MSW collection in the city up to MSW burial in the landfill and delivery of compost and recyclable materials to the market. For quantifying the environmental impacts, 11 impact categories were analyzed using life cycle assessment methodology, and the outcomes of characterization and normalization of impact categories were interpreted. The results showed that total energy consumption for composting-landfilling was greater than that of landfilling (22.5 vs. 17.5 GI/100tMSW). Composting-landfilling scenario showed avoided environmental emissions in the forms of abiotic depletion, terrestrial ecotoxicity and freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity associated with the production of compost; moreover, global warming potential, human toxicity, marine aquatic ecotoxicity, photochemical oxidation and acidification of landfilling scenario were found to be higher than those of composting-landfilling scenario by 495%, 239%, 49%, 679% and 669%, respectively.' On the other hand, compostingLlandfilling scenario had higher fossil fuels abiotic depletion, ozone layer depletion and eutrophication potential. Transportation accounted for the highest contribution to overall environmental emissions in both of the investigated scenarios, demonstrating the importance of decreasing environmental burdens during this step. Overall, compared to landfilling scenario, the lower environmental burdens associated with composting-landfilling scenario make it more environmentally attractive. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI An analysis of influencing factors on municipal solid waste
   source-separated collection behavior in Guilin, China by Using the
   Theory of Planned Behavior
SO SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) separation at the source is a key determinant in the success of the whole MSW management process in industrializing countries, especially in China. Implementing MSW source-separated collection heavily depends on the participation of householders, which motivates a thorough understanding of major influencing factors. In this paper, an extended Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) model was exploited to analyze how householders' attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and situational factors affected their overall behavior. The approach was applied to a case study in Guilin, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, which is representative of wide areas located in-land with a GDP around the national average. After obtaining 848 valid questionnaire responses in the city, a path analysis was executed. The findings suggest that individuals' attitude and situational factors are major predictors of their behavioral intention, while perceived behavioral control and intention play an important role in predicting MSW source-separated collection behavior. The implications of these findings on designing communication campaigns and improving waste management programs were also discussed.

TI Per capita municipal solid waste generation and its relationship with
   socioeconomic and demographic factors in Goias State, Brazil
SO REVISTA TECNOLOGIA E SOCIEDADE
AB In Brazil, per capita municipal solid waste (MSW) generation has been increasing in the last years. This situation, combined with inadequate MSW management, provides a disturbing scenario in the Brazilian States. For example, in Goias State, just 16 of the 246 municipalities send their MSW to licensed landfills. To change this, Goias should prevent waste generation, as advocated by the waste hierarchy, among other measures. To do this, it is necessary to identify elements that may be associated with increased MSW production. Thus, the goal of this study is to perform a statistical analysis to identify socioeconomic and demographic factors that may be associated with the per capita MSW generation in Goias. For this analysis, descriptive analysis and linear regression with robust estimation were used. The results showed that the daily per capita MSW generation in Goias can be better justified by socioeconomic and demographic variables rather than just by socioeconomic variables. The Municipal Human Development Index for Education has shown to be a statistically significant variable to exert influence on waste production, in order to contribute to the 39% growth of daily per capita MSW generation, in the State.

TI Composting barrel for sustainable organic waste management in Bangladesh
SO WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
AB To ensure quick and uniform aerobic stabilization of biowaste through domestic composting and to prevent malodorous emissions, two modifications were made to a conventional steel barrel composter by: (1) providing 0.0125 m diameter openings throughout the sides and (2) placing a 0.0254 m diameter perforated polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe in the middle portion of the barrel. The volume of composting waste before modification of the composting barrel was 40% of the original volume and it was 70%, 4 weeks following the modifications. In addition, the nutrients in the compost were found to be in a more suitable range after modification of the composting barrel. The carbon-nitrogen ratio (C/N) of the compost was in the ideal range of 11-15 in the modified composting reactor but it was quite high (24-25) in the conventional barrel. This modified barrel composting plant proved to be an efficient, eco-friendly, cost-effective solution for the management of organic solid waste materials in developing and technologically less sophisticated countries such as Bangladesh.

TI Environmental assessment of home composting
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB In this study the environmental burdens of home composting were determined using the life cycle assessment (LCA) tool. Data used for the LCA study such as gas emissions (CH4, N2O, NH3 and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)), tools and composter characteristics were obtained from an experimental home composting process of leftovers of raw fruits and vegetables (LRFV). Stable compost with a high content of nitrogen and organic matter was obtained. Neither pathogens nor phytotoxic compounds were found in the final compost. In relation to gaseous emissions, only volatile organic compounds (0.32 kg VOC/Mg LRFV) were detected, even though ammonia, methane and nitrous oxide emissions were also measured. Regarding environmental burdens, the composter was the major contributor to the total home composting process impact for the impact categories of abiotic depletion, ozone layer depletion, and cumulative energy demand. Gaseous emissions (based on our own measurements and literature data) caused the greatest contribution to the acidification, eutrophication, global warming and photochemical oxidation potentials.

TI Two Birds with One Stone: Bioplastics and Food Waste Anaerobic
   Co-Digestion
SO ENVIRONMENTS
AB Following the BBC's Blue Planet II nature documentary series on marine ecosystems, plastic packaging has come under public fire, with consumers demanding greener alternatives. The biodegradable properties of some bioplastics have offered a potential solution to the global challenge of plastic pollution, while enabling the capture of food waste through anaerobic digestion as a circular and energy-positive waste treatment strategy. However, despite their increasing popularity, currently bioplastics are being tested in environments that do not reflect real-life waste management scenarios. Bioplastics find their most useful, meaningful and environmentally-sound application in food packaging-why is there so little interest in addressing their anaerobic co-digestion with food waste? Here, we provide a set of recommendations to ensure future studies on bioplastic end-of-life are fit for purpose. This perspective makes the link between the environmental sustainability of bioplastics and the role of food waste anaerobic digestion as we move towards an integrated food-energy-water-waste nexus. It shines light on a novel outlook in the field of bioplastic waste management while uncovering the complexity of a successful path forward. Ultimately, this research strives to ensure that the promotion of bioplastics within a circular economy framework is supported across waste collection and treatment stages.

TI Enhancement of Solubility and Biohydrogen Production from Sewage Sludge
   with Lime Mud Filtrate
SO WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
AB This work has been performed to investigate the use of lime mud filtrate (LMF) pretreatment to enhance hydrogen (H-2) evolution from sewage sludge (SS). The SS samples were pretreated with LMF (pH 8.0-11.0) at 55 degrees C for 48 h, prior to the H-2 fermentation. The maximum H-2 yield of 38.30 ml/g-VS (volatile solid) was obtained from the SS pretreated by LMF pH of 10.0, with the corresponding lag time of 3.10 h, which was well described by the modified Gompertz model. Adequate pH of LMF facilitated the solubilization of SS and the release of organic matters, providing adequate substrates for subsequent bio-H-2 evolution. The soluble chemical oxygen demand was increased from 25.0 to 91.7%, as compared with the control test without LMF soak. However, further increase in pH of LMF could decrease the concentration of available substrate, thus reducing the H-2 yield. This technique revealed sustainable waste management and energy recovery.

TI Preferential policies promote municipal solid waste (MSW) to energy in
   China: Current status and prospects
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB As the largest developing country in the world, China creates a considerable quantity of municipal solid waste (MSW), which is one of the most serious urban pollution sources. Not only can MSW to energy contribute to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by landfills, but it can also generate clean energy to offset the increasing energy requirements. MSW to energy is a novel eco-friendly renewable energy resource and has attracted the attention of both national and local governments with various preferential policies. China's MSW to energy development has the characteristics of late starting, large scale and rapid growth, so it urgently needs to present how these policies exert influence on the prosperity of MSW to energy in view of latest situations. This paper initially illustrates the current status of MSW management in China. The application of landfill gas-fired and MSW incineration power generation is then analysed in detail. Meanwhile, the present situation of clean development mechanism (CDM) projects in MSW to energy is presented. In addition, a series of preferential policies and regulations to encourage the expansion of MSW to energy, especially MSW incineration, are offered. Finally, the market potential of MSW incineration power generation is analysed and reasonable suggestions are proposed. Owing to the demand for sustainable development, MSW incineration power generation is capable of significant growth and has tremendous market potential for investors in future decades with the support of the Chinese government.

TI Environmental performance evaluation of different municipal solid waste
   management scenarios in China
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Currently, the overwhelming majority of municipal solid waste (MSW) has been treated in sanitary landfills and incineration plants in China. In future, with the popularization of separate waste collection, it is logical to treat the biodegradable components using biological treatment technologies. To determine the advantages and disadvantages of each waste management strategy, both life-cycle inventory analysis and impact assessment are applied. The advantages and disadvantages of each waste management strategy is evaluated using environmental performances of these management methods on multi-dimensions as waste reduction, stabilization, material recovery, energy recovery, and greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions. These results showed that the scenarios of raw MSW landfilling would result in minimal waste reduction (34.8%) and stabilization (87.8%) rate as well as significant amounts of GHG emissions (116.7-192.2 kg-CO(2)Eq/t). On the other hand, the incineration scenario exhibited significant superiorities on these dimensions with a 79.2% reduction rate, 100% stabilization rate, and 124.3 kg-CO(2)Eq/t GHG reduction. Moreover, 1163.1 MJ/t of electricity could be recovered from the incineration process. The unique advantage of these scenarios with separated biodegradable components, treated by biological methods was the land application of the biological treated residue. A maximum of 89.3 kg/t or 122.0 kg/t material could be recovered when composting or anaerobic digestion (AD) of the biodegradable fractions with incineration of the high calorific value components (HCVCs), followed by residue landfilling. However, when the waste-generated bio-fertilizer could not be applied by field, these waste management scenarios with classified treatment would yield less competitive benefits in each evaluation dimension.

TI Environmental Analysis of Waste-to-Energy-A Portuguese Case Study
SO ENERGIES
AB Environmental evaluation of the waste treatment processes for the area of Greater Porto (Portugal) is presented for the year 2015. The raw data for the energy recovery plant (ERP) provided by the waste management entity were modelled into nine environmental impact categories, resorting to a life cycle assessment dedicated software (GaBi) for the treatment of 1 tonne of residues. Also, a sensitivity analysis was conducted for five scenarios in order to verify the assessment quality. Results were compared to two European average situations (typical incineration plant and sanitary landfill with no waste pre-treatment), which showed that these facilities perform better or at the same level as the average European situation, mostly due to the high efficiency observed at the ERP and to the electricity production in the incineration process. A detailed analysis concluded that these helped to mitigate the environmental impacts caused by some of the processes involved in the waste-to-energy technology (landfill showing the harder impacts), by saving material resources as well as avoiding emissions to fresh water and air. The overall performance of the energy recovery plant was relevant, 1 tonne of waste saving up to 1.3 million kg of resources and materials. Regarding the environmental indicators, enhanced results were achieved especially for the global warming potential (-171 kg(CO2)-eq.), eutrophication potential (-39 x 10(-3)kg(PO4-eq.)) and terrestrial ecotoxicity potential (-59 x 10(-3) kg(DCB-eq.)) categories. This work was the first to characterize this Portuguese incineration plant according to the used methodology, supporting the necessary follow-up required by legal frameworks proposed by European Union (EU), once this facility serves a wide populational zone and therefore is representative of the current waste management tendency in the country. LCA (life cycle assessment) was confirmed as a suitable and reliable approach to evaluate the environmental impacts of the waste management scenarios, acting as a functional tool that helps decision-makers to proceed accordingly.

TI Waste reduction and waste spillovers: evidence from unit-based pricing
   of municipal solid waste in Taiwan
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND POLICY
AB This study evaluates the effects of unit-based pricing (UBP) of municipal solid waste and a mandatory recycling (MR) policy on waste reduction, recycling, illegal dumping, and garbage tourism incidents in major municipalities of Taiwan by using a quasi-experimental framework. The results suggest that the UBP policy curbed the quantity of unsorted waste and increased disposal of biodegradable waste but did not significantly increase recycling. In contrast, the MR policy effectively boosted biodegradable waste and recycling but did not necessarily decrease the amount of unsorted waste. There was a temporary increase in illegal dumping following the UBP policy. No evidence indicates that waste was shipped to nearby urban municipalities that had no UBP policy but likely to a neighbor rural municipality. The efficiency of the UBP in Taiwan is also discussed and compared with similar programs in other countries in this study.

SO FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
AB Composting of sewage sludge and organic fraction of municipal solid waste can enhance its quality and suitability for agricultural use. The aim of this work is to present the physicochemical characteristics of the compost produced from dewatered, anaerobically stabilized primary sewage sludge (DASPSS) and organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW). The final results indicate a good soil conditioning for agricultural use. The co-composting products are found to have higher concentration of total humics (9.50 %), and organic matter (38.23 %) than the sewage sludge (3.50% and 32.81 %, respectively). Also the heavy metals' concentration in the final products are observed to be in lower concentration than in the sewage sludge compost.
