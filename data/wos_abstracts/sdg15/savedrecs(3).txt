AB In the context of sustainable development, complex adaptive systems frameworks can help address the coupling of macro social, environmental and economic constraint and opportunity with individual agency. Using a simple evolutionary game approach, we fuse endogenously derived socio-economic system dynamics from human and nature dynamics (HANDY) theory with Prisoner's Dilemma spatial intra-societal economic transactions. We then create a new human and nature dynamics agent based model to explore technological progression on population dynamics, economic development, social inequality and use of resources. We investigate the impact of technology proliferation on communications ease and the resulting compression of social space on individual wealth and societal sustainability. Our initial result shows complex adaptive or evolutionary systems approaches are necessary to understand both near and potentially catastrophic, far-from-equilibrium behavior and societal outcomes across all scales of human behavior and dynamics.

AB Knowledge Management (KM) is a newly emerging management mode, which now needs to solve its sustainable development for promoting the learning and the innovation of organizational knowledge in the complex environment. Complex Adaptive System (CAS) can help to explain the complexity connotation of KM and integrate all processes of KM for making KM adapt the changeful environment. This paper explores the connotation of KM from the perspective of CAS and then proposes the suitable developing framework of KM based on CAS. It hopes to provide the way to promote the sustainable development of KM by using the theory of CAS.

TI An integrated and dynamic framework for assessing sustainable resilience
   in complex adaptive systems
SO SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE
AB Growing awareness of climate change and resulting impacts to communities have generated increasing interest in understanding relationships between vulnerability, resilience, sustainability, and adaptive capacity, and how these concepts can be combined to better assess the quality of complex adaptive systems over time. Previous work has described interactions between these concepts and the value-added should they be integrated and applied in a strategic manner, resulting in a new understanding of system quality defined as sustainable resilience. However, a framework for explicitly integrating vulnerability, resilience, and sustainability assessment to develop understanding of system sustainable resilience has yet to be proposed. This paper presents a high-level, integrated and dynamic framework for assessing sustainable resilience for complex adaptive systems. We provide a set of functional definitions, a description of each step in the proposed assessment process, and walk through an example application of the framework, including a discussion of preliminary analyses, technical methodologies employed, and suggested future advances.

SO MARINE POLICY
AB Ecosystems have been viewed both as chaotic, untamed nature, and as mechanical systems with predictable equilibrium states. A developing concept of ecosystems as "complex adaptive systems" lies between these extreme concepts, with recognizably patterned but not fully predictable behavior. Sustainability has also been redefined as humans have exploited and often depleted desirable natural resources. Fisheries management desires sustainable yield, but must rethink this concept within the ecosystem context. The most powerful union of "ecosystem" and "sustainability" acknowledges the defining characteristics of complex adaptive systems with the objective of identifying and sustaining healthy relationships within and between ecosystems, economies, and society.

AB Education in particular Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are considered pivotal in promoting and implementing the targets of the United Nations-Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs). However, frameworks, curriculums, pedagogies and governance policies best suited for promoting sustainability through HEIs are still widely debated. The present letter, therefore emphasises on imagining HEIs as Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) instead of rigid units that are capable of adaptation and evolution based on the 'feedbacks and demands' of the society to which they cater. The article attempts to define the basic attributes of CAS and how can they prove beneficial in transitioning HEIs towards sustainability by fostering governance and policy changes.

AB This chapter describes the key features of complex adaptive systems (CAS) and presents a framework for analyzing sustainability of coupled human-environment systems (CHES). The framework uses two concepts to characterize and quantify sustainability: well-being and resilience. Well-being describes the state of a CHES at a given point in time, and resilience describes the state change of the system. The framework suggests some quantitative measures for well-being in the context of climate change and variability. It also includes specific analyses that are intended to undertsand the complex processes in a CHES and to provide scientific support for policy to promote sustainable development. The chapter closes with an overview of the study of rural development in the Poyang Lake Region of China.

TI Integrated optimal allocation model for complex adaptive system of water

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB Climate change, rapid economic development and increase of the human population are considered as the major triggers of increasing challenges for water resources management. This proposed integrated optimal allocation model (IOAM) for complex adaptive system of water resources management is applied in Dongjiang River basin located in the Guangdong Province of China. The IOAM is calibrated and validated under baseline period 2010 year and future period 2011-2030 year, respectively. The simulation results indicate that the proposed model can make a trade-off between demand and supply for sustainable development of society, economy, ecology and environment and achieve adaptive management of water resources allocation. The optimal scheme derived by multi-objective evaluation is recommended for decision-makers in order to maximize the comprehensive benefits of water resources management. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Bacteria have demonstrated an amazing capacity to overcome environmental changes by collective adaptation through genetic exchanges. Using a distributed communication system and sharing individual strategies, bacteria propagate mutations as innovations that allow them to survive in different environments. In this paper we present an agent-based model which is inspired by bacterial conjugation of DNA plasmids. In our approach, agents with bounded rationality interact in a common environment guided by local rules, leading to Complex Adaptive Systems that are named 'artificial societies'. We have demonstrated that in a model based on free interactions among autonomous agents, optimal results emerge by incrementing heterogeneity levels and decentralizing communication structures, leading to a global adaptation of the system. This organic approach to model peer-to-peer dynamics in Complex Adaptive Systems is what we have named 'bacterial-based algorithms' because agents exchange strategic information in the same way that bacteria use conjugation and share genome.

TI Understanding marine ecosystem based management: A literature review
SO MARINE POLICY
AB Ecosystem based management takes into account the interconnectedness and interdependent nature of ecosystem components and emphasizes the importance of ecosystem structures and functions which provide a range of services. The concept has now been adopted by many international agreements and national governments and is in the process of being implemented. This paper seeks to review the literature and to analyze the understanding of the subject. The term is defined and its implementation in fisheries and for all marine uses is analyzed. It has been concluded that to understand marine ecosystem based management one must consider ecosystems as complex adaptive systems which can show changes at higher levels from actions and processes occurring at lower levels. Recognizing that humans are part of these complex adaptive systems is vital in that their actions along with other processes can lead to transformations in ecosystem functioning. This recognition is also important to show how society can sustainably exploit these resources and that the inclusion of all stakeholders in the management process is necessary to legitimize the process. The uses of the precautionary principle along with adaptive management are seen to be useful tools in implementing these insights into the management of natural resources. Finally, the need for reducing consumption of fish is considered. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI International environmental law as a complex adaptive system
SO INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS-POLITICS LAW AND ECONOMICS
AB Complex adaptive systems are a special kind of self-organizing system with emergent properties and adaptive capacity in response to changing external conditions. In this article, we investigate the proposition that international environmental law, as a network of treaties and institutions, exhibits some key characteristics of a complex adaptive system. This proposition is premised on the scientific understanding that the Earth system displays properties of a complex adaptive system. If so, international environmental law, as a control system, may benefit from the insights gained and from being modelled in ways more appropriately aligned with the functioning of the Earth system itself. In this exploratory review, we found evidence suggesting that international environmental law is a complex system where treaties and institutions self-organize and exhibit emergent properties. Furthermore, we contend that international environmental law as a whole is adapting to exogenous changes through an institutional process akin to natural selection in biological evolution. However, the adequacy of the direction and rate of adaptation for the purpose of safeguarding the integrity of Earth's life-support system is questioned. This paper concludes with an emphasis on the need for system-level interventions to steer the direction of self-organization while maintaining institutional diversity. This recommendation stands in contrast to the reductionist approach to institutional fragmentation and aims at embracing the existing complexity in international environmental law.

TI Organizing Theories for Disasters into a Complex Adaptive System
   Framework
SO URBAN SCIENCE
AB Increasingly urbanized populations and climate change have shifted the focus of decision makers from economic growth to the sustainability and resilience of urban infrastructure and communities, especially when communities face multiple hazards and need to recover from recurring disasters. Understanding human behavior and its interactions with built environments in disasters requires disciplinary crossover to explain its complexity, therefore we apply the lens of complex adaptive systems (CAS) to review disaster studies across disciplines. Disasters can be understood to consist of three interacting systems: (1) the physical system, consisting of geological, ecological, and human-built systems; (2) the social system, consisting of informal and formal human collective behavior; and (3) the individual actor system. Exploration of human behavior in these systems shows that CAS properties of heterogeneity, interacting subsystems, emergence, adaptation, and learning are integral, not just to cities, but to disaster studies and connecting them in the CAS framework provides us with a new lens to study disasters across disciplines. This paper explores the theories and models used in disaster studies, provides a framework to study and explain disasters, and discusses how complex adaptive systems can support theory building in disaster science for promoting more sustainable and resilient cities.

Mechanistic and evolutionary frameworks for sustainable development are discussed. Evolution and adaptation are characteristics of complex adaptive systems, and a new understanding of sustainable development can be gleaned by using the complex adaptive systems framework. This approach to sustainable development issues implicitly requires proactive involvement by the public. This paper supports that bottom-up participation needs to be nurtured. Appropriate processes to enable participation need to be designed and implemented.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT
AB This article explores the value of Ostrom's socio-ecological systems framework and Meadows's leverage point hierarchy, as structured diagnostics, to define systemic problems and avoid approaches based on linear thinking. These frameworks were applied as an ex post analysis of an irrigation scheme in Zimbabwe, drawing on the scheme's baseline condition and the intervention outcomes. Strong leverage points, particularly those driving feedback mechanisms and institutional design, interacted with other intervention points, initiating systemic change. This analysis suggests that dysfunctional schemes can be transitioned towards complex adaptive systems by using agricultural innovation platforms to identify systemic challenges and intervention points.

TI Complex adaptive systems engineering and risk reduction
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-ENGINEERING
   SUSTAINABILITY
AB Complex adaptive systems are central to many persistent problems locally and globally. In cases where the effects of a policy play out slowly and propagate through interdependencies with other systems, the broader view and understanding gained from complex adaptive system analyses allow us to recognise the causal relationships involved and solve persistent system-level issues. This is particularly true with the risks due to climate change, economic crises, energy disruptions and food insecurity. Climate change and the challenge of addressing the resulting global risks provides a common set of problems on which to build a global community of practice that utilises earth systems' engineering approaches and sustainability goals to understand and resolve problems in complex adaptive systems of systems. Structural adaptation under environmental stress, simple rules for entity interactions and condition-dependent behaviours are key attributes of complex systems. These attributes provide the means for creating models that behave the way the real system does and for the same reasons, improving understanding and designing effective solutions. This paper presents general concepts for infrastructure adaptation and examples of successful applications of an expanded engineering process for complex systems of systems.

The subject of sustainability is now of wider inclusivity as it can be applied to almost any field of study. There are different approaches to model sustainability; however the systems approach is the focus of consideration in this paper. The proposed model for sustainability incorporates the use of neural networks to develop a complex adaptive system. The complexity of the system is simplified using influence diagrams or knowledge management techniques.

AB The transition from international to global health reflects the rapid growth in the numbers and nature of stakeholders in health, as well as the constant change embodied in the process of globalisation itself. This paper argues that global health governance shares the characteristics of complex adaptive systems, with its multiple and diverse players, and their polyvalent and constantly evolving relationships, and rich and dynamic interactions. The sheer quantum of initiatives, the multiple networks through which stakeholders (re) configure their influence, the range of contexts in which development for health is played out - all compound the complexity of this system. This paper maps out the characteristics of complex adaptive systems as they apply to global health governance, linking them to developments in the past two decades, and the multiple responses to these changes. Examining global health governance through the frame of complexity theory offers insight into the current dynamics of governance, and while providing a framework for making meaning of the whole, opens up ways of accessing this complexity through local points of engagement.

TI Planning for dynamic cities: introducing a framework to understand urban
   change from a complex adaptive systems approach
SO INTERNATIONAL PLANNING STUDIES
AB Planning for dynamic cities is a perennial problem that continues to grow in importance in a rapidly changing world. This paper presents a conceptual framework to understand urban change through a complex adaptive systems approach. This framework includes a process of (1) describing the system through setting boundaries and identifying the properties of the system, (2) identifying the patterns of change across scales and (3) mapping the change over time. The framework firstly, offers a tool to urban planners to approach some of the complexities of urban change and secondly, a foundation to engage with the challenge of developing alternative sustainable development models that are able to deal with the reality of complex, dynamic and interconnected urban systems and to cope with change and uncertainty in ways that build positive resilience and support regenerative design and development.

TI Sustainability Indicators for Tourism Destinations: A Complex Adaptive
   Systems Approach Using Systemic Indicator Systems
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM
AB This article discusses the necessity for complementing linear sustainability assessment tools, which disregard the complex and dynamic nature of tourism, with complex adaptive systems (CASs) approaches. A methodological framework for the selection and evaluation of sustainability indicators for tourism destinations, the systemic indicator system (SIS), is proposed; this framework takes the interrelatedness of sociocultural, economic and environmental issues into account. The SIS methodology is tested using a case study of a holiday eco-village project near Lamington National Park in Queensland, Australia. The results show that tourism destinations need to be viewed and studied as CASs, and that sustainability indicator systems need to be applied in the context of an adaptive management approach. Special attention is given to the capability of the SIS methodology as a decision aid for resort developers and planners to improve the effectiveness of measures for pollution prevention and mitigation.

TI A resilience-based framework for evaluating adaptive co-management:
   Linking ecology, economics and society in a complex world
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB Adaptive co-management brings together collaborative and adaptive approaches in pursuit of sustainable resource use and social-ecological resilience. Enthusiasm for this management approach, however, is countered by recent critiques regarding outcomes. A lack of evidence from consistent evaluation of adaptive co-management further exacerbates this situation. This paper revisits the issue of evaluation in natural resource management and recasts it in light of complex adaptive systems thinking. An evaluative framework for adaptive co-management is developed which directs attention toward three broad components: ecosystem conditions, livelihood outcomes and process and institutional conditions. Scale-specific parameters are offered for each component to facilitate systematic learning from experience and encourage cross-site comparisons. Conclusions highlight the importance of systematically incorporating evaluation into the adaptive co-management process and recognize the challenge for resource agencies and researchers to shift from a conventional to a complex adaptive system perspective.

TI Exposing the attractors of evolving complex adaptive systems by
   utilising futures images: Milestones of the food sustainability journey
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB This study aims at exposing the potential of futures images in anticipating and informing transitions of complex adaptive systems toward sustainability. Our case concerns the food system. The inherent properties of complex adaptive systems make the exact trajectories of these systems unforeseeable. However, since the systems unfold into a common direction, we can say something about the qualities of the milestones toward which these systems navigate. Attractors configure the evolution of complex adaptive systems. Since attractors are the most stable and robust elements in these systems, they are more feasible targets for foresight than the several variants that they configure and effectuate. We have depicted attractors of sustainable local food systems by futures images: through working with an appropriate level of abstraction, by leaning on a multi-perspective approach and by breaking the linear relationship between the present and the future. In this context they were sustainability-oriented trading and delivery systems, food cultures, product development projects, food brands and transparent food systems. We also located hot spots of structural change and agency within the food system. These insights may inform transition management efforts, but they must be updated frequently, since sustainable development is a journey. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

SO SCHOOL EFFECTIVENESS AND SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT
AB There are reports about school improvement initiatives that have been successfully implemented and evaluated within relatively brief time scales. However, many initiatives do not survive over longer terms. Our purpose in this study was to identify successful strategies for achieving long-term school improvement. We interviewed 12 leaders at four educational sites. We adopted complex adaptive systems perspectives to analyse the interview transcripts, provide rich descriptions of contexts, illustrate examples of practices, and synthesise participants' accounts to highlight key areas for attention and action. Participants described purposeful programme selection with clear goals, strategic staff leadership and continuous professional education, accountable professional networks, data sharing and feedback, time and resource management, distributed multilevel leadership, and a supportive school culture. We recommend adopting a complex adaptive systems perspective to communicate and facilitate processes of change, including planning, enacting, and evaluating school improvement as a continuous long-term process rather than as an end product of any singular initiative.

TI Water sensitive communities: a systematic review with a complex adaptive
   systems perspective
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB There have been increasing calls for a paradigm shift in urban water management to a water sensitive cities (WSC) approach. Although it is well recognised that development of water sensitive communities is key to sustainable urban water transitions, there is no established definition for the "water sensitive community." This study conducts a systematic review to understand how water sensitive communities are characterised in the literature and applies a complex adaptive systems perspective to the findings. The review identifies 16 attributes that define water sensitive communities, involving elements of participation, collaboration, liveability, shared ownership and responsibility in transition processes, and resilience. We add to this by linking WSC research with complex adaptive systems theory and propose a new definition of the water sensitive community as a complex adaptive system. This presents a realistic framework in which to study the complex interactions and dynamic aspects of a water sensitive community.

AB In this paper, we propose an organizational approach within two-level complex adaptive system (CAS). The low level agents in the CAS deliberate about their environment, execute an internal monitor-analyze-decision-execute loop, interact with their neighbors and make decisions according to the deliberation policy. The higher metacognitive level provides a non-myopic, global perspective that allows for controlling and reasoning about the lower-level deliberation process. Moreover, the metacognitive level controls the global adaptation by policy injection. Experimental simulation shows that it's an efficient way to adapt to CAS emergence changes and improve CAS metacognitive capability for CAS evolution.

AB Complex Adaptive Systems are systems composed of distributed, decentralized and autonomous agents (software components, systems and people) and exhibit non-deterministic interactions between these agents. These interactions can often lead to the appearance of "emergent" behaviour or properties at the system level. These emergents can be harmful to the system or individual constituents, but are by their nature impossible to predict in advance and must therefore be detected at run-time. The characteristics of these systems mean that detecting emergence at run-time presents a significant challenge, one that cannot be met by existing methods that depend on a centralized controller with a global view of the system state.
   In this paper we present an important step towards decentralised detection of emergence in Complex Adaptive Systems. Our approach is based on observing the consequence of naturally arising feedback that occurs from the system level (macro) to the component level (micro) when emergent behaviour or properties appear in a system. This feedback results in the appearance of correlations, where none existed before, between the internal variables of individual agents and the properties that an agent detects in its local environment. In a case study of five different multi-agent systems we demonstrate that the number of agents that report these correlations increases as emergence occurs in each system. This provides the constituent agents with sufficient information to collaboratively detect when emergence has occurred at a system level without the need for a centralized, global view of the system.

AB Due to the adaption, dynamic and multi-objective characteristics of complex water resources system, it is a considerable challenge to manage water resources in an efficient, equitable and sustainable way. An integrated optimal allocation model is proposed for complex adaptive system of water resources management. The model consists of three modules: (1) an agent-based module for revealing evolution mechanism of complex adaptive system using agent-based, system dynamic and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II methods, (2) an optimal module for deriving decision set of water resources allocation using multi-objective genetic algorithm, and (3) a multi-objective evaluation module for evaluating the efficiency of the optimal module and selecting the optimal water resources allocation scheme using project pursuit method. This study has provided a theoretical framework for adaptive allocation, dynamic allocation and multi-objective optimization for a complex adaptive system of water resources management.

TI Desertification risk, economic resilience and social issues: From theory
   to practice
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF POPULATION RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Land degradation and early forms of desertification in both advanced economies and emerging countries reflect complex socio-environmental processes driven by multiple interactions between biophysical and socioeconomic forces across different spatial scales. The present study investigates desertification risk, land degradation, and socio-demographic dynamics through the lens of "resilience," adopting complex adaptive systems (CAS) thinking. The resilience of socio-environmental systems exposed to land degradation is defined as the capacity of a regional economy to respond to crises and reorganize by making changes to preserve functions, structure, and feedback, and to promote future development options. By reviewing the socioeconomic resilience of local socio-ecological systems exposed to land degradation, this study achieves a better comprehension of the multifaceted processes that lead to a higher risk of desertification and the intimate relationship with underlying population trends and demographic dynamics. A comprehensive approach based on resilience thinking was formulated to review both environmental and socio-demographic issues at the landscape scale, and provide a suitable foundation for sustainability science and regional development policies.

TI From Management to Stewardship: Viewing Forests As Complex Adaptive
   Systems in an Uncertain World
SO CONSERVATION LETTERS
AB The world's forests and forestry sector are facing unprecedented biological, political, social, and climatic challenges. The development of appropriate, novel forest management and restoration approaches that adequately consider uncertainty and adaptability are hampered by a continuing focus on production of a few goods or objectives, strong control of forest structure and composition, and most importantly the absence of a global scientific framework and long-term vision. Ecosystem-based approaches represent a step in the right direction, but are limited in their ability to deal with the rapid pace of social, climatic, and environmental changes. We argue here that viewing forest ecosystems as complex adaptive system provides a better alternative for both production- and conservation-oriented forests and forestry. We propose a set of broad principles and changes to increase the adaptive capacity of forests in the face of future uncertainties. These span from expanding the sustained-yield, single-good paradigm to developing policy incentives and interventions that promote self-organization and integrated social-ecological adaptation.

TI Transients as the Basis for Information Flow in Complex Adaptive Systems
SO ENTROPY
AB Information is the fundamental currency of naturally occurring complex adaptive systems, whether they are individual organisms or collective social insect colonies. Information appears to be more important than energy in determining the behavior of these systems. However, it is not the quantity of information but rather its salience or meaning which is significant. Salience is not, in general, associated with instantaneous events but rather with spatio-temporal transients of events. This requires a shift in theoretical focus from instantaneous states towards spatio-temporal transients as the proper object for studying information flow in naturally occurring complex adaptive systems. A primitive form of salience appears in simple complex systems models in the form of transient induced global response synchronization (TIGoRS). Sparse random samplings of spatio-temporal transients may induce stable collective responses from the system, establishing a stimulus-response relationship between the system and its environment, with the system parsing its environment into salient and non-salient stimuli. In the presence of TIGoRS, an embedded complex dynamical system becomes a primitive automaton, modeled as a Sulis machine.

TI The Dynamics of Psycho-Social-Ecological Resilience in the Urban
   Environment: A Complex Adaptive Systems Theory Perspective
SO FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE CITIES
AB As the proportion of people living in urban areas continues to grow (United Nations et al., 2019), it becomes increasingly important to understand urban resilience in the face of both chronic and acute, endogenous, and exogenous stressors. Indeed, there is a growing literature on urban resilience, which includes several recent frameworks to operationalize and assess the concept and its indicators. Inherent in this literature, though rarely explicitly, is the psychology of the people comprising urban environments. The purpose of this paper is to explore the intersection of urban resilience and psychological resilience by viewing both in the context of complex adaptive systems theory. Arising from this juncture is a more robust and dynamic understanding of resilience, a psycho-social-ecological resilience. The discussion will draw from this notion of resilience a more thorough framework for understanding the reciprocal relationships among urban dwelling people and their total environments. Areas for future research and implications for our understandings of psychological resilience, urban resilience, and sustainable cities will be highlighted.

SO HIGHER EDUCATION RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT
AB The COVID-19 pandemic has forced universities worldwide to deliver emergency remote online teaching and learning. This study analyses teaching practices at a globally ranked Australian university. These practices were adopted to develop connection with students in the absence of face-to-face learning. Complex adaptive system theory is applied, and a mixed research method adopted to examine the evolution of the remote classroom and to understand behaviour as a process of self-organisation. We find that social connection is the underlying mechanism by which the classroom evolved to meet the learning outcomes within the remote online teaching and learning environment. In response to initial transition and institutional pressures, educators attempted to replicate online their work in a face-to-face environment, creating surrogate social connectedness. Our study findings not only extend the literature on the continuing impact of the pandemic on higher education but also highlight the need for pedagogy to drive change and the importance of social connectedness.

AB Complex Adaptive Systems are known to be amongst the most resilient systems due to their ability to self-organize when faced with challenge. Such self-organization is marked by innovation and this paper simulates a mathematical model of innovation positioned to be at the heart of any complex adaptive system, regardless of scale. Innovation in general involves moving from a basis of negative to positive sources of real-time action and reaction. Sources of innovation are modeled as four distinct sets that research indicates have categorized sustainable organization at the quantum-particle level to the level of civilizations. Further, these four sources of innovation are modeled to themselves exist at four levels of possibility based on the breaking of prevailing patterns. The model of innovation simulated in this paper hence is based on a four-by-four framework of innovation and can bring about a multiple of innovation of up to 18,000x, over 10 years as compared with default system innovation of up to 15x over 10 years when prevailing patterns are allowed to persist.

SO ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF TOURISM RESEARCH
AB This paper advances understanding of the complex and adaptive nature of indigenous Fijian communities involved in tourism. It examines how tourism-related development has set the people of one Fijian village along two separate development pathways, and explores how preferential access to tourism benefits has created disparities within the community. Complex Adaptive Systems theory and Social Capital theory are used to conceptualise how over 40 years of tourism involvement has influenced development within an indigenous Fijian community. The findings argue that indigenous Fijian communities are non-homogeneous entities, which are constantly in transition, responding and adapting integratively to both internal and external changes over time. The findings show that the emergence of new behaviours and ways of life has led to the collapse of the pre-existing systems of social capital. As a response, community members retreated and regrouped, strengthening internal bonds and social capital in their smaller social units, leading to both dependency and opportunity-seeking behaviours among participants. Ultimately, the paper asserts that money alone does not lead to development, but rather tourism and access to a variety of capital do.

TI Influence of Agile Leadership on Project Success; A Moderated Mediation
   Study on Construction Firms in Nepal
SO ENGINEERING LETTERS
AB Emerging leadership is recognized as a key role in influencing project success and has always been a topic of discussion in project management research. Nevertheless, consideration of how agile leadership affects project success is limited. For this article, the model designed to inspects the direct-indirect influence of agile leadership on project success in construction firms via a self-organized team built on a degree of project complexity considering complex adaptive system theory, social control theory, and contingency theory. The research collected and evaluated sample data from 310 project managers and engineers in construction companies based in Nepal through a self-administered questionnaire. This study used hierarchical regression analysis and bootstrapping analysis for mediation and moderation effects. The empirical study outcomes suggested a direct positive effect of agile leadership and a self-organized team on project success. Self-organized teams play a partial mediating role among agile leadership and project success. And the study also showed a positive moderation in project complexity with respect to the self-organized teams and project success whereas negative moderation with respect to the agile leadership and project success.

SO ECOSYSTEMS
AB Global modeling has been used for decades to assess the possible futures of humanity and the global environment. However, these models do not always satisfactorily include the adaptive characteristics of systems. In this article, a general approach is used to simulate change and transition at a macrolevel due to adaptation at a microlevel. Tools from complex adaptive systems research are used to simulate the microlevel and consequently determine parameter values of the equation-based macrolevel model. Two case studies that applied this approach are reviewed. The first study assessed the efficacy of efforts to control malaria, whereas the second study used an integrated model to construct climate change scenarios by using various possible views an the nature of the climate system.

AB Adaptive allocation brings adaptive approaches in pursuit of sustainable social resource use and social-ecological information resilience. However, a lack of evidence from consistent evaluation of adaptive allocation exacerbates the doubt of this allocation. This paper revisits the issue of evaluation in information resource allocation and recasts it in light of complex adaptive systems thinking. An evaluative framework for adaptive allocation is developed which directs attention toward four broad components: society ecosystem conditions, information ecosystem conditions, ecological sustainability and process. Scale-specific parameters are offered for each component to facilitate systematic learning from experience and encourage comparisons. Conclusions highlight the importance of systematically incorporating evaluation into the adaptive allocation process and recognize the challenge for information resource agencies and researchers to shift from a conventional to a complex adaptive system perspective

TI US container port resilience in a complex and dynamic world
SO MARITIME POLICY & MANAGEMENT
AB The resilience of US container ports is increasingly challenged by disruptive and stressful events such as regulatory change, adverse weather, larger container ship sizes, changing patterns of trade and sea routes, and the still to be quantified effects of enlarging the capabilities and capacity of the Panama Canal. Port sustainability requires the port managers to be resilient in their practices, to maintain existing performance levels and to increase market share when opportunity presents. The primary question that this paper addresses is how US container ports might be affected by adverse events and how they undertake resilience processes when faced with complex problems and uncertain outcomes. The paper gathers insights from literature on complex adaptive systems to discuss how US container ports may adapt to changing circumstances through innovation and the emergent outputs of self-organised agents (components) of their port organisations. The paper suggests that by conceptualising ports as complex adaptive systems, port managers may be able to better understand the complexity of change and organisational dynamics and thus harness the phenomenon of self-organisation towards their strategic intent.

TI Circular economy supply network transition phases management dynamics
SO BUSINESS STRATEGY AND DEVELOPMENT
AB This paper discusses transitions towards circular economy, developing a circular economy supply network transition phases management dynamics framework. We studied seven circular supply networks in Brazil through process analysis and system dynamics modeling. Primary data were collected through 35 manager's interviews and companies' plant and their suppliers' visits. We suggest that transition phases management are pre-development, learning, expansion, leadership, stabilization and self-renew with cooperative and competitive challenges, characterized by specific circular factors over time. The simulation and transition phases models provide strategic tools to make decision on which circular factor, project team should focus applying multi-tier supply chain management and hybrid leadership to stimulate internal and integrate external stakeholders to adopt circularity, unveiling challenges and average time to achieve each phase. We also enrich circular economy supply network management theoretical background defining it in three dimensions: behavioral as supply ecosystem, structural as supply network and contextual as complex adaptive system.

AB Complex Adaptive Systems are emerging as a viable framework for developing sustainable organizations. Yet the sustainability-focused KPIs that provide insight into baseline realities and needed development efforts that would increase the likelihood of longer-term organizational sustainability, remains relatively immature at best. In this paper, we suggest a composite-KPI model to determine the likelihood of organizational sustainability based on observations of the four-fold foundation of sustainable physical, chemical, biological, and more complex behavioral systems. KPIs along each of the four dimensions of system-harmony, system-knowledge, system-energy, and system-service, pillars of sustainable physical, chemical, biological, and complex behavioral systems, leverage Closeness, Page Rank, Betweenness, and Article Rank algorithms - all Centrality measures respectively. These KPIs are leading as opposed to more common business and financial-based lagging indicators, and they were generated using Zappos-inspired datasets focused on intra-organizational activity. Values for generated graphs and histograms and their associated statistical metrics were compared to metrics generated from idealized graphs and histograms using a Watts-Strogatz model. The delta between the sets of generated metrics generates the respective KPIs. The organization size was estimated at approximately 600 teams.

TI Modeling rangelands as spatially-explicit complex adaptive systems
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Rangelands cover one third of the earth's land area, provide livelihoods for one billion persons, and most have been degraded by overgrazing of domestic livestock. Recent debate about best management practices often has centered on comparison of continuous grazing and rotational grazing. Resolution to this debate may lie in viewing rangelands as complex adaptive systems. We describe a spatially-structured, individual-based model of rangelands that embodies this perspective, and simulate forage dynamics and cattle production under semi-arid rangeland conditions typical of the southern Great Plains of the USA employing both continuous and rotational grazing. Relative "success" of simulated grazing schemes depended primarily on the evaluation metric used (e.g., rangeland ecological condition, sale weight of cattle, secondary production efficiency) and the particular manage scheme employed, and neither continuous nor rotational grazing schemes were uniformly more successful. Our results demonstrate that solution of the grazing systems debate is unlikely to be found in a single group of grazing schemes, but, rather, in adaptive management of feedbacks among system components. The present work provides an example of how modeling rangelands as complex adaptive systems can aid in the evaluation of management schemes.

TI Implementing organisational interoperability-The SUddEN approach
SO COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY
AB Dynamic markets require enterprises to collaborate in organisational networks. Current support for automotive supply networks is limited to logistic aspects, In the European project SUddEN an approach to support coordination and organisational interoperability in supply networks is researched. These networks are seen as complex adaptive systems, with their structure changing permanently and dynamically. This has impact on the flow of materials and information across the network. Coordination and interoperability are important aspects that enable the required business performance in order to survive in today's global competing business environment. The SUddEN ICT approach supports collaborative performance measurement system development. This allows network partners to adapt their individual processes to improve organisational interoperability. For this approach, an architecture has been designed and a prototype has been implemented. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A more dynamic understanding of human behaviour for the Anthropocene
SO NATURE SUSTAINABILITY
AB Human behaviour is of profound significance in shaping pathways towards sustainability. Yet, the approach to understanding human behaviour in many fields remains reliant on overly simplistic models. For a better understanding of the interface between human behaviour and sustainability, we take work in behavioural economics and cognitive psychology as a starting point, but argue for an expansion of this work by adopting a more dynamic and systemic understanding of human behaviour, that is, as part of complex adaptive systems. A complex adaptive systems approach allows us to capture behaviour as ''enculturated' and 'enearthed', co-evolving with socio-cultural and biophysical contexts. Connecting human behaviour and context through a complex adaptive systems lens is critical to inform environmental governance and management for sustainability, and ultimately to better understand the dynamics of the Anthropocene itself.

TI An integrative approach to conceptualizing sustainable resilience
SO SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE
AB Vulnerability, resilience, and sustainability are three concepts commonly used in assessing the quality of a variety of systems. While each can be applied independently when performing risk analysis, there is growing interest across multiple disciplines in understanding how these concepts can be integrated when considering complex adaptive systems, such as communities. In this paper, we identify issues related to the use of these respective concepts in assessing complex adaptive systems, and describe how these issues may produce imbalanced results and maladaptive outcomes. We identify five critical areas where alignment and integration across concepts can lead to improved system assessment. As a result, we introduce a new paradigm, sustainable resilience, in which these concepts are integrated to enable alignment of adaptation and transformation strategies with desired resilience outcomes. This work provides the foundation for the development of an integrated assessment framework to help guide informed risk-based decisionmaking for sustainable and resilient systems.

TI Emerging Issues in Decentralized Resource Governance: Environmental
   Federalism, Spillovers, and Linked Socio-Ecological Systems
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF RESOURCE ECONOMICS, VOL 12
SE Annual Review of Resource Economics
AB Spillovers among jurisdictions are ubiquitous and likely to increase with increasing population and consumption, so the centralization or decentralization of environmental governance is of pressing concern in a world of tightly linked socio-ecological systems. Spillovers play a key role in federalism analysis because they tend to reduce benefits from decentralization. Laboratory federalism, a common rationale for decentralization, has not proven successful as a model of local policy innovation. Given a national policy toward a public good, differences in preferences across jurisdictions may push national policy toward a quantity instrument rather than a tax instrument. Finally, the lack of interaction between environmental federalism analysis and studies of adaptive governance and linked complex adaptive systems leaves both literatures incomplete. The increasing urgency of global sustainability issues argues for linking insights from environmental federalism with the literature on linked socio-ecological complex adaptive systems.

TI Complex adaptive system approach for improved irrigation management: The
   case of the Gezira scheme in Sudan(dagger)
SO IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
AB Several factors contribute to poor irrigation management. A set of natural, social, environmental, institutional and technological variables can collectively result in complex and messy problems. Traditional engineering systems are not well suited for addressing coupled and interlinked types of problem. To this end, a hybrid network model is introduced to study the cumulative impact of these variables on the performance of irrigation projects. The model is based on the theory of complex adaptive systems and agent-based modelling. The Gezira scheme in Sudan is used as a case study in order to convert the vicious circle through adopting an improved and most viable irrigation management system. Six key variables are selected as dominant driving forces that influence the performance of the irrigation scheme. These are scheme governance, agricultural research, agricultural inputs and technologies, farmers, water user associations and the irrigation agency responsible for operation and maintenance. The scope of the analysis is to explore the dynamics of system enhancement under different scenarios of policy intervention. The results revealed the need for balanced and diversified investment in all entities to ensure sustainable growth. The findings emphasize the importance of having interventions with moderate growth patterns that seek to enhance cooperation and positive feedback among entities. (c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Cellular automata (CA) have been shown to be suitable for modelling and simulating complex adaptive systems. To achieve adaptation to the exterior environment, Learning Cellular Automata (LCA) have been proposed as an extension of traditional CA, which exhibit only local adaptation, in order to allow a global adaptation of the automaton to its environment. In this paper, a new variant of LCA is described. It relies on two main ideas: The first one is to enhance the learning capabilities of the cellular automaton by using new operations inspired from the Reynolds's Boids model and the second one is to foster diversity of cells' states within the cellular automaton by adopting a quantum representation of the CA cells. Through solving the Travelling Salesman Problem, we show the effectiveness of the proposed model in implementing a LCA. Therefore a better simulation of complex adaptive systems can be envisaged.

SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB We review and contrast three frameworks for analyzing human-land interactions in the Holocene: the traditional concept of favored and disfavored landscapes, the new concept of ResourceCultures from researchers at University of Tubingen, and complex adaptive systems, which is a well-established contemporary approach in interdisciplinary research. Following a theoretical integration of fundamental concepts, we analyze three paired case studies involving modern agriculture in Germany and Belize, prehistorical changes in land use in southwest Germany, and aquaculture on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of North America. We conclude that ResourceCultures and complex adaptive systems provide different but complementary strengths, but that both move beyond the favor-disfavor concept for providing a holistic, system-level approach to understanding human-land interactions. The three frameworks for understanding human responses to contemporary cultural and biophysical challenges are relevant to new thinking related to sustainability, resilience, and long-term environmental planning in the Anthropocene.

TI Examining Complex Problem Solving in Communities Through the Lens of
   Kirton'S Adaption-Innovation Theory
SO JOURNAL OF LEADERSHIP STUDIES
AB The current philosophical paper brings the concepts of community, complex adaptive systems, wicked problems, and Kirton's (2011) adaption-innovation (A-I) theory together as a model to encourage practitioners to recognize the importance of cognitive diversity for sustainable and impactful solutions. Leadership and change practitioners often face the complexity of addressing community based wicked problems. A-I theory offers an additional perspective to help teams foster structural changes in these complex adaptive systems.

TI Sustain(able) urban (eco)systems: Stakeholder-related success factors in
   urban innovation projects
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB Urban areas are centers of financial and industrial activities and social life. Therefore, they are high consumers of resources and energy. Consequently, the relevance of sustainable urban transformation as a mean to counter climate change is increasing. However, because cities are complex and adaptive (eco)systems characterized by constant change, established innovation management approaches are not necessarily compatible with them. Therefore, this study aims to shed light on the underlying mechanisms, innovation barriers, and drivers of urban innovation development in urban ecosystems. It adopts the complex adaptive system perspective that allows an exploratory analysis of intricate stakeholder interactions, being a means to achieve urban transformation. Based on a qualitative content analysis of data obtained through 20 semi-structured interviews, the author shows that urban innovation implementation relies on the interaction between stakeholders in the urban district and from the near and distant urban environment. However, individual, organizational, and ecosystem innovation resistance in the urban district hinder innovation implementation, innovation drivers instead focus on the core of the urban ecosystem. In addition, based on a crisp-set qualitative comparative analysis using data from 33 German urban innovation projects, the author identifies and proffers combinations of specific innovation drivers that result in urban innovation implementation.

TI Becoming Breastfeeding Friendly Index: Development and application for
   scaling-up breastfeeding programmes globally
SO MATERNAL AND CHILD NUTRITION
AB Global efforts to further improve exclusive breastfeeding rates have not been successful, in part because effective scaling-up frameworks and roadmaps have not been developed. The Becoming Breastfeeding Friendly (BBF) toolbox includes an evidence-based index, the BBF Index (BBFI), to guide the development and tracking of large scale, well-coordinated, multisector national breastfeeding promotion programmes. This paper describes the development of the BBFI, which is grounded in the Breastfeeding Gear Model complex adaptive systems framework. The BBFI was developed by the BBF Steering Committee in collaboration with a high-level Technical Advisory Group following the Delphi consensus methodology. Key benchmarks and definitions were informed by evidence-based health, nutrition, and newborn survival initiatives identified from the academic and grey literature. The BBFI consists of 8 gears (54 benchmarks): Advocacy (4); Political Will (3); Legislation and Policies (10); Funding and Resources (4); Training and Program Delivery (17); Promotion (3); Research and Evaluation (10); and Coordination, Goals, and Monitoring (3). Scores are generated for 8 gear scores plus a total country score to gauge the scaling-up enabling environment. The BBFI provides an evidence-based index to assist countries in (a) assessing their readiness to scale up breastfeeding programmes and (b) tracking scaling-up progress.

TI Innovation Emergence: Public Policies versus Actors' Free Interaction
SO SYSTEMS
AB The main argument of this work is that innovation flourishes and emerges in a creative environment where the actors interact freely, to the extent that this environment is a complex adaptive system. Public or institutional policies, trying to induce innovation, must be careful to not stifle or interrupt the emergence of novelties in the path from creation and conception to market involvement. Our proposed model argues that innovation emerges wherever evolution, learning, mutation, and competition between individuals and firms are permitted, without restrictions or pre-defined paths to the market. We describe two cases of innovation by way of example: the first case shows how severaland sometimes anonymouselements interact and compete in a typical environment of innovation, while the second case shows how continuous policies to foment innovation may create results to the contrary. In addition, we show technology clusters as cases where the emergence of innovation can be fostered by policies that observe the complex adaptive system characteristics.

TI Incorporating complex adaptive systems theory into strategic planning:
   The Sierra Nevada Conservancy
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB Conservation organizations rely increasingly on integrated planning approaches that explicitly address social and economic goals while pursuing ecological conservation. Moreover, the spatial and temporal scale at which these organizations operate is growing. The Sierra Nevada Conservancy, established as a new state agency by California legislation in 2004 to pursue social, economic and ecological sustainability across a 25 million acre region, exemplifies this large-scale, integrated approach. Therefore, the new agency faces a complex set of policy objectives that must be pursued across a widely varying geography of social, economic and ecological conditions. Using the Conservancy's. re management program area as an example, the paper illustrates how application of an analytic framework from complex adaptive systems theory can guide the Conservancy to deploy its resources more effectively than broader-scale application of a single, agency-wide strategy relying on a more static model. Therefore, the complex adaptive systems framework offers promise in strategic planning. The paper illustrates how the model's four-stage cycle can be applied at the sub-regional and programmatic level to identify opportunities for agency intervention that address varying local conditions. This approach is likely to increase the effectiveness of programs for agencies facing similar complexities and challenges.

AB Since the 90s of last century, learning organization as a new organizational mode is highly prized by the management scholars all over the world. It is considered as a new trend and an ideal mode of the global organizational management in the knowledge economy era. In consideration of learning organizations with attributes of complex system, the theory of complex adaptive system provides a possible route on methodology for the study of its organizational change. This paper starts from the view of complex adaptive system theory, analyzes the initiative, adaptability of the learning organization and its interaction with the environment. It assumes that with the constant change of the performance parameters, functions and attributes of the organization, the entire organization mode and the structure will also change. Furthermore by constructing a complex adaptive model of learning organization, this paper elaborates the organizational change process, and extracts the information communication, organizational mood, leadership style and organizational knowledge as the impact indicators. The conclusion of this research has some significance as reference for those who try to improve the level of the adaptability of organizations in the various changing environment.

TI Politics of complexity: Conceptualizing agency, power and powering in
   the transitional dynamics of complex adaptive systems
SO RESEARCH POLICY
AB This paper seeks to bridge the gap between socio-material and complex adaptive systems approaches in conceptualizing the politics of transformation. Our contribution in particular is a further clarification of the relational nature of power, and the role of non-humans in transitional dynamics of complex adaptive systems. We explore and operationalize the role of non-humans and relationality in (1) agency and (2) power, and the implications thereof for processes of (3) powering, through which power relations shape resource distributions and associated macro-scale dynamics. We consider agency as an embedded and temporal capacity for reorientation. This also entails attributing agency to entangled networks of humans and non-humans. Such a capacitive conception of agency follows from our understanding that agents and structures consist of comparable ontological building blocks, both being (networks of) components in complex adaptive systems. Power we understand as a productive and relational phenomenon that emerges from interactions between components and that structures their agency. We argue that such a 'force-field' understanding of power enables the observation of different types of power relations. Finally, we consider six different mechanisms through which power relations can result in a (re)distribution of resources and with that, contribute to self-reproducing or transformative systemic dynamics. With this conceptualization, we hope to advance the debate on the different facets of the politics of transformation, and to help further urgently needed transitions towards a more sustainable future.

TI Toward a complex adaptive system: The case of the Zhongguancun
   entrepreneurship ecosystem
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB Viable entrepreneurship ecosystems (EEs), which provide sustainable competitive advantages to innovative regions, have become increasingly important for producing high-impact entrepreneurial firms. However, little is known about the complexity nature that viable EEs uncover under specific regional entrepreneurial contexts. By integrating the EE literature and complex adaptive system (CAS) theory, we conducted a case study on the Zhongguancun EE in China. We demonstrate six interrelated complexity properties of a viable EE: a large number of self-organized agents, nonlinear interactions, (in)sensitivity to initial conditions, adaptation to the environment, emergence of successful entrepreneurial firms, and coevolution. Moreover, the integration of these six complexity properties offers an overarching understanding of how the Zhongguancun EE maintained its viability over time. We contribute to the EE literature by developing a more nuanced complexity-based understanding of a viable EE and extend CAS theory at the ecosystem level by highlighting an EE's adaptive process to maintain its viability.

AB In the context of sustainable development, a complex adaptive systems framework can help address the coupling of macro social, environmental and economic constraints and opportunities with individual agency. Using a simple evolutionary game approach, we fuse endogenously derived socioeconomic system dynamics from human and nature dynamics (HANDY) theory with Prisoner's Dilemma, spatial intra-societal economic transactions. We explore the potential of spectral information from the social network adjacency matrices to predict synchronization dynamics and see how behavioral social spatial heterogeneity entrain with wealth, carrying capacity and population.

AB We propose a network-aware multi-agent simulation approach to understanding the interlacing connections between herder-farmer communities in open property regimes. Specifically, we model herder-farmer conflicts in agent-based terms whereby individual decision-making, pastoral mobility, and symbiotic herder-farmer relations result in the emergence of a complex adaptive system in which communal resources are managed in ways that either lead to peaceful coexistence or conflict. From a theoretical perspective, we hope to further understanding of how individual decision-making and coordination produces complex adaptive systems as well as how emergent structures shape individual action. In practice, we anticipate that this study will help shed light on how herder-farmer communities can cooperate and coordinate their activity and mobility patterns to manage common pool resources in sustainable ways that mitigate violent conflict. Broadly, our work aims to contribute new insights towards multi-agent modelling of traditional small-scale societies.

TI Whose resilience matters? Addressing issues of scale in supply chain
   resilience
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS LOGISTICS
AB Many existing studies and models of supply chain resilience conceptualize resilience from the perspective of an equilibrium-seeking focal firm or industry. The term "supply chain resilience" is often discussed as a dimension of firm resilience, as opposed to a standalone concept. In this context, resilience is defined according to how well a firm or industry can respond to a disruption while maintaining existing structures and processes and then "bounce back" to a pre-disruption equilibrium or "bounce forward" to a new, presumably better, equilibrium in the shortest amount of time with the least cost. In this paper, we argue that equilibrium-based conceptualizations of supply chain resilience can be misaligned with the notion of a supply chain as complex adaptive system (CAS) that continually adapts and transforms via autonomous actions of the different actors within the system. We offer suggestions on how practitioners and researchers can advance theory and practice by adopting a CAS or complexity-based perspective on supply chain resilience. Specifically, we address the importance of scale and the challenges associated with mismatched scales.

TI Complex Adaptive Systems Approach to Simulate the Sustainability of
   Water Resources and Urbanization
SO JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB Urban water resources should be managed to meet conflicting demands for environmental health, economic prosperity, and social equity for present and future generations. While the sustainability of water resources can depend on dynamic interactions among natural, social, and infrastructure systems, typical water resource planning and management approaches are based on methodologies that ignore feedbacks and adaptations among these systems. This research develops and demonstrates a new complex adaptive systems approach to model the dynamic interactions among population growth, land-use change, the hydrologic cycle, residential water use, and interbasin transfers. Agent-based and cellular automaton models, representing consumers and policymakers who make land-and water-use decisions, are coupled with hydrologic models. The framework is applied for an illustrative case study to simulate urbanization and the water supply system over a long-term planning horizon. Results indicate that interactions among the decentralized decisions of individual residents can significantly influence system-wide sustainability. Adaptive management policies are included to restrict the water use and land use of consumers as the availability of water decreases. These strategies are simulated and assessed based on their abilities to increase the sustainability of the water supply system under the stresses of population growth, land-use change, and drought.

TI Social-ecological systems as complex adaptive systems: organizing
   principles for advancing research methods and approaches
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB The study of social-ecological systems (SES) has been significantly shaped by insights from research on complex adaptive systems (CAS). We offer a brief overview of the conceptual integration of CAS research and its implications for the advancement of SES studies and methods. We propose a conceptual typology of six organizing principles of CAS based on a comparison of leading scholars' classifications of CAS features and properties. This typology clusters together similar underlying organizing principles of the features and attributes of CAS, and serves as a heuristic framework for identifying methods and approaches that account for the key features of SES. These principles can help identify appropriate methods and approaches for studying SES. We discuss three main implications of studying and engaging with SES as CAS. First, there needs to be a shift in focus when studying the dynamics and interactions in SES, to better capture the nature of the organizing principles that characterize SES behavior. Second, realizing that the nature of the intertwined social-ecological relations is complex has real consequences for how we choose methods and practical approaches for observing and studying SES interactions. Third, engagement with SES as CAS poses normative challenges for problem-oriented researchers and practitioners taking on real-world challenges.

TI \ Institutional Change towards a Sustainability Agenda: How far can
   theory assist?
SO TERTIARY EDUCATION AND MANAGEMENT
AB This paper offers a case study of a major university initiative to embed sustainability into practices in a number of ways, with a focus here on embedding the sustainability agenda across the curriculum. The purpose of this is to examine how far the concepts and axioms around change processes which run out of two theoretical traditions are borne out by this case. Those traditions are, first, social practice theory, an ontological perspective on the social world which has implications for how both stability and change are accomplished in organizations and beyond them. Second is an approach to the management of change specifically, a more immediately practical theory termed complex-adaptive systems theory. The paper's intent is to consider how far such theories of change offer managers lenses for seeing the issues involved, while illuminating some of the key factors that the social practice and complex-adaptive systems theory viewpoints foreground.

TI Applying complex adaptive systems and risk society theory to understand
   energy transitions
SO ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
AB Renewable energy transitions are occurring across the globe in response to climate change. Such socio-technical transitions are complex and non-linear. They require bold leadership and innovative policy, both in response to environmental risk and to navigate political, technical and socio-economic conditions. This paper integrates complex adaptive systems and risk society theory to inform a discussion on regional socio-technical transitions. South Australia is forging its own adaptive pathway, and in doing so, is leading energy transitions in Australia. Utilising the complex adaptive cycle to frame the state's renewable energy transition, the path can be seen to be evolving from a simple first modernity to a multi-dimensional second modernity. Sociotechnical transitions are partly a by-product of responses to risk. While there is no single map for navigating societal transitions, this paper proposes that risk, in the context of risk society theory, is an important guiding dimension for understanding transformational change in sociotechnical systems.

TI Investigating Ecotourism Opportunities Measurements in a Complex
   Adaptive System: A Systematic Literature Review
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Identifying and quantifying ecotourism opportunities are critical processes in sustainable tourism planning, which is challenging, since ecotourism is a Complex Adaptive System (CAS). This study investigated Ecotourism Opportunities Measurements (EOMs) in the literature and mapped the research trends to provide practical implications for research in this area. A systematic quantitative literature review began with a scientometric analysis in CiteSpace to examine the existing knowledge and the state of the art in EOMs. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol was then applied to refine the initial search results, and snowballing was used to collect additional articles. The refined set was then thematically coded and quantitatively analyzed. Our findings show that existing studies on ecotourism opportunities predominantly focus on the impacts of ecotourism on the environment, stakeholders' contributions toward ecotourism development, sustainability, and responsible behavior of local communities in ecotourism promotion. In addition, five dimensions have been identified under which ecotourism opportunities can be measured, including nature, environmental education/protection, sustainability, socio-cultural benefits, and tourist satisfaction. Existing scales or indices assess potential destinations qualitatively rather than quantitatively. In contrast, an index-based approach might help to solve the challenges of evaluating ecotourism opportunities as a CAS, as well as to quantitatively assess potential destinations to support decision-making related to ecotourism promotion.

TI A Transdisciplinary Complex Adaptive Systems (T-CAS) Approach to
   Developing a National School-Based Culture of Prevention for Health
   Improvement: the School Health Research Network (SHRN) in Wales
SO PREVENTION SCIENCE
AB The paper reflects on a transdisciplinary complex adaptive systems (T-CAS) approach to the development of a school health research network (SHRN) in Wales for a national culture of prevention for health improvement in schools. A T-CAS approach focuses on key stages and activities within a continuous network cycle to facilitate systems level change. The theory highlights the importance of establishing transdisciplinary strategic partnerships to identify and develop opportunities for system reorientation. Investment in and the linking of resources develops the capacity for key social agents to take advantage of disruption points in the re-orientated system, and engagement activities develop the network to facilitate new social interactions and opportunities for transdisciplinary activities. A focus on transdisciplinary action research to co-produce interventions, generate research evidence and inform policy and practice is shown to play an important part in developing new normative processes that act to self-regulate the emerging system. Finally, the provision of reciprocal network benefits provides critical feedback loops that stabilise the emerging adaptive system and promote the network cycle. SHRN is shown to have embedded itself in the system by securing sustainability funding from health and education, a key role in national and regional planning and recruiting every eligible school to the network. It has begun to reorient the system to one of evidence generation (56 research studies co-produced) and opportunities for data-led practice at multiple levels. Further capacity development will be required to capitalise on these. The advantages of a complex systems approach to address barriers to change and the transferability of a T-CAS network approach across settings and cultures are highlighted.

TI The Dynamics of Sustainable IS Alignment: The Case for IS Adaptivity
SO JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Our research addresses one of the most vexing issues in IS, that of how IS alignment occurs. Even more vexing, and largely unaddressed, is the issue of sustainable IS alignment. We address sustainable IS alignment as a dynamic, multi-faceted, and non-deterministic process based on the complexity theory worldview. The complexity theory worldview conceives of organizations and IS as complex adaptive systems (CAS) that co-evolve over time. Sustainable IS alignment results when an organization's complex adaptive IS adapt to remain in alignment with the constantly-changing (that is, evolving) organization's goals. Our co-evolutionary theory of IS alignment links bottom-up, emergent processes that foster adaptivity with top-down, formal organizational processes essential to established organizations. We illustrate the theory by applying it to the co-evolution and therefore adaptation of enterprise architectures and IS development projects. Our research on the role of co-evolution in sustainable IS alignment contributes to IS research in general and to prior research on IS alignment in particular, and has implications for achieving sustainable IS alignment. We believe that portraying organizations and their IS as complex adaptive systems that co-evolve provides both research and practice with a way to move forward in their endeavors to realize the potential benefits from using IS to enable businesses.

AB This paper explores the efficacy of contractual mechanisms for enhancing the formation of self-organized industrial symbiosis networks in environments characterized by diverse levels of uncertainty and turbulence. We propose a simple contract scheme designed to foster the formation of stable industrial symbiosis relationships and to guarantee that the industrial symbiosis is beneficial for all parties involved. Industrial symbiosis networks are framed as complex adaptive systems and an agent-based model is provided, to study the effect of the proposed contract on their emergence. In particular, we utilize a real case study and by means of simulation assess the benefits associated with the proposed contract in terms of emergence of stable industrial symbiosis relationships. The results show that the proposed contractual mechanism is a facilitator for establishing symbiotic relationships especially in scenarios characterized by low environmental uncertainty and high turbulence.

AB Implementing effective and sustainable health care responses to intimate partner violence (IPV) is a complex public health problem internationally. Increasingly scholars are recognizing that research methods which explore health-system responses to IPV obscure the complexity of the problem. This paper discusses the use of complexity theory for researching sustainable responses to IPV within New Zealand primary health care. We reconceptualize IPV responses as complex adaptive systems and propose a complexity-friendly methodology to explore interactions within and between the problem (IPV), intervention (IPV response), and the setting (health care).

TI Resilience in supply networks: Definition, dimensions, and levels
SO ANNUAL REVIEWS IN CONTROL
AB Oftentimes, seemingly robust systems fail, almost inexplicably, due to unforeseen events leading to disruption. Exploration and research of the mechanisms behind the failure of such systems have revealed that those capable of surviving are not robust, but resilient. This has spawned a stream of research on the resilience of different complex systems, from ecosystems, to the human body, to supply chains and communication networks. Supply networks are complex adaptive systems in which a subset of agents create flow and are required to deliver such flow to sink agents located at the other end of the network. Delivery of flow under pre-defined service conditions requires resilient design and operation protocols. In this article, a supply network formalism is introduced, and the concept and dimensions of resilience in supply networks, explored. Five core components of resilience are derived from reviewed definitions; two resilience dimensions, structure and control protocols, and two resilience levels, agent and network level, are characterized based on insights from articles in literature. Finally, emerging trends in resilience research as well as current research gaps are presented and future work directions outlined. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we apply Agent UML to modeling the supply and demand network (SDN) that is a network evolved from supply chain in the environment of E-commerce. Firstly, we analyze in depth the features of SDN as a complex adaptive system (CAS). The MAS structure of SDN system is then established. Next we make use of Agent UML to set up the static relation model and dynamic behavior model for the roles. Finally, a dynamic interaction protocol model is established and analyzed. This paper provides a visible framework of SDN that enables further actualization in a multiagent computational environment.

SO KNOWLEDGE-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BIOECONOMY: TECHNOLOGICAL AND
   ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES
SE Economic Complexity and Evolution
AB Observations of major curves for greenhouse gas emissions, energy usage, world population, obesity (and health related diseases), national deficits, etc. are showing exponential growth. This is based on current economic forces favouring upscaling, higher throughputs and homogenization of mass production processes for food, (bio-) materials, molecules, energy, but also for services like tourism. On the other hand, biology-especially ecology-and sociology demonstrate that complex, viable ecosystems require (bio- and cultural-) diversity, differentiation and dynamic equilibria between species. Concomitant patterns are sinusoidal allowing dynamics and life at the edge of order and chaos both locally and globally. Consequently, the 'bio-economy' faces a paradox. First thoughts about a conceptual approach for the bio-economy are presented that relate the economic evolving patterns with ecological dynamic equilibria. It is based on an iterative process of defining and monitoring images of a viable planet, exploiting complex adaptive systems (CAS) with continuously adapted rules and interventions. The emerging properties of the system fuel innovations. Those are all steered collectively by a Bio-economy Council such that these are disruptive in nature and cross-sector-oriented in order to re-direct the exponential curves towards sinusoidal patterns; this approach is introduced as intelligently navigated complex adaptive systems (INCAS).

TI A Theory of Transformative Agency in Linked Social-Ecological Systems
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB We reviewed the literature on leadership in linked social-ecological systems and combined it with the literature on institutional entrepreneurship in complex adaptive systems to develop a new theory of transformative agency in linked social-ecological systems. Although there is evidence of the importance of strategic agency in introducing innovation and transforming approaches to management and governance of such systems, there is no coherent theory to explain the wide diversity of strategies identified. Using Holling's adaptive cycle as a model of phases present in innovation and transformation of resilient social-ecological systems, overlaid by Dorado's model of opportunity context (opaque, hazy, transparent) in complex adaptive systems, we propose a more coherent theory of strategic agency, which links particular strategies, on the part of transformative agents, to phases of system change.

TI Community Health Systems as Complex Adaptive Systems: Ontology and
   Praxis Lessons from an Urban Health Experience with Demonstrated
   Sustainability
SO SYSTEMIC PRACTICE AND ACTION RESEARCH
AB The global health and development field, which has been reasonably dominated by linear models of planning, is witnessing increased interest in complexity, non-linear processes, and systems thinking. This welcome interest is challenged by both language and ability to discern whether complex development phenomena are discussed from the perspective of the nature of particular health systems (ontology), from the identification of more fitting intervention modalities (praxis), or from our approach to learning and evidence (epistemology). This paper is an experience-based contribution to the first two perspectives. Two Bangladeshi municipal health systems provide an example of how sustainable outcomes were achieved through complex adaptive system behaviors, during and after intervention by Concern Worldwide, Inc. (Concern). Concern provided support to the Municipal Health Departments and then assessed the sustainability of health achievements several years after its intervention. We examine complexity in municipal health systems behavior, and the nonlinearity of project effects. We identify ways in which Concern's program, beyond technical design, followed recommendations on leading complex systems towards positive sustainable outcomes. We conclude on the necessity for global community health planners and practitioners to (1) better understand the complexity of the context and issues they are facing, (2) make more reasonable assumptions about the "shock to the system'' caused by projects both when they start and when they end, and (3) learn to balance strategic designs with respect for self-organization principles.

The principal contribution of this article is to articulate the relationship between transition management and complex systems theory. A better understanding of the dynamics of complex, adaptive systems provides insight into the opportunities, limitations, and conditions under which it is possible to influence such systems. Transition management is based on key notions of complex systems theory, such as variation and selection, emergence, coevolution, and self-organization. It involves a cyclical process of phases at various scale levels: stimulating niche development at the micro level, finding new attractors at the macro level by developing a sustainability vision, creating diversity by setting out experiments, and selecting successful experiments that can be scaled up.

TI Linking Sustainable Business Models to Socio-Ecological Resilience
   Through Cross-Sector Partnerships: A Complex Adaptive Systems View
SO BUSINESS & SOCIETY
AB A flourishing literature assesses how sustainable business models create and capture value in socio-ecological systems. Nevertheless, we still know relatively little about how the organization of sustainable business models-of which cross-sector partnerships represent a core and distinctive mechanism-can support socio-ecological resilience. We address this knowledge gap by taking a complex adaptive systems (CAS) perspective. We develop a framework that identifies the key strategic, institutional, and learning elements of partnerships that sustainable business models rely on to support socio-ecological resilience. With our analytical framework, we underpin the importance of assessing sustainable business initiatives in terms of their impact on resilience at the level of socio-ecological systems, not just of organizations. Therefore, we reveal how cross-sector partnerships provide the organizational support for sustainable business models to support socio-ecological resilience. By combining the key features of CAS and the key elements of partnerships, we provide insight into the formidable task of designing cross-sector partnerships so that they support socio-ecological resilience and avoid unintended consequences.

TI The development, application, and refinement of a Regenerative
   Development Evaluation Tool and indicators
SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB Ecological indicators are foundational for holistic guidance toward thriving living systems, yet existing indicators are incomplete, fragmented, and do not fully integrate living systems principles. We suggest that thriving living systems (i.e., social-ecological or complex adaptive systems) can and should be the aim of sustainability and sustainable development. Thriving living systems, also called regenerative living systems, are those in which complexity, diversity, capacity to support all life, and the potential to change to provide future options increases. Holistic ecological and sustainability indicators and evaluation tools are needed. The emerging field of regenerative development (RD) offers theoretical and practical guidance for such indicators and tools. We integrate complex adaptive systems science, ecology, sustainability, and regenerative development to construct and pilot the first iteration of a holistic sustainable development evaluation tool-the Regenerative Development Evaluation Tool-in two river restoration projects. The tool identifies RD Principles and Core Characteristics of Regenerative Living Systems that provide general guidance for thinking and decision-making. From these general indicators, place-based quantitative and qualitative indicators are constructed through a cocreative community process. Our case studies reveal factors correlated with degrees of engagement with RD and potential place-based indicators for each project. We recommend continuing the development and expansion of the RD Evaluation Tool, adding RD indicators and strategies. We also recommend developing an RD process tool that can work explicitly across scales, integrating the neighborhood, city, landscape, and regional scales since they are pivotal for sustainability efforts and manifesting thriving living systems. Finally, we recommended integrated research and practice to test and adapt RD tools and processes.

TI Understanding pathways for scaling up health services through the lens
   of complex adaptive systems
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
AB Despite increased prominence and funding of global health initiatives, efforts to scale up health services in developing countries are falling short of the expectations of the Millennium Development Goals. Arguing that the dominant assumptions for scaling up are inadequate, we propose that interpreting change in health systems through the lens of complex adaptive systems (CAS) provides better models of pathways for scaling up.
   Based on an understanding of CAS behaviours, we describe how phenomena such as path dependence, feedback loops, scale-free networks, emergent behaviour and phase transitions can uncover relevant lessons for the design and implementation of health policy and programmes in the context of scaling up health services. The implications include paying more attention to local context, incentives and institutions, as well as anticipating certain types of unintended consequences that can undermine scaling up efforts, and developing and implementing programmes that engage key actors through transparent use of data for ongoing problem-solving and adaptation.
   We propose that future efforts to scale up should adapt and apply the models and methodologies which have been used in other fields that study CAS, yet are underused in public health. This can help policy makers, planners, implementers and researchers to explore different and innovative approaches for reaching populations in need with effective, equitable and efficient health services.
   The old assumptions have led to disappointed expectations about how to scale up health services, and offer little insight on how to scale up effective interventions in the future. The alternative perspectives offered by CAS may better reflect the complex and changing nature of health systems, and create new opportunities for understanding and scaling up health services.

TI Exploring an adaptability approach: how creative return processors
   impact firm performance
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose The authors explore complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory as an updated theoretical perspective for managing product returns that better matches the chaotic nature of recent consumer behaviors. CAS theory highlights the importance of agents who create and self-organize to help systems adapt in unpredictable environments. Design/methodology/approach This research utilizes data collected from return managers in an online survey and applies regression analyses to estimate the influence of the focal variables. Findings Empirical evidence of the firm flexibility-firm adaptability link is established, and return processor creativity positively relates to this link. The firm flexibility-firm adaptability link fully mediates the relationship between return processor creativity and returns management performance and partially mediates the relationship between return processor creativity and relationship quality. Nonmediated effects were observed for turnover and revenue size. Practical implications Managers of returns who embrace an adaptability approach become facilitators of returns by supporting processor creativity. Enhancing the autonomy of processors in their day-to-day work increases the knowledge-creation capabilities of the firm, which helps the firm move forward and adapt in an uncertain environment. Originality/value This research presents empirical evidence of the underlying mechanisms of CAS theory in the product returns context by studying processor agents and argues that CAS theory better fits the current dynamics of the product returns environment. Further, this paper extends work by Espinosa et al. (2019) and Nilsson (2019) by studying how a specific human characteristic - creativity - impacts product returns management.

AB This paper describes a methodology for creating a Complex Adaptive System ( CAS) computer model that supports assessments of Cardiovascular Diseases ( CVD) over a period of time. The Agent Based Model ( ABM) was implemented in NetLogo and allowed for the complex interdependency of the risk factors and feedback loops from the health interventions at different levels. The CVD assessments are normally based on mathematical equations, predictive risk algorithms or the World Health Organization/ International Society of Hypertension ( WHO/ ISH) predication charts. The 10 year WHO/ ISH risk score charts are particularly important because they are calibrated for low and middle income countries unlike the popular Framingham Risk Score and the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation ( SCORE). WHO/ ISH charts contain risk factors that are easier to maintain as a part of medical records of persons in low and middle income countries. The Framingham Risk Score and SCORE were developed and validated in high income countries predominantly with Caucasian populations. Steps to create the model based on WHO/ ISH prediction charts are described. The model is applicable to low and middle income countries which account for 80% of CVD related deaths globally.

TI Understanding sustainable innovation as a complex adaptive system: a
   systemic approach to the firm
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The aim of this paper is to understand how firms engage in new processes, strategies and behaviors for sustainable innovation. It results on a non-linear, recursive and self-organized process that can be studied as a complex adaptive system. Based on an integrative literature review, we find five ontological sustainable innovation components: operational, collaborative, organizational, instrumental, and holistic. Our analysis also yields three complex adaptive system phenorhena, which explain three main patterns of how components interact and interconnect: non-linearity, self-organization and emergence. The three phenomena are mutually dependent and specific to each company. Non-linearity explains the connection between the components, including positive and negative feedback loops and the rates of change, disorder, chaos and stability between them. Self-organization increases the order or regularity between the components interaction and even generates a new order and configuration with the different components behaving autonomously. Emergence involves radically new processes and component interactions due to new and radical experimentation, rule-breaking and disruptive sustainable technologies. Each phenomenon is explained in three extended examples, including three interaction mechanisms describing the dynamics of the five components. The outcomes of this research provide a new approach to theory-building in the sustainable innovation field and serve as the basis for further research on the complexity of engaging sustainable innovation in firms. This suggests new research questions regarding the role of firms in sustainable innovation and sustainable system transitions. It also calls for more interdisciplinary work on the issue due to the systemic nature of sustainable innovation at the firm level. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Water Resources Allocation Based on Complex Adaptive System Theory in
   the Inland River Irrigation District
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Water resources are the key factors affecting the sustainable development of inland river irrigation districts. The establishment of a water resources management model is helpful to realize the coordinated development of water, society, and ecology. Aiming at the contradiction of water use and ecological vulnerability, this study was based on the method of complex adaptive system (CAS) theory, and an agent-based modeling (ABM) method was adopted. Taking Huaitoutala irrigation district as the research object, a water resource management model considering ecological balance was established, with the water resources potentially tapping in the source area as an effective constraint. This study took 2016 as the datum year; the water consumption and comprehensive benefits of four water-saving irrigation scenarios in different characteristic years were simulated and optimized under the conditions of the current water supply and 10% and 15% potential water resources tapping. The results showed that the model considering the behavior and adaptability of the agent can well optimize and simulate the water use in the irrigation district. Under the application of water resources potential tapping and high-efficiency water-saving technology; the water utilization efficiency (WUE) of the irrigation area has been significantly improved. The comprehensive benefits of the irrigation district increased the proportion of ecological water, which was conducive to the sustainable development of the irrigation district and the ecological protection of inland rivers.

TI Circular economy supply network management: A complex adaptive system
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB The circular economy is gaining momentum in political and academic agendas. However, little is empirically known about circular economy supply network configurations, dynamics and coordination mechanisms. In aiming to fill this theoretical and practical gap, this study employs a multiple case study of seven circular supply networks from different industries using coding, within-and cross-case analysis. As the study's main theoretical contribution, an innovative framework is proposed, characterizing circular economy supply network manage-ment as a complex adaptive system leading to three different configurations: a closed loop supply network, an open loop supply network and a combination of both, adding new industries' supply chains and nonlinear connections and resulting in a hybrid loop supply network. This framework is composed of three key elements, management mechanisms, the internal and external environment, and emergent properties, and three sets of propositions, which relate each of these key elements to different circular economy supply network management configurations that dynamically adapt to internal and external environment changes. The framework also in-troduces two types of leverage points, one upstream and another downstream, in that agents with different roles and positions might be responsible for coordinating or initiating the postconsumption product or byproduct physical reverse flow, merging sourcing and customer strategy. Managers and policy-makers could benefit from this framework, as it could help them make decisions on how to foster circular economy implementation, even amid lacking government incentives and regulation complexity.

TI Leadership for Sustainability: An Evolution of Leadership Ability
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB This article examines the existing confusion over the multiple leadership styles related to successful implementation of corporate social responsibility/sustainability in organisations. The researchers find that the problem is the complex nature of sustainability itself. We posit that organisations are complex adaptive systems operating within wider complex adaptive systems, making the problem of interpreting just in what way an organisation is to be sustainable, an extraordinary demand on leaders. Hence, leadership for sustainability requires leaders of extraordinary abilities. These are leaders who can read and predict through complexity, think through complex problems, engage groups in dynamic adaptive organisational change and have the emotional intelligence to adaptively engage with their own emotions associated with complex problem solving. Leaders and leadership is a key interpreter of how sustainability of the organisation 'links' to the wider systems in which the organisation sits, and executing that link well requires unusual leaders and leadership systems.

TI Closing the gap between causality, prediction, emergence, and applied
   marine management
SO ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE
AB The themed article set (TS) "Science in support of a nonlinear non-equilibrium world" reflects the challenge presented by the increasing potential for complex non-linear behaviour in marine ecosystems, many of which are undergoing dramatic changes due to anthropogenic perturbations. Marine ecosystems are complex adaptive systems, yet management strategies are often guided by a linear, stable perspective that excludes non-linearities and the possibility for evolution and adaptation. Rapidly increasing amounts of observational data, the interdisciplinary development of powerful mathematical approaches from complexity theory, and the evolving complex adaptive systems approach that includes human behaviour promise to substantially advance the development of management strategies. For these reasons, the ICES Journal of Marine Science solicited contributions to a TS that would take up these issues. In this introduction, I focus on three important areas-causality, prediction, and emergence-where a "non-linear" perspective can advance our understanding and better support sustainable management of ecosystems. I briefly present the nine contributions that are included in the themed set and suggest some ways forward. We hope that these articles serve to convince managers and marine scientists of the benefits of incorporating approaches and results from research on non-linear dynamics.

AB Technology is both an enabler and disruptor for the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Yet few approaches integrate macro-outcomes with the micro and meso scale activities of human behavior. We instantiate an agent-based model to simulate technology diffusion within a micro-mesomacro scale integrated economy: allowing heterogenous agents to play technology enabled symmetric and asymmetric socio-economic transaction games through various random and preferential social network market typologies to simulate how behavioral technology adoption and societal proliferation impact macroeconomic income, growth and inequality dynamics. By fusing cross-scale theory and simulation modeling in a complex adaptive systems framework, such approaches could provide additional insights on the complex relationships between income, technology and inequality. These can also assist creating the necessary evidence and science-based policy conversations around why, if, how and when societies might achieve their SDG targets.

TI Managing complex adaptive systems - A co-evolutionary perspective on
   natural resource management
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB The overexploitation of natural resources and the increasing number of social conflicts following from their unsustainable use point to a wide gap between the objectives of sustainability and current resource management practices. One of the reasons for the difficulties to close this gap is that for evolving complex systems like natural and socioeconomic systems, sustainability cannot be a static objective. Instead sustainable development is an open evolutionary process of improving the management of social-ecological systems, through better understanding and knowledge. Therefore, natural resource management systems need to be able to deal with different temporal, spatial and social scales, nested hierarchies, irreducible uncertainty, multidimensional interactions and emergent properties. The co-evolutionary perspective outlined in this paper serves as heuristic device to map the interactions settled in the networks between the resource base, social institutions and the behaviour of individual actors. For this purpose we draw on ideas from complex adaptive systems theory, evolutionary theory and evolutionary economics. Finally, we outline a research agenda for a co-evolutionary approach for natural resource management systems. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Reconsidering disaster resilience: a nonlinear systems paradigm in
   agricultural communities in Southern Africa
SO NATURAL HAZARDS
AB Disasters continue to have a dramatic impact on lives, livelihoods and environments communities depend on. In response to these losses, the global community has developed various theories, assessment methodologies and policies aimed at reducing global losses. A contemporary outcome of these interventions is to build the disaster resilience. However, despite the disaster resilience-building endeavours espoused by policies, theories and methodologies, very little progress is being made in reducing disaster losses. This paper argues that a possible reason behind the limitations of current resilience-building policies and methodologies could be that most of these policies are based a mechanistic scientific paradigm that places an emphasis on system components that are perceived to build resilience and not the function of systems as a whole. This often leads to resilience-building initiatives that are based on a 'one-size-fits-all' approach. This paper argues for the use of a complex adaptive systems approach to building resilience. This approach argues that contextual factors within different social systems will have a nonlinear affect on disaster resilience-building efforts. Therefore, it is crucial to move away from 'one-size-fits-all' approaches to more flexible approaches to building resilience. These hypotheses are tested by means of a correlation statistical analysis of agricultural communities in Southern Africa. Results of this analysis indicate that unique resilience profiles are evident in almost all of the communities studied. This indicates that resilience is not the same for everybody, and that resilience-building endeavours should be flexible enough to be adapted for different contexts.

TI Managing organizational transformation (OT) using complex adaptive
   system (CAS) framework: future lines of inquiry
SO JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose - A slew of conventional change models and theories appear in the extant change literature. Despite being theoretically sound, these a priori structured approaches to organizational change management have questionable application given the rapidly changing business environments. Novel approaches, offering greater flexibility to fast changing external conditions, may offer superior models to organizational change and organizational transformation (OT) in particular. In this paper, the application of a complex adaptive system (CAS) framework, from complexity theory (CT), for managing OT is assessed theoretically.
   Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual paper.
   Findings - A review of the extant change literature suggests that current approaches and models for organizational change are limited in their ability to reflect OT responses to today's highly dynamic external environments. New models are required to inform and guide organizations. A new model, i.e. CAS framework, is deemed suitable to guide the OT implementation.
   Originality/value - This paper critically analyses different approaches to change management, consolidates CAS framework, reviews its applications in the field of management and presents a case for CAS's application for the management of OT.

TI Framework for Applying a Complex Adaptive System Approach to Model the
   Operation of Eco-Industrial Parks
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY
AB Models of eco-industrial parks (EIPs) might help us transform our production systems by fostering the emergence of sustainable EIPs since such models have the potential to support the decision-making processes of cooperative companies that participate and to decrease operational uncertainties. In this article, a conceptual framework for modeling the operation of EIPs is presented. The framework is underpinned by complex adaptive systems theory, industrial ecology, and an analysis of the experiences of existing EIPs. The proposed framework draws on the observed strengths of two types of industrial symbiosis modelsplanned eco-industrial parks (PEIPs) and EIPs that developed through self-organizing symbiosis (SOS)as well as their observed weaknesses and the features of complex adaptive systems. From this analysis, five key properties to be modeled are deduced: functionality, reliability, life span, theoretical knowledge, and adaptability. It is proposed that the properties of functionality and theoretical knowledge are determined by the goals of the EIP and its member companies, while the property of adaptability is determined by the understanding that the companies in an EIP have of the environment surrounding the EIP, while the properties of reliability and life span are determined by the internal and external relationships of the companies that make up an EIP.

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The environment and society are both the context for and product of human actions and interactions. Outdoor recreation is the primary interaction many people have with the environment and it is an interaction that greatly contributes to human well-being. To sustainably manage the social and ecological components of outdoor recreation, an integrative and dynamic systems perspective is needed. Analyses that link recreation management and recreational experiences to both social and ecological outcomes across multiple sales and over time are not developed. This article will outline how a number of fragmented recreation management frameworks such as the recreation experience model, beneficial outcomes, the recreation opportunity spectrum, limits of acceptable change, and constraints theory can be organized within a larger social-ecological framework. The outdoor recreation meta-framework presented here links structuration theory from the social sciences with theories of complex adaptive systems and hierarchical patch dynamics from ecology to understand the human and ecological drivers for and responses to outdoor recreation.

TI The role played by invasive species in interactions with endangered and
   threatened species in the United States: a systematic review
SO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB Invasive species are considered to be a leading cause of the decline of threatened species. However, this view has been disputed because much of the evidence base is anecdotal. This systematic review, through an extensive, repeatable search using agreed selection criteria, examined the available scientific evidence on invasive species' interactions with the 1363 endangered and threatened species protected under the United States Endangered Species Act (ESA). The review found scientific evidence available for 116 endangered or threatened species (8.5% of the ESA list). Of these, 85 species (6.2%) were reported as being negatively impacted by invasive species: 39 located on the continental US and 39 on islands, with seven marine species. The relative percentages of species impacted differed according to location: 4.3% (n = 906) on the continental US, 9.3% (n = 420) on islands. It was found that predation by invasive vertebrates on birds on islands and competition between invasive plants and endangered or threatened plants on the mainland were the main mechanisms of impact. The results of this study contrast markedly with a previous study which found that 49% of imperilled species in the United States were threatened by invasive species. Further research is essential in order to evaluate the impact of invasive species on imperilled species on the ESA list; this would help to reduce the high degree of uncertainty regarding the threat of invasive species due to the lack of empirical information.

TI Scaling up Integrated Early Childhood Development programs: lessons from
   four countries
SO CHILD CARE HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB BackgroundThere is still limited knowledge regarding the translation of early child development (ECD) knowledge into effective policies and large-scale programmes. A variety of frameworks that outline the key steps in scaling up exist, but we argue that taking a complex adaptive systems (CAS) approach assists in understanding the complex, dynamic processes that result in programmes being taken to scale.
   ObjectivesThe objective of this study is to examine the process of scaling up four major country-level ECD programmes through the application of a CAS framework.
   MethodsNine key informants with a deep knowledge of how each ECD programme was established and brought to scale were interviewed via Skype or phone by using open-ended interviews. The interviews were tape recorded and then transcribed verbatim for subsequent coding by using CAS domains. The coding and integration of the results to identify unique and common CAS scaling up features across the case studies involved an iterative process of reaching consensus.
   ResultsThe scaling up of all four programmes behaved as a CAS including as follows: (i) positive feedback loops (five themes) and negative feedback loops (two themes); (ii) scale-free networks (two themes); (iii) phase transitions (four themes); (iv) path dependence (two themes); and (v) emergent behaviour (six themes). Five additional themes were identified for sustainability, which was repeatedly mentioned as an important consideration when deciding how to scale up programmes.
   ConclusionsCAS analysis is likely to improve our understanding of how effective ECD programmes become scaled up. Prospective CAS implementation research is needed to continue advancing the knowledge in the field.

TI Strengthening health systems in low-income countries by enhancing
   organizational capacities and improving institutions
SO GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH
AB Background: This paper argues that the global health agenda tends to privilege short-term global interests at the expense of long-term capacity building within national and community health systems. The Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) movement needs to focus on developing the capacity of local organizations and the institutions that influence how such organizations interact with local and international stakeholders.
   Discussion: While institutions can enable organizations, they too often apply requirements to follow paths that can stifle learning and development. Global health actors have recognized the importance of supporting local organizations in HSS activities. However, this recognition has yet to translate adequately into actual policies to influence funding and practice. While there is not a single approach to HSS that can be uniformly applied to all contexts, several messages emerge from the experience of successful health systems presented in this paper using case studies through a complex adaptive systems lens. Two key messages deserve special attention: the need for donors and recipient organizations to work as equal partners, and the need for strong and diffuse leadership in low-income countries.
   Summary: An increasingly dynamic and interdependent post-Millennium Development Goals (post-MDG) world requires new ways of working to improve global health, underpinned by a complex adaptive systems lens and approaches that build local organizational capacity.

TI Demystifying the Struggles of Private Sector Paradigmatic Change:
   Business as an Agent in a Complex Adaptive System
SO BUSINESS & SOCIETY
AB In this article, the author applies complex systems theory (CST) to help understand why, after 14 years of management scholar advocacy for a paradigmatic shift in management behavior, the field of management has been unable to move away from a technocentric paradigm. Using four principles of complex adaptive systems (CAS), the author shows that focusing exclusively on business behavior limits our attention to symptoms rather than the broader system of interacting agents whose collective behaviors legitimize and support an economic paradigm. By drawing on complexity and critical systems theory, the author then develops a three-phased process model that provides a preliminary conceptualization of what it might take to shift the business paradigm. The success of this shift is dependent on a consequential shift at the societal level, the interaction of which speaks to the implications for business as a recipient of this broader shift and, more important, its role as an agent in the process of creating new opportunities that sustain the life-supporting environmental and social systems. Through this model, the author presents important implications for policy makers and management theory.

AB The ability to design and implement sustainable telecommunications policies is increasingly challenging as regulatory regimes transition from monopoly to competition under conditions of rapid technological change. The traditional paradigm of selecting policies to optimize some static measure of efficiency is outmoded. We draw upon complexity theory to offer a different paradigm. If the telecommunications sector and the legal/policymaking institutions are recognized as co-evolving complex adaptive systems, then we must reconsider the appropriate roles for telecommunications regulatory policy. We discuss systemic sources of policy unsustainability, and outline steps for facilitating the development of sustainable telecommunications policies. We stress the need to modify expectations of what policies can realistically achieve by shifting emphasis from static optimization under constraints to adaptability. Such a shift in focus will require policymakers to chan-e their attitudes toward policy experimentation and failure, to develop and use new research tools. and to potentially modify the policymaking processes.

TI A complex adaptive systems governance framework for regional supply
   networks
SO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Purpose This paper aims to propose an empirically grounded governance framework based on complex adaptive systems (CAS) principles to facilitate formation of well-connected regional supply chains that foster economic development, adaptability and resilience of mining regions.
   Design/methodology/approach This study is an exploratory case study of the South Australian (SA) mining industry that includes 38 semi-structured interviews with the key stakeholders and structural analysis of the regional supply network (RSN).
   Findings Findings demonstrate the applicability of the CAS framework as a structured approach to the governance of the mining industry regional supply chains. In particular, the findings exemplify the relationship between RSN governance, its structure and interconnectivity and their combined impact on the adaptability and resilience of mining regions.
   Research limitations/implications The data set analysed in the current study is static. Longitudinal data would permit a deeper insight into the evolution of the RSN structure and connectivity. The validity of the proposed framework could be further strengthened by being applied to other industrial domains and geographical contexts.
   Practical/implications The proposed framework offers a novel insight for regional policy-makers striving to create an environment that facilitates the formation of well-integrated regional supply chains in mining regions through more focussed policy and strategies.
   Originality/value The proposed framework is one of the first attempts to offer a holistic structured approach to governance of the regional supply chains based on CAS principles. With the current transformative changes in the global mining industry, policy-makers and supply chain practitioners have an urgent need to embrace CAS and network paradigms to remain competitive in the twenty-first century.

TI SELF-ORGANIZATION AS A MECHANISMFOR SOLVING LINGUISTIC VARIATION
SO CADERNOS DE ESTUDOS LINGUISTICOS
AB This paper examines the ways by which linguistic variation tends to be resolved. I assume from the beginning that language is a complex adaptive system. As such it is also a non-linear, dissipative system which interacts with its environment. Self-organization is understood here, following Camazine et al. (2001), as the emergence of a pattern at the global level of a system solely from numerous interactions among the lower-level components of the system and its core mechanism is feedback loop. The main point of this paper is that a linguistic system which has been disturbed by some kind of positive feedback will recover stability in the course of time through negative feedback under the action of periodic as well as non periodic attractors. Some cases of linguistic variation in Brazilian Portuguese are considered here to support the main claim. As a closing remark I suggest that the effect of non periodic attractors has some sort of precedence over the effect of periodic attractors. If this is really the case then we have support for the idea that any analysis of linguistic variation will have to take into consideration its ethological and ecological aspects.

TI Chile Crece Contigo: Implementation, results, and scaling-up lessons
SO CHILD CARE HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB BackgroundChile Crece Contigo (ChCC) is defined as a comprehensive, intersectoral, and multicomponent policy that aims to help all children reach their full potential for development, regardless of their socio-economic status.
   MethodsThis case study was developed on the basis of grey literature review and key informants' interviews.
   ResultsChCC behaves as a complex adaptive system that combines universal and targeted benefits for the more vulnerable starting since gestation and until the children are 4years old. Three key ministries are involved in ChCC management: health, education, and social development. Studies show adequate programme implementation and positive effects of ChCC on child development. In addition, it was found that the more families use ChCC benefits and the longer the subsystem has been operating in the commune, the greater the positive effects.
   ConclusionsStrong political support based on principles of equity and child rights combined with strong evidence and funding commitment from government has been central to emergence, scaling up, and sustainability of ChCC. Further sustainability of ChCC will rely on firmly establishing a well-trained and compensated cadre of early child development professionals and paraprofessionals as well as an improved management and evaluation decentralized system.

SE Annual Review of Environment and Resources
AB This review synthesizes diverse approaches that researchers have brought to bear on the challenge of sustainable development. We construct an integrated framework highlighting the union set of elements and relationships that those approaches have shown to be useful in explaining nature-society interactions in multiple contexts. Compelling evidence has accumulated that those interactions should be viewed as a globally interconnected, complex adaptive system in which heterogeneity, nonlinearity, and innovation play formative roles. The long-term evolution of that system cannot be predicted but can be understood and partially guided through dynamic interventions. Research has identified six capacities necessary to support such interventions in guiding development pathways toward sustainability. These are capacities to (a) measure sustainable development, (b) promote equity, (c) adapt to shocks and surprises, (d) transform the system into more sustainable development pathways, (e) link knowledge with action, and (f) devise governance arrangements that allow people to work together in exercising the other capacities.

AB With the progressing of information economy, knowledge economy and global economy, some environmental factors which were easily mastered by corporations are disintegrating, and the business environment of corporations are transforming from relatively steady statistic one to more and more complex dynamic one, the basic characters of corporations' competition are changing, a new hyper competition time is coming. The view is identified broadly that competence is the headspring of corporation's competition advantages. In 90's, the studies emphasized particularly on the rigidity aspect of corporation's competence and thereafter leaned to the flexibility competence. But studies combining the two aspects are rare. In view of this, the paper firstly brings forward a structural framework of corporation's competence system from corporation competence system structure, corporation competence system environment and corporation competence system action on the basis of Complex Adaptive System (CAS) theory. Then, the article puts forward that rigidity and flexibility compose the key dimensionalities of corporation's competence, and they are interactional and complemental to each other and indispensable for corporations to gain competitive advantages, and then the paper constructs the dimensionalities-levels system of corporation's competence. Finally, the article establishes an "efficacy sequence" model to determine the levels of corporation's competence based on the theory of system harmonization and system membership degree.

TI Resilience theory and coerced resilience in agriculture
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB There is uncertainty regarding the resilience of modern intensive agricultural systems, given that they have been developed recently in history (post-WWII). Historically, agricultural sciences have focused on scales from the molecular and plant to plot and field. Innovation in this space has led to increased efficiency in agricultural production at local scales, but it remains a challenge to scale up such knowledge to explain dynamics in soil, water, nutrients, and biodiversity at larger spatial and temporal scales, or to account for complex interactions and feedbacks. We present agricultural systems as coerced regimes, and then discuss three underutilized resil-ience concepts relevant for investigations of agricultural systems as multi-scaled complex adaptive systems (CASs): scales, uncertainty, and regime shifts. Framing agricultural systems as coerced regimes situates them according to their degree of self-organization, the impact on resilience, and the possibility of alternative regimes. Collectively, these resilience concepts offer a path forward for evaluating the resilience of modern agriculture systems and expanding agroecological principles to scales beyond that of the field or farm because they explicitly account for agricultural systems as multi-scaled complex adaptive systems. This knowledge base has immediate management implications from the farm to continental scale, as climate and land use change force challenging decisions regarding the ability of modern agriculture to persist as is, adapt, or transform in order to avoid un-desirable regime shifts.

TI Applying agent-based modeling to the evolution of eco-industrial systems
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB Agent-based modeling is simply a modeling technique for describing complex adaptive systems in a form that can be solved by computers. In this paper, agent-based modeling is applied to eco-industrial systems to gain new insights into their behavior. The factory in the eco-industrial systems is taken as an agent, and the objects, attributes and behaviors are determined. Some important interaction mechanisms between agents are also designed. Besides, the sustainability evolution is also studied through emergy theory. More importantly, a new concept, the Internal-flow emergy, is used to indicate the evolution direction of an eco-industrial system. Finally, a hypothetical eco-industrial park utilizing natural gas and halite as the main raw material inputs is adopted as a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of the agent-based modeling.

TI Contribution of systems thinking and complex adaptive system attributes
   to sustainable food production: Example from a climate-smart village
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) conceptually has the potential to contribute to the sustainable development goals of achieving zero hunger, reducing land degradation, eliminating poverty, [adding climate change, and promoting gender equality. The scaling-up needed to achieve goals of CSA represents a challenge, as it entails understanding synergies between often opposing socioeconomic and environmental priorities and trade-offs over temporal and spatial scales. In this paper, we tested new approaches to support scaling-up of sustainable food production through investigating the contribution of systems thinking as a conceptual approach and complex adaptive system (CAS) attributes as a framework for analysis of CSA. This was done through examining (i) to what extent CSA represents a CAS and (ii) what contribution systems thinking and CAS attributes can make to understanding and scaling-up sustainable food production systems through CSA. The CSA situation was conceptualized through systems thinking sessions with women farmers in the climate-smart village (CSV) of Doggoh-Jirapa, northern Ghana, and was guided by the Distinctions, Systems, Relationships and Perspectives (DSRP) framework. Systems thinking, and CAS attributes provide system-wide understanding of elements, dynamics and trade-offs over temporal and spatial scale in selected agri-food systems. As such it could aid horizontal and vertical scaling-up by informing policy developoment and selection of a context-specific portfolio of technologies and practices at landscape and farm levels to achieve synergies between goals. In this study, systems thinking enabled women farmers in the CSV to identify income-generating and tree planting activities, with desirable simultaneous system-wide impact. The paper calls for further testing of tools, approaches, and methods that enable dynamic systems thinking to inform scaling-up efforts, while embracing the transdisciplinary nature and complexity of CSA as a constituent of the food production system.

Clarifying the technical meanings and foundations of the concept of resilience would appear to be necessary. Proposals for defining resilience are flourishing as well. This paper organizes the different technical approaches to the question of what is resilience and how to engineer it in complex adaptive systems. This paper groups the different uses of the label 'resilience' around four basic concepts: (1) resilience as rebound from trauma and return to equilibrium; (2) resilience as a synonym for robustness; (3) resilience as the opposite of brittleness, i.e., as graceful extensibility when surprise challenges boundaries; (4) resilience as network architectures that can sustain the ability to adapt to future surprises as conditions evolve.

SO TOURISM MANAGEMENT
AB This paper highlights the new horizons opening with the applications of concepts from the application of the complexity science to tourism data, which are traditionally treated from an intradisciplinar point of view. From this new point of view, tourism is considered as a complex adaptive system. Complexity theory is rooted in the hard sciences, and social sciences have adopted it in recent times. Going a step further, we introduce the concept of chaordic system in tourism. This new thinking has appeared in the social sciences as a response to the current need to cope with contradictions and inconsistencies, adapting evolution without losing essence. We propose considering tourism as a chaordic system and analyzing the resulting managerial consequences. We propose the use of a set of measures to quantify a system as chaordic. Finally, we empirically analyze tourist arrivals to Majorca (Spain) to verify the existence of a chaordic system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A review of global banking regulation under an assumption of complexity
SO ANNALS OF ACTUARIAL SCIENCE
AB The global banking system can be shown to be a Complex Adaptive System that exhibits phase transitions from time to time. These phase transitions can result in significant financial losses to the community that we estimate to be much more significant than losses occurring during "business as usual" periods. In this paper, we argue that the significant losses arising from phase transitions in the banking system requires a very different approach to regulation than the current Basel regime, and that there is a need to transition the Basel regime from a Federation of Systems to a System of Systems. We demonstrate that the World Health Organisation's recent management system for pandemics is ideally suited for management of the global banking system and would have greater potential to control the phase transition losses than the current Basel system.

TI IS THE DOLLAR'S HEGEMONIC ROLE IN THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY SYSTEM
   SUSTAINABLE?
SO REVISTA DE ECONOMIA MUNDIAL
AB Since the signing of the Bretton Woods Agreements, the US dollar has formed the central axis of the International Monetary System (IMS). However, is this hegemonic situation sustainable in the medium to long term? This study seeks to answer that question using a prospective approach based on the Complex Adaptive Systems (CASs) underlying Complexity Economics. The greatest danger facing the current IMS as a CAS lies in its endogenous evolution. The modern Triffin dilemma and a tendency towards multipolarity in the economic system-as opposed to the continued unipolarity of the monetary system-make it essential to adapt the system. However, no such adaptation is currently taking place. Thus, with no need for any external shock, the very nature of the IMS leads to an eroding of confidence in the dollar in the medium/long term. In order for the IMS to adapt and reconstruct itself, co-operation between interactive agents participating in the system is essential.

AB Renewable energy has gained much-deserved prominence on the world stage of sustainable development, yet despite the surging interest there is a notable lack of understanding regarding best practices in business - stakeholder relations. Using a constructivist grounded theory approach (Charmaz, 2005) and drawing from complexity theory and social scientific theories of identity, our empirical study shows that core values and identity are strongly implicated in the formation and negotiation of stakeholder attitudes for both individuals and social groups. Specifically, we find that personal and social identity are core drivers of community attitude development in a complex adaptive system, and that conflicts between strongly held identities are galvanized along bifurcated "axes of tension" that are also strongly implicated in community attitude formation processes.

TI Unraveling the Complexity of the Jevons Paradox: The Link Between
   Innovation, Efficiency, and Sustainability
SO FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH
AB The term "Jevons Paradox" flags the need to consider the different hierarchical scales at which a system under analysis changes its identity in response to an innovation. Accordingly, an analysis of the implications of the Jevons Paradox must abandon the realm of reductionism and deal with the complexity inherent in the issue of sustainability: when studying evolution and real change how can we define "what has to be sustained" in a system that continuously becomes something else? In an attempt to address this question this paper presents three theoretical concepts foreign to conventional scientific analysis: (i) complex adaptive systems-to address the peculiar characteristics of learning and self-producing systems; (ii) holons and holarchy-to explain the implications of the ambiguity found when observing the relation between functional and structural elements across different scales (steady-state vs. evolution); and (iii) Holling's adaptive cycle-to illustrate the existence of different phases in the evolutionary trajectory of a complex adaptive system interacting with its context in which either external or internal constraints can become limiting. These concepts are used to explain systemic drivers of the Jevons Paradox. Looking at society's thermodynamic foundations, sustainability is based on a dynamic balance of two contrasting principles regulating the evolution of complex adaptive systems: the minimum entropy production and the maximum energy flux. The co-existence of these two principles explains why in different situations innovation has to play a different role in the "sustainable development" of society: (i) when society is not subject to external biophysical constraints improvements in efficiency serve to increase the final consumption of society and expand its diversity of functions and structures; (ii) when the expansion of society is limited by external constraints improvements in efficiency should be used to avoid as much as possible the loss of the existing diversity. It is concluded that sustainability cannot be achieved by technological innovations alone, but requires a continuous process of institutional and behavioral adjustment.

TI Robustness of Social-Ecological Systems: Implications for Public Policy
SO POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL
AB We conceptualize social-ecological systems (SESs) as complex adaptive systems where public policy affects and is affected by the biophysical system in which it is embedded. The study of robustness of SESs combines insights from various disciplines including economics, political science, ecology, and engineering. In this paper we present an approach that can be used to explore the implications for public policy when viewed as a component of a complex adaptive system. Our approach leverages the Institutional Analysis and Development framework to provide a platform for interdisciplinary research that focuses on system-wide outcomes of the policy process beyond just policy change. The main message is that building robustness can create new vulnerabilities. Fail-free policies cannot be developed, and instead of a focus on the "right" policy, we need to think about policy processes that stimulate experimentation, adaptation, and learning.

TI Imagining maternity care as a complex adaptive system: understanding
   health system constraints to the promotion of respectful maternity care
SO SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MATTERS
AB Evidence of the health system challenges to promoting respectful maternity care (RMC) is limited in Ethiopia and globally. This study investigated the health system constraints to RMC in three Southern Ethiopian hospitals. We conducted a qualitative study (7 focus group discussions (FGDs) with providers of RMC and 12 in-depth interviews with focal persons and managers) before and after the implementation of an RMC intervention. We positioned childbirth services within the health system and applied complex adaptive system theory to analyse the opportunities and constraints to the promotion of RMC. Both system "hardware" and "software" factors influencing the promotion of RMC were identified, and their interaction was complex. The "hardware" factors included bed availability, infrastructure and supplies, financing, and health workforce. "Software" factors encompassed service providers' mindset, staff motivation, and awareness of RMC. Interactions between these factors included privacy breaches for women when birth companions were admitted in labour rooms. Delayed reimbursement following the introduction of fee-exemption for maternity services resulted in depleted revenues, supply shortages, and ultimately disrespectful behaviour among providers. Other financial constraints, including the insufficient and delayed release of funds, also led to complex interactions with the motivation of staff and the availability of workforce and supplies, resulting in poor adherence to RMC guidance. Interventions aimed at improving only behavioural components fall short of mitigating the mistreatment of women. System-wide interventions are required to address the complex interactions that constraint RMC.

AB As a background to later contributions, this chapter provides a concise introduction to different approaches to (i) understanding and (ii) shaping transition dynamics:
   1. A sociotechnical approach, with the multilevel perspective as its main concept, and strategic niche management as its governance concept;
   2. A complex (adaptive) system-based approach, using the concept of transition patterns, with transition management as its governance concept;
   3. A governance approach, where the politics of transition dynamics are examined, with reflexive design as the core of its approach to shaping transition.
   In addition, work based on the social theory of practice has helped to bring consumption practices into transition theory, and an approach focusing on innovation system has helped to explain how different arrangements may become interconnected so as to produce a transition.

AB Today's the increasing globalization of the worldwide market and diverse technological advancements is forcing hard competition. Consequently, satisfying customers force firms to develop product and to look into all the possible areas of improvement in the product development process (PDP). The early research on PDP has produced models that view the process as a linear system with sequential and discrete stages. Over the time and with the increased complexity, PDP became hard to imagine out of Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) strategy. Hence, within the dynamic environment, managing a PDP is a challenging mission. In fact, uncertainty, variety, diversity, distributive control, interconnected entities are some of the factors that lead to the variation between expected and actual flows in PDP. Several disciplines have adopted the perspective of the Complex Adaptive System (CAS) as a viable alternative to an existing enterprise system to deal with such complexity. In this perspective, the present paper extends the linear, recursive and chaotic framework by considering PDP as a CAS. In addition, with using the complexity theory and especially an agent organizational methodology, the knowledge gained from this framework can be beneficial for PDP to move from isolated field to dynamic and holistic one.

TI Complex Adaptive Systems Framework to Assess Supply-Side and Demand-Side
   Management for Urban Water Resources
SO JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB The availability of water resources in many urbanizing areas is the emergent property of the adaptive interactions among consumers, policy, and the hydrologic cycle. As water availability becomes more stressed, public officials often implement restrictions on water use, such as bans on outdoor watering. Consumers are influenced by policy and the choices of other consumers to select water-conservation technologies and practices, which aggregate as the demand on available water resources. Policy and behavior choices affect the availability of water for future use as reservoirs are depleted or filled. This research posited urban water supply as a complex adaptive system (CAS) by coupling a stochastic consumer demand model and a water supply model within an agent-based modeling (ABM) framework. Public officials were simulated as agents to choose water conservation strategies and interbasin transfer strategies, and consumers were simulated as agents, influenced by various conservation-based programs to select water conservation technologies and behaviors, and correspondingly update their individual demand models. A water supply reservoir was simulated to receive rainfall from the contributing watershed and to supply the demands of consumer agents. The ABM framework was applied to an illustrative urban case study. A set of scenarios was developed to represent moderate and strong water conservation strategies, and was simulated for a long-term precipitation record to evaluate the sustainability of water conservation practices.

TI Designing circular supply chains in start-up companies: evidence from
   Italian fashion and construction start-ups
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT
AB PurposeThe theory of complex adaptive systems (CASs) represents an interesting perspective to study the characteristics of circular supply chains (CSCs). In this regard, the current literature lacks evidence regarding coordination and integration mechanisms, characteristics of the environment and emerging system properties of CSCs. This paper aims to fill this gap and focuses on how and why companies design (i.e. configure and coordinate) their CSCs and what value these design choices help to create across different industries.Design/methodology/approachThe authors use a multiple case study approach and analyze data collected from a sample of five sustainable start-ups operating in the fashion and construction industries in Italy to better understand how these companies design (i.e. configure and coordinate) their CSCs.FindingsResults reveal that in the two industries under investigation, the design of CSCs built around open and closed-loop logic is triggered by the intention to solve a negative sustainability impact. The sustainability impact determines whether the value is restored within the same supply chain, in another, or inside or outside the same industry. Interestingly, start-ups appear to coordinate other CSC actors with three leading roles: (1) orchestrator, (2) integrated orchestrator and (3) circular manufacturer. The coordination role of the start-ups differs in each supply chain configuration based on the level of vertical integration of manufacturing activities.Originality/valueFrom a theoretical perspective, the authors' results expand previous supply chain management (SCM) literature by presenting an empirical analysis of the configuration and coordination of CSCs, and discussing the drivers for creating such circularity from a CAS perspective. From a managerial perspective, the authors offer a practical experience to entrepreneurs on how to transform circular and sustainable business model aspirations into CSC practices.

TI Resilience, robustness, and marine ecosystem-based management
SO BIOSCIENCE
AB Marine ecosystems provide essential services to humans, yet these services have been diminished, and their future sustainability endangered, by human patterns of exploitation that threaten system robustness and resilience. Marine ecosystems arc complex adaptive systems composed of individual agents that interact with one another to produce collective effects, integrating scales from individual behaviors to the dynamics of whole systems. In such systems, small changes can be magnified through nonlinear interactions, facilitating regime shifts and collapses. Protection of the services these ecosystems provide must therefore maintain the adaptive capacities of these systems by preserving a balance among heterogeneity, modularity, and redundancy, tightening feedback loops to provide incentives for sound stewardship. The challenge for management is to increase incentives to individuals, and tighten reward loops, in ways that will strengthen the robustness and resilience of these systems and preserve their ability to provide ecosystem services for generations to come.

TI Cooperative governance: one pathway to a stable-state economy
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS
AB Exponential increases in material and energy use globally threaten Earth System stability inmany ways including through climate change. Yet societies remain committed to economic growth, reflected in the way publicly traded corporations are legally obliged to maximise shareholders' profits. In contrast, businesses governed cooperatively by members, i.e. democratically and transparently, may be better suited to operating in an ecologically sustainable way, enacting their members' ethical commitments. Combining a complex adaptive systems approach with community economies theory, we argue that cooperatives offer a significant transformative opportunity to resocialise and repoliticise economies away from the growth imperative. Cooperative governance is consistent enough with currently dominant neoliberal governance (itself closely aligned with economic growth) to gain initial policy traction. Ultimately, we seek an overall shift to a stable-state economy - a global economy whose operation sustains rather than threatens the familiar (to humans and our civilisations) stable state of the Earth System.

SO JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES
AB The recent economic shocks have severely tested the EU's political sustainability. The deep-rooted and unending succession of existential crises demonstrates the sharp misalignment between the high degree of integration reached by the EU, its authority structure, and the absence of solidarity to sustain this structure. The contribution unfolds as follows: first, we claim that the Union has become a complex adaptive system and that attempts to restore the status quo ante are unrealistic. Section II shows that its authority structure is ill-suited to steering the complex system because it lacks adequate instruments for addressing common risks and democratic externalities. Section III argues that contemporary EU leaders are failing to promote the principles of solidarity which, according to its founding father are required to disarm centrifugal tendencies. Section IV presents empirical evidence which signals the existence of considerable popular support for these pan-European forms of solidarity.

TI Circular economy business models as resilient complex adaptive systems
SO BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB Broad consensus seems to have emerged on the circular economy as a plausible and desirable solution to build prosperity while respecting ecological boundaries. However, its implementation in industry is slow paced. Whilst the systemic nature of the innovation required and barriers to implementation in complex sustainability transitions partially explain why this is the case, reflecting on the contribution of the growing scholarly literature on circular business models to orient management practice is also relevant. In fact, despite the existence of a fairly voluminous scholarly literature on the subject, practitioners are either uncertain or struggling about how to implement circular economy strategies and models. Using an integrative research approach to theory building and drawing on systems theory, this article proposes a resilient complex adaptive system view of circular business models. The resulting framework is a stepping-stone to overcoming conceptual ambiguities and construct fallacies in the way circular business models are typified.

AB This paper aims to identify the differences and similarities in the way to explain self-organization from the different theories of complex systems used in management, which we have grouped as complex systems theories, complex adaptive systems (CAS) and organizational cybernetics. For this purpose we suggest three parallel and complementary dimensions to delimit the conceptual spaces where these theories can be placed. Using this classification as an analytical lens we summarize the core arguments suggested by each of these complex systems approaches, regarding the ideas of emergence and new order. This analysis helps us to conclude that the three theories coincide in their interest for studying nonlinear complex systems, but diverge in the nature of the complex problems studied. Finally we analyze the consequences that recognizing the similarities and differences between these approaches have, when using them for the study and research of social and business organizations and their management.

TI An innovative approach for improving infrastructure resilience
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-CIVIL ENGINEERING
AB Extreme weather events, such as the UK floods of 2007 and cold snap of 2010-2011, stress the importance of infrastructure systems' resilience for business continuity. The interconnected nature of critical national infrastructure and its component parts places demands on the approach used to deal with its subsequent complexity. Recognition of infrastructure as a complex adaptive system has led to the development of an innovative, systems-based methodology for sustainability assessment in the built environment. The methodology consists of a database of causal interactions which, when combined with a process, allows users to produce causal loop diagrams that identify unanticipated systemic behaviour, communicate risks, share knowledge, and identify systemic intervention points that minimise negative consequences and add value in a project context. The approach is applied to highlight the key characteristics of complex adaptive systems that critical national infrastructure exhibits and show how the technique can be used to increase infrastructure resilience and sustainability.

TI An empirical investigation of transaction dynamics in online surplus
   networks: A complex adaptive system perspective
SO JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT
AB Online material and waste exchanges (OMWEs) provide an online platform connecting suppliers of surplus material with potential buyers. These exchanges aim to improve the environment by helping industrial organizations repurpose surplus material and avoid landfill disposal. OMWEs represent an emerging surplus-driven supply network, which exhibits different internal complexities and dynamics from traditional supply networks, with similarly distinct transactional patterns and outcomes. Drawing on complex adaptive system (CAS) theory, this study investigates how the complex network adapts to alter the likelihood of transactions between buyers and suppliers. Using data from , an OMWE operating in the US state of Minnesota, we observe that, at the node level, buyers adapt their searches for products over time to increase transaction success; at the dyadic level, buyer-supplier pairing patterns adapt over time through homophilous relations to facilitate negotiations and increase transaction success; and at the network level, the entire exchange system structurally self-organizes to increase transaction rates. Throughout, buyers' competition influences transaction success, contingent on whether the product has been on the market for a long time, and buyers with more experience more quickly identify favorable conditions (among products and suppliers) leading to higher transaction success than less experienced competitors. Overall, the results demonstrate multilevel network emergence, in which complex, adaptive, and longitudinal buyer-supplier interactions resolve uncertainty and increase transactions. These findings disentangle OMWEs' operation to allow managers and policymakers to increase the overall buyer-supplier transaction rates with an eye toward improved environmental outcomes.

TI UNILEVER'S DRIVE FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND CSR - CHANGING THE GAME
SO ORGANIZING FOR SUSTAINABILITY
SE Organizing for Sustainable Effectiveness
AB This chapter examines Unilever's transformation in sustainability and corporate social responsibility (CSR) over the past decade. It tracks the author's involvement with an internal team that studied Unilever's world "outside in" and "inside out" through the engagement of over 100 organizational leaders to awaken the company for change. The case reports how Unilever embraced a "vitality mission" to align its strategies and organization around sustainability and CSR and infuse social and environmental content into its corporate and product brands. Among the innovations described are certification of the sources of sustainable fish and tea, Dove's inner-beauty campaign, and several "bottom of the pyramid" efforts. Particular attention is given to the makeover of its high-growth Asian business. The transformation is examined as a "catalytic" approach to change and discussed with reference to theories of complex adaptive systems. This raises theoretical questions about the role of top-down versus more communal leadership, the importance of mission versus vision in guiding change, and the relevance of emotive and psycho-spiritual versus more programmatic interventions in the rearchitecture of an organization as it progresses on sustainability and CSR.

Characterised by a variety of furniture and layout options, these spaces are designed to enable a range of learning styles and activities and facilitate student-centred pedagogy. These changes to school learning environments are discussed in light of some central constructs of complexity theory, including inertial momentum, emergence, agent interaction, information flow, feedback loops and lock-in. The findings highlight the role of consultation, participation and ownership as central elements of sustainable change processes. Further effective design and transformation of learning environments requires a reflexive school community, pedagogical shift, professional development, and ongoing support to teachers and students. The discussion emphasizes the sociomaterial interplay between the pedagogical and physical classroom environment.

AB In this paper complexity theory and complex adaptive systems are examined as a conceptual and empirical framework for sustainability and the sustainable commons. In contrast to traditional reductionist approaches, complexity theory provides a view in which nested and intertwined social, environmental, economic and cultural systems are in continual flux and coevolutionary development, and where change is emergent, the result of ongoing multidirectional contact and feedback among networks of agents of many types. The implications of this ontology are that sustainability is defined more in terms of processes rather than performance measures or final goals, and inquiry focuses on the contexts, patterns, networks, and relational aspects and mechanisms of micro and macro sustainability processes. The paper presents an overview of complexity theory, situates and examines sustainability in a complexity 'mindset' (Richardson, 2008), and discusses three important research tools for a complexity analysis of sustainability-social construction, identity work, and social network analysis.

TI Regional Innovation Systems as Complex Adaptive Systems: The Case of
   Lagging European Regions
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This article proposes an agent-based model to support the development of self-sustaining regional innovation systems (RIS). The model is the base of a computational laboratory, CARIS (Complex Adaptive Regional Innovation System), which aims at evaluating the self-sustainability of RIS and at investigating what are the resources, competencies and mechanisms able to trigger powerful innovation and economic growth processes. Such a topic is particularly interesting for the so-called lagging regions, which, notwithstanding noticeable policy interventions, have been unable to significantly improve their innovation performances. Results of this study show that the exploration capacity, the propensity to cooperation, and the endowed competencies of actors belonging to a region could be considered as key aspects in affecting the regional innovation performance. This means that policy-makers should (i) incentivize investments in research and development activities both at the public and private levels; (ii) support public-private partnerships; (iii) enhance national and regional university systems; and (iv) increase the number of researchers employed both in the public and private sectors. In the next future, the CARIS laboratory could be adopted as policy support instrument to evaluate how much effective are current innovation policies and what are the most effective ones to reassess the current patterns.

TI Addressing antimicrobial resistance in China: policy implementation in a
   complex context
SO GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH
AB The effectiveness of antibiotics in treating bacterial infections is decreasing in China because of the widespread development of resistant organisms. Although China has enacted a number of regulations to address this problem, but the impact is very limited. This paper investigates the implementation of these regulations through the lens of complex adaptive systems (CAS). It presents the findings from reviews of relevant policy documents and published papers. The paper identifies different types of agent and explores their interaction with regard to the use of antibiotics and their responses to changes of the regulations. It focuses particularly on the impact of perverse financial incentives on overall patterns of use of antibiotics. Implications for the possibilities of nonlinear results, interactive relationships, and new pathways of policy implementation are discussed. The paper concludes that policy-makers need to better understand the objectives, incentives and potential adaptive behaviors of the agents when they implement interventions to improve antibiotic use and reduce the risk of emergence of resistant organisms.

TI Thinking about complexity in health: A systematic review of the key
   systems thinking and complexity ideas in health
SO JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB Rationale, aims, and objectivesAs the Sustainable Development Goals are rolled out worldwide, development leaders will be looking to the experiences of the past to improve implementation in the future. Systems thinking and complexity science (ST/CS) propose that health and the health system are composed of dynamic actors constantly evolving in response to each other and their context. While offering practical guidance for steering the next development agenda, there is no consensus as to how these important ideas are discussed in relation to health. This systematic review sought to identify and describe some of the key terms, concepts, and methods in recent ST/CS literature.
   MethodUsing the search terms systems thinkin * AND health OR complexity theor* AND health OR complex adaptive system* AND health, we identified 516 relevant full texts out of 3982 titles across the search period (2002-2015).
   ResultsThe peak number of articles were published in 2014 (83) with journals specifically focused on medicine/healthcare (265) and particularly the Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice (37) representing the largest number by volume. Dynamic/dynamical systems (n=332), emergence (n=294), complex adaptive system(s) (n=270), and interdependent/interconnected (n=263) were the most common terms with systems dynamic modelling (58) and agent-based modelling (43) as the most common methods.
   ConclusionsThe review offered several important conclusions. First, while there was no core ST/CS canon, certain terms appeared frequently across the reviewed texts. Second, even as these ideas are gaining traction in academic and practitioner communities, most are concentrated in a few journals. Finally, articles on ST/CS remain largely theoretical illustrating the need for further study and practical application. Given the challenge posed by the next phase of development, gaining a better understanding of ST/CS ideas and their use may lead to improvements in the implementation and practice of the Sustainable Development Goals.

TI Seeing the forest and not the trees: Learning from nature's circular
   economy
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Managing for triple bottom line (TBL) by creating economic, ecological and social value is increasingly on the business agenda. However, it is challenging to address non-economic issues because businesses are designed to maximize profit and are less aligned with global ecological and social challenges. Shifting from linear supply chain thinking to interconnected, circular, ecosystem thinking could offer insights into addressing these challenges. Looking at time-tested patterns and strategies from natural ecosystems that operate using, reusing, and repurposing materials and components in a way that is sustainable, may allow for innovative and effective solutions for businesses to begin addressing these global challenges. Biomimicry, an approach to innovation that seeks solutions to human challenges by emulating nature, can inspire evolutionary and structural aspects of business ecosystems. Biomimetic insights related to mycorrhizal (root-fungus) networks are used as a foundation of this research. This research draws on network theory and complex adaptive systems (CAS) to translate the biomimetic language to the language of networked business systems. Based on literature and interview data gathered from five businesses, biomimetic principles were developed that can guide businesses as they transition from linear, wasteful chains to circular business value systems. In particular, business ecosystems require more participants in the roles of 'scavengers' and 'decomposers' and an underlying infrastructure, that helps to manage information and material flows in an integrated way.

Component elements are basic elements in the process of adaptation. This article proposes that the enterprise adaptability is composed of three elements: environment sense, organizational adjustment and environment response based on the complex adaptive system theory by John H. Holland. For measuring enterprise adaptability this paper builds a second order measuremant model, then to test and verify the model by empirical data analysis through questionnaire survey of Chinese private enterprises.

TI Crafting actionable knowledge on ecological intensification: Lessons
   from co-innovation approaches in Uruguay and Europe
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB Context: Despite a wealth of analytical knowledge on factors and processes that operate to slow down or impede sustainability transitions in various sectors of society, design-oriented researchers face a lack of guidance on the 'how to' question for developing knowledge to support sustainability changes. From 2007, we crafted coinnovation as an approach for governance and management of change-oriented projects, combining three domains; a complex adaptive systems perspective, a social learning setting, and dynamic monitoring and evaluation.
   Objective: This paper sets out to describe the co-innovation approach and draw lessons from its application in projects on ecological intensification in Uruguay and the European Union.
   Methods: We used an analytical framework for evaluating sustainability transition experiments, which considers project features that provide insights into the contribution to sustainability transformations by project outputs, outcomes, processes and inputs, and their interactions. Empirical information on 6 cases from 3 projects was collected through in-depth interviews with former project staff, group discussion, and project documentation. This enabled a reflexive evaluation of co-innovation.
   Results and conclusions: Outputs showed substantial variation among the cases despite a similar approach to project governance and management. More significant contributions to sustainability transitions were associated with in-depth project preparation, a focus at the farm-level instead of the crop or field level, connections during the project's lifetime with regional innovation system actors, and frequent facilitated interactions among project actors to reflect on results, wider system implications, and project direction. We discuss the results in relation to the three domains of co-innovation. To enhance the role of projects in destabilizing currently unsustainable systems we highlight: reconsidering the role of projects as a business model; stimulating institutional learning from previous change-oriented projects; and making funding more adaptive to evolving project needs.
   Significance: With most of the budget for agricultural research-for-change spent through projects, how projects are conducted is a critical determinant of the rate of sustainability transitions. Effective disruption of unsustainable practices through project interventions requires rethinking linear cause-effect relations to include project governance and management approaches based on complex adaptive systems thinking, social learning settings, and monitoring geared to adaptation and learning.

   issue and marine commons
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
CT Workshop of Resilience Alliance
CY MAY, 2004
CL Nagambie, AUSTRALIA
AB Most research in the area of common and common-pool resources in the past two or three decades sought the simplicity of community-based resource management cases to develop theory. This was done mainly because of the relative ease of observing processes of self-governance in simple cases, but it raises questions related to scale. To what extent can the findings of small-scale, community-based commons be scaled up to generalize about regional and global commons? Even though some of the principles from community-based studies are likely to be relevant across scale, new and different principles may also come into play at different levels. The study of cross-level institutions such as institutions of co-management, provides ways to approach scale-related questions and deal with linkages in complex adaptive systems. Looking beyond self-governance, community-based resource management needs to deal with multiple levels of governance and external drivers of change, as illustrated in this paper with examples of marine commons.

TI On the road to carbon reduction in a food supply network: a complex
   adaptive systems perspective
SO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Purpose In acknowledging the reality of climate change, large firms have set internal and external (supplier oriented) targets to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. This study aims to explore the complex processes behind the evolution and diffusion of carbon reduction strategies in supply networks.
   Design/methodology/approach The research uses complex adaptive systems (CASs) as a theoretical framework and presents a single case study of a focal buying firm and its supply network in the food sector. A longitudinal and multilevel analysis is used to discuss the dynamics between the focal firm, the supply network and external environment.
   Findings Rather than being a linear and controlled process of adoption implementation outcomes, the transition to reduce carbon in a supply network is much more dynamic, emerging as a result of a number of factors at the individual, organisational, supply network and environmental levels.
   Research limitations/implications The research considers the emergence of a carbon reduction strategy in the food sector, driven by a dominant buying firm. Future research should seek to investigate the diffusion of environmental strategies more broadly and in other contexts.
   Practical implications Findings from the research reveal the limits of the control that a buying firm can exert over behaviours in its network and show the positive influence of consortia initiatives on transitioning to sustainability in supply networks.
   Originality/value CAS is a fairly novel theoretical lens for researching environmental supply network dynamics. The paper offers fresh multilevel insights into the emergent and systemic nature of the diffusion of environmental practices in supply networks.

TI Policy adaptability in practice Lessons learned in the application of
   the Adaptive Design and Assessment Policy Tool (ADAPTool) to examine
   public policies in Canada in the context of climate change
SO POLICY DESIGN AND PRACTICE
AB Designing public policies to effectively address comingled economic, social and environmental issues is a fundamental challenge facing sustainable development policy-makers in the twenty-first century. Raising the stakes is the added challenge of doing so in today's complex, dynamic and uncertain conditions. Policies that cannot perform under such conditions run the risk of not achieving their intended purpose and hindering the ability of individuals, communities and businesses to cope with and adapt to change. To explore the principles of adaptive policies, a four-year empirical investigation was launched in Canada and India to extract practical insights from complex adaptive systems literature and to study the characteristics of policies that have been effective under changing socio-economic and environmental conditions. Seven core principles for creating adaptive policies were identified and a practical policy analysis tool was developed to help policy-makers translate the principles into tangible recommendations. This paper presents the results of applications of the ADAPTool (Adaptive Design and Assessment Policy Tool) by four provincial governments in Canada on policies aimed at supporting climate change adaptation efforts. Lessons learned from the applications are discussed.

TI Historical roots and the evolving science of forest management under a
   systemic perspective
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB In recent history, both a growing awareness of how scientific and societal uncertainty impacts management decisions and of the intrinsic value of nature have suggested new approaches to forest management, with a growing debate in forest science over the need for a paradigmatic shift from the classic conventional world view, based on determinism, predictability, and output-oriented management, towards a world view that has roots in complex adaptive systems theory and is consistent with a nature-based ethic. A conceptual framework under this context is provided by systemic silviculture. In this discussion, we analyze how this approach can be linked to three fundamental moments of the history of forestry and forest science: the Dauerwald theory, Gurnaud's control method, and the origins of environmental ethics. Relationships with the recent history of forest management science and current research perspectives are also highlighted.

TI Being Affected by Sinking Deltas: Changing Landscapes, Resilience, and
   Complex Adaptive Systems in the Scientific Story of the Anthropocene
SO CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY
AB This paper considers recent studies of global environmental change and their impact on the deltas, social and ecological patches that epitomize an Anthropocene environmental dynamism. Looking into these delta studies, we explore an emerging imagination about human-planet relations. Specifically, we indicate that the relationship between the changing Earth and human activities depicted in these studies is comparable to the kind of affective relations to which the anthropology of science has recently brought attention. While affective relations as anthropologically described depend on the capacity of the body to be affected by other entities, global change research on deltas asks the public to imagine collective life, including infrastructure, land use, resource consumption, and companion species, as composite bodies affected by the changing planet. This imagination is made possible by analogies developed in the vicinity of the notion of resilience, a term that originated in mathematical ecology and complex adaptive systems in computer science. In exploring this interdisciplinary traffic of ideas and models, we elucidate an analogical imagination that crosses the border of machines and organisms.

TI Opportunities and challenges of the ecosystem approach
SO FUTURES
AB Humanity will continue to struggle with solving its existential problems in the future if command-and-control continues as the predominant approach to environmental and natural resources management. Recognizing the ecosystem perspective, complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory and transdisciplinary collaboration as conceptual opportunities to developing innovative and socially robust solutions is an important step in the right direction. However, because ecosystems are constantly evolving, human co-development has to account for inherent ecological uncertainty. Thus, sustainability depends on a continuous reevaluation of objectives, continuous knowledge generation, stakeholder involvement and a deeper understanding of evolving social and ecological dynamics. These requirements of continuity are hardly met by current approaches consisting of consecutive transdisciplinary projects focused on solving the most urgent problems of mismanagement at hand. Therefore, in this paper we argue for an organizational setup when pursuing an ecosystem approach and outline essential characteristics, inherent opportunities and fundamental challenges. Promising benefits of this approach include tested yet proactive interventions, public credibility, resource efficiency, long-term relationship building, community participation and ultimately sustainable development. Thereby, sustainability is aspired to and supported by a shared vision, organizational co-evolution, an organizational culture promoting innovation and an external autonomy to self-organize.

TI What is the evidence that invasive species are a significant contributor
   to the decline or loss of threatened species? A systematic review map
SO ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE
AB Background: Invasive species have been reported as one of the leading causes of species extinction. However, the evidence to support or contest their effects on the decline and/or extinction of threatened species has been largely unavailable and few efforts have been made to collate such information. In order to develop national and international policies addressing the loss of threatened species, and to prioritise research and mitigation efforts, the evidence needs to be systematically reviewed and mapped to determine the importance of such effects.
   Methods/design: The searching of online publication databases, grey literature and other resources, such as recovery plans of endangered species, aims to gather existing evidence on whether invasive species are a significant contributor to the decline and/or extinction of threatened species. This study focuses on US species under threat. The methods used to carry out the systematic review will address the following two fundamental questions: (a) what proportion of threatened species have an invasive species as a significant contributor to their decline and (b) through what mechanisms do invasive species contribute towards the decline of native species? The pool of resources gathered will be analysed for relevance and quality using a pre-defined scoring system. A systematic map will be produced, summarising information from individual studies. Where possible, data will be extracted from included studies and synthesised using meta-analysis.

TI Conserving complexity: A complex systems paradigm and framework to study
   public relations? contribution to grand challenges
SO PUBLIC RELATIONS REVIEW
AB Sustainable development poses a grand challenge for society, addressed by organisations through their public relations activities. Grand challenges are complex by nature and call for nontrivial solutions whose effects show at the level of society. That is why studying public relations' contribution to grand challenges requires a macro perspective that accounts for the dynamic interaction between individual, organisational, and system levels in a digital communication environment. This paper offers a new paradigm to analyse organisations' significant and at times undue impact on grand challenges through public relations. It develops a framework inspired by complex adaptive systems thinking and adopts its ten properties for public relations: emergence, adaptivity, heterogeneous actors, nonlinear effects, feedback mechanisms, self-organisation, phase transitions, networks, scaling, and cooperation. The paper applies the framework to the example of sustainable development. It shows why research on grand challenges requires a holistic perspective and how it can help study digitally born communication phenomena. The proposed complex systems paradigm provides space for critical, social scien-tific, and interpretative research lines in public relations. Inquiries start from the grand challenge and study the communicative interactions between organisations and other actors from existing theory while accounting for the ten properties of complex adaptive systems. The paper outlines how future research can enrich the study of public relations and discusses its limits.

TI Transition management towards sustainable mobility in Alpine
   destinations: realities and realpolitik in Italy's South Tyrol region
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM
AB Sustainable mobility, including public transport and human-powered slow mobility is a priority for the sustainable development of tourism destinations, but it is a complex challenge to devise, implement and manage. This paper explores the mechanisms and conditions governing transition towards sustainable mobility in destinations, using a complexity-based approach. Destinations are understood as complex adaptive systems where social-ecological, socio-technical and socio-political subsystems interact dynamically with the tourism subsystem. These subsystems are interwoven and undergo significant, and inter-related, changes during transition towards more sustainable mobility. Three examples from the tourism intensive Alpine destination of South Tyrol (Italy) illustrate subsystem interactions during the transition process. Key player interview-based qualitative research indicates that the complexity of transition management is rooted particularly in the paired presence of risk aversion among local stakeholders and the unpredictability of visitor flows. Mitigating risk aversion through collective knowledge creation and offering answers to unpredictability by developing a strong adaptive and (re)organisation capacity seem to be required to adjust sustainable mobility solutions to continuous market changes, to convince stakeholders and to guarantee incremental and durable success. The public sector's special role is noted, as are the time demands of transition management, and the value of both formal and informal partnerships.

TI Sustainability in Community Building: Framing Design Thinking Using a
   Complex Adaptive Systems Perspective
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory is acquiring mainstream recognition in sustainable community building. In this paper, we bring the applicability of CAS theory into sharper focus, highlighting its potential for integrating complexity and adaptivity of community into a structured body of knowledge while also providing a thought pattern for generating, implementing and validating new design ideas. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a framework of design thinking that uses a CAS perspective to aid designers in conceiving new community building design ideas efficiently. Next, this paper presents the results of a cognitive design experiment where functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and extended protocol analysis methods were combined to examine the validities of the proposed design thinking framework in community building. The results show that the Agent-Interaction-Adaptation (AIA) design thinking framework has the ability to promote designers' extension of idea space, brain activation and idea quality in contrast to a traditional design thinking framework, but it did not significantly increase the designers' idea quantity.

TI Understanding water governance from a systems' perspective: A precursor
   for an enhanced water governance in small towns
SO HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB Small towns do not emerge spontaneously, but evolve, with water governance issues emerging at each stage of the community's growth. Water governance is bedevilled with challenges because cognitive attention is not given to water governance at early stages of growth. This paper examines small town water governance in Ghana, using field research in two communities, Gwollu and Daffiama, in north-western Ghana, which had water systems installed in the 1960s. Systems' thinking was used to unravel the evolution of the water systems. The paper uses historical analysis to focus on the water systems' successes and vulnerability issues, and to explain how management has been able to respond to different pressures over time. Each water system has been exposed to an array of pressures, including technological changes, socioeconomic and demographic changes, all of which have influenced the functioning of their water governance regimes. The case studies illustrate how each town's water system has gone through a cycle of adaptive change of: (i) growth/exploitation; (ii) conservation; and (iii) final collapse of the water system. After the collapse, the two towns moved to a reorganisation of their water system in the same year. The two water systems were moving to a collapse stage. The paper concludes by offering an explanation of the current state of outcomes.

TI Supporting interoperability in complex adaptive enterprise systems: A
   domain specific language approach
SO DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING
AB From a Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) theory perspective a new approach for supporting Enterprise Interoperability (El) is described. Particular needs informed by the theory are presented and a software environment supporting these requirements is proposed. The infrastructure aims at serving as a tool for solving problems in the EI domain, and includes a Domain Specific Language (DSL) supporting engineering interoperability solutions. The Ontology of Enterprise Interoperability (OoEI) provides the underlying conceptualisation of the Enterprise Interoperability (El) domain and is used as basis. The DSL enhances the ontology with CAS related concepts. The CAS perspective provides a particular focus on dynamic aspects, which requires a new approach currently only addressed to a limited extend. The research interoperability infrastructure provides components to address the decentralised nature of a CAS by providing software agents and agent interaction protocols that facilitate the identification of interoperability problems and agent negotiations to find solutions. It is realised using the functional programming language Scala. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Power in global governance: an expanded typology from global health
SO GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH
AB The exercise of power permeates global governance processes, making power a critical concept for understanding, explaining, and influencing the intersection of global governance and health. This article briefly presents and discusses three well-established conceptualizations of power-Dahl's, Bourdieu's, and Barnett and Duvall's-from different disciplines, finding that each is important for understanding global governance but none is sufficient. The conceptualization of power itself needs to be expanded to include the multiple ways in which one actor can influence the thinking or actions of others. I further argue that global governance processes exhibit features of complex adaptive systems, the analysis of which requires taking into account multiple types of power. Building on established frameworks, the article then offers an expanded typology of eight kinds of power: physical, economic, structural, institutional, moral, discursive, expert, and network. The typology is derived from and illustrated by examples from global health, but may be applicable to global governance more broadly. Finally, one seemingly contradictory - and cautiously optimistic - conclusion emerges from this typology: multiple types of power can mutually reinforce tremendous power disparities in global health; but at the same time, such disparities are not necessarily absolute or immutable. Further research on the complex interaction of multiple types of power is needed for a better understanding of global governance and health.

TI Managerial applications of corporate social responsibility and systems
   thinking for achieving sustainability outcomes
SO SYSTEMS RESEARCH AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
AB There is a gap between organizations' intentions to adopt corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies and their provision of a clear strategy and management tools for practically realizing such intentions. In particular, the literature to date has not yet developed a pragmatic, descriptive summary of firms' designs for CSR adoption, along with a practical menu of ways to implement their designs in organizational systems. To address these gaps, this paper aims to make three principle contributions. First, it defines CSR, sustainability and their relationship in practical terms. Second, it develops a typology of CSR standpoints that incorporates a number of other classifications. Third, it offers a menu of practical methods and measurement metrics based on interpretive and complex adaptive systems perspectives. The result is a hands-on guide to the process of achieving sustainability goals and objectives from a variety of ideological positions and systems designs, thereby contributing to both managerial practice and sustainability theory.

TI On the road to a new stormwater planning approach: from Model A to Model
   B
SO WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Traditional models for planning urban water systems are to great extent based on technical and economic considerations (Model A). This approach is adequate for planning isolated and well-defined water systems. With the introduction of the concept of sustainability, the water systems interact with societal processes in the urban environment. We are not any more dealing with an isolated water system but with a complex adaptive system. For such systems the traditional planning models are not good enough. A more integrated planning approach is needed (Model B). An important characteristic of this new approach is that the complexity of the planning process is not combated but made manageable. As a result, during the process different space scales are handled parallel, time plays a more important role and more actors are involved. It is an open process. Also more values of water are taken into account. Different techniques for sustainable stormwater drainage are described. Based on experiences in the city of Malmo in Sweden a practical approach for integrated planning of these types of drainage systems has evolved (Model B). As a result multiple use of stormwater facilities has today been general practice in Malmo. The outcome of some sustainable stormwater projects is presented.

AB Lifelong learning has become a fundamental element in any organization, as a tool for managing development, sustainability and innovation of knowledge capabilities. In this paper, we start by describing the combination of two phenomena-Shared Service Centre (SSC) and E-Learning-that expand knowledge capabilities. Also this intentional combination provides for the emergence of new knowledge. Then we produce a conceptual model for developing a continuous learning organization. The Delta model assumes-in essence-the characteristics of complex adaptive systems (CAS) and incorporates concepts of crowdsourcing. This model conceptualizes and integrates SSC for managing organizational knowledge and memory repository and E-Learning, as the enhancer for a push-pull communication process and the emergence of knowledge. Then, from the conceptual model, we mathematically deduct a Delta (Delta) factor. This factor presents characteristics that allow it to be used for determining the viability of continuous learning from the sharing of knowledge capabilities. In addition we present a set of recommendations designed Improvement Classes, which aim to guide a successful implementation of the Delta Model.

TI Heavy metal music meets complexity and sustainability science
SO SPRINGERPLUS
AB This paper builds a bridge between heavy metal music, complexity theory and sustainability science to show the potential of the (auditory) arts to inform different aspects of complex systems of people and nature. The links are described along different dimensions. This first dimension focuses on the scientific aspect of heavy metal. It uses complex adaptive systems theory to show that the rapid diversification and evolution of heavy metal into multiple subgenres leads to a self-organizing and resilient socio-musicological system. The second dimension builds on the recent use of heavy metal as a critical thinking model and educational tool, emphasizing the artistic component of heavy metal and its potential to increase people's awareness of environmental sustainability challenges. The relationships between metal, complexity theory and sustainability are first discussed independently to specifically show mechanistic links and the reciprocal potential to inform one domain (science) by the other (metal) within these dimensions. The paper concludes by highlighting that these dimensions entrain each other within a broader social-cultural-environmental system that cannot be explained simply by the sum of independent, individual dimensions. Such a unified view embraces the inherent complexity with which systems of people and nature interact. These lines of exploration suggest that the arts and the sciences form a logical partnership. Such a partnership might help in endeavors to envision, understand and cope with the broad ramifications of sustainability challenges in times of rapid social, cultural, and environmental change.

TI Perspectives on the role of mobility, behavior, and time scales in the
   spread of diseases
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB The dynamics, control, and evolution of communicable and vector-borne diseases are intimately connected to the joint dynamics of epidemiological, behavioral, and mobility processes that operate across multiple spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The identification of a theoretical explanatory framework that accounts for the pattern regularity exhibited by a large number of host-parasite systems, including those sustained by host-vector epidemiological dynamics, is but one of the challenges facing the coevolving fields of computational, evolutionary, and theoretical epidemiology. Host-parasite epidemiological patterns, including epidemic outbreaks and endemic recurrent dynamics, are characteristic to well-identified regions of the world; the result of processes and constraints such as strain competition, host and vector mobility, and population structure operating over multiple scales in response to recurrent disturbances (like El Nino) and climato-logical and environmental perturbations over thousands of years. It is therefore important to identify and quantify the processes responsible for observed epidemiological macroscopic patterns: the result of individual interactions in changing social and ecological landscapes. In this perspective, we touch on some of the issues calling for the identification of an encompassing theoretical explanatory framework by identifying some of the limitations of existing theory, in the context of particular epidemiological systems. Fostering the reenergizing of research that aims at disentangling the role of epidemiological and socioeconomic forces on disease dynamics, better understood as complex adaptive systems, is a key aim of this perspective.

AB With the development of social economy, water resources system is coupled with the systems of society and economy and environment, rather than an isolated system. The coupled system is called a water society economy environment compound system (WSEECS). To realize the sustainable development of WSEECS, each sub system of the system, namely the sub system of water resources, society, economy and environment, should be developed harmoniously. Because of serious water shortage, water volume plays an important role in the process. of developing harmoniously each sub system, which can be quantitatively measured by an index called system coordination degree (SCD). The SCD fluctuates with the water volume allocated to each sub system varying. In the traditional water resources allocation model, SCD is made as a constraint. But for a complex huge WSEECS, such as inter-basin water resources system, the disposal manner has many defects and is not effective in the problem of inter-basin water resources allocation. In fact, the inter-basin WSEECS is a complex adaptive system (CAS). Therefore, according to CAS theory, based on the complexity and adaptability of system, through regarding water resources allocation as an evolutionary process and SCD as an evolution control factor, the paper puts forward a multi-level multi-object inter-basin water resources allocation model. Furthermore, the model is applied to the water resources allocation problem of the east-route of South-to-North Water Transfer Project and is verified through simulation.

AB Five moments in the formation and functioning of complex adaptive systems are: (1) emergent regularities and patterns in the flow of matter, energy, and/or information; (2) condensed schematic representations of these regularities enabling their identification; (3) reproductively interchangeable variants of these representations serving as templates for new instances of the pattern; (4) successful reproduction facilitated by the accuracy and reliability of the representations' predictions of data flow regularities; and (5) informational feedback that adaptively modifies and reorganizes representations to incorporate new variations in the data flow, cycling back the first moment. These five moments are instantiated via stochastic models providing practical approaches to representing and managing complex adaptive psychological and social systems in education, health care, human resource management, etc. Local independence, unidimensionality, and statistical sufficiency criteria function as means of identifying, evaluating, and deploying conceptual and social forms of life acting as evolving agents in defined ecological niches. Bringing these agents into play systematically requires embodying them in technologies instrumental to making them readily recognizable and sharable across ecosystem niches. Modeling research and practice promoting sustainable and self-organizing ecosystems of this kind set the stage for redefining profit in terms of authentic wealth and value for life.

AB We explore supervisory control strategies for the operation of grid-connected hybrid energy systems (HES) as complex adaptive systems. We do this not from a demand response management standpoint, like most of the literature does, but from a power generation and supply viewpoint, by means of homeostatic regulation and control with an aim for sustainable micro-generation systems for small-size communities. Homeostatic control (HC) is a term introduced by Fred C. Schweppe and his group of collaborators at MIT back in 1979 and early 1980s and stems from the highly visionary work done by them. We build on this concept and take a new approach, presenting our model and simulation results, which show clearly how He and regulation of energy intake and expenditure by consumers, along with the presence of energy storage and compensatory mechanisms in the microgrid can provide much insight on how to make these systems more efficient, sustainable and resilient, particularly when integrated to the mains. Simulation provides a good fit to the data, and the response of the system to changing supply in different scenarios was characterized by its consistency and logical framework, supporting the model employed.

AB There is an ongoing tension for scientists when deciding to engage with the public about their research as many scientists view direct participation as peripheral to their role. Pressures of time, lack of support by management and a lack of communicative skills are identified by scientists as reasons for not committing to communicative initiatives. We aimed to explore and explain the organizational culture of a research community that activity communicates with the public and has an international research culture. The Centre for Brain Research (CBR) was identified as a model and was analyzed using the concept of Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS). Twelve participants (scientists (8), clinicians (1), community liaison people (2)) and an identified director of the organization were interviewed. Direct quotes from interview were used to provide examples of the characteristics of CAS for example a variety of agents interacting, adapting the learning within the organization, non-linear dynamic behavior that is a result of aggregates of groups with actions emerging from self-organizing behavior and the development of an emergent culture. This analysis showed that complexity theory was a suitable framework for analyzing the sustainable communicative organization within CBR.

In order to achieve this goal, different urban morphological factors, which have great influence on energy consumption of the city as a single entity, are investigated as based on complexity analysis. In this analysis, the urban morphology is considered as the microscopic emergence of the city element's transformation in time. Much research has been carried out regarding sustainable buildings and the energy performance of single edifices; however, there are few studies which have been carried out with consideration of the cities as a single unit.

TI Embracing complexity in landscape management: Learning and impacts of a
   participatory resilience assessment
SO ECOSYSTEMS AND PEOPLE
AB Landscapes and their management are at the center of many of the sustainability challenges that we face. Landscapes can be described as social-ecological systems shaped by a myriad of human activities and biophysical processes, interacting across space and time. Managing them sustainably requires considering this complexity. Resilience thinking offers ways to address complexity in decision-making. In this paper, we analyse the learning and impact on a diverse group of local actors from participating in a participatory resilience assessment. The assessment, focused on sustainable landscape management in the Helge a catchment, Sweden, produced concrete knowledge outputs, describing ecosystem service bundles, a future vision, conceptual system models, and a strategic action plan. Follow-up interviews indicate that the process and its outputs supported the participants' learning process and helped them to articulate complexity thinking in practice. The outputs, and the exercises to produce them, emerged as complementary in supporting this articulation. Furthermore, they helped build participants' capacity to communicate the diverse values of the landscape to others and to target leverage points more strategically. Thus, it supported the application of resilience thinking in landscape management, especially by generating learning and fostering complex adaptive systems thinking.

TI Coupling agent-based simulation and spatial optimization models to
   understand spatially complex and co-evolutionary behavior of cocaine
   trafficking networks and counterdrug interdiction
SO IISE TRANSACTIONS
AB Despite more than 40 years of counterdrug interdiction efforts in the Western Hemisphere, cocaine trafficking, or ''narco-trafficking'', networks continue to evolve and increase their global reach. Counterdrug interdiction continues to fall short of performance targets, due to the adaptability of narco-trafficking networks and spatially complex constraints on interdiction operations (e.g., resources, jurisdictional). Due to these dynamics, current modeling approaches offer limited strategic insights into time-varying, spatially optimal allocation of counterdrug interdiction assets. This study presents coupled agent-based and spatial optimization models to investigate the co-evolution of counterdrug interdiction deployment and narco-trafficking networks' adaptive responses. Increased spatially optimized interdiction assets were found to increase seizure volumes. However, the value per seized shipment concurrently decreased and the number of active nodes increased or was unchanged. Narco-trafficking networks adaptively responded to increased interdiction pressure by spatially diversifying routes and dispersing shipment volumes. Thus, increased interdiction pressure had the unintended effect of expanding the spatial footprint of narco-trafficking networks. This coupled modeling approach enabled the study of narco-trafficking network evolution while being subjected to varying interdiction pressure as a spatially complex adaptive system. Capturing such co-evolution dynamics is essential for simulating traffickers' realistic adaptive responses to a wide range of interdiction scenarios.

TI Assessing a farm's sustainability: insights from resilience thinking
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB Research on sustainability in agriculture often focuses on reducing the environmental impacts of production systems. However, environmentally friendly production methods may not be sufficient to ensure the long-term economic and social sustainability of a farm. Taking a systems approach to sustainable farming, we turn to resilience thinking with its focus on the interdependence of social and ecological systems. We apply this approach to farming by conceptualizing a farm as being part of a set of systems spanning several spatial scales and including agro-ecological, economic and political-social domains. These subsystems interact and are subjected to their own complex dynamics. Within such a complex adaptive system, farm sustainability can only be achieved through adaptability and change. To be ready for the inevitable periods of turbulent change, a farmer needs to retain diversity and redundancy to ensure adaptability. Resilience is thus more likely to emerge when farmers hone the capacity to transform the farm, when farm production is attuned to the local ecological carrying capacity, and when learning and innovation are targeted outcomes. This article shows how resilience theory applied to farming may provide a more comprehensive route to achieving sustainability and offers rules of thumb as guides to building farm resilience.

AB This paper represents a research response to the current vision on transformations regarding the capacity building of smart cities focused towards sustainability, by addressing the knowledge based urban development and collaborative tools that support the development, dissemination, and use of knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to develop a collaborative pattern of knowledge networking, focusing on sustainability goals within a smart city concept, using the logic of the Complex Adaptive System (CAS). The study was carried out in an innovation cluster in Romania; the Social Network Analysis (SNA) was used as a tool to perform the study. The results of this analysis, due to the suggested networking, have led to delimitation of the roles that Groups of Competences play to enhance the sustainability of smart cities in areas where the use of knowledge has the greatest impact. Results show that the success of the smart solutions' implementation depends on how the social and competence structures of the network are shaped and whether it permanently adapts to fit the sustainability objectives in the considered areas.

TI An integrated science-based methodology to assess potential risks and
   implications of engineered nanomaterials
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB There is an urgent need for broad and integrated studies that address the risks of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) along the different endpoints of the society, environment, and economy (SEE) complex adaptive system. This article presents an integrated science-based methodology to assess the potential risks of engineered nanomaterials. To achieve the study objective, two major tasks are accomplished, knowledge synthesis and algorithmic computational methodology. The knowledge synthesis task is designed to capture "what is known" and to outline the gaps in knowledge from ENMs risk perspective. The algorithmic computational methodology is geared toward the provision of decisions and an understanding of the risks of ENMs along different endpoints for the constituents of the SEE complex adaptive system. The approach presented herein allows for addressing the formidable task of assessing the implications and risks of exposure to ENMs, with the long term goal to build a decision-support system to guide key stakeholders in the SEE system towards building sustainable ENMs and nano-enabled products.

   Care Organizations The ELIAS Performance Management Framework
SO HEALTH CARE MANAGER
AB The development of sustainable health care organizations that provide high-quality accessible care is a topic of intense interest. This article provides a practical performancemanagement framework that can be utilized to develop sustainable health care organizations. It is a cyclical 5-step process that is premised on accountability, performance management, and learning practices that are the foundation for a continuous process of measurement, disconfirmation, contextualization, implementation, and routinization This results in the enhancement of learning, innovation, adaptation, and sustainability ( ELIAS). Important considerations such as recognizing that health care organizations are complex adaptive systems and the presence of a dynamic learning culture are necessary contextual factors that maximize the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Importantly, the ELIAS performance management framework utilizes data that are already being collected by health care organizations for accountability, improvement, evaluation, and strategic purposes. Therefore, the benefit of the framework, when used as outlined, would be to enhance the chances of health care organizations achieving the goals of ongoing adaptation and sustainability, by design, rather than by chance.

TI Simulating Religions as Adaptive Systems
SO HUMAN SIMULATION: PERSPECTIVES, INSIGHTS, AND APPLICATIONS
SE New Approaches to the Scientific Study of Religion
AB Religious communities exhibit many features of complex adaptive systems (CASs). They are open systems whose global features nonlinearly emerge from the interactions of their components, are complexly internally structured, and must adaptively respond to continual perturbations in their environments. This chapter presents a system dynamics model (SDM) of a generic religious organization represented as a CAS. The simulated community extracts energy from an ecological resource base and expends energy on distinct, mutually exclusive goals: reproduction, energy-seeking, and ritual. Although energy that is spent on ritual cannot be spent on utilitarian objectives, ritual performance increases the perceived legitimacy of the religious system, thereby motivating higher levels of cooperation. Low levels of perceived legitimacy can trigger a switch to a charismatic version of authority. In experiments, we found that many simulated communities maximized their populations by outstripping their resource base shortly before collapsing, in a classic example of boom-and-bust ecological overshoot. However, certain communities showed greater longevity if the Charisma parameter was maximized. We interpret our results to suggest that increasing social flexibility in response to crises of legitimacy may contribute to the resilience of certain types of social, including religious, systems.

TI The green-restructuring of clusters: investigating a biocluster's
   transition using a complex adaptive system model
SO EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES
AB Bioclusters' promise of helping achieving sustainable bioeconomies has invoked great interest among policymakers and academia. However, bioclusters are not intrinsically sustainable. If they are to fulfil their promise, bioclusters must undergo green-restructuring. While cluster-research has elaborated on green regional development, we need more clarity on how clusters transition to normatively desired states; we need more evidence of how green-restructuring unfolds. In this study, we conduct a longitudinal analysis to demonstrate how a biocluster green-restructures through the interactions of agency, regional and industrial structures, and phenomena at (supra-)national levels. To execute this analysis, we created a novel cluster-evolution framework that treats clusters, and the regional innovation system and sectoral systems of innovation that contain the cluster, as complex adaptive systems. We applied this framework to study the greening of the Basque pulp-and paper-biocluster, over four phases between 1986 and 2019. Our analysis helped us discover patterns of agency, structural dynamics, and of agency-structure interactions and how supra-regional phenomena shaped structures and agency over the four phases. Based on our findings, we recommend policymakers encourage not only green-tech entrepreneurs, but also institutional-entrepreneurs and place-leaders who can help shape both (supra-)regional and industrial structures.

TI Networked resilience in rural Australia - a role for health promotion in
   regional responses to climate change
SO HEALTH PROMOTION JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
AB Issues addressed: This paper provides a model for how health promotion teams might establish and support regional collaborations of organisations in a broad response to climate change that enables emergence of multiple strategies tailored to regional needs.
   Methods: Complex Adaptive Systems Theory (CAS) and Organisational Learning informed action to foster a Climate Change Collaboration that engaged in strategies to improve transport options, food security and energy sustainability. Social Network Analysis was used to evaluate the degree to which member organisations became networked, the evolution of key network qualities and the way the organisations were affiliated via their participation in emergent strategies.
   Results: Between 2005 and 2009 a highly connected network of organisations emerged and rapidly evolved to collaborate for action on climate change. There were significant improvements in network density, centralisation, clustering and reciprocity. Member organisations collaborated on a broad range of strategies.
   Conclusions: Reducing regional impact of climate change is complex. It requires long-term collaboration between organisations that may not usually work together. Sustain Northern Rivers provides a successful model for achieving such collaboration.

TI The application of systems thinking concepts, methods, and tools to
   global health practices: An analysis of case studies
SO JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
AB ObjectivesThis review of systems thinking (ST) case studies seeks to compile and analyse cases from ST literature and provide practitioners with a reference for ST in health practice. Particular attention was given to (1) reviewing the frequency and use of key ST terms, methods, and tools in the context of health, and (2) extracting and analysing longitudinal themes across cases.
   MethodsA systematic search of databases was conducted, and a total of 36 case studies were identified. A combination of integrative and inductive qualitative approaches to analysis was used.
   ResultsMost cases identified took place in high-income countries and applied ST retrospectively. The most commonly used ST terms were agent/stakeholder/actor (n=29), interdependent/interconnected (n=28), emergence (n=26), and adaptability/adaptation (n=26). Common ST methods and tools were largely underutilized. Social network analysis was the most commonly used method (n=4), and innovation or change management history was the most frequently used tool (n=11). Four overarching themes were identified; the importance of the interdependent and interconnected nature of a health system, characteristics of leaders in a complex adaptive system, the benefits of using ST, and barriers to implementing ST.
   ConclusionsThis review revealed that while much has been written about the potential benefits of applying ST to health, it has yet to completely transition from theory to practice. There is however evidence of the practical use of an ST lens as well as specific methods and tools. With clear examples of ST applications, the global health community will be better equipped to understand and address key health challenges.

SP Australian Soc Parasitol
AB Host-parasite relationships can be conceptualised either narrowly, where the parasite is metabolically dependent on the host, or more broadly, as suggested by an ecological-evolutionary and complex systems perspective. In this view Host-parasite relationships are part of a larger set of ecological and co-evolutionary interdependencies and a complex adaptive system. These interdependencies affect not just the hosts, vectors, parasites, the immediate agents, but also those indirectly or consequentially affected by the relationship. Host-parasite relationships also can be viewed as systems embedded within larger systems represented by ecological communities and ecosystems. So defined, it can be argued that Host-parasite relationships may often benefit their hosts and contribute significantly to the structuring of ecological communities. The broader, complex adaptive system view also contributes to understanding the phenomenon of disease emergence, the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms involved, and the role of parasitology in research and management of ecosystems in light of the apparently growing problem of emerging infectious diseases in wildlife and humans. An expanded set of principles for integrated parasite management is suggested by this perspective. (c) 2005 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Business adopted a terminology of sustainability to defend, then justify, and finally explain practices that acknowledged resource limitations as inherent in the business environment. Tracing the rhetoric across a half century of business use demonstrates an expansion of the concept of sustainability to encompass managerial attention to finite human, capital, and political resources. A rhetoric of sustainability seemed to promise a revolution in management practice, and practitioners have indeed adopted principles of complex systems. The sustainability terminology retains its narrower focus on environmentally responsible corporate activities, however, and management communication pedagogy has not yet recognized the emerging discourse of adaptive communication practices.

TI Boundary-spanning actors in complex adaptive governance systems: The
   case of multisectoral nutrition
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB A growing literature highlights complexity of policy implementation and governance in global health and argues that the processes and outcomes of policies could be improved by explicitly taking this complexity into account. Yet there is a paucity of studies exploring how this can be achieved in everyday practice. This study documents the strategies, tactics, and challenges of boundary-spanning actors working in 4 Sub-Saharan Africa countries who supported the implementation of multisectoral nutrition as part of the African Nutrition Security Partnership in Burkina Faso, Mali, Ethiopia, and Uganda. Three action researchers were posted to these countries during the final 2years of the project to help the government and its partners implement multisectoral nutrition and document the lessons. Prospective data were collected through participant observation, end-line semistructured interviews, and document analysis. All 4 countries made significant progress despite a wide range of challenges at the individual, organizational, and system levels. The boundary-spanning actors and their collaborators deployed a wide range of strategies but faced significant challenges in playing these unconventional roles. The study concludes that, under the right conditions, intentional boundary spanning can be a feasible and acceptable practice within a multisectoral, complex adaptive system in low- and middle-income countries.

AB Recent research in Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) has begun to produce an understanding of complexity in natural systems as a phenomenon that emerges from the interaction of multiple, simple, but adaptive, agents. The simulations used in this research have led to the development of mathematical and computational techniques based on the model of a complex system composed of multiple, autonomous, intelligent agents, competing and cooperating in the context of the whole system's environment. These methods have had considerable success in modeling and simulating phenomena in biology and ecology, and, more recently, in financial markets.
   A CAS model is particularly appropriate for any industry made up of many, geographically dispersed components that can exhibit rapid global change as a result of local actions - a characteristic of the industries which make up a national or international "infrastructure," for instance, telecommunications, transportation, gas, water and oil pipelines, and the electric power grid. A CAS model and simulation is being developed of the "Electric Enterprise" (taken in the broadest possible sense) that uses autonomous, adaptive agents to represent both the possible industrial components, and the corporate entities who own these components. It is being used to explore both the economic effects of deregulation and the practicality of autonomous, distributed control.

AB The objective of this paper is to unify coordinative management theory and complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory into green construction supply chain management (GCSCM) for realizing the sustainable development. Based on GCSCM, green construction supply chain network system (GCSCNS) is put forward to present holistic solution for the coordination and co-evolution of enterprises, society and environment. Researchers have long modeled and analyzed supply chains using numerous approaches like system dynamics, continuous and discrete time differential equation modeling, and discrete event simulation modeling. These approaches, however, typically assume a predefined supply chain structure. GCSCNS is a complex and dynamic system. Based on analyzing the characteristics of CAS, we find there are common mechanisms shared by GCSCNS and CAS; therefore, relative study is done to discover and expound the intrinsic similarities. Using the concepts of CAS, entities in GCSCNS is considered as agents that are adaptive and evolving to their environments. According to CAS theory, coordinative management framework for GCSCNS is put forward. Considering the attributes of GCSCNS and it management, Swarm simulation platform is introduced for modeling and simulation, and the characteristics and advantages of Swarm simulation for GCSCNS are analyzed and discussed in detail.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION
AB The context of the SDGs resembles the properties of a complex adaptive system (CAS). CAS requires a specific form of leadership and leaders capable of creating social movements and via that way inducing large-scale system transformation towards the attainment of SDGs. Leaders capable of creating social movements tend to be those who occupy the highest levels of adult development (also referred as orders of consciousness). In this paper, we study the leadership approach towards the attainment of SDGs of leader, humanist and mystic from India Jaggi Vasudev Sadhguru. We have chosen him because he has initiated several social movements that have already created effects specified by SDGs. We study his approach to leadership by applying Kegan's (1994) framework of meaning-making and subject-object theory for the 5th order of consciousness. After analyzing Sadhguru's approach from that perspective, we discuss how leadership development programs should be re-designed to produce more leaders of Sadhguru's type. We contribute to the gap between adult development and leadership development if the aim is to facilitate the vertical development of participants towards the highest order of consciousness which in effect will be more capable of attaining SDGs.

TI SoFISHticated policy - social perspectives on the fish conflict in the
   Northeast Atlantic
SO MARINE POLICY
AB Ecosystem changes currently question the traditional allocation of fishing rights and quotas in the fishery of Northeast Atlantic mackerel and Norwegian spring-spawning herring in the Northeast Atlantic. Variability in the distribution of these highly migratory species escalated in a political conflict between member states of the European Union, Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Norway, which is a driving force for unsustainable fishery. The aim of this paper is to investigate this conflict by outlining the social understandings of diverse stakeholders by using the Q methodology. The method reduced the complexity of numerous opinions, detected four distinct perspectives and simultaneously categorised the participating stakeholders. Although the perspectives differ in various elements, the protection of economic interests seems to dominate over the quest for sustainability. The call of all stakeholders in this study to clarify the fishing rights in the Northeast Atlantic reveals a clear deficiency of the current international fishery management in handling abrupt ecological changes and the necessity to acknowledge this as a complex adaptive system.

SO SYSTEMIC PRACTICE AND ACTION RESEARCH
AB Understanding how innovation ecosystems emerge and can be sustained is an important issue. However, the lack of sound relational analysis methods to explain such dynamics could constrain a deeper understanding of the emergence and evolution of ecosystems. This article aligns with the call for innovation ecosystems to utilize developed theoretical foundations through defining and analyzing an innovation ecosystem as a Complex Adaptive System. Of importance is the identification in the article of key functional activities that occur in the system, termed change attractors, informed by Technological Innovation Systems functions. The article takes a reflective look at a technological platform, the District Health Information System (DHIS2) Platform through a review of 73 publications comprising of postgraduate dissertations and reports from the creators and implementers of the DHIS2 Platform from the University of Oslo's Global Health and Infrastructures group. We identify ten key change attractors as functional activities that can be used by managers and implementers of an innovation ecosystem in explaining the current behavior and dynamics in an innovation ecosystem. These attractors assist innovation ecosystem management on what aspects to look at with regard to the evolution and growth of a technology-centric innovation ecosystem.

AB Healthy ocean ecosystems are needed to sustain people and livelihoods and to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Using the ocean sustainably requires overcoming many formidable challenges: overfishing, climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution. Despite gloomy forecasts, there is reason for hope. New tools, practices, and partnerships are beginning to transform local fisheries, biodiversity conservation, and marine spatial planning. The challenge is to bring them to a global scale. We dissect recent successes using a complex adaptive-systems (CAS) framework, which acknowledges the interconnectedness of social and ecological systems. Understanding how policies and practices change the feedbacks in CASs by altering the behavior of different system components is critical for building robust, sustainable states with favorable emergent properties. Our review reveals that altering incentives-either economic or social norms, or both-can achieve positive outcomes. For example, introduction of well-designed rights-based or secure-access fisheries and ecosystem service accounting shifts economic incentives to align conservation and economic benefits. Modifying social norms can create conditions that incentivize a company, country, or individual to fish sustainably, curb illegal fishing, or create large marine reserves as steps to enhance reputation or self-image. In each example, the feedbacks between individual actors and emergent system properties were altered, triggering a transition from a vicious to a virtuous cycle. We suggest that evaluating conservation tools by their ability to align incentives of actors with broader goals of sustainability is an underused approach that can provide a pathway toward scaling sustainability successes. In short, getting incentives right matters.

TI A Systems-Based Conceptual Framework for Assessing the Determinants of a
   Social License to Operate in the Mining Industry
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The concept of a "social license to operate" (SLO) was coined in the 1990s and gained popularity as one way in which "social" considerations can be addressed in mineral development decision making. The need for a SLO implies that developers require the widespread approval of local community members for their projects to avoid exposure to potentially costly conflict and business risks. Only a limited amount of scholarship exists on the topic, and there is a need for research that specifically addresses the complex and changeable nature of SLO outcomes. In response to these challenges, this paper advances a novel, systems-based conceptual framework for assessing SLO determinants and outcomes in the mining industry. Two strands of systems theory are specifically highlighted-complex adaptive systems and resilience-and the roles of context, key system variables, emergence, change, uncertainty, feedbacks, cross-scale effects, multiple stable states, thresholds, and resilience are discussed. The framework was developed from the results of a multi-year research project which involved international mining case study investigations, a comprehensive literature review, and interviews conducted with mining stakeholders and observers. The framework can help guide SLO analysis and management efforts, by encouraging users to account for important contextual and complexity-oriented elements present in SLO settings. We apply the framework to a case study in Alaska, USA before discussing its merits and challenges. We also illustrate knowledge gaps associated with applications of complex adaptive systems and resilience theories to the study of SLO dynamics, and discuss opportunities for future research.

TI Exploring Tradeoffs in Demand- Side and Supply- Side Management of Urban
   Water Resources Using Agent- Based Modeling and Evolutionary Computation
SO SYSTEMS
AB Urban water supply systems may be managed through supply-side and demand-side strategies, which focus on water source expansion and demand reductions, respectively. Supply-side strategies bear infrastructure and energy costs, while demand-side strategies bear costs of implementation and inconvenience to consumers. To evaluate the performance of demand-side strategies, the participation and water use adaptations of consumers should be simulated. In this study, a Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) framework is developed to simulate consumer agents that change their consumption to affect the withdrawal from the water supply system, which, in turn influences operational policies and long-term resource planning. Agent-based models are encoded to represent consumers and a policy maker agent and are coupled with water resources system simulation models. The CAS framework is coupled with an evolutionary computation-based multi-objective methodology to explore tradeoffs in cost, inconvenience to consumers, and environmental impacts for both supply-side and demand-side strategies. Decisions are identified to specify storage levels in a reservoir that trigger: (1) increases in the volume of water pumped through inter-basin transfers from an external reservoir; and (2) drought stages, which restrict the volume of water that is allowed for residential outdoor uses. The proposed methodology is demonstrated for Arlington, Texas, water supply system to identify non-dominated strategies for an historic drought decade. Results demonstrate that pumping costs associated with maximizing environmental reliability exceed pumping costs associated with minimizing restrictions on consumer water use.

TI Coverage of endangered species in environmental risk assessments at EFSA
SO EFSA JOURNAL
AB The EFSA performs environmental risk assessment (ERA) for single potential stressors such as plant protection products, genetically modified organisms and feed additives, and for invasive alien species that are harmful to plant health. This ERA focusses primarily on the use or spread of such potential stressors in an agricultural context, but also considers the impact on the wider environment. It is important to realise that the above potential stressors in most cases contribute a minor proportion of the total integrated pressure that ecosystems experience. The World Wildlife Fund listed the relative attribution of threats contributing to the declines in animal populations as follows: 37% from exploitation (fishing, hunting, etc.), 31% habitat degradation and change, 13% from habitat loss, 7% from climate change, and only 5% from invasive species, 4% from pollution and 2% from disease. In this scientific opinion, the Scientific Committee gathered scientific knowledge on the extent of coverage of endangered species in current ERA schemes that fall under the remit of EFSA. The legal basis and the relevant ecological and biological features used to classify a species as endangered are investigated. The characteristics that determine vulnerability of endangered species are reviewed. Whether endangered species are more at risk from exposure to potential stressors than other nontarget species is discussed, but specific protection goals for endangered species are not given. Due to a lack of effect and exposure data for the vast majority of endangered species, the reliability of using data from other species is a key issue for their ERA. This issue and other uncertainties are discussed when reviewing the coverage of endangered species in current ERA schemes. Potential tools, such as population and landscape modelling and trait-based approaches, for extending the coverage of endangered species in current ERA schemes, are explored and reported.

TI A complex systems model for transformative supply chains in emerging
   markets
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS
AB Purpose Corporations operating global value chains must grapple with a multiplicity of ethical and practical considerations, most notably when value chains extend to emerging markets. Such contexts involve interactions with diverse stakeholders who possess the ability to impact supply chain performance, but who also bring conflicting needs, values and interests. The purpose of this paper is to outline a transformative model of supply chain fairness, arguing that adopting plural fairness principles and practices generates a higher fairness equilibrium which includes all affected stakeholders in the production of fairness outcomes, with consequent positive organizational and system level impacts. Design/methodology/approach Through a philosophically informed overview of the literature on organizational fairness, the paper applies fairness to the management of supplier relations to identify the institutional features of ethically sustainable supply chains. The proposed conceptual model uses a complex adaptive systems approach (CADs), supplemented by describing the contribution of fairness norms and practices. Findings This paper argues that a transformative approach to supply chain fairness can suggest new structures for interaction between firms, stakeholders, mediating institutions and governments. Originality/value Emerging market supply chains are facing significant changes. Adopting a complex adaptive systems perspective upon stakeholder relationships, this paper offers insights from the theoretical literature on fairness, and proposes a normative model of supply chain fairness which accounts for both the normative and empirical aspects of relational complexity.

TI Irrational use of antibiotics in Iran from the perspective of complex
   adaptive systems: redefining the challenge
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Background Irrational use of antibiotics is proving to be a major concern to the health systems globally. This results in antibiotics resistance and increases health care costs. In Iran, despite many years of research, appreciable efforts, and policymaking to avoid irrational use of antibiotics, yet indicators show suboptimal use of antibiotics, pointing to an urgent need for adopting alternative approaches to further understand the problem and to offer new solutions. Applying the Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) theory, to explore and research health systems and their challenges has become popular. Therefore, this study aimed to better understand the complexity of the irrational use of antibiotics in Iran and to propose potential solutions. Method This research utilized a CAS observatory tool to qualitatively collect and analyse data. Twenty interviews and two Focus Group discussions were conducted. The data was enriched with policy document reviews to fully understand the system. MAXQDA software was used to organize and analyze the data. Result We could identify several diverse and heterogeneous, yet highly interdependent agents operating at different levels in the antibiotics use system in Iran. The network structure and its adaptive emergent behavior, information flow, governing rules, feedback and values of the system, and the way they interact were identified. The findings described antibiotics use as emergent behavior that is formed by an interplay of many factors and agents over time. According to this study, insufficient and ineffective interaction and information flow regarding antibiotics between agents are among key causes of irrational antibiotics use in Iran. Results showed that effective rules to minimize irrational use of antibiotics are missing or can be easily disobeyed. The gaps and weaknesses of the system which need redesigning or modification were recognized as well. Conclusion The study suggests re-engineering the system by implementing several system-level changes including establishing strong, timely, and effective interactions between identified stakeholders, which facilitate information flow and provision of on-time feedback, and create win-win rules in a participatory manner with stakeholders and the distributed control system.

TI Decentralization and heterogeneity in complex adaptive systems
SO KYBERNETES
AB Purpose - Following a bacterial-based modeling approach, the authors want to model and analyze the impact of both decentralization and heterogeneity on group behavior and collective learning. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - Inspired by bacterial conjugation, the authors have defined an artificial society in which agents' strategies adapt to changes in resources location, allowing migration, and survival in a dynamic sugarscape-like scenario. To study the impact of these variables the authors have simulated a scenario in which resources are limited and localized. The authors also have defined three constraints in genetic information processing (inhibition of plasmid conjugation, inhibition of plasmid reproduction and inhibition of plasmid mutation).
   Findings - The results affirmed the hypothesis that efficiency of group adaptation to dynamic environments is better when societies are varied and distributed than when they are homogeneous and centralized.
   Originality/value - The authors have demonstrated that in a model based on free interactions among autonomous agents, optimal results emerge by incrementing heterogeneity levels and decentralization of communication structures, leading to a global adaptation of the system. This organic approach to model peer-to-peer dynamics in complex adaptive systems (CAS) is what the authors have named "bacterial-based algorithms" because agents exchange strategic information in the same way that bacteria use conjugation and share genome.

TI Break the Cycle of Collusion: Simulation to Influence Mechanism of
   Cognitive Bias on To-Collude Decision Making
SO BUILDINGS
AB Collusion is an all-pervading illegal market behavior that can undermine the sustainable development of the construction industry. It is acknowledged that collusive bidding decision making is influenced by conspirators' cognitive bias. Nevertheless, the understanding of such an influence mechanism remains vague in the literature. This study aims to examine the mechanism of conspirators' to-collude decision making by establishing a system dynamic model. The model development is based on the theories of cognitive biases, collusive bidding, and complex adaptive system. Multiple scenarios were simulated in the context of the Chinese construction industry. Three most influential cognitive bias are overconfidence, the illusion of control, and cognitive dissonance. The simulation results reveal conspirators' intrinsic mechanisms to decide whether they deserve to participate in collusive bidding. The evolution of to-collude decision making is characterized by nonlinearity, multiplier, and stimulus enhancement effects. Collusion motivation and enterprise network relationships expand conspirators' to-collude decision making. The increase of government regulation intensity and enterprise performance inhibit conspirators' to-collude decision making. This study provides an insight into the cycle of collusion emergence from a complex system perspective and implies that antitrust authorities can launch carrot-and-stick measures for better regulation.

AB Manufacturing sustainability is related to complex adaptive systems crossing different layers; sustainability issues, and their potential resolutions, are transversal to supply and shop-floor levels, often including interaction between them; in addition, multiple actors across the supply chain interact displaying non-linear and non-rational behaviours characterized by feedbacks and time lags. This complexity is nowadays addressed with classical simulation approaches such as System Dynamics (SD), Dynamic Systems (DS) at very high and aggregate level, or Discrete Event Simulation (DES) at very low and disaggregated level. Agent Based Modelling (ABM) approach may potentially address such issues in a more effective way because it exploits the strengths of both aggregated and disaggregated models, while minimizing the drawbacks. The purpose of this paper is to present a self-developed multi-agent based framework as a basis for sustainable manufacturing modelling, simulation and analysis. A literature review on agent based modelling applied to sustainable manufacturing issues is reported to justify choices adopted in the developed tool. Then an illustrative case of a semi-automated food production line is described with the aim of evaluating the self-developed framework through some sustainability and productivity KPIs, and showing easiness and adaptability. The complete agent based simulator and the interaction sequence are reported and validated by an experimental campaign.

SO ENERGY, INFORMATION, FEEDBACK, ADAPTATION, AND SELF-ORGANIZATION: THE
   FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF LIFE AND SOCIETY
SE Intelligent Systems Control and Automation Science and Engineering
AB The aim of this chapter is to demonstrate the role of adaptation and self-organization in life and society. The range of adaptation is very wide and includes, among others, animal physiology adaptation, immigrant adaptation, animal fertility adaptation, emotional adaptation, adaptation to stress, etc. Self-organization is an intrinsic process taking place in both biological and societal systems. In both cases, the rules of self-organization are determined on the basis of local information only, without information from a global level. Examples of self-organizing biological systems or patterns include a raiding column of army ants, a termite mound, pigmentation patterns on shells, etc. This chapter illustrates the presence of adaptation and self-organization through a number of representative examples, namely: adaptation of animals, adaptation of ecosystems, adaptation of immune systems, adaptation of socio-ecological and general societal systems, self-organization of knowledge management, and self-organization of technological and man-made systems (traffic lights control, WWW, multiagent robotic systems, bio-inspired systems). The above examples demonstrate clearly that adaptation and self-organization are fundamental processes for the survival of living organisms and societies, and the optimal operation of hard and soft man-made systems.

TI The Complexity of the Homeopathic Healing Response Part 1: The Role of
   the Body as a Complex Adaptive System in Simillimum-Initiated Recovery
   from Disease
SO HOMEOPATHY
AB Background The concepts of complex systems science enhance the understanding of how people develop and recover from disease. Living systems (human beings, animals, and plants) are self-organizing complex adaptive systems (CAS): that is, interconnected networks. CAS maintain life by initiating and carrying out non-linear dynamical changes to optimize survival fitness and function in the context of an ever-changing environment.
   Aims In Part 1 of this two-part paper, we relate concepts from complex systems science to homeopathic healing. The systemic changes of homeopathic healing involve adaptive patterns of responses to salient signals (similia) for reversing disease patterns and generating emergent multi-symptom healing over time.
   Methods and Results This narrative review relates homeopathic clinical practice theory to complex systems and network research. Homeopathic medicines communicate individually salient environmental information to the organism, with effects that are multi-system and indirect. The body's defense mechanisms recognize the self-similar information that the correctly chosen simillimum medicine at low dose conveys as a weak external/internal environmental stressor or danger signal (hormetin) to mobilize neural and cellular defenses. The body networks then use endogenous cell to cell signaling and amplify the small magnitude signal information. The results are disproportionately large: that is, non-linear, adaptive, modifications across the inter-connected self-organized biological networks/sub-systems of the body. CAS amplification mechanisms for small or weak signals include stochastic resonance, time-dependent sensitization, and hormesis.
   Conclusions The body as a complex system has the capacity for self-organization, emergence and self-similarity over global (overall health and wellbeing) and local (organ) levels of organization. These features are key for future research on the systemic healing that evolves over time during individualized homeopathic treatment.

TI From bouncing back, to nurturing emergence: reframing the concept of
   resilience in health systems strengthening
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
AB Recent health system shocks such as the Ebola disease outbreak have focused global health attention on the notion of resilient health systems. In this commentary, we reflect on the current framing of the concept of resilience in health systems discourse and propose a reframing. Specifically, we propose that: (1) in addition to sudden shocks, health systems face the ongoing strain of multiple factors. Health systems need the capacity to continue to deliver services of good quality and respond effectively to wider health challenges. We call this capacity everyday resilience; (2) health system resilience entails more than bouncing back from shock. In complex adaptive systems (CAS), resilience emerges from a combination of absorptive, adaptive and transformative strategies; (3) nurturing the resilience of health systems requires understanding health systems as comprising not only hardware elements (such as finances and infrastructure), but also software elements (such as leadership capacity, power relations, values and appropriate organizational culture). We also reflect on current criticisms of the concept of resilient health systems, such as that it assumes that systems are apolitical, ignoring actor agency, promoting inaction, and requiring that we accept and embrace vulnerability, rather than strive for stronger and more responsive systems. We observe that these criticisms are warranted to the extent that they refer to notions of resilience that are mismatched with the reality of health systems as CAS. We argue that the observed weaknesses of resilience thinking can be addressed by reframing and applying a resilience lens that is better suited to the attributes of health systems as CAS.

TI Food Security and Nutrition as the Neglected Missing Links in Cultural
   Evolution: The Role of the Sociotype
SO RAMBAM MAIMONIDES MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB Food security and nutrition were major drivers of cultural evolution by enabling sociotypic development and communal living after the Neolithic agricultural revolution some 12,000 years ago. The sociotype unites concepts from the sciences and the humanities; in concert with the genotype it determines an individual's phenotype (observable traits and behavior), and together they advance societal culture. As such, the sociotype relates to an individual's dynamic interactions with the surrounding social environment throughout life and comprises three domains: the Individual, Relationships, and Context. Nutrition affects each domain, respectively, by ensuring the following dimensions of food security: utilization (metabolic fuel and health); accessibility (physical and economic); and availability (the right to nutritious food for all citizens). The sociotype is influenced by multiple factors, including diet-gene interactions, allostasis, microbiota, oxytocin, and culturally through mate selection, family bonds, social communication, political ideologies, and values. Food security, sociotypes, and culture form a complex adaptive system to enable coping with the circumstances of life in health and disease, to achieve sustainable development, and to eradicate hunger. The current geopolitical unrest highlights the absolutely critical role of this system for global security, yet many challenges remain in implementing this paradigm for society. Therefore, sustainable food security must be considered a fundamental human right and responsibility for safeguarding the survival and progress of the sociotypes of humankind (Homo culturus) worldwide.

TI UNIFYING THE ROLE OF IT IN HYPERTURBULENCE AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE VIA
   A MULTILEVEL PERSPECTIVE OF IS STRATEGY
SO MIS QUARTERLY
AB While information technology (IT) serves as a new source of sustainable competitive advantage for firms, it also induces hyperturbulent environments (or hyperturbulence) that erode that sustainable competitive advantage. In this paper, we posit that these contradictions might be due to cross-level nonlinear causality between firm-level IT-based strategic actions and collective-level IT-induced hyperturbulence. We develop a multilevel perspective of IS strategy for theorizing this causality, and unifying novel with established research. Complex adaptive systems theory is employed as the overarching framework for its strength in formalizing cross-level nonlinear causal paths. Using literature-based theorization and agent-based modeling, we establish two bottom-up nonlinear causal paths by which IT drives hyperturbulence: IT can act as an external force (i.e., component IT innovation) to locally instigate firm strategic actions that aggregate to temporary hyperturbulence or as an internal force (i.e., architectural IT innovation) to drive pervasive firm strategic interactions that aggregate to persistent hyperturbulence. Each causal path produces varied amounts of reducible and irreducible uncertainties and thereby renders a top-down nonlinear effect that reshapes the opportunity for IT to contribute to competitive advantage. This multilevel theorization paves the way for new, IS-specific theory regarding IT's unique role in inducing nonlinear dynamics and in affording new business strategies in today's competitive environments.

TI Coevolving Systems and the Organization of Agile Software Development
SO INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH
AB Despite the popularity of agile methods in software development and increasing adoption by organizations there is debate about what agility is and how it is achieved. The debate suffers from a lack of understanding of agile concepts and how agile software development is practiced. This paper develops a framework for the organization of agile software development that identifies enablers and inhibitors of agility and the emergent capabilities of agile teams. The work is grounded in complex adaptive systems (CAS) and draws on three principles of coevolving systems: match coevolutionary change rate, maximize self-organizing, and synchronize exploitation and exploration. These principles are used to study the processes of two software development teams, one a team using eXtreme Programming (XP) and the other a team using a more traditional, waterfall-based development cycle. From the cases a framework for the organization of agile software development is developed. Time pacing, self-management with discipline and routinization of exploration are among the agile enablers found in the cases studies while event pacing, centralized management, and lack of resources allocated to exploration are found to be inhibitors to agility. Emergent capabilities of agile teams that are identified from the research include coevolution of business value, sustainable working with rhythm, sharing and team learning, and collective mindfulness.

TI Marine fisheries and future ocean conflict
SO FISH AND FISHERIES
AB Conflict over marine fishery resources is a growing security concern. Experts expect that global changes in our climate, food systems and oceans may spark or exacerbate resource conflicts. An initial scan of 803 relevant papers and subsequent intensive review of 31 fisheries conflict studies, focused on subnational and international conflicts, suggests that four substantial scientific gaps need addressing to improve our understanding of the nature and drivers of fisheries conflict. First, fisheries conflict and levels of conflict intensity are not precisely defined. Second, complex adaptive systems thinking is underutilized but has the potential to produce more realistic causal models of fishery conflict. Third, comparative large-scale data and suitably integrative methodologies are lacking, underscoring the need for a standardized and comparable database of fisheries conflict cases to aid extrapolation beyond single case-studies. Fourth, there is room for a more widespread application of higher order concepts and associated terminology. Importantly, the four gaps highlight the homogenized nature of current methodological and theoretical approaches to understanding fishery conflict, which potentially presents us with an oversimplified understanding of these conflicts. A more nuanced understanding of the complex and dynamic nature of fishery conflict and its causes is not only scientifically critical, but increasingly relevant for policymakers and practitioners in this turbulent world.

TI Tree species composition and richness along altitudinal gradients as a
   tool for conservation decisions: the case of Atlantic semideciduous
   forest
SO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB Altitude is one of the major environmental variables influencing the distribution of tree taxa around the world, and can be a useful parameter for the development of conservation strategies. Our objectives were to obtain an overview of the conservation status of taxa from the Atlantic semideciduous seasonal forests of southeastern Brazil and check, among the floristically consistent altitudinal zones, which had the largest number of endemic, threatened and indicator species. To accomplish this, we used species occurrence and geo-climatic data from the 'NeoTropTree' database. First, we checked which zones were floristically consistent using an ordination method (non-metric multidimensional scaling, NMS) followed by an analysis of variance. Then, we conducted an indicator species analysis, estimated species richness, calculated the taxonomic distinctness index for all zones and evaluated important aspects for conservation, such as endemism and threat of extinction. Taxa richness, and number of endemic and threatened species decreased with increasing altitude, while the amount of indicator species for each zone increased with altitudinal elevation. These variations related to the altitudinal gradient should be considered when developing conservation strategies. We also should prioritise the conservation of the entire gradient and, whenever possible, include endemic and endangered species in forest recovery programs.

TI Systems thinking and complexity: considerations for health promoting
   schools
SO HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL
AB The health promoting schools concept reflects a comprehensive and integrated philosophy to improving student and personnel health and well-being. Conceptualized as a configuration of interacting, interdependent parts connected through a web of relationships that form a whole greater than the sum of its parts, school health promotion initiatives often target several levels (e.g. individual, professional, procedural and policy) simultaneously. Health promoting initiatives, such as those operationalized under the whole school approach, include several interconnected components that are coordinated to improve health outcomes in complex settings. These complex systems interventions are embedded in intricate arrangements of physical, biological, ecological, social, political and organizational relationships. Systems thinking and characteristics of complex adaptive systems are introduced in this article to provide a perspective that emphasizes the patterns of inter-relationships associated with the nonlinear, dynamic and adaptive nature of complex hierarchical systems. Four systems thinking areas: knowledge, networks, models and organizing are explored as a means to further manage the complex nature of the development and sustainability of health promoting schools. Applying systems thinking and insights about complex adaptive systems can illuminate how to address challenges found in settings with both complicated (i.e. multi-level and multisite) and complex aspects (i.e. synergistic processes and emergent outcomes).

Traditional supply chains must change to adaptive supply networks. It is very important to deeply investigate the characters of adaptive supply networks including modelling, analysis and optimization. A modelling framework for adaptive supply networks is proposed based on the complex adaptive system theory. The supply chain dynamic configuration problem is studied under this framework. Simulation results show the validity of the method.

TI Melting of Himalayan glaciers and planetary health
SO CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB The association of melting Himalayan glaciers and planetary health is complex. Climate change has accelerated the melting of Himalayan glaciers, with profound impacts on the planetary health realms of the Himalayan region and that now threaten hundreds of millions of people. Using a complex adaptive systems framework based on a systematic literature review, this complexity has been captured and mapped in nine subsystem categories: ecological services, disaster, water security, food security, energy security, livelihood and culture, migration, conflict and public health. This mapping helps to explain linkages between melting glaciers and associated planetary health issues, which can be helpful in planning for better planetary health.

TI Multiscale modeling in smart cities: A survey on applications, current
   trends, and challenges
SO SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB A smart city model views the city as a complex adaptive system consisting of services, resources, and citizens that learn through interaction and change in both the spatial and temporal domains. The characteristics of dynamic evolution and complexity are key issues for megacity planners and require a new systematic and modeling approach. Multiscale models involved in smart cities and megacities have recently become a popular topic because they can understand complex adaptive systems and efficiently solve complex problems at multiple scales (i.e., micro, meso, and macro) to improve system efficiency and reduce computational complexity and cost. However, there are numerous opportunities to improve this interdisciplinary field considering the lack of applicability of the multiscale modeling approach in megacities and smart cities, and the potential of multiscale modeling in various complex systems within smart cities. Therefore, a review that summarizes the state-of-art researches and opens opportunities around the theme of multiscale modeling participating in megacities and smart cities is warranted. This study, therefore, provides a comprehensive review covering the introduction of megacities, their current challenges, and their emergence in smart cities. Then, the introduction of the smart city along with its characteristics and different generations is disclosed. Moreover, we shed light on multiscale modeling, its categories (i.e., sequential multiscale modeling and concurrent multiscale modeling), and the need for multiscale modeling in megacities and smart cities along with its emerging applications. Finally, based on a literature review, the study highlights the current challenges and future directions related to multiscale modeling in megacities and smart cities, which provide a roadmap for the optimized operation of megacities and smart city systems.

TI A problem structuring method for ecosystem-based management: The DPSIR
   modelling process
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
AB The purpose of this paper is to learn from Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) theory to inform the development of Problem Structuring Methods (PSMs) both in general and in the specific context of marine management. The focus on marine management is important because it is concerned with a CAS (formed through the interconnection between natural systems, designed systems and social systems) which exemplifies their particularly 'wicked' nature. Recognition of this compels us to take seriously the need to develop tools for knowledge elicitation and structuring which meet the demands of CAS. In marine management, chief among those tools is the DPSIR (Drivers - Pressures - State Changes - Impacts Responses) model and, although widely applied, the extent to which it is appropriate for dealing with the demands of a CAS is questionable. Such questioning is particularly pertinent in the context of the marine environment where there is a need to not only recognise a broad range of stakeholders (a question of boundary critique) but also to manage competing knowledge (economic, local and scientific) and value claims. Hence this paper emphasises how a CAS perspective might add impetus to the development of a critical perspective on DPSIR and PSM theory and practice to promote a more systemic view of decision-making and policy development.

TI Implementing innovative models of dementia care: The Healthy Aging Brain
   Center
SO AGING & MENTAL HEALTH
AB Background: Recent randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of the collaborative dementia care model targeting both the patients suffering from dementia and their informal caregivers. Objective: To implement a sustainable collaborative dementia care program in a public health care system in Indianapolis. Methods: We used the framework of Complex Adaptive System and the tool of the Reflective Adaptive Process to translate the results of the dementia care trial into the Healthy Aging Brain Center (HABC). Results: Within its first year of operation, the HABC delivered 528 visits to serve 208 patients and 176 informal caregivers. The mean age of HABC patients was 73.8 (standard deviation, SD 9.5), 40% were African-Americans, 42% had less than high school education, 14% had normal cognitive status, 39% received a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, and 46% were diagnosed with dementia. Within 12 months of the initial HABC visit, 28% of patients had at least one visit to an emergency room (ER) and 14% were hospitalized with a mean length of stay of five days. The rate of a one-week ER revisit was 14% and the 30-day rehospitalization rate was 11%. Only 5% of HABC patients received an order for neuroleptics and only 16% had simultaneous orders for both definite anticholinergic and anti-dementia drugs. Conclusion: The tools of 'implementation science' can be utilized to translate a health care delivery model developed in the research laboratory to a practical, operational, health care delivery program.

TI Conceptualising Long-Term Socio-ecological Research (LTSER): Integrating
   the Social Dimension
SO LONG-TERM ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH: BETWEEN THEORY AND APPLICATION
AB In order to support the emerging network of long-term ecological research (LTER) sites across Europe, the European Union has launched ALTER-Net, a network aiming at lasting integration of long-term socio-economic, ecological and biodiversity research. Due to its high population density and long history of human habitation, however, Europe's ecosystems are generally intensively used. Social and natural drivers are so inextricably intertwined that the notion of 'socio-ecological' systems is appropriate. Traditional natural science-based approaches are insufficient to understand these integrated systems, as they cannot adequately capture their relevant socioeconomic dimensions. This is particularly relevant because the EU launched ALTER-Net has an explicit aim to support sustainability, a goal that requires integration of socio-economic and ecological dimensions. As such, LTER is challenged to significantly expand its focus from ecological to socio-ecological systems, thus transforming itself from LTER to long-term socio-ecological research or LTSER. In order to support this transformation, this chapter explores several approaches for conceptualising socio-economic dimensions of LTSER. It discusses how the socioeconomic metabolism approach can be combined with theories of complex adaptive systems to generate heuristic models of society nature interaction which can then be used to integrate concepts from the social sciences. In particular, the chapter discusses possible contributions from the fields of ecological anthropology and ecological economics and shows how participatory approaches can be integrated with innovative agent-based modelling concepts to arrive at an integrated representation of socio-ecological systems that can help to support local communities to move towards sustainability.

TI Complex Adaptive Modeling Framework for Evaluating Adaptive Demand
   Management for Urban Water Resources Sustainability
SO JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB New water resources management methodologies are needed to address increasing demands and future uncertainty for urban water resources. Adaptive water demand management strategies provide an approach to improve the efficiency of water system operations and meet water demands by adapting flexibility to increasing stresses, such as droughts. This study simulates adaptive water demand management through the development of a complex adaptive system modeling framework, which couples cellular automata modeling, agentbased modeling, and hydrologic modeling to simulate land-use change, consumer behaviors, management decisions, the rainfall-runoff process, and reservoir storage. The model is applied to simulate the effect of demand management strategies on reductions in municipal water demands and on the sustained storage in a surface water supply reservoir. Historic and projected climate change hydroclimatic time series are used to assess the effectiveness of domestic water restrictions, including outdoor watering restrictions, a rainwater harvesting rebate program, and a high-density land-use change policy. Strategies are adaptively implemented based on the amount of water storage available. The framework is applied to evaluate strategies for the Arlington, Texas, metropolitan area that historically suffers from severe droughts. The framework provides an approach to evaluate a combination of multiple strategies for effectively managing the increasing stresses caused by urbanization, population growth, and climate change. Results demonstrate that adaptive demand management strategies that respond to water shortages result in long-term per capita demand reductions. For climate projections that forecast severe water shortages, development density strategies are more effective than rainwater harvesting strategies, and a combination of strategies can reduce the need for interbasin transfers and maintain reservoir volumes.

SO CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB Collaborative partnerships exist in the context of complex institutional systems that feature multiple institutions and actors interacting in the context of interconnected collective-action problems within ecosystems. How collaborative partnerships contribute to the overall capacity of complex institutional systems to sustainability govern natural resources remains an open question. This article reviews several theoretical approaches for studying complex institutional systems, and discusses how collaborative partnerships would be viewed from these perspectives. The approaches covered include neo-institutional economics, polycentric governance, complex adaptive systems, and evolutionary models of institutional change. The conclusion calls for synthetic theoretical frameworks that integrate many of these ideas, and identifies the research on social-ecological systems as a promising direction.

While systems analyses largely targeting well-defined, engineered systems have been used to help SWM agencies in industrialized countries since the 1960s, collection and removal dominate the SWM sector in developing countries. This review contrasts the history and current paradigms of SWM practices and policies in industrialized countries with the current challenges and complexities faced in developing country SWM. In industrialized countries, public health, environment, resource scarcity, climate change, and public awareness and participation have acted as SWM drivers towards the current paradigm of integrated SWM. However, urbanization, inequality, and economic growth; cultural and socio-economic aspects; policy, governance, and institutional issues; and international influences have complicated SWM in developing countries. This has limited the applicability of approaches that were successful along the SWM development trajectories of industrialized countries. This review demonstrates the importance of founding new SWM approaches for developing country contexts in post-normal science and complex, adaptive systems thinking. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI CANCER IS THE CHAOTIC SEARCH FOR ADAPTATION TO PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN
   ENVIRONMENTS
SO THEORETICAL BIOLOGY FORUM
AB Cancer may be the most important global public health problem. The effort of understanding carcinogenesis has been accelerating over the last years on account of its high incidence and impact on the lives of individuals' affected. There are a number of theories of carcinogenesis and these theories may be used to justify various alternative cancer treatments. The small variations in cancer mortality observed during the previous years indicate that the clinical applications of these theories have been very limited.
   In this article, we tried to explain carcinogenesis based on complex adaptive system (CAS) theory.

TI Exploring the complex pathway of the primary health care response to
   intimate partner violence in New Zealand
SO HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS
AB BackgroundIntegrating sustainable responses to intimate partner violence in health care is a persistent and complex problem internationally. New Zealand holds a leading role, having established national health system infrastructure for responding to intimate partner violence within hospital and selected community settings. However, resources for, and engagement with, the primary health care sector has been limited. The present study focuses on what affects a sustainable response to intimate partner violence within New Zealand primary health care settings.MethodsUtilising complexity theory, we reconceptualised a sustainable primary health care response to intimate partner violence as a complex adaptive system. To explore interactions between agents, we analysed the function(s) of key policy, strategy, guideline and evaluation documents informing intimate partner violence responsiveness in health care. We chronologically threaded these documents together by their function(s) to show how discourse influencing intimate partner violence responsiveness emerges from agent interactions.ResultsThis paper presents a complexity informed implementation narrative of the New Zealand health system response to intimate partner violence across the last two decades, focused on the participation of the primary health care sector. We demonstrate how competing discourses have contributed to system gaps and unintended consequences over time. Our findings consider implications for a sustainable response to intimate partner violence in primary health care and call attention to system interactions that challenge a whole health system approach in New Zealand.ConclusionsUse of complexity theory facilitates an innovative perspective of a persistent and complex problem. Given the complexity of the problem and New Zealand's leadership, sharing the lessons learnt is critical for the international community involved in developing health care system approaches to intimate partner violence.

TI Do tourism clusters contribute to low-carbon destinations? The spillover
   effect of tourism agglomerations on urban residential CO2 emissions
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB A burgeoning literature has investigated the relationship between tourism and regional CO2 emissions. However, the results are equivocal. Some scholars find that tourism induces more emissions, while others find that tourism benefits emission mitigation. Previous research suffers three deficiencies: (1) the CO2 emissions induced by tourism beyond the tourism sectors are neglected; (2) the role of tourism agglomerations in sustainable desti-nation development is underrated; (3) the tripartite mechanism of tourism agglomerations, household income, and urban direct residential CO2 emissions (DRCEs) remains to be determined. Based on the theories of complex adaptive system and an empirical study of 30 provinces in China, we examine the relationship between the tripartite roles via multiple spatial econometric models. The results disclose that tourism agglomerations have dual effects on urban DRCEs and an inverted U-shaped effect on household income. The growth of tourism agglomerations has generally promoted urban DRCEs in many provinces of mainland China during the last fourteen years because its indirect effect (positive) outweighs the direct effect (negative). However, tourism agglomerations are feasible for low-carbon destinations once the emission-income decoupling happens. This study contributes to low-carbon destination management by presenting a more holistic image of the social-economic-environmental impacts of tourism agglomerations.

TI Unravelling the Flemish Mobility Orgware: the transition towards a
   sustainable mobility from an actor-network perspective
SO EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES
AB Large mobility projects in Flanders end up in wicked problems. In the quest for efficient and sustainable mobility, the Flemish government becomes entangled in endless struggles between ever more involved and changing stake- and shareholders. The role and effectiveness of the government is exposed to rising challenges from inside and outside. Since most new projects focus on infrastructural (hardware) or (socio-)technical innovations in the use of mobile means (software), innovations within the organizational structure of mobility (orgware') have mostly remained untouched. We address this hiatus by approaching mobility projects as complex adaptive systems, comprising various, dynamic actor-networks. Following actor-networks through space and time is necessary to obtain an idea of the upcoming, and leading associations of various mobility actors, that are decisive for the success, failure and efficiency of mobility projects. To grasp these complex challenges, one needs to unravel the orgware and identify the potentials of the mobility systems regarding the travel, transport and traffic mobility arenas. We draw upon a combination of actor-network theory and institutional theory insights applied to conceptual mobility frameworks. The resulting research framework for the Flemish mobility orgware will be first applied to the Oosterweel link case in Antwerp.

TI Adaptive Allocation Modeling for a Complex System of Regional Water and
   Land Resources Based on Information Entropy and its Application
SO WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
AB Currently, water and land resources are treated as separate resources in allocation optimization for complex systems of water and land resources, which may have negative impacts on these water-land resource systems. In our study, an adaptive allocation model was established for a complex system of regional water and land resources using complex adaptive systems theory. The users of water and land resources were treated as adaptive agents, and the competition and synergy among various agents toward water and land resources were used as the driving forces for the evolution of the model. The model was accurately solved using a nested genetic algorithm to achieve the optimal joint allocation of regional water and land resources. A case study was conducted in the city of Kiamusze in Heilongjiang Province, and the results indicated that the evolution of the model was consistent with the actual behaviors of adaptive agents. Moreover, after the implementation of the optimized allocation results, the economic benefits in the study area were expected to increase by 3.34 %, and the comprehensive user satisfaction index regarding water increased from 0.61 to 0.73; moreover, the ecological footprint of the ecological sector increased by 5.6 %. Our results provide important guidance for achieving the sustainable use of regional water and land resources.

TI Modelling shifts between mono- and multifunctional farming systems: the
   importance of social and economic drivers
SO LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB In Europe, policy measures are starting to emerge that promote multifunctional farming systems and delivery of ecosystem services besides food production. Effectiveness of these policy instruments have to deal with ecological, economic and social complexities and with complexities in individual decisions of local actors leading to system shifts.
   The objective of this paper is to discover the most important social and/or economic drivers that cause farm systems to shift between a monofunctional (providing food) and a multifunctional state (providing food and natural pest regulation).
   Using a cellular automata model, we simulated decisions of individual farmers to shift between a mono-and multifunctional state through time, based on their behaviour type and on financial and social consequences. Collaboration of multifunctional farmers at a landscape scale is a precondition to provide a reliable level of natural pest regulation.
   Costs of applying green infrastructure was an important driver for the size and the conversion rate of shifts between mono-and multifunctional farming systems. Shifts towards multifunctional farming were enhanced by a higher motivation of farmers to produce sustainably, while shifts (back) to a monofunctional state was enhanced by a low social cohesion between multifunctional farmers.
   These results suggest that in order to develop a multifunctional farming system, individual farmers should act counterintuitively to their conventional farming environment. To maintain a multifunctional farming system, social cohesion between multifunctional farmers is most relevant. Financial aspects are important in both shifts.

TI Where do people vulnerable to deforestation live? Triaging forest
   conservation interventions for sustainable non-timber forest products
SO LAND USE POLICY
AB Rural households in developing countries often depend on non-timber forest products (NTFPs), including foods, traditional medicines, fuelwood, fodder, and construction and craft materials such as bamboo and rattan, for their livelihoods, but the forests that supply NTFPs are subject to competition from other land uses. NTFP collectors who are unable to sustain their livelihoods because of changes caused in the NTFP collection environment by deforestation and degradation may even convert surrounding forests to agricultural land to compensate for their reduced incomes. This feedback loop of deforestation and degradation can create further conflicts among natural resource users and undermine long-term development goals. Here, we aimed to advance the discussion of forest conservation interventions in protected areas in developing countries-particularly the discussion of patrolling strategies in and around existing wildlife sanctuaries-by presenting a new approach that uses the case of NTFP collection and a human geography perspective. We used a structured questionnaire composed of closed questions to measure the awareness of village households of the impacts of deforestation and/or illegal extraction of trees on NTFP collection over a short period of time (2014-2016) near the Prey Long Wildlife Sanctuary in the eastern part of the Kampong Thom Province, Cambodia. Our survey was based on the conceptual framework of Bohensky and Lynam (Ecol. Soc. 10, 11; 2005) that people in complex adaptive systems change their behaviour after becoming aware of the impact or consequences of a change. The probability of a village having an affected household (i.e., a household that was aware of the impact) was predicted by using generalized linear mixed models. By using identified geospatial indicators of environmental and socioeconomic aspects, including distance between the village and the wildlife sanctuary, size of deforested area per capita in 2014-2016 within a 10-km radius of the village and proportion of households in the village that collect NTFPs for cash income, we predicted the spatial distribution of villages with affected NTFP-collecting households. Priority areas for NTFP collection were then mapped with reference to the identified indicators. By using these results, we present an approach to breaking the deforestation feedback loop by identifying priority areas for patrolling and other forest conservation interventions in the wildlife sanctuary.

TI Making technological innovation work for sustainable development
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB This paper presents insights and action proposals to better harness technological innovation for sustainable development. We begin with three key insights from scholarship and practice. First, technological innovation processes do not follow a set sequence but rather emerge from complex adaptive systems involving many actors and institutions operating simultaneously from local to global scales. Barriers arise at all stages of innovation, from the invention of a technology through its selection, production, adaptation, adoption, and retirement. Second, learning from past efforts to mobilize innovation for sustainable development can be greatly improved through structured cross-sectoral comparisons that recognize the socio-technical nature of innovation systems. Third, current institutions (rules, norms, and incentives) shaping technological innovation are often not aligned toward the goals of sustainable development because impoverished, marginalized, and unborn populations too often lack the economic and political power to shape innovation systems to meet their needs. However, these institutions can be reformed, and many actors have the power to do so through research, advocacy, training, convening, policymaking, and financing. We conclude with three practiceoriented recommendations to further realize the potential of innovation for sustainable development: (i) channels for regularized learning across domains of practice should be established; (ii) measures that systematically take into account the interests of underserved populations throughout the innovation process should be developed; and (iii) institutions should be reformed to reorient innovation systems toward sustainable development and ensure that all innovation stages and scales are considered at the outset.

TI Seven tools for creating adaptive policies
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB Experience demonstrates that policies crafted to operate within a certain range of conditions are often faced with unexpected challenges outside of that range. The result is that many policies have unintended impacts and do not accomplish their goals. Adaptive policies are designed to function more effectively in complex, dynamic, and uncertain conditions. Based on over a dozen case studies on public policies relating to agriculture and water resources management in Canada and India, we conclude that there are seven tools policymakers should follow to create adaptive policies. Adaptive policies anticipate and plan for the array of conditions that lie ahead: (#1) using integrated and forward-looking analysis; (#2) monitoring key performance indicators to trigger built-in policy adjustments; (#3) undertaking formal policy review and continuous learning; and (#4) using multi-stakeholder deliberation. But not all situations can be anticipated. Unknown unknowns and deep uncertainty will always be part of policymaking. Adaptive policies are able to navigate toward successful outcomes in settings that cannot be anticipated in advance. This can be done by working in concert with certain characteristics of complex adaptive systems and thereby facilitating autonomous actions among stakeholders on the ground. To a degree, adaptive policy tools #3 and #4 can be used toward this purpose, but most directly, such autonomous tools include: (#5) enabling self-organization and social networking; (#6) decentralizing decisionmaking to the lowest and most effective jurisdictional level; and (#7) promoting variation in policy responses. This paper elaborates on these seven tools as a pragmatic guide for policymakers who find themselves working in highly complex, dynamic, and uncertain settings. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

TI Quantifying the relationship of resilience and eco-efficiency in complex
   adaptive energy systems
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB The concepts of efficiency and resilience are important in complex adaptive systems. Efficiency and resilience have been compared in complex systems, but the data and materials have mainly been derived from natural ecosystems. The actual environmental impacts of this comparison with data and materials from human economic systems is an important research theme for ecological economics. Furthermore, efficiency defined as eco-efficiency is missing from resilience research. This paper studies resilience and eco-efficiency in societal energy systems. Eco-efficiency is defined as energy produced per CO2 emissions and incineration ash generated. For resilience, we use the diversity of fuel types in energy systems, in particular the evenness of fuels in each fuel type category. Empirical materials from the district heating energy system of Southern Lapland in Finland encompassing six municipalities are presented. What if-scenarios show that, in general, diversity and eco-efficiency seem to support each other, i.e., there is a correlation. This is different from food web studies in ecology where the material flows are primarily biomass. In human energy systems, lithosphere derived materials are used alongside biomass, in our case study fossil coal, oil as well as peat, which is a semi-fossil fuel. The difference might also be explained due to the role of technology in human economic systems. For policy and business strategy implications, it is important to study the case system with two interdependent system boundaries; the subsystem level of the capital city Rovaniemi and the larger six municipality regional system to which Rovaniemi belongs. Policy planning and business strategy development would gain if the actors involved would approach the system with enlarged spatial and temporal system boundaries. Long-term strategic thinking and inter-municipality cooperation may help the region to mitigate the risks related to the development of the district heating energy system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI What Is Resilience and How Can It Be Nurtured? A Systematic Review of
   Empirical Literature on Organizational Resilience
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT
AB Background: Recent health system shocks such as the Ebola outbreak of 2014-2016 and the global financial crisis of 2008 have generated global health interest in the concept of resilience. The concept is however not new, and has been applied to other sectors for a longer period of time. We conducted a review of empirical literature from both the health and other sectors to synthesize evidence on organizational resilience.
   Methods: We systematically searched for literature in PubMed, Econlit, EBSCOHOST databases, google, and Google Scholar and manually searched the reference lists of selected papers. We identified 34 papers that met our inclusion criteria. We analysed data from the selected papers by thematic review.
   Results: Resilience was generally taken to mean a system's ability to continue to meet its objectives in the face of challenges. The concepts of resilience that were used in the selected papers emphasized not just a system's capacity to withstand shocks, but also to adapt and transform. The resilience of organizations was influenced by the following factors: Material resources, preparedness and planning, information management, collateral pathways and redundancy, governance processes, leadership practices, organizational culture, human capital, social networks and collaboration.
   Conclusion: A common theme across the selected papers is the recognition of resilience as an emergent property of complex adaptive systems. Resilience is both a function of planning for and preparing for future crisis (planned resilience), and adapting to chronic stresses and acute shocks (adaptive resilience). Beyond resilience to acute shocks, the resilience of health systems to routine and chronic stress (everyday resilience) is also key.

TI A constructive crisis: complex system adaptability during the COVID-19
   pandemic
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL ANALYSIS
AB PurposeThis study aims to investigate the response by a multi-campus private higher education provider to a major crisis. This study examined what elements of complex adaptive systems (CAS) were activated and/or developed within the organization during the onset of the COVID-19 global pandemic, through a retrospective analysis of organizational responses. Design/methodology/approachA retrospective qualitative approach has been used. The theory of CAS has been used as the theoretical lens to explore the organizational context, responses and behaviours during the first year of the COVID-19 crisis. A series of semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 senior leaders across the major functions of the organization spread over multiple campuses. FindingsFindings point to coverage of the main CAS characteristics in the organizational responses to the pandemic, however, in varying degrees. There was strong evidence for the application of guiding principles, for self-organizing, for micro-diversity coupled with independent actors and new generative relationships, all brought about by the chaos the pandemic generated. This study concludes that the global pandemic presented this organization with the impetus for rapid and agile responses to what ultimately has become a constructive crisis, paving the way for key elements of CAS theory to be enacted. This study recommend embedding the conscious creation of an adaptive space within ongoing strategic organizational transformation initiatives. Originality/valueThere is scant literature on CAS as applied to crises from organizations in the higher education sector and notably from outside of the health/medical fields. As a result, this study offers a novel and original approach to applying CAS theory during a major crisis. In addition to the findings above, this study also found an emergent characteristic, that of agility, which could be further tested as a potential theoretical addition to CAS theory.

TI SUSTAINABILITY-FOCUSED KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IN A GLOBAL ENTERPRISE
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Large industrial companies pursuing a strategy of 'green' management practices are required to balance competing interests among stakeholders while also managing the complex impact of their operations on the environment. We conducted a field study of the specific information challenges facing a global Fortune 150 industrial enterprise and the extent to which those challenges impact its sustainability efforts. We present our analysis of these challenges within the broader context of a distributed knowledge management (KM) framework based on the existing Belief-Action-Outcome (BAO) model [39] extended through the use of Enterprise Social Networking and Web 2.0. Our framework includes aspects of complex adaptive systems as well as a proposed set of specific technologies that can be deployed within the framework These technologies include business intelligence enabled through mobile devices, tools for collaboration and social networking, and data visualization.

TI A Complex Systems Science Perspective for Whole Systems of Complementary
   and Alternative Medicine Research
SO FORSCHENDE KOMPLEMENTARMEDIZIN
AB Whole systems complementary and alternative medicine (WS-CAM) approaches share a basic worldview that embraces interconnectedness; emergent, non-linear outcomes to treatment that include both local and global changes in the human condition; a contextual view of human beings that are inseparable from and responsive to their environments; and interventions that are complex, synergistic, and interdependent. These fundamental beliefs and principles run counter to the assumptions of reductionism and conventional biomedical research methods that presuppose unidimensional simple causes and thus dismantle and individually test various interventions that comprise only single aspects of the WS-CAM system. This paper will demonstrate the superior fit and practical advantages of using complex adaptive systems (CAS) and related modeling approaches to develop the scientific basis for WS-CAM. Furthermore, the details of these CAS models will be used to provide working hypotheses to explain clinical phenomena such as (a) persistence of changes for weeks to months between treatments and/or after cessation of treatment, (b) nonlocal and whole systems changes resulting from therapy, (c) Hering's law, and (d) healing crises. Finally, complex systems science will be used to offer an alternative perspective on cause, beyond the simple reductionism of mainstream mechanistic ontology and more parsimonious than the historical vitalism of WS-CAM. Rather, complex systems science provides a scientifically rigorous, yet essentially holistic ontological perspective with which to conceptualize and empirically explore the development of disease and illness experiences, as well as experiences of healing and wellness.

TI An Active Inference Model of Collective Intelligence
SO ENTROPY
AB Collective intelligence, an emergent phenomenon in which a composite system of multiple interacting agents performs at levels greater than the sum of its parts, has long compelled research efforts in social and behavioral sciences. To date, however, formal models of collective intelligence have lacked a plausible mathematical description of the relationship between local-scale interactions between autonomous sub-system components (individuals) and global-scale behavior of the composite system (the collective). In this paper we use the Active Inference Formulation (AIF), a framework for explaining the behavior of any non-equilibrium steady state system at any scale, to posit a minimal agent-based model that simulates the relationship between local individual-level interaction and collective intelligence. We explore the effects of providing baseline AIF agents (Model 1) with specific cognitive capabilities: Theory of Mind (Model 2), Goal Alignment (Model 3), and Theory of Mind with Goal Alignment (Model 4). These stepwise transitions in sophistication of cognitive ability are motivated by the types of advancements plausibly required for an AIF agent to persist and flourish in an environment populated by other highly autonomous AIF agents, and have also recently been shown to map naturally to canonical steps in human cognitive ability. Illustrative results show that stepwise cognitive transitions increase system performance by providing complementary mechanisms for alignment between agents' local and global optima. Alignment emerges endogenously from the dynamics of interacting AIF agents themselves, rather than being imposed exogenously by incentives to agents' behaviors (contra existing computational models of collective intelligence) or top-down priors for collective behavior (contra existing multiscale simulations of AIF). These results shed light on the types of generic information-theoretic patterns conducive to collective intelligence in human and other complex adaptive systems.

TI A New Conceptual 'Cylinder' Framework for Sustainable Bioeconomy Systems
   and Their Actors
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS
AB Concepts for sustainable bioeconomy systems are gradually replacing the ones on linear product chains. The reason is that continuously expanding linear chain activities are considered to contribute to climate change, reduced biodiversity, over-exploitation of resources, food insecurity, and the double burden of disease. Are sustainable bioeconomy systems a guarantee for a healthy planet? If yes, why, when, and how? In literature, different sustainability indicators have been presented to shed light on this complicated question. Due to high degrees of complexity and interactions of actors in bioeconomy systems, trade-offs and non-linear outcomes became apparent. This fueled the debates about the normative dimensions of the bioeconomy. In particular, the behavior of actors and the utilization of products do not seem to be harmonized according to the environmental, social, and economic pillars of sustainability. Potential conflicts require a new conceptual framework that is here introduced. It consists of a 'sustainability' cylinder captured between an inner-cylinder, representing order, and an outer-cylinder for chaos, based on the laws of physics and complex adaptive systems. Such a framework permits (bioeconomy) systems to propagate in the sustainability zone only if they follow helical pathways serving as the new norms. Helices are a combination of two sinusoidal patterns. The first represents here the sustainable behavior of interacting actors and the second the balanced usage of resources and products. The latter counteracts current growth discourses. The applicability of the conceptual cylinder framework is positively verified via 9 cases in Europe, which encompass social-organizational and product-technological innovations. -

TI 5 Key Challenges and Solutions for Governing Complex Adaptive (Food)
   Systems
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB There is increasing recognition in academic circles of the importance of adaptive governance for the sustainability of social-ecological systems, but little examination of specific implications for the 34% of land-use where human activities are pervasive but potentially commensurate with functioning ecosystems: agricultural production systems. In this paper, we argue for the need to view food systems and agro-ecosystems as multi-scalar complex adaptive systems and identify five key challenging characteristics of such systems: multi-causality; cumulative impacts; regime shifts; teleconnections and mismatch of scales. These characteristics are necessary features of multi-scalar adaptive systems, and apply equally to social and natural subsystems. We discuss the implications of these characteristics for agricultural production systems and consider how governance can rise to these challenges. We present five case studies that highlight these issues: pollinator declines; payments for ecosystem services; pest control and pesticide resistance; downstream aquatic systems in Tasman Bay, New Zealand; and riparian buffers in Puget Sound, USA. From these case studies we derive recommendations for managing agricultural systems, both specific and general. Ultimately, adaptive governance of agro-ecosystems will likely hinge upon three paradigm shifts: viewing farmers and ranchers not only as food producers but also as land and water managers; seeking not yield maximization but rather resilient management of food ecosystems; and critically, as it transcends the production-system literature, engaging broad audiences not only as consumers but also citizens.

TI Complex Adaptive Systems, soil degradation and land sensitivity to
   desertification: A multivariate assessment of Italian agro-forest
   landscape
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Degradation of soils and sensitivity of land to desertification are intensified in last decades in the Mediterranean region producing heterogeneous spatial patterns determined by the interplay of factors such as climate, land-use changes, and human pressure. The present study hypothesizes that rising levels of soil degradation and land sensitivity to desertification are reflected into increasingly complex (and non-linear) relationships between environmental and socioeconomic variables. To verify this hypothesis, the Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) framework was used to explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of eleven indicators derived from a standard assessment of soil degradation and land sensitivity to desertification in Italy. Indicators were made available on a detailed spatial scale (773 agricultural districts) for various years (1960, 1990, 2000 and 2010) and analyzed through a multidimensional exploratory data analysis. Our results indicate that the number of significant pair-wise correlations observed between indicators increased with the level of soil and land degradation, although with marked differences between northern and southern Italy. 'Fast' and 'slow' factors underlying soil and land degradation, and 'rapidly-evolving' or 'locked' agricultural districts were identified according to the rapidity of change estimated for each of the indicators studied. In southern Italy, 'rapidly-evolving' districts show a high level of soil degradation and land sensitivity to desertification during the whole period of investigation. On the contrary, those districts in northern Italy are those experiencing a moderate soil degradation and land sensitivity to desertification with the highest increase in the level of sensitivity over time. The study framework contributes to the assessment of complex local systems' dynamics in affluent but divided countries. Results may inform thematic strategies for the mitigation of land and soil degradation in the framework of action plans to combat desertification. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Transdisciplinary partnerships for sustainability: an evaluation guide
SO SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
AB Transdisciplinary research, in which academics and actors from outside the academy co-produce knowledge, is an important approach to address urgent sustainability challenges. Indeed, to meet these real-world challenges, governments, universities, development agencies, and civil society organizations have made substantial investments in transdisciplinary partnerships. Yet to date, our understanding of the performance, as well as impacts, of these partnerships for sustainability is limited. Here, we provide a guide to assess the performance and impacts of transdisciplinary partnerships for sustainability. We offer key steps to navigate and examine the partnership process for continuous improvement, and to understand how transdisciplinary partnership is contributing to sustainable futures.

TI Decision theory in sustainable supply chain management: a literature
   review
SO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Purpose - This study aims to aid theory building, the use of decision theory (DT) concepts in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) research is examined.
   Design/methodology/approach - An abductive approach considers two DT concepts, Snowden's Cynefin framework for sense-making and Keeney's value-focussed decision analysis, in a systematic literature review of 160 peer-reviewed papers in English.
   Findings - Around 60 per cent of the papers on decision-making in SSCM come from operational research (OR), which makes explicit use of DT. These are almost all normative and rationalist and focussed on structured decision contexts. Some exceptions seek to address unstructured decision contexts via Complex Adaptive Systems or Soft Systems Methodology. Meanwhile, a second set, around 16 per cent, comes from business ethics and are empirical, behavioural decision research. Although this set does not explicitly refer to DT, the empirical evidence here supports Keeney's value-focussed analysis.
   Research limitations/implications - There is potential for theory building in SSCM using DT, but the research only addresses SSCM research (including corporate responsibility and ethics) and not DT in SCM or wider sustainable development research.
   Practical implications - Use of particular decision analysis methods for SSCM may be improved by better understanding different decision contexts.
   Social implications - The research shows potential synthesis with ethical DT absent from DT and SCM research.
   Originality/value - Empirical behavioural decision analysis for SSCM is considered alongside normative, rational analysis for the first time. Value-focussed DT appears useful for unstructured decision contexts found in SSCM.

TI Modeling initial Neolithic dispersal. The first agricultural groups in
   West Mediterranean
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB In previous research, the SE-NW time-trend in the age of the earliest Neolithic sites across Europe has been treated as a signal of a global-scale process that brought farming/herding economies to the continent. Residual variation from this global time-trend is generally treated as 'noise'. A Complex Adaptive Systems perspective views this empirical record differently. The apparent time-trend is treated as an emergent consequence of the interactions of individuals and group of different scale.
   Here, we examine the dynamics of agricultural dispersals, using the rich body evidence available from the Iberian Peninsula as a case study. We integrate two complementary approaches: (1) creating a high resolution Agent Based Modeling environment to simulate different processes that may have driven the spread of farming; (2) collecting and synthesizing empirical archeological data for the earliest Neolithic settlements that we use to evaluate our models results.
   Our results suggest that, (a) the source of radiocarbon data used to evaluate alternative hypotheses play an important role in the results; and (b) the model scenario that produces de best fit with archeological data implies a dispersal via northwestern and southern routes; a preference for leap-frog movement; an influence of ecological conditions (selecting most favorable agricultural land) and demographic factors (avoiding settled regions).
   This work represents a first attempt at high-resolution bottom-up modeling of this important dynamic in human prehistory. While we recognize that other social and environmental drivers could have also affected the dispersal of agropastoral systems, those considered here include many that have been widely considered important in prior research and so warrant inclusion.

It is argued that because an ACT team operates as a complex adaptive system (CAS), it engages in the organizational processes of "sensemaking" and self-organization, which help to bring order to the actions of team members and sustainability of the intervention itself. Consequently, successful implementation of ACT requires that management technologies Such as meaning-creation and design are used in conjunction with traditional "command and control" technologies of policies, procedures, processes, and structures.

TI Proposal for a model to hierarchize strategic decisions according to,
   criteria of value innovation, sustainability and budgetary constraint
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Organizations need management models, which will enable their executives to develop systemic thinking. In addition, executives should keep in mind that: some decision-making processes should be shared; impose political influence according to their preferences; value innovation strategies may be present; it is essential to consider the environmental, economic and social dimensions of sustainability. In this context, this study describes a model to hierarchize strategic decisions according to criteria innovation value, sustainability and budgetary constraint, developed according to the methodology proposed by Mitroff et al. (1974). In addition to hierarchizing, the model allows identifying the degree of importance of each of the strategic decisions in the performance indicators defined as evaluation criteria and sub-criteria. In the conceptualization phase, the model is influenced by concepts that describe complex adaptive systems. Next, the Analytic Network Process with Benefits, Opportunities, Costs and Risks Analysis and Linear Programming techniques are used in order to define the mathematical structure that operationalizes the model. The use of a hypothetical example demonstrates the capacity of the model proposed in this work to support the decision-making process of an organization in the selection of its decision alternatives. Thus, the model can help the academic and business communities concerned with the progress of sustainable societies, insofar as it subsidizes decision-making for the development and implementation of new products and processes related to cleaner production.

TI Methods for understanding social-ecological systems: a review of
   place-based studies
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB In recent years, social-ecological systems (SES) have emerged as a prominent analytical framing with which to investigate pressing sustainability issues associated with the Anthropocene era. Despite the growth of SES research, the lack of a delineated set of methods commonly contributes to disorientation for those entering into a field where methodological pluralism is the norm. We conduct a review of SES research, focusing particularly on methods used in this field. Our results reflect the rapid growth in SES research relative to other publications in relevant subject areas, and suggest a maturation of the field. Whilst institutions investigating SES have been mostly based in the global north, focal SES has been more globally distributed, although key regions, especially island regions, remain poorly studied. Key problems addressed in the studies related to policy, trade, conservation, adaptation, land use change, water, forests, sustainability, urban problems, and governance and institutions. We identified 311 methods, which we grouped into 27 method categories that can serve as a guide to SES research methods for newcomers to the field. We also performed an exploratory assessment of the ability of these methods to account for key features of SES as complex adaptive systems. We found that methods do better at accounting for the relational and context-dependent nature of SES, and least well with complex causality. Our study highlights the plurality of methods used in SES research, and helps highlight key areas in need of further methodological development.

AB Waste materials generated from building demolition have become a great challenge to sustainable urban development due to its consumption of the limited landfill spaces, water population, energy consumption, and harmful gas emissions. However, little studies investigate demolition waste management (DWM) from the perspective of complex adaptive system (CAS). The aim of this research is to simulate and explore how the change of attitude and the dynamic interaction among heterogeneous stakeholders can influence the system of DWM. A simulation model of demolition waste management was developed by using an agent-based modeling approach in Anylogic. Small world network was introduced and applied in the model. It is found that the interaction between the various agents and the proportion of green managers have a significant effect on demolition waste generation.

TI Mountain Matokit and Vrgorac city: a new localities of threatened and
   invasive plant taxa in Croatia
SO JOURNAL OF CENTRAL EUROPEAN AGRICULTURE
AB This paper is first inventarisation of threatened and invasive vascular plants on the rocky grasslands situated on northern slopes of mountain Matokit and abandoned arable land in vicinity of town of Vrgorac. These sites represent a new site for the Croatian flora. This research was conducted in year 2010 and 2011. We found 11 species of threatened vascular plants that by the Red Book (Nikolic and Topic [14]) and Flora Croatica Database (Nikolic [13]) and 15 invasive species, according to preliminary list of invasive alien species (IAS) in Croatia (Borsic et al. [3]). In this paper the habitat of some species, their distribution in Croatia, life forms and floral elements are described. It was found that threatened species occur exclusively on the rocky grassland habitat, except two species: critically endangered (CR) Papaver argemone and endangered (EN) Hibiscus trionum which were recorded on arable land. All inventoried invasive species, were recorded at the abandoned arable land, except the species Robinia pseudoacacia. Tendency for uncontrolled spread showed species Ailanthus altissima and Ambrosia artemisiifolia. Habitats of rocky grassland are on the stage of secondary succession (healing with the forest), and on the arable land the spread of invasive species exist (due to socio-economic changes: abandonment of agriculture and animal husbandry, and depopulation of the population). The results of these studies are contribution to the distribution map of threatened and invasive species in Croatia, and to the conservation of grassland habitat study area, as well as to preventing of the spread of invasive species.

TI Sustainable school-improvement in complex adaptive systems: A scoping
   review
SO REVIEW OF EDUCATION
AB School-improvement initiatives are implemented with admirable goals, often requiring substantial human and material resources. However, many fail to be sustainable beyond short-term funding cycles or the enthusiasm of local initiators. Typically, implementation and improvement are viewed linearly and as static end-products that fail to consider that schools are complex adaptive systems (CAS) that are continuously and recursively challenged with change. To investigate sustainable school-improvement within CAS, we used PRISMA-SR guidelines to conduct a scoping review of peer-reviewed journal articles extracted from six databases using keywords synonymous with 'complex or adaptive system', 'sustain', 'school' and 'initiative'. The search process yielded 1146 articles but only 16 of those articles met our inclusion/exclusion criteria that specified that authors present an integrated view of sustainable implementation in schools conceptualised as CAS. Within the selected 16 articles, key components for sustainability in schools described as CAS included access to adequate funding and resources, engagement and involvement of stakeholders, the ability of stakeholders to adapt to change, formation of collaborative partnerships, and the development of supportive policies and procedures. Some important issues arose, such as the tendency of the 'whole school approach' to be reduced to information dissemination activities that do not adequately deal with components of complex systems, and the increasing recognition that older implementation models that seek 'institutionalisation' fail to appreciate that sustainability is a process, not an end goal. This scoping review highlights the need to recognise the complexity and adaptivity of school systems for successful and sustained implementation of school-improvement initiatives.

TI Study on Urban Resilience from the Perspective of the Complex Adaptive
   System Theory: A Case Study of the Lanzhou-Xining Urban Agglomeration
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB In the context of global environmental change and continuous urbanization, enhancing urban resilience is an important way to improve urban emergency management capacity and achieve sustainable development of urban systems. It is of great significance to clarify the mechanisms and effects of urban resilience and carry out resilience measurement to improve the level of urban system resilience and alleviate the pressure of environmental disturbances on the stable operation of urban systems. As an important part of the "Belt and Road" Initiative and one of the few leading economic regions in western China, promoting the high-quality development of the Lanzhou-Xining urban agglomeration is of profound significance for strengthening ethnic unity and stabilizing the northwest and southwest regions. Based on the complex adaptive system (CAS) theory and the adaptive cycle model, this study understands urban resilience as the comprehensive result of urban system stability, self-organization, learning adaptability and transformability, constructs a multi-level open index evaluation system, and analyzes the spatio-temporal evolution characteristics of urban resilience of the Lanzhou-Xining urban agglomeration from the proposed design to the formal planning in 2010-2017. The findings are as follows: (1) Research on the urban resilience of the Lanzhou-Xining urban agglomeration verifies the applicability of the evolutionary urban resilience analysis framework and makes preliminary findings on urban resilience based on CAS theory, which provide a certain theoretical reference for the research on the spatio-temporal evolution of urban resilience. (2) From 2010 to 2017, significant differences are observed between various urban attributes. Resilience exhibits an overall upward trend, and spatial evolution changes from a double core (Lanzhou and Xining) to three cores (Lanzhou, Xining and Haidong) and polycentric modes. (3) Based on urban resilience characteristics and an urban system adaptability cycle model, this paper divides the Lanzhou-Xining urban agglomeration cities into four types (exploitation-reorganization, conservation-release, conservation-exploitation and exploitation), and proposes corresponding adaptive management countermeasures. These could be adopted as a reference to promote the high-quality development of the Lanzhou-Xining urban agglomeration.

TI Bridging the policy-implementation gap in federal health systems:
   lessons from the Nigerian experience
SO JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN AFRICA
AB The Partnership for Reviving Routine Immunization in Northern Nigeria - Maternal, Newborn and Child Health initiative supports efforts by the government of Nigeria to bridge primary health care (PHC) policies and services at three levels of government: federal, state and local. The paper suggests that understandings informed by complexity theory and complex adaptive systems have been helpful in shaping policy and programme design across these levels. To illustrate this, three initiatives are explored: Bringing PHC under one roof, enhancing access to funding provided by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, and strengthening the midwives service scheme. These initiatives have demonstrated how concepts and experience developed at subnational level can influence national policy and practice, and how work at subnational levels can add value to nationally conceived and nationally, driven plans for PHC.

SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB Designed to facilitate economic development, the corporate form now threatens human survival. This article presents an argument that organisations are yet to be 'fit for purpose' and that the corporate form needs to be re-designed to reach sustainability. It suggests that organisations need to recognise their agent status amongst a much wider and highly complex array of interconnected, dynamic economic, environmental and social systems. Human Factors theory is drawn on to propose that business systems could be made sustainable through re-design. They could fit their environment more appropriately by improving: Efficiency, Adaptability and Social Cohesion. Leaders of organisations would also need to take a holistic approach to alter the organisation proactively to adapt to the systems within which it is embedded.

TI Community-oriented primary care for National Health Insurance in South

SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMARY HEALTH CARE & FAMILY MEDICINE
AB This is a report on Chiawelo Community Practice (CCP) in Ward 11, Soweto, South Africa, a community-oriented primary care (COPC) model for National Health Insurance (NHI) in South Africa, developed by a family physician. A shift to capitation contracting for primary health care (PHC) under NHI will carry risk for providers - both public and private, especially higher number of patient visits. Health promotion and disease prevention, especially using a COPC model, will be important. Leading the implementation of COPC is an important role for family physicians in Africa, but global implementation of COPC is challenged. Cuba and Brazil have implemented COPC with panels of 600 and 3500, respectively. The family physician in this report has developed community practice as a model with four drivers using a complex adaptive system lens: population engagement with community health workers (CHWs), a clinic re-oriented to its community, stakeholder engagement and targeted health promotion. A team of three medical interns: 1 clinical associate, 3 nurses and 20 CHWs, supervised by the family physician, effectively manage a panel of approximately 30 000 people. This has resulted in low utilisation rates (less than one visit per person per year), high population access and satisfaction and high clinical quality. This has been despite the challenge of a reductionist PHC system, poor management support and poor public service culture. The results could be more impressive if panels are limited to 10 000, if there was a better team structure with a single doctor leading a team of 3-4 nurse/clinical associates and 10-12 CHWs and PHC provider units that are truly empowered to manage resources locally.

TI The everyday practice of supporting health system development: learning
   from how an externally-led intervention was implemented in Mozambique
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
AB Health system strengthening (HSS) has often been undertaken by global health actors working through vertical programmes. However, experience has shown the challenges of this approach, and the need to recognize health systems as open complex adaptive systems-which in turn has implications for the design and implementation approach of more 'horizontal' HSS interventions. From 2009 to 2016, the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation supported the African Health Initiative, establishing Population Health Implementation and Training partnerships in five African countries (Ghana, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania and Zambia). Each partnership was designed as a large-scale, long-term, complex health system strengthening intervention, at a primary care or district level-and in each country the intervention was adapted to suit that specific health systems context. In Mozambique, the Population Health Implementation and Training partnership sought to strengthen integrated health systems management at district and provincial levels (through a variety of capacity-development intervention activities, including in-service training and mentoring); to improve the quality of routine data and develop appropriate tools to facilitate decision-making for provincial and district managers; and to build capacity to design and conduct innovative operations research in order to guide integration and system-strengthening efforts. The success of this intervention, as assessed by outcome measures, has been reported elsewhere. In this paper, the implementation practice of this horizontal HSS intervention is assessed, focusing on the key features of how implementation occurred and the implementation approach. A case study focusing on HSS implementation practice was conducted by external researchers from 2014 to 2017. The importance of an accompanying implementation research approach is emphasized-especially for HSS interventions where the 'complex adaptive system' (complex and constantly changing context) forces constant adaptations to the intervention design and approach.

HO Natl Univ Ireland
AB We use the New England herring fishery as an example of the unresolved scientific issues pertinent to ecosystem-based management of forage-fish fisheries. The biomass of herring off New England is currently well above maximum sustainable yield (B-MSY), leading to pressure for expanded harvests. Associated concerns include: the maintenance of sufficiently abundant forage to meet the current needs of marine mammals and seabirds while supporting the rebuilding of overfished groundfish resources; the preservation of the service functions of a healthy population of pelagic zooplanktivorous fish to prevent possible outbreaks of pests, or hypoxia events; and the limitation of unintended bycatch of marine mammals, seabirds, and juvenile stages of groundfish. Perhaps a self-enhancing feedback loop, involving predation by herring on the early life stages of their groundfish predators, might result in regime shifts that could not be easily reversed. A plausible outcome of these ideas is a dichotomy in management choice between (i) promoting an ecosystem dominated by valuable groundfish resources and (ii) promoting the current ecosystem that features a large herring resource associated with abundant and energy-rich forage for marine mammals, seabirds, and continued high productivity of valuable shellfish resources.

TI Emergent sustainability in open property regimes
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Current theoretical models of the commons assert that common-pool resources can only be managed sustainably with clearly defined boundaries around both communities and the resources that they use. In these theoretical models, open access inevitably leads to a tragedy of the commons. However, in many open access systems, use of common-pool resources seems to be sustainable over the long term (i.e., current resource use does not threaten use of common-pool resources for future generations). Here, we outline the conditions that support sustainable resource use in open property regimes. We use the conceptual framework of complex adaptive systems to explain how processes within and couplings between human and natural systems can lead to the emergence of efficient, equitable, and sustainable resource use. We illustrate these dynamics in eight case studies of different social-ecological systems, including mobile pastoralism, marine and freshwater fisheries, swidden agriculture, and desert foraging. Our theoretical framework identifies eight conditions that are critical for the emergence of sustainable use of common-pool resources in open property regimes. In addition, we explain how changes in boundary conditions may push open property regimes to either common property regimes or a tragedy of the commons. Our theoretical model of emergent sustainability helps us to understand the diversity and dynamics of property regimes across a wide range of social-ecological systems and explains the enigma of open access without a tragedy. We recommend that policy interventions in such self-organizing systems should focus on managing the conditions that are critical for the emergence and persistence of sustainability.

These are capital-intensive, long-lived large scale socio-technical systems that evolve over decades. To enable high-level decision support on climate policy, strategic investment decisions or transition management, we are evolving a simulation engine for Agent-Based simulation of infrastructure development. The key functionality and capability of this engine is its ability for playing out possible futures, to identify development patterns and conditions for sustainability by exploring multiple scenarios. Two of the models completed serve to illustrate the approach. These address the ecological impact of bio-electricity and the long-term effect of CO2 policy on the electricity production technology portfolio. Limits and opportunities of the approach are discussed and an outline for future research is given.

AB In this paper we propose a self-organizing mechanism to model adaptive multi-agent systems. The mechanism is inspired in a psychological approach of motivation. Under this approach motivation is an internal state or condition that serves to activate or energize behavior and give it direction. Thus, we propose an intrinsic motivation or reason for engaging in a particular behavior called goal-achievement, in this way agents will have a drive to reach a clearly defined state. To increase the strength of this particular behavior we propose a reinforcement mechanism based on agents past experience as a feedback. The intention of this mechanism is to mimic the adaptation exhibited by entities of complex systems composed of multiple autonomous entities that make local decisions leading to a global organized behavior for the system. Such organization is reached autonomously in different ways, thus adapting to task and environment.

SO DEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE
AB Understanding "what works" for capacity development support in an international development setting remains an important area for operational research. This mixed-methods study explored this topic within a global programme that supports civil society organisations in fifteen countries to secure the health and human rights of marginalised and underserved populations. Taking a complex adaptive systems approach, and seeking to understand the phenomena from the "receiver" perspective, the study found that the programme fostered the development of four interconnected domains of capacity through a reflexive, user-led approach. These capacity gains could be linked, although not causally, to important programmatic achievements for the programme's focus populations.

AB Traditionally, cities evolved over time into current quite rigid urban conurbations. As complexity of our political, social and economic environment increases, cities begin to experience new pressures - traffic congestion, pollution, immigration, overcrowding, inadequacy of services, to mention just a few, which affect both citizens and visitors. Digital technology now exists that we could use to turn rigid cities into Urban Ecosystems. The paper provides an updated definition of Smart City as an Urban Ecosystem, it analyses problems experienced by cities caused by complexity of the Internet-based global economy and describes an advanced solution - to design cities as urban ecosystems capable of delivering services to citizens and visitors under conditions of complexity.
   The authors have developed an evolutionary methodology that ensure a minimum of disruptions to city services during its transformation into an urban ecosystem. Design of Smart City ontology is provided as an example.

TI Achieving organizational resilience through complex adaptive systems
   approach: a conceptual framework
SO MANAGEMENT RESEARCH-THE JOURNAL OF THE IBEROAMERICAN ACADEMY OF
   MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose The global business environment causes different and difficult kinds of problems that threaten organizational survival. As an important solution, the organizational resilience concept arises and offers holistic philosophy. The resilience concept offers multidisciplinary and valuable eclectic literature to organizational studies that help to produce a wide variety of solutions but causes a lack of consensus to measure and apply resilience at an organizational level. To fill this gap, this paper aims to offer the complex adaptive systems (CAS) approach as a lens to organizations. This paper aims to offer that CAS provides a suitable toolkit to address the organizational resilience concept as it has the potential to offer more generalizable guidance. Design/methodology/approach To reach that goal, this research follows a two-phase systematic literature review. In the first phase, the purpose is to search past five years' studies (2015-2020) to figure out current trends in organizational resilience concepts. In the second phase, organizational resilience studies, which include the CAS approach, are checked to analyze the alignment procedures of two concepts. Findings Literature shows that the organizational resilience concept has rarely worked from the CAS lens.CAS are more resilient via adaptation and learning as they depend on local interactions that shape and co-evolve together with their dynamic environment, which helps the emergence of self-organization in an unpredictable future. To achieve organizational resilience, the CAS lens proposes a generalizable and applicable framework to organizational studies. Research limitations/implications Future research should also explore the impact of the interrelationship between two concepts; quantitative and qualitative methods should be applied to be able to get empirical results. Practical implications CAS lens could be used as a contemporary design idea. The CAS approach enables the learning and adaptation requirement of the organizational resilience concept, which helps to create dynamic capabilities to handle turbulent changes and gain long-lasting competitiveness. Designing organizations' agents from CAS viewpoint helps to understand and be ready for new trends, such as digitalization or Industry 4.0. Social implications Evaluating organizations from the CAS lens as living systems that co-evolve with their environments reveals different ways to achieve organizational resilience management philosophy. Designing organizations as CAS promotes organizational adaptation and learning, which improves organizational decision-making, increasing organizational resilience in organizations. Originality/value The originality of the study lies in proposing to achieve organizational resilience via CAS lenses and offering a conceptual framework to achieve organizational resilience.

SO CIVIL ENGINEERING AND ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS
AB Resilience and sustainability have both gained traction in civil engineering. There is significant overlap between both fields, but practitioners tend to remain confined to their niche. This paper clarifies the link between both fields, reflects on the underlying concepts, and identifies challenges and opportunities in understanding complex problems involving both resilience and sustainability. A conceptual framework is proposed for understanding resilience and sustainability together. The example of a coastal town subject to sea-level rise and large storms is used to motivate the framework. The example is used to evaluate the use of discount rates for events in the distant future. The results are discussed to determine our ability to decide whether such scenarios are sustainable. The conclusion is that computational approaches will be inadequate. Rather, there is a need for qualitative thinking that embraces ambiguity and unmeasurable uncertainty.

AB Enterprise Interoperability (EI) is a well established applied systems' research area, studying the problems related with the lack of systems and applications' interoperability in the organizations and proposing novel methods and frameworks to contribute with innovative solutions for EI problems. Collaborative networked environments emerged with the spread of the internet, contributing to overcome past communication barriers, and identifying interoperability as an essential property. With an increasingly complex and dynamic global market, models change frequently to answer new customer requirements, and seamless networked business environments is a requirement. Scientific foundations for EI are envisaged to roadmap such general knowledge covering the general laws of the operation on EI. This paper draws concepts from the complex systems science and proposes a formal model on seamless networked business for sustainable systems interoperability in dynamic networks.

Yet, the cultivation of leadership is impacted by the complex nature of ECEC environments and the persistent challenges therein. Complex workforce issues, inadequate preparation for positional leadership roles and few opportunities for professional development for emerging leaders challenge the growth of effective leadership and the development of sustainable leadership for the ECEC profession. This commentary gives an insight into the challenges of leadership within ECEC and leader supply and suggests leadership emergence and enactment is potentially cultivated by broadening theoretical and pragmatic propositions. Complexity leadership theory within complex adaptive systems is presented as a framework for leadership cultivation within ECEC and opportunities for leadership development are highlighted.

This chapter traces the evolution of the discipline of ecology from Charles Elton's Presidential address to the British Ecology Society in January 1949 to the present day. Five primary themes are discussed: predicting where species are, population ecology including the theories of island biogeography and predator-prey and plant-herbivore dynamics, biological diversity and species richness, community and ecosystem dynamics including equilibrium, stability and resilience theory, and finally applied ecology leading to development of the concept of complex adaptive systems. The integrative nature of ecology places the discipline in a dominant position to address the issue of sustainability and the planning and managing of ecosystems.

These alien organisms, including insects, plants, and microorganisms, were introduced to new ecosystems, spread and threaten local biodiversity (also known as biological invasions). Nowadays, vulnerable forests in China are being threatened by large numbers of invasive species. In this chapter, we introduce current situation of invasive species in forest ecosystems in China, propose novel theoretical researches on biological invasions in forest ecosystems and several invasive species, as well as discuss main strategies and policies for management of forest pest invasions.

SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
AB The impact of human activity on the biophysical world raises myriad challenges for sustaining Earth system processes, ecosystem services, and human societies. To engage in meaningful problem-solving in the hydrosphere, this necessitates an approach that recognizes the coupled nature of human and biophysical systems. We argue that, in order to produce the next generation of problem-solvers, hydrology education should ensure that students develop an appreciation and working familiarity in the context of coupled human-environmental systems. We illustrate how undergraduate-level hydrology assignments can extend beyond rote computations or basic throughput scenarios to include consideration of the dynamic interactions with social and other biophysical dimensions of complex adaptive systems. Such an educational approach not only builds appropriate breadth of dynamic understanding, but can also empower students toward assuming influential and effective roles in solving sustainability challenges.

TI Resilience Measurements and Dynamics of Resource-Based Cities in
   Heilongjiang Province, China
SO LAND
AB In the process of sustainable transformation, resource-based cities (RBCs) in Heilongjiang are in a dilemma. Resilience is a key capability to help RBCs deepen sustainable development, adapt to shocks, and exit the transformation dilemma. This study aims to clarify the resilience measurements and dynamics of RBCs and propose targeted resilience enhancement strategies. First, we construct a resilience indicator system based on the urban complex adaptive system (CAS) and use principal component analysis (PCA) to specify indicator weights to obtain the resilience values of RBCs in Heilongjiang Province during 2010-2019, then use cluster analysis to classify five resilience grades. Second, we identify and analyze the resilience dynamics of RBCs in Heilongjiang Province from 2010-2019 based on the adaptive cycle framework. The results indicate that the overall resilience dynamics of RBCs have exhibited an upward trend over the past decade, but there are clear variations in the level of resilience values and dynamics between the different types of RBCs. The petroleum-based city has the highest level of resilience, is less affected by shocks, and recovers quickly. Forest-based cities have a medium level of resilience and are able to recover from shocks, but they fail to improve and remain at a medium level for a long time. Coal-based cities have a low level of resilience and find it difficult to recover from shocks, but this has improved since 2017. Finally, we propose targeted resilience enhancement strategies for RBCs of different types and resilience levels in Heilongjiang Province to provide RBCs with directional guidance for overcoming the development dilemma through resilience measures.

TI Possibility to implement invasive species control in Swedish forests
SO AMBIO
AB Invasive alien species constitute an increasing risk to forestry, as indeed to natural systems in general. This study reviews the legislative framework governing invasive species in the EU and Sweden, drawing upon both a legal analysis and interviews with main national level agencies responsible for implementing this framework. The study concludes that EU and Sweden are limited in how well they can act on invasive species, in particular because of the weak interpretation of the precautionary principle in the World Trade Organisation and Sanitary and Phytosanitary agreements. In the Swedish case, this interpretation also conflicts with the stronger interpretation of the precautionary principle under the Swedish Environmental Code, which could in itself provide for stronger possibilities to act on invasive species.

AB In the present study, we introduce two techniques - self-organizing maps (SOM) and indicator species analysis (INDVAL) - for understanding the richness patterns of invasive species. We first employed SOM to identify functional groups and then used INDVAL to identify the representative areas characterizing these functional groups. Quantitative traits and distributional information on 127 invasive plants in 28 provinces of China were collected to form the matrices for our study. The results indicate Jiangsu to be the top province with the highest number of invasive species, while Ningxia was the lowest. Six functional groups were identified by the SOM method, and five of them were found to have significantly representative provinces by the INDVAL method. Our study represents the first attempt to combine self-organizing maps and indicator species analysis to assess the macro-scale distribution of exotic species.

TI Learning to live in a global commons: socioeconomic challenges for a
   sustainable environment
SO ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB Ecologists, economists and other social scientists have much incentive for interaction. First of all, ecological systems and socioeconomic systems are linked in their dynamics, and these linkages are key to coupling environmental protection and economic growth. Beyond this, however, are the obvious similarities in how ecological systems and socioeconomic systems function, and the common theoretical challenges in understanding their dynamics. This should not be surprising. Socioeconomic systems are in fact ecological systems, in which the familiar ecological phenomena of exploitation, cooperation and parasitism all can be identified as key features. Or, viewed from the opposite perspective, ecological systems are economic systems, in which competition for resources is key, and in which an evolutionary process shapes the individual agents to a distribution of specialization of function that leads to the emergence of flows and functionalities at higher levels of organization. Most fundamentally, ecological and socioeconomic systems alike are complex adaptive systems, in which patterns at the macroscopic level emerge from interactions and selection mechanisms mediated at many levels of organization, from individual agents to collectives to whole systems and even above. In such complex adaptive systems, robustness must be understood as emergent from selection processes operating at these many different levels, and the inherent nonlinearities can trigger sudden shifts in regimes that, in the case of the biosphere, can have major consequences for humanity. This lecture will explore the complex adaptive nature of ecosystems, and the implications for the robustness of ecosystem services on which we depend, and in particular examine the conditions under which cooperative behavior emerges. It will then turn attention to the socioeconomic systems in which environmental management is based, and ask what lessons can be learned from our examination of natural systems, and how we can modify social norms to achieve global cooperation in managing our common future. Of special interest will be issues of intragenerational and intergenerational equity, and the importance of various forms of discounting.

TI Making Complexity Your Friend: Reframing Social Theory for the
   Anthropocene
SO WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY
AB This article uses the dilemma of climate change as an entry point to explore the utility of a complexity framework for a more comprehensive social science of environmental sustainability. A theory of complex adaptive systems (CAS) is especially appropriate for the Anthropocene, a newly proposed geological period defined around humanity's impact on the biosphere. Aspects of complexity theory have been entering public consciousness through popular accounts of climate "tipping points'' and "emergent'' change-the risk that Earth's climate could shift into a new pattern in a relatively short time period. Social structures, including capitalism, are complex systems, as are social movements. The paper reviews CAS research with special attention to applications in social ecology. It discusses two case studies of exemplary research on human management of environmental resources and one case study of the antiglobalization movement, all conceived within a complexity framework. The central argument is that complexity thinking will enhance social studies of sustainability and efforts to create a more resilient economy and biosphere.

As an important research topic, the enterprise system evolution should be paid more attention by researchers and managers. In this work, we focus on the evolutionary paths of enterprise system, which can determine enterprise's sustainable development. Based on prior research, we combine two theories insights: complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory and resource-based theory (RBT) to develop a conceptual model for enterprise system evolution. Firstly, we analyze the theoretical basis of the enterprise system evolution. Secondly, we present four stages of the enterprise system development and evolution. Lastly, we identify three evolutionary paths of enterprise system, including self-development, dynamic imitation, and innovational emergence.

TI Design for financial sustainability
SO PATTERNS
AB The 1987 United Nations Brundtland Report established the vision of sustainable development as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.'' How might we anticipate the requirements of future custodians of vast, continuously morphing socio-technical-ecological systems while addressing current pressing needs? An abstract, principled approach (such as axiomatic design) might help address such ambiguity. Such systems are composed of large numbers of information-processing agents/agencies that collectively form a complex adaptive system (CAS). The focus here is on financial sustainability: (1) what is a principled approach toward sustainable design? (2) What design insights might we obtain by studying financial crises forensically against sustainability successes in nature? (3) How to design for financial sustainability? This paper adopts the CAS framework alongside axiomatic design to help elicit design patterns and anti-patterns of sustainability. Inspired by nature, a promising inside-out design pattern emerges.

AB For maintaining social and financial support for eradication programs of invasive species, quantitative assessment of recovery of native species or ecosystems is important because it provides a measurable parameter of success. However, setting a concrete goal for recovery is often difficult owing to lack of information prior to the introduction of invaders. Here, we present a novel approach to evaluate the achievement level of invasive predator management based on the carrying capacity of endangered species estimated using long-term monitoring data. In Amami-Oshima Island, Japan, where the eradication project of introduced small Indian mongoose is ongoing since 2000, we surveyed the population densities of four endangered species threatened by the mongoose (Amami rabbit, the Otton frog, Amami tip-nosed frog, and Amami Ishikawa's frog) at four time points ranging from 2003 to 2011. We estimated the carrying capacities of these species using the logistic growth model combined with the effects of mongoose predation and environmental heterogeneity. All species showed clear tendencies toward increasing their density in line with decreased mongoose density, and they exhibited density-dependent population growth. The estimated carrying capacities of three endangered species had small confidence intervals enough to measure recovery levels by the mongoose management. The population density of each endangered species has recovered to the level of the carrying capacity at about 20-40% of all sites, whereas no individuals were observed at more than 25% of all sites. We propose that the present approach involving appropriate monitoring data of native organism populations will be widely applicable to various eradication projects and provide unambiguous goals for management of invasive species.

TI Promising practices for dealing with complexity in research for
   development
SO GAIA-ECOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES FOR SCIENCE AND SOCIETY
AB The need to deal with complexity is getting increasingly attention in research for development projects implemented through transboundary research partnerships between organisations from the Global North and the Global South. However, less is known about aspects beyond the systems under study that still affect complexity in the research project. We conducted an experience capitalization of five transboundary research partnerships undertaking research in 14 countries in the Global South. We found that the combination of multiple contexts, the cultural and disciplinary diversity of the transboundary research partnerships, and the set of rules and proceedings from the funding mechanism affect the levels of complexity. We further identified that a transdisciplinary approach and several related practices, like intercultural communication or integrative partnerships, are promising ways of dealing with complexity. Current structures in research for development need to improve in order to fully use the potential of transdisciplinarity for sustainability transformation.

SO HUMAN ECOLOGY
AB We investigated the coupled social and ecological dynamics of swidden agriculture through a common property resource field experiment framed as a game with realistic social norms and ecological dynamics. We tested the hypothesis that community social norms related to labor reciprocity and graduated sanctioning may encourage sustainable swidden cultivation. We played the game with 150 people from two Q'eqchi' Maya villages in southern Belize where swidden agriculture is common. We found that when the game mimics local social norms related to agricultural labor exchange, clearing requests decrease and a statistical analysis indicates that players sanctioned one another in order to decrease resource use and increase sustainability. We validated our results using qualitative methods, post-game surveys, and interviews, and we conclude that cultural and social norms related to labor exchange improve the sustainability of swidden agriculture.

TI Innovations in the Dutch polder Communities of practice and the
   challenge of coevolution
SO EMERGENCE-COMPLEXITY & ORGANIZATION
AB Recently, a new initiative has entered the Dutch policy-arena of spatial planning, water management and nature preservation: the so-called Community of Practice (COP). Within such a COP actors with very different backgrounds (experts, inhabitants, officials, stakeholders) participate to try and find creative solutions for persistent political and societal problems by combining conflicting spatial functions in specific areas. From a complex adaptive systems point of view, we analyze the logic and functioning of such a COP. From the literature on complexity and innovation we can learn that staying at the edge of chaos for COPs mean that they not only have to maintain an internal process of coevolution between the very different actors involved, but also have to maintain relations of coevolution with their wider environment. After an in-depth case study 'Gouwe Wiericke' we conclude that COPs can produce innovative policy results, but reaching 'bounded instability' through sustainable coevolution requires careful balancing acts between extremes.

AB The Grenadine Islands lie on the Grenadine Bank extending some 120 km between Grenada and St. Vincent, and occupy about 1,500 km(2) of the bank. This area supports the most extensive coral reefs and related habitats in the south-eastern Caribbean. The international boundary between Grenada and St Vincent and the Grenadines lies about midway down the bank. The largest islands have towns and communities. Others are resort islands. Most are visited by yachters and fishers. Tourism and fishing are the major sources of employment in the area. Tourism development is proceeding apace, while fishery resources appear to be fully or overexploited. Governments of both countries perceive their Grenadine Islands as having high potential for tourism and associated development They also recognise the vulnerability of the marine and terrestrial ecosystems of the area to environmental degradation and that sustainable development depends on conservation of the resources. There the emerging view that the entire area should be a transboundary World Heritage Site. The Tobago Cays Marine Park has been established and other MPAs are, planned, but a broader approach is needed. Achieving sustainable livelihoods from marine and coastal resources will need organisational change at many levels. There is a complex interplay of local and international private interests, local, national, and international NGOs, as well as tensions between main island government and local inhabitants. Therefore, conventionally planned change is difficult to implement. The model of organisational change that is most likely to be applicable is one based the science of complex adaptive systems and chaos theory. Intervention should employ 'containers', significant differences', and 'transforming exchanges' to increase the capacity for self-organisation among stakeholders. Understanding of other chaos elements such as boundaries, butterfly effects, coupling and attractors can be used to encourage self-organization.

With the COVID pandemic the paradigm shifted tremendously and the city governments, as well as scientists have to focus more on resilience strategies. The city managers now should make their decisions in conditions of limited information, unavailability to see and plan future development, maintain "what if" analysis to predict the results.
   Considering the Smart City as a complex system the new approach and digital platform that combines both sustainable and resilient modes of behavior are presented. This platform allows to perform normally in a sustainable mode and react adaptively when unpredictable events occur in the resilient mode.

TI Assessment of Small Towns' Fitness around China's Major Cities: A Case
   Study in Wuhan City
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB As China increases its pace of urbanization, urban areas achieve rapid development by snatching resources from small towns that suffer persistent outflow of resources and anemic growth. Consequently, this trend is likely to destroy the foundation of urbanization and structural equilibrium of sustainable development. Based on the theory of complex adaptive systems (CAS), this paper held that the changes above were results of the small towns' making adaptive adjustments to their internal structures according to external environments. To assess the fitness values of the small towns around major cities in China, this study analyzedWuhan city and its peripheral towns from the ` fitness' perspective using the NK model. Meanwhile, the "space-function" coupled mode was introduced to analyze the development features of these small towns at different fitness levels. On this basis, spatial autocorrelation was employed to reveal the spatial patterns of the small towns around Wuhan according to their fitness values. Besides, the locally optimal paths of eight different types of combinations to evolve fitness were identified based on the NK computation results. The findings indicate positive correlations between the fitness values of small towns around major cities and the number of dominant factors. Apart from this, there exists a hierarchical clustering structure in the region of the major city which is bounded by urban growth boundary based on the fitness values of small towns. Also, spatial restructuring, the path to closer interaction with peripheral adaptive agents and effective resource integration in a greater scope, should be given priority to improve the adaptability of small towns. Additionally, the small towns should shift toward the function-oriented pattern that emphasizes specialization from the conventional centralized clustering structure to go with the tide of regional specialization and transformation in urban areas and realize their regional value.

TI Capturing emergent phenomena in social-ecological systems: an analytical
   framework
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB Social-ecological systems (SES) are complex adaptive systems. Social-ecological system phenomena, such as regime shifts, transformations, or traps, emerge from interactions among and between human and nonhuman entities within and across scales. Analyses of SES phenomena thus require approaches that can account for (1) the intertwinedness of social and ecological processes and (2) the ways they jointly give rise to emergent social-ecological patterns, structures, and dynamics that feedback on the entities and processes that generated them. We have developed a framework of linked action situations (AS) as a tool to capture those interactions that are hypothesized to have jointly and dynamically generated a social-ecological phenomenon of interest. The framework extends the concept of an action situation to provide a conceptualization of SES that focusses on social-ecological interactions and their links across levels. The aim of our SE-AS (social-ecological action situations) framework is to support a process of developing hypotheses about configurations of ASs that may explain an emergent social-ecological phenomenon. We suggest six social-ecological ASs along with social and ecological action situations that can commonly be found in natural resource or ecosystem management contexts. We test the ability of the framework to structure an analysis of processes of emergence by applying it to different case studies of regime shifts, traps, and sustainable resource use. The framework goes beyond existing frameworks and approaches, such as the SES framework or causal loop diagrams, by establishing a way of analyzing SES that focuses on the interplay of social-ecological interactions with the emergent outcomes they produce. We conclude by discussing the added value of the framework and discussing the different purposes it can serve: from supporting the development of theories of the emergence of social-ecological phenomena, enhancing transparency of SES understandings to serving as a boundary object for interdisciplinary knowledge integration.

We address this challenge by proposing changes in scientific and scholarly research communities and transformations in roles, resources, actors, and institutions of scholarship (i.e., natural and social sciences, humanities, and arts), which can contribute substantially and effectively to co-designing solutions for sustainable, just, and equitable human societies. Technical summary The critical challenge facing humanity is the increasingly urgent need to find and implement pathways that lead humankind into a new stage of dynamic equilibrium that promotes the co-evolution of natural and cultural systems. We address this challenge for scientific and scholarly research communities and the transformations in roles, resources, actors, and institutions of scholarship (encompassing natural and social sciences, humanities, and arts), which can contribute substantially and effectively to co-designing solutions for coping with unsustainable practices and systemic risks. Our perspective builds upon a series of four workshops to identify and address global sustainability challenges at a regional scale. It is anchored in the view that nature and society are inextricably interwoven, that planetary boundaries are fundamentally societal, rather than solely environmental issues, that viable solutions to the global challenges mentioned above can be developed and most effectively implemented at a regional to local scale in conjunction with substantive changes in the education systems at all levels, and that these considerations require a complex adaptive systems approach to seeking and implementing solutions. We call for rethinking, finding creative approaches, and acting to make scholarship more capable of effectively creating just and equitable sustainable futures in diverse cultures and contexts.

TI Connecting research discovery with care delivery in dementia: the
   development of the Indianapolis Discovery Network for Dementia
SO CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS IN AGING
AB Background: The US Institute of Medicine has recommended an integrated, locally sensitive collaboration among the various members of the community, health care systems, and research organizations to improve dementia care and dementia research.
   Methods: Using complex adaptive system theory and reflective adaptive process, we developed a professional network called the "Indianapolis Discovery Network for Dementia" (IDND). The IDND facilitates effective and sustainable interactions among a local and diverse group of dementia researchers, clinical providers, and community advocates interested in improving care for dementia patients in Indianapolis, Indiana.
   Results: The IDND was established in February 2006 and now includes more than 250 members from more than 30 local (central Indiana) organizations representing 20 disciplines. The network uses two types of communication to connect its members. The first is a 2-hour face-to-face bimonthly meeting open to all members. The second is a web-based resource center (http://www.indydiscoverynetwork.org). To date, the network has: (1) accomplished the development of a network website with an annual average of 12,711 hits per day; (2) produced clinical tools such as the Healthy Aging Brain Care Monitor and the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale; (3) translated and implemented the collaborative dementia care model into two local health care systems; (4) created web-based tracking software, the Enhanced Medical Record for Aging Brain Care (eMR-ABC), to support care coordination for patients with dementia; (5) received more than USD$24 million in funding for members for dementia-related research studies; and (6) adopted a new group-based problem-solving process called the "IDND consultancy round."
   Conclusion: A local interdisciplinary "think-tank" network focused on dementia that promotes collaboration in research projects, educational initiatives, and quality improvement efforts that meet the local research, clinical, and community needs relevant to dementia care has been built.

AB This article addresses the problem of how change and innovation can create a fuller voice for ecological interests in organizations and public policy, raising issues about change mechanisms at the institutional versus organizational level. First, it suggests that the newer, systems-based and inclusive approaches to organizational development practice and theory may overcome shortcomings of earlier approaches to planned change. Second, it argues that co-evolutionary approaches that use complex adaptive systems thinking will more effectively structure such third-generation interventions by focusing on issues at the institutional level. Third, the article examines a dialectical model of institutional change which incorporates activist input and channels conflict into innovative outcomes. Finally, it presents a case example of how a dialectical model combined with a co-evolutionary perspective could foster the institutional change required to facilitate the integration of ecological priorities into the human systems of organizations.

AB Health care systems across the world are in a state of flux. If the experience of the early 1990s can be used as a model, the recent global economic downturn will lead to very significant pressures to reduce spending and achieve better value. Systems have provided a range of approaches to modeling and evaluating these more complex organizations, from simple process models to complex adaptive systems. This paper considers the pros and cons of such approaches and proposes a new modeling approach that combines the best elements of other techniques. This paper also describes a case study, where the approach has been deployed by the authors. The case study comes from health care services in Ontario, Canada, who are shifting from the traditionally hospital-based system to one that recognizes a greater role for community and primary care services.

SO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB The management and active enforcement of the increasing number of conservation-related instruments (e.g. the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), The World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red Data Lists and pending invasive species regulations), and the number of listed plant and animal taxa that they are likely to incorporate, are already straining national regulatory, enforcement and border control agencies. Against the backdrop of increasing capacity constraints (financial and logistic) and uncertainty faced by these authorities, we support calls for a radical shift in the traditional approach to the management of threatened species (either Red Data List or CITES listed) and the maintenance of the integrity of biological systems (viz. the control of potentially invasive species). This entails the establishment of National Green Data Species Lists (proposed by Imboden (1989) in World Birdwatch 9:2). The Green List would be a reciprocal list of species that are not threatened (not Red Data listed), not affected by trade (not CITES listed) or pose little threat of invasion according to importing authorities. This reciprocal list does not require negotiation of new international treaties and will simply piggy-back on existing treaties. In addition, it will shift the 'burden of proof', including the financial investment required for species Green Data listing, the verification of origins, taxonomic and conservation status determination, from regulating authorities to traders.

Based on the number and form of thorns present on the stem (5-8 thorns with a fan-like form at the node), this new species is easily recognizable morphologically and possesses characteristics unique to the Neotropical Dioscorea. Presenting only a few individuals in each population, this rare and endangered species is only known from three sites surrounded by a vegetation matrix degraded by human impact and overrun by invasive alien species. Dioscorea flabellispina does not occur in any officially protected area in Brazil, placing the species at increased risk. Herein we present the morphological description of this species, including a discussion of its ecology, distribution, and conservation status.

TI The bi-modal organization Balancing autopoiesis and fluid social
   networks for sustainability
SO LEARNING ORGANIZATION
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assist an organization to restructure as a bi-modal organization in order to achieve sustainability in today's highly complex business world.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper is conceptual and is based on relevant literature and the authors' research and practice.
   Findings - Although fluid self-organizing networks are the natural state for humankind, in most organizations "organizing" entails the process of autopoiesis. This process does not produce the open fluid organization that is required for success in today's business world. While autopoiesis is taking place, informal socialization is taking place across the organization's interpersonal networks. Under supportive conditions, this leads to the development of a bi-modal organization where one or more open systems may emerge and co-exist concurrently with the autopoietic system; these open systems include fluid networks and complex adaptive system. The bi-modal organization achieves sustainability by balancing a certain amount of organization versus a certain amount of instability, leading to predictability with disorder, and planned long-term strategy achieved through many concurrent short-term actions.
   Research limitations/implications - Future research will involve an empirical study that will further examine the bi-modal organization, its development, and its properties.
   Practical implications - The systems that surround a business organization now and for the foreseeable future are highly dynamic, competitive, and socially individualized, and demand a new organizational form and competencies that may only be exhibited by a bi-modal organization based on an open system. The paper describes how an organization can restructure to become a bi-modal organization.
   Social implications - The paper should help improve quality of work-life and organizational structure.
   Originality/value - The paper describes a new organizational form designed to flourish in today's complex business contexts.

TI Pre-emptive Intervention for Autism Spectrum Disorder: Theoretical
   Foundations and Clinical Translation
SO FRONTIERS IN INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE
AB Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are an emergent public health problem, placing significant burden upon the individual, family and health system. ASD are polygenetic spectrum disorders of neural connectome development, in which one or more feedback loops amplify small genetic, structural, or functional variations in the very early development of motor and sensory-motor pathways. These perturbations trigger a 'butterfly effect' of unpredictable cascades of structural and functional imbalances in the global neuronal workspace, resulting in atypical behaviors, social communication, and cognition long-term. The first 100 days post-term are critically neuroplastic and comprise an injury-sensitive developmental window, characterized by a neural biomarker, the persistence of the cortical subplate, and a behavioral biomarker, the crying diathesis. By the time potential diagnostic signs are identified, from 6 months of age, ASD neuropathy is already entrenched. The International Society for Autism Research Special Interest Group has called for pre-emptive intervention, based upon rigorous theoretical frames, and real world translation and evaluation. This paper responds to that call. It synthesizes heterogenous evidence concerning ASD etiologies from both psychosocial and biological research literatures with complexity science and evolutionary biology, to propose a theoretical framework for pre-emptive intervention. This paper hypothesizes that environmental factors resulting from a mismatch between environment of evolutionary adaptedness and culture initiate or perpetuate early motor and sensory-motor lesions, triggering a butterfly effect of multi-directional cascades of atypical developmental in the complex adaptive system of the parent and ASD-susceptible infant. Chronic sympathetic nervous system/hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperarousal and disrupted parent-infant biobehavioral synchrony are the key biologic and behavioral mechanisms perpetuating these atypical developmental cascades. A clinical translation of this evidence is proposed, for application antenatally and in the first 6 months of life, as pre-emptive intervention for ASD.

SE Annual Review of Ecology Evolution and Systematics
AB The Anthropocene biosphere constitutes an unprecedented phase in the evolution of life on Earth with one species, humans, exerting extensive control. The increasing intensity of anthropogenic forces in the twenty-first century has widespread implications for attempts to govern both human-dominated ecosystems and the last remaining wild ecosystems. Here, we review how evolutionary biology can inform governance and policies in the Anthropocene, focusing on five governance challenges that span biodiversity, environmental management, food and other biomass production, and human health. The five challenges are: (a) evolutionary feedbacks, (b) maintaining resilience, (c) alleviating constraints, (d) coevolutionary disruption, and (e) biotechnology. Strategies for governing these dynamics will themselves have to be coevolutionary, as eco-evolutionary and social dynamics change in response to each other.

SO JAMBA-JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK STUDIES
AB Determining the level of a city's disaster resilience and developing a disaster resilience strategy is an important process towards understanding the current and potential future risk of cities. However, the process of determining and mapping the level of urban disaster resilience presents a challenge for the City of Tshwane, as it requires a consolidated and coordinated commitment and collaboration from various role players. This research study developed disaster resilience framework indicators for the City of Tshwane to determine its current disaster resilience and to contribute to its disaster resilience and sustainable development planning strategy. The research assumed a case study design using a qualitative approach to gather data through document analysis and one-on-one interviews. Ten disaster resilience framework indicators were identified as essential indicators in assisting the City of Tshwane with its endeavour to be a disaster resilient city.

   Exploring the network dynamics of positional embeddedness
SO JOURNAL OF PURCHASING AND SUPPLY MANAGEMENT
AB Companies increasingly need to work with their partners to address sustainability issues, but benefits from environmental R&D cooperation can be limited by the complexity of its management. This paper examines how the interplay between dyadic and network relationships can contribute to increase the success of environmental R&D cooperation. Using secondary data, we examine whether the positional embeddedness in the supply network structure of partners engaged in environmental R&D cooperation amplifies the effects of cooperation on product performance. Non-monotonic effects of environmental R&D cooperation and embeddedness are also tested. The results indicate that the positional embeddedness of partners triggered by multiple sourcing strategy amplifies the effects of environmental R&D cooperation on product environmental performance. The interaction effects become however insignificant in the presence of increasing complexity and excessive environmental R&D cooperation.

The paper discusses the learning under four themes and also notes the future learning needed to enable faster and lower-cost improvement and innovative methods for this learning. The four themes are: describing and reporting improvement interventions; the theme of increasing our certainty about attributing effects to implemented improvement changes; the theme of generalizing the learning from one investigation or improvement and the theme of learning for sustainment and scale-up. The paper suggests ways to build on what we learned at the seminar to create and enable faster take up of proven improvements by practitioners and healthcare services so as to benefit more patients more quickly in a variety of settings.

AB Providing viable estimates, understanding project requirements and doing proper risk management on software projects require extensive application and sophisticated techniques of analysis and interpretation. There is still a lack of informative techniques and feedback mechanisms that help to assess how well and efficiently a specific development methodology is performing. Analyzing project tasks would enhance how well individual tasks are estimated, how well they are defined, and whether items are completed on-time and on-budget. In this work, we propose a temporal probabilistic model that addresses feedback control mechanisms in project planning using the Complex Adaptive Systems Software Engineering framework (CASSE). We have tested our approach in industry, with a software development company in South Africa on two commercial project evaluations. Our preliminary results show that the temporal probabilistic model of the framework demonstrably enhances practitioners' understanding in managing software projects profitably - hence increasing business sustainability and management

SO GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Any initiative to coordinate actions, plans, or initiatives to improve the interaction between global health stakeholders finds itself feeding into a vastly complex global system. By utilising complexity theory as part of a new scientific paradigm, complex adaptive behaviour can emerge to create coherence. A suggested global health convention facilitating incremental regime development could be a way to create good governance processes. Minimum specifications could provide wide space for innovation and encourage shared action. Such specifications would be both a product of, and a facilitator for, future generative relationships. The potential empowerment of individuals as a result of this has the potential to transform global health by creating an arena for continual cooperation, interaction and mutual dependence among global stakeholders.

TI Peripheral: Resilient Hydrological Infrastructures
SO INFRASTRUCTURES
AB This article addresses the issue of developing designs of resilient hydrological infrastructures for cities facing sea level rise in the Anthropocene. It undertakes short case studies of differently scaled cities, three in the Global North and three in the Global South. The aim is to investigate the current water management situations in order to reveal potentials for increased urban and environmental resilience. Cities are approached as complex adaptive systems (CAS) negotiating uncertainty that concerns designing for resilience, understood as viable transitions for their interlinked social, ecological, and technological systems (SETS). The main finding is that, despite obvious differences, the six cases are surprisingly similar. Potentials for increased hydrological resilience reside in design approaches that work differently with what is currently deprivileged and considered 'merely' peripheral. Peripheral cities and the peripheries of coastal cities are found to be of key rather than minor adaptive infrastructural import. To reprivilege the peripheral here means to adopt more dynamically flexible, long-term, decentralized, and nonanthropocentric urban design approaches to water and infrastructures. Specifically, this article advocates thinking about water via at least four critical displacements. These displacements point toward alternatives concerning excessively static and land-based designs, short-term planning, overly anthropocentric conceptions of the city environment distinction, and undue centrism in planetary urbanization of the Global North and Global South. In conclusion, this article presents a brief outlook to other cases which suggest that greater resilience potentials are likely to be found in planning for the complexly ecotone city. This works mostly bottom-up from the local regimes for water sensitive infrastructures to regional network designs that can engage with larger climatic and ecological landscapes.

TI On the effective organization of rural settlements spatial structure
   under the transformation and development of mountainous areas in Western
   China: evaluation measurement based on complex adaptability theory
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB The vast majority of rural settlements in Western China are located in the ecologically sensitive and diverse mountainous environment, which also experienced rapid changes in policy and institutional interventions over the past 40 years. At present, in the transitional period of "post-poverty alleviation," they have more opportunities to re-integrate themselves into the large regional development. However, there is a lack of systematic evaluation and cognition of the related functions of the spatial structure between the settlements at the regional village scale and town scale. Therefore, in this paper, the theory of complex adaptive system and its analytical NK model were introduced, and a quantitative measurement framework was constructed for the adaptability level of this kind of rural settlement spatial structure organization so as to explore the effective path for its global optimization. Taking Xinglong Town of Chongqing in the western mountainous area as an example, it was found from the analysis that (1) the number of villages at a high comprehensive adaptation level has increased over time, which has an obvious positive correlation with the construction of transportation network, and a structural adsorption effect. (2) The spatial structure of the rural settlement system in the region has changed from weak industrial nodes - traffic single branch connection - public service decentralized coverage in 2010 to the organizational adaptation characteristics of stable industrial agglomeration - traffic expansion and extension - public service continuous coverage in 2019. (3) The spatial elements related to industry and public service in each village have an increasingly significant impact on the reconstruction and differentiation of its spatial structure. Finally, based on the changing trend of adaptability level and the correlation characteristics of regional space, in this paper, the spatial structure optimization strategy of Xinglong Town is put forward, which provides a reference basis for the coordinated development of the town and village space under the township-level planning in the western region.

   Climate Change Hot Spot: the Coalfields of the Hunter Valley, New South
   Wales, Australia
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB This paper examines the possibilities for transformation of a climate-change hot spot-the coal-producing Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia-using complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory. It uses CAS theory to understand the role of coal in the region's history and efforts to strengthen the ecological, economic, and social resilience of the region's coal industry in the face of demands for a shift from fossil fuel dependency to clean, renewable energy and genuine resilience and sustainability. It uses CAS theory to understand ways in which the resilience of two alternative futures, labeled "Carbon Valley" and "Post-Carbon Society" (Heinberg 2004), might evolve. The paper discusses ways in which changes implemented through the efforts of local communities at local, smaller scales of the nested systems seek to influence the evolution of adaptive cycles of the system at the local, national, and global scales. It identifies the influences of "attractors," defined as factors driving the evolution of the system, that are influential across the panarchy. These include climate change threats, markets, regulatory regimes, political alliances, and local concerns about the environmental and social impacts of the Hunter's coal dependency. These factors are weakening the apparent resilience of the coal industry, which is being propped up by the coal industry corporations, labor unions, and governments to maintain coal dependency in the Carbon Valley. Moreover, they are creating an alternative basin of attraction in which a Post-Carbon Society might emerge from the system's evolutionary processes.

TI Digital Health Testbeds in Sweden: An exploratory study
SO DIGITAL HEALTH
AB Objective This study explored the Swedish digital health testbeds through the lens of complexity science. Methods The purposive sampling was used to identify 38 digital health testbed organizations to conduct interviews in written or audio-conferencing. The interview responses were aggregated and analyzed using thematic analysis. The themes were mainly generated through complexity theory and the principles of complex adaptive systems. Results Fifteen testbed organizations responded, comprising 13 written responses and two audio-conferencing. Five main theoretical themes were generated: agents and diversity, connections and communication, adaptation and learning, perturbations, and path dependence. Agents and diversity depicted different types of testbeds, stakeholders and innovation, and the primary function and purpose of the testbeds. Various factors enhancing connections and communications among multiple stakeholders were identified, such as the quality of e-health solutions and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Some adaptation and learning factors, such as internal reorganization, sharing and creating learning opportunities, and additional funding, guaranteed the sustainability of testbeds. Perturbations were characterized by two factors: non-linear interactions - lack of commitment and transparency in stakeholders' engagement, and uncertainty about testbed definitions and concepts. Path dependence highlighted the importance of history, such as previous positive and negative experiences. Conclusion This study provided insights into testbeds' organization, their functions, how various aspects were challenged, and how they adapted to overcome and improve the system issues. Identifying the stakeholders and relevant factors, commissioning an evaluation, backing up with a contingency plan, securing adequate funding, and disseminating the findings can improve the testbeds' design and implementation.

TI Simulating Institutional Controls on Consumption Patterns in the Commons
SO SYSTEMS RESEARCH AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
AB In 1968, Garrett Hardin identified a class of common goods that suffer under traditional market mechanisms. This paper describes the results of an agent-based computer simulation used to study how institutional forces shape consumption patterns. Overall, when populations generally act in the common interest, the commons, the population and individuals all experience higher quality outcomes than when they act in generally or exclusively self-interested ways. The results suggest common-interested behaviours support a greater population at a higher quality of living; however, exclusively common-interested behaviours result in underutilized commons, and the whole is generally less well off. The paper frames further applications in terms of managing growth for long-term sustainability. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Developing a response to family violence in primary health care: the New
   Zealand experience
SO BMC FAMILY PRACTICE
AB Background: Despite primary health care being recognised as an ideal setting to effectively respond to those experiencing family violence, responses are not widely integrated as part of routine health care. A lack of evidence testing models and approaches for health sector integration, alongside challenges of transferability and sustainability, means the best approach in responding to family violence is still unknown. The Primary Health Care Family Violence Responsiveness Evaluation Tool was developed as a guide to implement a formal systems-led response to family violence within New Zealand primary health care settings. Given the difficulties integrating effective, sustainable responses to family violence, we share the experience of primary health care sites that embarked on developing a response to family violence, presenting the enablers, barriers and resources required to maintain, progress and sustain family violence response development.
   Methods: In this qualitative descriptive study data were collected from two sources. Firstly semi-structured focus group interviews were conducted during 24-month follow-up evaluation visits of primary health care sites to capture the enablers, barriers and resources required to maintain, progress and sustain a response to family violence. Secondly the outcomes of a group activity to identify response development barriers and implementation strategies were recorded during a network meeting of primary health care professionals interested in family violence prevention and intervention; findings were triangulated across the two data sources.
   Results: Four sites, representing three PHOs and four general practices participated in the focus group interviews; 35 delegates from across New Zealand attended the network meeting representing a wider perspective on family violence response development within primary health care. Enablers and barriers to developing a family violence response were identified across four themes: 'Getting started', 'Building effective relationships', 'Sourcing funding' and 'Shaping a national approach to family violence'.
   Conclusions: The strong commitment of key people dedicated to addressing family violence is essential for response sustainability and would be strengthened by prioritising family violence response as a national health target with dedicated resourcing. Further analysis of the health care system as a complex adaptive system may provide insight into effective approaches to response development and health system integration.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
AB The sustainability of agricultural systems is of paramount concern in order to ensure the survival and wellbeing of humans throughout the world. Sustainability is a complex issue involving multiple factors that fit broadly within economic, social and environmental areas. Given its complexity, this paper examines the question of how sustainability can be assessed in a way that gives a holistic picture of the separate and interrelated factors. The paper then presents a literature review, field experience and the use of complex adaptive systems to identify the issues and concerns that need to be addressed during agricultural sustainability assessment and categorizes them into in seven groups: integration of capitals; maintaining resilience, adaptation and transformation; ensuring system performance; involving stakeholders; mixing interdisciplinary views; integration of scales; and practicing good governance. Based on these issues and concerns, a set of indicators are suggested that will assist with holistic agricultural sustainability assessment in a given area.

TI DeCASA in AgriVerse: Parallel Agriculture for Smart Villages in
   Metaverses
SO IEEE-CAA JOURNAL OF AUTOMATICA SINICA
AB The demand for food is tremendously increasing with the growth of the world population, which necessitates the development of sustainable agriculture under the impact of various factors, such as climate change. To fulfill this challenge, we are developing Metaverses for agriculture, referred to as AgriVerse, under our Decentralized Complex Adaptive Systems in Agriculture (DeCASA) project, which is a digital world of smart villages created alongside the development of Decentralized Sciences (DeSci) and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) for Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSSs). Additionally, we provide the architectures, operating modes and major applications of DeCASA in Agri-Verse. For achieving sustainable agriculture, a foundation model based on ACP theory and federated intelligence is envisaged. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities.

AB Blockchain networks have enjoyed remarkable attention the past few years in both the research community and the society at large. Such networks carry the promise of highly decentralized validation and witnessing of important social and economic events, reducing the need to rely on centralized authorities. Public proof-of-work based networks specifically, despite their limitations and challenges, continue to be popular due to their simplicity and intuitiveness. However, for such networks to perpetually meet viability, efficiency, security and environmental sustainability objectives, they need to adapt to environmental changes via continuous reconfiguration of their operating parameters. In this paper, we attempt to formulate this blockchain network adaptability problem as one of control engineering. We sketch the basic characteristics of blockchain networks as systems and identify variables available for designing a controller that allows such networks to attain macroscopic operating objectives. By means of describing and simulating a simple idealized proportional controller, we demonstrate the benefits and some of the challenges in designing such controllers.

TI Macroethical systems and sustainability science
SO SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
AB The Industrial Revolution and associated economic, demographic, technological and cultural changes have resulted in what many scientists are beginning to refer to as "the Anthropocene" - roughly translated, the Age of Humans. One response to this development is the nascent field of "sustainability science," a multidisciplinary and systemic attempt to perceive and understand this new era. In doing so, however, methodologies and intellectual frameworks must be developed which extend beyond existing, dominantly reductionist, approaches, and are intended to address emergent characteristics of complex systems that integrate cultural and social systems, the engineered and built environment and natural systems. In the area of ethics, this requires developing a capability for "macroethics," or ethical systems and processes capable of addressing issues arising from the emergent behavior of the complicated systems that characterize the Anthropocene.

TI Hardin's legacy as a need for a 'commoning turn' in planning
SO PLANNING THEORY
AB Hardin's legacy in planning is highly relevant to current concerns, as planners shape the management of resources in the face of climate change and urbanization. Through a broad literature review of planning articles citing Hardin's 'Tragedy of the Commons' we find out that Hardin's suggestions are rejected by planning theory, yet have been implemented in planning practice. However, the rejection of Hardin's suggestions, has evolved in an ongoing and growing 'commons trend' in social science. We review the presence of this trend in contemporary planning literature. Our results call for a turn towards the commons in planning, that is, for a dialogue between planning and the heterogeneous ideas embedded within the commons trend - a necessary endeavour if we are to address several critical planning questions of today.

TI Development Trajectories and Complex Systems-Informed Theories of Change
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EVALUATION
AB This article presents an approach to use complex adaptive systems thinking to construct a theory of change to plan and evaluate transformational interventions. The article draws on the concepts of domains, scales, agents, and emergence to build a model of the system targeted by the intervention, to identify the chains of causality driving the system, and to identify the most influential enabling conditions affecting the system's development trajectory. Using the case study of the Indonesia SMART-Fish project, the article illustrates how to use such a theory of change to understand how a program interacts with the phenomena and how to assess the extent to which a program contributes to a development trajectory consistent with the intended long term transformational objectives. The article also illustrates how to use network analysis tools and simple data visualization techniques in ways that engage stakeholders in evaluation design, data collection and analysis.

TI Managing the Marine Environment: Is the DPSIR Framework Holistic Enough?
SO SYSTEMS RESEARCH AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
AB Ever increasing and diverse use of the marine environment and consequent impacts on marine life, habitats and landscapes make prominent the need for policy and policy-making procedures that promote resilience and sustainability. In this paper, we focus on the DriversPressuresState ChangesImpactsResponses (DPSIR) framework, which seeks to represent and hence enable the management of key relationships formed between natural systems, designed systems and social systems. The DPSIR framework is widely used to assess and manage the impact of policy changes and associated problems; however, a change is evident in recent applications of the approach: an expert-driven, evidence-focussed mode of use is giving way to the use of the framework as a heuristic device to facilitate engagement, communication and understanding between different stakeholders. In this paper, an assessment is made of how holistic DPSIR practice is in the context of the marine environment and we argue that the paradigmatic turn from realist to interpretivist reveals the DPSIR approach's multiparadigmatic and holistic potential.

TI What is the story with sustainability? A narrative analysis of diverse
   and contested understandings
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES AND SCIENCES
AB Since the coining of the term "sustainability/sustainable development," diverse and contested understandings of sustainability theory and practice have circulated both within the academy and the public at large. For the most part, sustainability has been approached from a very science-dominated perspective. That is only part of the story: while science is important for sustainability, science alone cannot account for the many situated dimensions of life. In contrast to science, story-or narrative-as both a mode of knowing and process of knowledge construction, can account for life's place-, time-, and event-dependent dimensions. This paper performs a narrative analysis of eight different conceptual frameworks of sustainability-Deep Ecology, Social Ecology, Ecofeminism, Environmental History and Human Geography/Ecology, Complex Adaptive Systems, Political Ecology, Ecological Economics, and Business and Sustainability-to identify where these frameworks are commensurate and irreconcilable, with the aim of exploring a coherent alternative to current practice and conventional ways of thinking.

TI Assessing the effects of water restrictions on socio-hydrologic
   resilience for shared groundwater systems
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB Groundwater resources are shared across management boundaries. Multiple management units that differ in scale, constraints and objectives may manage a shared resource in a decentralized approach. The interactions among water managers, water users, and the water resource components influence the performance of management strategies and the resilience of community-level water supply and groundwater availability. This research develops an agent-based modeling (ABM) framework to capture the dynamic interactions among household-level consumers and policy makers to simulate water demands. The ABM is coupled with a groundwater model to evaluate effects on the groundwater table. The framework is applied to explore trade-offs between improvements in water supply sustainability for local resources and water table changes at the basin-level. A group of municipalities are simulated as agents who share access to a groundwater aquifer in Verde River Basin, Arizona. The framework provides a holistic approach to incorporate water user, municipal, and basin level objectives in evaluating water reduction strategies for long-term water resilience.

Emerging understanding of how humanity can live appreciatively within complex adaptive systems (Planet Earth, ecosystems, cities, etc.). Strategies of Appreciative Inquiry - as model for decision-making and strategic change - that provide the data needed to live appreciatively, co-adapt with complexity, and thrive by living within complex systems. Explores the integrative management of energy, water and food systems -WEF Security Nexus - as catalyst for living within complex systems; and how integrative management builds self-reliance and local eco-entrepreneurs essential to achieving the global goal of sustainability.
   Overview of Sustainable Communities Institute's (SCI) application of knowledge about complex systems, living appreciatively, and AI strategies to help communities interconnect sustainability's triple bottom line - ecological, social and economic - with appreciative system dynamics, to empower communities to thrive by living sustainably. How SCI facilitates appreciation of ecological systems as primary human supports, infrastructural systems as secondary supports, and the built-environment as tertiary supports; and sustainable development as synergy of the three to sustain full-functionality of the complex system upon which we rely. Overview of SCI projects including ones focused on optimizing the WEF Security Nexus and others focused on enhancing the ability of a key system - e.g., food system - to catalyze community change to thriving in the current context of accelerating system change.
   Concludes with discussion of new potential unleashed by integratively managing the WEF Security Nexus and the three levels of human supports as catalyst for living sustainably; tools for assessing the degree to which this change is occurring, and co-adaptive processes for facilitating emergence of community self-reliance and the ability to thrive during the current turbulent time of complex system change.

TI Societal Change Systems: A Framework to Address Wicked Problems
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
AB Problems referred to as wicked, messy, complex, and meta-level, by their very nature, require involving multiple and diverse organizations. Issues such as climate change, poverty, sustainable agriculture, and health care involve many hundreds of organizations at a national level; at a global level this easily increases to many thousands. Emerging their collective power into an effective force represents an enormous organizing challenge. Drawing from complexity and global networking knowledge, and building on the concept of innovation system, this article develops the concept of societal change system as a framework to support addressing the organizing challenge. This arose through analysis of global change initiatives aiming to integrate sustainability concerns into the production of electricity, which included a meeting of leaders of such change initiatives. The activities produced recommendations for greatly enhancing change efforts with pragmatic steps to develop the societal change system in which they are embedded.

SO SEARCH-JOURNAL OF MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION RESEARCH
AB In an unfolding scenario of environmental gloom and doom where humans have become the key disruptors and exploiters of nature, our article presents an optimistic and hopeful approach to how humans may interact with nature on nature's premises-with reverence. To illustrate this communicative praxis, we carry out cross-case analyses of two real-life scenarios that we label "picking our oysters" and "swimming with our whales," revealing how human beings interacting with others and nature through locally situated tourism interventions can spark cascading interactional effects into yet newer and expanding communities of caring for nature. When such happens, we contend that it represents the kind of sustainable development that the world badly needs, especially in the present perilous times. We contend that the insights emerging from our cross-case analyses have wide-ranging implications for both scholars and practitioners of tourism and communication-that is, collaborative local interactions, actions, and interventions can cascade into emergent and resilient sustainable development practices.

SO HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS REDESIGNED: From Perpetuation to Innovation to
   Student Success
SE SUNY series, Critical Issues in Higher Education
AB Public higher education systems are under pressure to transform in ways that might meaningfully and sustainably improve the educational achievement of their students. But, to date, higher education has a weak history of academic innovations that have led to these kinds of transformations. This is not due to some extraordinary resistance to change, but rather to the complexities inherent in the academic institutional culture that keep higher education from fitting neatly into traditional innovation adoption models. Recently, we took time to reflect on the University System of Maryland's successful eight-year, systemwide course redesign initiative in order to evaluate the System's role in enabling academic innovation to generate transformational change. Using complex adaptive systems theory as a framework for analysis, this chapter reports the findings of that qualitative self-study of the system's role in leading academic change-specifically, the extent to which USM was able to cultivate a culture of innovation across its member institutions.

In this communication we propose that disarray of pericytes plays a central role in emerge of Long COVID. We assume pericytes are agents with "Triple-A" qualities, i.e., analyze-adapt and advance, necessary for sustainability of host homeostasis. Based on this view, we further suggest Long COVID may provide a model system to integrate system theory and complex adaptive systems to explore a new class of maladies those are currently not well defined and with no remedies.

AB This paper explores the question of what systems thinking adds to the field of global health. Observing that elements of systems thinking are already common in public health research, the article discusses which of the large body of theories, methods, and tools associated with systems thinking are more useful. The paper reviews the origins of systems thinking, describing a range of the theories, methods, and tools. A common thread is the idea that the behavior of systems is governed by common principles that can be discovered and expressed. They each address problems of complexity, which is a frequent challenge in global health. The different methods and tools are suited to different types of inquiry and involve both qualitative and quantitative techniques. The paper concludes by emphasizing that explicit models used in systems thinking provide new opportunities to understand and continuously test and revise our understanding of the nature of things, including how to intervene to improve people's health.

TI Perspectives of Australian hospital leaders on the provision of safe
   care: implications for safety I and safety II
SO JOURNAL OF HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose There is evidence that patient safety has not improved commensurate with the global attention and resources dedicated to achieving it. The authors explored the perspectives of hospital leaders on the challenges of leading safe care. Design/methodology/approach This paper reports the findings of a three-year longitudinal study of eight Australian hospitals. A representative sample of hospital leaders, comprising board members, senior and middle managers and clinical leaders, participated in focus groups twice a year from 2015 to 2017. Findings Although the participating hospitals had safety I systems, the leaders consistently reported that they relied predominantly on their competent well-meaning staff to ensure patient safety, more of a safety II perspective. This trust was based on perceptions of the patient safety actions of staff, rather than actual knowledge about staff abilities or behaviours. The findings of this study suggest this hegemonic relational trust was a defence mechanism for leaders in complex adaptive systems (CASs) unable to influence care delivery at the front line and explores potential contributing factors to these perceptions. Practical implications In CASs, leaders have limited control over the bedside care processes and so have little alternative but to trust in "good staff providing good care" as a strategy for safe care. However, trust, coupled with a predominantly safety 1 approach is not achieving harm reduction. The findings of the study suggest that the beliefs the leaders held about the role their staff play in assuring safe care contribute to the lack of progress in patient safety. The authors recommend three evidence-based leadership activities to transition to the proactive safety II approach to pursuing safe care. Originality/value This is the first longitudinal study to provide the perspectives of leaders on the provision of quality and safety in their hospitals. A large sample of board members, managers and clinical leaders provides extensive data on their perspectives on quality and safety.

AB The smart electric power grid will evolve into a very complex adaptive system under semi-autonomous distributed control. It will be spatially and temporally complex, non-convex, non-linear and non-stationary, with lots of variability and uncertainties beyond what the traditional power system experiences today. The distributed integration of intermittent sources of energy and energy storage to a power grid further adds complexity and challenges to modeling, control and optimization of the grid. Innovative control technologies are needed to handle the growing complexity of a smart grid, maximize the penetration of renewable energy, and provide maximum utilization of available energy storage, especially plug-in electric vehicles. In this panel paper, innovative control technologies, which are dynamic, stochastic, computational and scalable, and which show promise for achieving the goals of a smart grid, are presented.

TI Analysis of the Gulf of California cannonball jellyfish fishery as a
   complex system
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Cannonball jellyfish has become the target of an important seasonal fishery in the Gulf of California. Research has focused mainly on biological and management aspects, yet linkages and dynamics between social and ecological components have received less attention. Based on an analysis of stakeholder perceptions and its comparison with available quantitative data, this study provides a holistic view of the fishery and its actors as part of a complex adaptive system. Stakeholders include artisanal fishers, owners of improvised and permanent processing plants, foreign buyers and funders, local managers, Mexican management entities, women, and Indigenous communities. Policy guidelines and management actions must address sustainability within various dimensions as understood by those interviewed: social equity, economic benefits, and environmental responsibility. To transition to sustainability, a transdisciplinary research approach is needed to provide management advice and to strengthen fishery governance through co-management decision-making strategies.

TI Shaping, adapting and reserving the right to play: Responding to
   uncertainty in high quality cassava flour value chains in Nigeria
SO JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explain why the high quality cassava flour (HQCF) value chain in Nigeria has not performed as well as expected. The specific objectives are to: analyse important sources of uncertainty influencing HQCF value chains; explore stakeholders' strategies to respond to uncertainty; and highlight the implications of different adaptation strategies for equity and the environment in the development of the value chain.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors used a conceptual framework based on complex adaptive systems to analyse the slow development of the value chain for HQCF in Nigeria, with a specific focus on how key stakeholders have adapted to uncertainty. The paper is based on information from secondary sources and grey literature. In particular, the authors have drawn heavily on project documents of the Cassava: Adding Value for Africa project (2008 to present), which is funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and on the authors' experience with this project.
   Findings Policy changes; demand and supply of HQCF; availability and price of cassava roots; supply and cost of energy are major sources of uncertainty in the chain. Researchers and government have shaped the chain through technology development and policy initiatives. Farmers adapted by selling cassava to rival chains, while processors adapted by switching to rival cassava products, reducing energy costs and vertical integration. However, with uncertainties in HQCF supply, the milling industry has reserved the right to play. Vertical integration offers millers a potential solution to uncertainty in HQCF supply, but raises questions about social and environmental outcomes in the chain.
   Research limitations/implications The use of the framework of complex adaptive systems helped to explain the development of the HQCF value chain in Nigeria. The authors identified sources of uncertainty that have been pivotal in restricting value chain development, including changes in policy environment, the demand for and supply of HQCF, the availability and price of cassava roots, and the availability and cost of energy for flour processing. Value chain actors have responded to these uncertainties in different ways. Analysing these responses in terms of adaptation provides useful insights into why the value chain for HQCF in Nigeria has been so slow to develop.
   Social implications Recent developments suggest that the most effective strategy for the milling industry to reduce uncertainty in the HQCF value chain is through vertical integration, producing their own cassava roots and flour. This raises concerns about equity. Until now, it has been assumed that the development of the value chain for HQCF can combine both growth and equity objectives. The validity of this assumption now seems to be open to question. The extent to which these developments of HQCF value chains can combine economic growth, equity and environmental objectives, as set out in the sustainable development goals, is an open question.
   Originality/value The originality lies in the analysis of the development of HQCF value chains in Nigeria through the lens of complex adaptive systems, with a particular focus on uncertainty and adaptation. In order to explore adaptation, the authors employ Courtney et al.'s (1997) conceptualization of business strategy under conditions of uncertainty. They argue that organisations can assume three strategic postures in response to uncertainty and three types of actions to implement that strategy. This combination of frameworks provides a fresh means of understanding the importance of uncertainty and different actors' strategies in the development of value chains in a developing country context.

TI Saving species beyond the protected area fence: Threats must be managed
   across multiple land tenure types to secure Australia's endangered
   species
SO CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
AB The main effort to secure threatened species globally is to set aside land and sea for their conservation via governance arrangements such as protected areas. But not even the biggest protected area estate will cover enough area to halt most species declines. Consequently, there is a need for assessments of how species habitats are distributed across the tenure landscape, to guide policy and conservation opportunities. Using Australia as a case study, we assess the relationship between land tenure coverage and the distributions of nationally listed threatened species. We discover that on average, nearly half (48%) of Australian threatened species' distributions occur on privately owned (freehold) lands, despite this tenure covering only 29% of the continent. In contrast, leasehold lands, which cover 38% of Australia, overlap with only 6% of species' distributions while protected area lands (which cover 20%) have an average of 35% of species' distributions. We found the majority (75%; n = 1199) of species occur across multiple land tenures, and those species that are confined to a single tenure were mostly on freehold lands (13%; n = 201) and protected areas (9%; n = 139). Our findings display the opportunity to reverse the current trend of species decline with increased coordination of threat management across land tenures.

TI Spatial Designation of Critical Habitats for Endangered and Threatened
   Species in the United States
SO JOURNAL OF MAP & GEOGRAPHY LIBRARIES
AB Establishing biological reserves or "hot spots" for endangered and threatened species is critical to support real-world species regulatory and management problems. Geographic data on the distribution of endangered and threatened species can be used to improve ongoing efforts for species conservation in the United States. At present no spatial database exists which maps out the location of endangered species for the US. However, spatial descriptions do exist for the habitat associated with all endangered species, but in a form not readily suitable to use in a geographic information system (GIS). In our study, the principal challenge was extracting spatial data describing these critical habitats for 472 species from over 1000 pages of the Federal Register. In addition, an appropriate database schema was designed to accommodate the different tiers of information associated with the species along with the confidence of designation; the interpreted location data was geo-referenced to the county enumeration unit producing a spatial database of endangered species for the whole of US. The significance of these critical habitat designations, database scheme and methodologies will be discussed.

TI The emergence of entrepreneurial ecosystems based on enabling
   technologies: Evidence from synthetic biology
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB Certain technologies have the potential to spawn an entrepreneurial ecosystem, but this potential is not always realized. Some of these technologies that could enable prosperous and sustainable ecosystems struggle at the threshold of ecosystem emergence. In this paper, we use an in-depth case study of an emergent entrepreneurial ecosystem based on an enabling technology-synthetic biology-to identify the structural, societal, and ethical barriers to ecosystem growth. The structural barriers mainly relate to the lack of an ecosystem framework to manage intellectual property in complex interactions. The societal barriers concern the clock speed conflict between parts of the quintuple helix entrepreneurial ecosystem, and the ethical barriers arise from the widespread impact of enabling technologies in combination with the diffusion of ethical responsibility throughout the ecosystem. We also discuss both the theoretical and managerial implications of these barriers.

AB Collaborative networked environments emerged with the spread of the internet, contributing to overcome past communication barriers, and identifying interoperability as an essential property. When achieved seamlessly, efficiency is increased in the entire product life cycle. Nowadays, most organizations try to attain interoperability by establishing peer-to-peer mappings with the different partners, or in optimized networks, by using international standard models as the core for information exchange. In current industrial practice, mappings are only defined once, and the morphisms that represent them, are hardcoded in the enterprise systems. This solution has been effective for static environments, where enterprise and product models are valid for decades. However, with an increasingly complex and dynamic global market, models change frequently to answer new customer requirements. This paper draws concepts from the complex systems science and proposes a framework for sustainable systems interoperability in dynamic networks, enabling different organizations to evolve at their own rate.

TI CAS and ABM-based Demolition Waste Management Research in the AEC
   Industry
SO FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT
AB With the increase of the urban population and the rapid development of urbanization in China, a large number of old buildings will be demolished and produce a huge amount of waste. Currently the recycling ratio of old building materials is very low, which results in the problems of resource waste and environment pollution. This greatly challenges urban sustainable development. With respect to the continual growth of demolition waste quantities, it is urgent to research how to implement effective management of demolition wastes by focusing on the demolition agents' behavior. Based on the theory of complexity, this paper analyzes the demolition waste management from the perspective of complex adaptive system. Taking into account the "green" demolition (building dismantling) and conventional demolition (building demolished) methods, the agent-based modeling method with Repast Simphony platform is applied to simulate interactions between demolition agents. The longitudinal trend of demolition waste quantities is forecasted.

TI Invasions and extinctions through the looking glass of evolutionary
   ecology
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Invasive and endangered species reflect opposite ends of a spectrum of ecological success, yet they experience many similar eco-evolutionary challenges including demographic bottlenecks, hybridization and novel environments. Despite these similarities, important differences exist. Demographic bottlenecks are more transient in invasive species, which (i) maintains ecologically relevant genetic variation, (ii) reduces mutation load, and (iii) increases the efficiency of natural selection relative to genetic drift. Endangered species are less likely to benefit from admixture, which offsets mutation load but also reduces fitness when populations are locally adapted. Invading species generally experience more benign environments with fewer natural enemies, which increases fitness directly and also indirectly by masking inbreeding depression. Adaptive phenotypic plasticity can maintain fitness in novel environments but is more likely to evolve in invasive species encountering variable habitats and to be compromised by demographic factors in endangered species. Placed in an eco-evolutionary context, these differences affect the breadth of the ecological niche, which arises as an emergent property of antagonistic selection and genetic constraints. Comparative studies of invasions and extinctions that apply an eco-evolutionary perspective could provide new insights into the environmental and genetic basis of ecological success in novel environments and improve efforts to preserve global biodiversity.

TI Environmental Governance for the Anthropocene? Social-Ecological
   Systems, Resilience, and Collaborative Learning
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The Anthropocene is characterized by rapid global change, necessitating adaptive governance. But how can such adaptive governance be operationalized? The article offers a three-point argument to approach this question. First, people and environment need to be considered together, as social (human) and ecological (biophysical) subsystems are linked by mutual feedbacks, and are interdependent and co-evolutionary. These integrated systems of humans and environment (social-ecological systems) provide an appropriate unit of analysis. Second, the resilience approach deals with change in multilevel complex systems, and has stimulated much of the adaptive governance literature by addressing uncertainty and adaptation to unforeseen future changes. Third, there is a need to foster collaborative approaches to improve social and institutional learning, as for example in adaptive management, collaborative learning networks, and knowledge co-production. Collaborative learning is perhaps where further research, experimentation, and application might make a difference for operationalizing adaptive governance, with a focus on institutions, at all levels from local to international.

AB Integrated environmental resources management is a purposeful activity with the goal to maintain and improve the state of an environmental resource affected by human activities. In many cases different goals are in conflict and the notion "integrated" clearly indicates that resources management should be approached from a broad perspective taking all potential trade-offs and different scales in space and time into account. However, we are yet far from putting into practice integrated resources management fully taking into account the complexity of human-technology-environment systems. The tradition of resources management and of dealing with environmental problems is characterized by a command and control approach. The increasing awareness for the complexity of environmental problems and of human-technology-environment systems has triggered the development of new management approaches. The paper discusses the importance of focusing on the transition to new management paradigms based on the insight that the systems to be managed are complex adaptive systems. It provides arguments for the role of social learning processes and the need to develop methods combining approaches from hard and soft systems analysis. Soft systems analysis focuses on the importance of subjective perceptions and socially constructed reality. Soft systems methods and group model building techniques are quite common in management science where the prime target of management has always been the social system. Resources management is still quite slow to take up such innovations that should follow as a logical consequence of adopting an integrated management approach. Integrated water resources management is used as example to provide evidence for the need to implement participatory and adaptive management approaches that are able to cope with increasing uncertainties arising from fast changing socio-economic conditions and global and climate change. Promising developments and future research directions are discussed. The paper concludes with pointing out the need for changes in the scientific community to improve the conditions for interdisciplinary, system-oriented and trans-disciplinary research.

The former perceive public policy and economic constraints, the latter clinical or patient-centred strategies as the means to achieving a desired outcome.
   Design Theoretical development and critical analysis of a complex health system model. Results and conclusions We introduce the concept of the health care vortex as a metaphor by which to understand the complex adaptive nature of health systems, and the degree to which their behaviour is predetermined by their 'shared values' or attractors. We contrast the likely functions and outcomes of a health system with a people- centred attractor and one with a financial attractor. This analysis suggests a shift in the system's attractor is fundamental to progress health reform thinking.

AB The transition perspective on promoting sustainable development recognizes a need for not merelynewsocietal practices, but changes in the structures in which these practices are embedded, and which have co-evolved with earlier practices ('the regime'). This article presents insights on the dynamics of sustainable transitions, developed within the context of the Dutch KSI programme, and identifies issues for further research.
   Two perspectives, the sociotechnical approach and the complex adaptive systems approach, have yielded typologies of transition trajectories. We discuss similarities of, and differences between, these. Third, the governance perspective has generated insights about the agency involved, including powering and legitimization. While the latter offers some response to scholarly criticism that earlier transition theory too much ignored aspects of power and legitimacy, more research is obviously needed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.

TI Innovative use of the integrative review to evaluate evidence of
   technology transformation in healthcare
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS
AB Healthcare is in a period significant transformational activity through the accelerated adoption of healthcare technologies, new reimbursement systems that emphasize shared savings and care coordination, and the common place use of mobile technologies by patients, providers, and others. The complexity of healthcare creates barriers to transformational activity and has the potential to inhibit the desired paths toward change envisioned by policymakers. Methods for understanding how change is occurring within this complex environment are important to the evaluation of delivery system reform and the role of technology in healthcare transformation. This study examines the use on an integrative review methodology to evaluate the healthcare literature for evidence of technology transformation in healthcare. The methodology integrates the evaluation of a broad set of literature with an established evaluative framework to develop a more complete understanding of a particular topic. We applied this methodology and the framework of punctuated equilibrium (PEq) to the analysis of the healthcare literature from 2004 to 2012 for evidence of technology transformation, a time during which technology was at the forefront of healthcare policy. The analysis demonstrated that the established PEq framework applied to the literature showed considerable potential for evaluating the progress of policies that encourage healthcare transformation. Significant inhibitors to change were identified through the integrative review and categorized into ten themes that describe the resistant structure of healthcare delivery: variations in the environment; market complexity; regulations; flawed risks and rewards; change theories; barriers; ethical considerations; competition and sustainability; environmental elements, and internal elements. We hypothesize that the resistant nature of the healthcare system described by this study creates barriers to the direct consumer involvement and engagement necessary for transformational change. Future policies should be directed at removing these barriers by demanding and emphasizing open technologies and unrestricted access to data versus as currently prescribed by technology vendors, practitioners, and policies that perpetuate market equilibrium.

TI Perspective: What Will It Cost to Scale-up Breastfeeding Programs? A
   Comparison of Current Global Costing Methodologies
SO ADVANCES IN NUTRITION
AB Breastfeeding is one of the most feasible and cost-effective maternal-child health interventions. Currently, global investments needed to achieve the WHO global nutrition target for exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) do not meet the recommended standards for economic investment and implementation of policies supporting mothers to breastfeed. Estimating implementation costs of high-quality, high-impact programs based on each country's enabling environment and specific context is essential for developing and prioritizing recommendations that can drive the successful scaling-up of breastfeeding programs globally. We provide a detailed comparison (strengths, limitations, and gaps) of the 2 most recent global cost analysis frameworks used to estimate financial needs for scaling-up breastfeeding interventions from World Breastfeeding Costing Initiative (WBCi) and the World Bank. Our comparison found that the World Bank presents the more advanced costing methodology for scaling-up breastfeeding programs. However, there is a need to adapt and improve this costing framework to guide individual countries based on key contextual factors that consider the complexity of health systems.

TI Sustainability in global production networks - Introducing the notion of
   extended supplier networks
SO COMPETITION & CHANGE
AB Research considering globalized production as taking place within global production networks and global value chains has potential to provide insights into the challenges of sustainable production. However, studies employing these approaches to look at manufactured products have often concentrated on connections between lead buyers and upper tier suppliers and given insufficient attention to exploring interactions across all stages of production. In this article, the concept of extended supplier networks is introduced to address this gap by explicitly looking at how all stages of production are connected. The extended supplier network model that is presented provides an analytical framework that enables multiple scales of analysis in the study of sustainability challenges.

TI Massive Institutional Structures in Global Governance
SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS
AB Global governance consists of elementary regimes that form regime complexes, which in turn give rise to what we call superclusters around broad policy domains. In recent years, scholars have explored what these macroscopic structures look like and how they evolve over time. Yet the complex ways in which entire governance superclusters interact and coevolve, and what might emerge through this process, have not received much attention. In this article, we expand the ontological frontier of global governance research by offering a first bird's-eye view on supercluster-level institutional interaction with an empirical focus on trade and environment. We constructed and analyzed a dynamic network-of-networks model, revealing a supercluster complex , a massive institutional structure in global governance consisting of two or more interlocking superclusters that exert a measurable influence on each other's course of development. We theorize that the supercluster complex serves as an institutional fabric that enables the degree of self-organized coordination observed between the trade and environment policy domains. Our preliminary findings warrant more research on supercluster complexes as an important but little-noticed phenomenon in global governance.

TI Building the Evidence for Dedicated Education Unit Sustainability and
   Partnership Success
SO NURSING EDUCATION PERSPECTIVES
AB AIM To evaluate the sustairiahility of dedicated education units (DEUs) within an academic-service partnership.
   BACKGROUND A two-year, multisite, mixed-methods study with a randomized control trial was designed to isolate the effects of the DEU innovation on clinical education quality, teaching capacity. work life: and productivity.
   METHOD Interview data from 34 participants were analyzed for interactions and behaviors that indicated sustainability.
   RESULTS Seven themes portrayed successful participant interactions: revealing shifting roles based on mutual respect and collaboration among engaged partners working within complex adaptive systems. Relationship building and partnership achievements were confirmed as key components in DEU sustainability.
   CONCLUSION Sustainable, mature clinical education partnerships depend on implementing routinizing: reinforcing, recognizing: and rewarding activities. Unit level success relies on foundational structures that support the ongoing development of DEU clinical instructors. DEU sustainability will depend on the continual creation of new meaning for participants and the generation of new resources and results.

TI Governance in the Face of Extreme Events: Lessons from Evolutionary
   Processes for Structuring Interventions, and the Need to Go Beyond
SO ECOSYSTEMS
AB The increasing frequency of extreme events, exogenous and endogenous, poses challenges for our societies. The current pandemic is a case in point; but "once-in-a-century" weather events are also becoming more common, leading to erosion, wildfire and even volcanic events that change ecosystems and disturbance regimes, threaten the sustainability of our life-support systems, and challenge the robustness and resilience of societies. Dealing with extremes will require new approaches and large-scale collective action. Preemptive measures can increase general resilience, a first line of protection, while more specific reactive responses are developed. Preemptive measures also can minimize the negative effects of events that cannot be avoided. In this paper, we first explore approaches to prevention, mitigation and adaptation, drawing inspiration from how evolutionary challenges have made biological systems robust and resilient, and from the general theory of complex adaptive systems. We argue further that proactive steps that go beyond will be necessary to reduce unacceptable consequences.

TI Systemic Understanding of Coopetitive Behaviour in a Latin American
   Technological Park
SO SYSTEMIC PRACTICE AND ACTION RESEARCH
AB The purpose of this article is to construct a systemic structure to explain the relations subjacent to the coopetitive behaviour observed in a Latin American technological park. The research method is qualitative modelling. The primary research technique is the in-depth interview with park experts. Systemic language organised the speeches. The systemic language uses symbols that represent the elements of a system, such as variables, relations, and feedback loops. Initially, we constructed two essential archetypes that describe how the need for coopetition emerged, triggered by failures in meeting customersA ' demands and reduced sales. Then, we built an overall systemic structure relying on the essential archetypes, which explains how the coopetitive strategy emerged in the park. The main conclusion reached by the study is learning and public policies as desirable conditions; failure in meeting customers' requirements as the trigger; and sustainability, knowledge and resource sharing, mitigation of risks and uncertainties, and increased sales by price reduction, as reinforcing feedback factors. The main contribution of the study is a systemic qualitative model that helps understanding how to implement or manage a coopetitive strategy in a network formed of companies mainly driven by technological factors.

TI The use of group work and journal writing in reinventing development
   planning for sustainability under complexity
SO TOWN AND REGIONAL PLANNING
AB Since 2002 Stellenbosch has offered a multidisciplinary Masters programme in Planning, Management and Practice of Sustainable Development (with a specialisation in development planning), offered mainly for working adult students. One of the challenges of developing a curriculum for this degree is that sustainable development (SD) and 'development planning', the focal points of the programme, are potentially very broad concepts, requiring the exploration of a variety of complex challenges in the African context, moving beyond the traditional spatial focus of planning in South Africa. This article explores the various potential meanings of SD, as well as its link with complexity thinking, systems thinking and complex adaptive systems and its implications for planning education and curriculum development. Complex adaptive systems thrive on diversity, creativity, and innovation. The programme is not about spoon-feeding, but about allowing space to explore and discover for oneself the diverse interpretations, tensions and contradictions inherent in planning, development and sustainability. Most concepts (participation, sustainability, planning, development, and so on) have a whole continuum of possible meanings between polar opposites, and it is important to make students aware of the language games people play in order to enable them to move beyond the cliches, myths and spin. Self-managed learning is an important element of this programme and innovative methods have to be found to teach the basics (to kick-start the learning) and create the pre-conditions for lifelong learning, as well as instil the critical, questioning, and imaginative attitude needed to invent the sustainable future we need. In addition to formal lectures and discussion classes, writing skill workshops to teach the important skill of writing, two of the more innovative teaching techniques used to try and bridge the teaching divide are journal writing and group work. In the real world, actor collaboration and group processes are very important methods of building knowledge. Since SD does not have a fixed meaning and is value-laden and multi-(or trans-) disciplinary, it requires democratic and deliberative public processes to give meaning to the concept. For this reason, group work forms an important element of the teaching curriculum and students are required to give feedback on the group process after each exercise and in their journals. The purpose of the journal writing is also to try to stimulate deep, rather than superficial learning and to help make the linkages in support of transdisciplinary learning, where learners are taught to make connections between social, political, economic, biological and physical dimensions and to make use of more holistic ways of thinking. Journal writing and reflections on group work have demonstrated many learning benefits, but also the need for more structure and guidance to steer individual learning processes.

TI Prioritising the eradication of invasive species from island
   archipelagos with high reinvasion risk
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB Eradicating invasive species from islands is a proven method for safeguarding threatened and endangered species from extinction. Island eradications can deliver lasting benefits, but require large up-front expenditure of limited conservation resources. The choice of islands must therefore be prioritised. Numerous tools have been developed to prioritise island eradications, but none fully account for the risk of those eradicated species later returning to the island: reinvasion. In this paper, we develop a prioritisation method for island eradications that accounts for the complexity of the reinvasion process. By merging spatially explicit metapopulation modelling with stochastic dynamic optimisation techniques, we construct a decision-support tool that optimises conservation outcomes in the presence of reinvasion risk. We applied this tool to two different case studies-rat (Rattus rattus) invasions in the Seaforth archipelago in New Zealand, and cane toad (Rhinella marina) invasions in the Dampier archipelago in Australia-to illustrate how state-dependent optimal policies can maximise expected conservation gains. In both case studies, incorporating reinvasion risk dramatically altered the optimal order of island eradications, and improved the potential conservation benefits. The increase in benefits was larger in Dampier than Seaforth (42% improvement versus 6%), as a consequence of both the characteristics of the invasive species, and the arrangement of the islands. Synthesis and applications. Our results illustrate the potential consequences of ignoring reinvasion risk. We recommend that reinvasion risk be explicitly included in any island eradication prioritisation involving an archipelago, particularly when some islands are close to the mainland.

TI DyNet-LCCA: a simulation framework for dynamic network-level life- cycle
   cost analysis in evolving infrastructure systems
SO SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE
AB Civil infrastructure systems transform over the long-term due to complex interactions among socio-environmental stressors, degradation of physical networks, and decision-making processes of infrastructure agencies. To incorporate such complex transformation mechanisms into infrastructure cost management, this study integrates simulation modeling and life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) to create a framework for dynamic network-level LCCA in infrastructure systems. The proposed framework was implemented using a multi-agent simulation model in a numerical case study related to a road network affected by sea-level rise, population growth, and uncertain maintenance funding. The results include identification of several state transition, and tipping point behaviors at which small changes in service demand, maintenance budget, and adaptation investment may result in significant improvement in network cost and performance conditions. The results show the capability of the proposed framework in modeling the long-term trajectories of life-cycle costs at the network level under different stressors and decision scenarios.

TI Enhancing the sustainability of school improvement initiatives
SO SCHOOL EFFECTIVENESS AND SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT
AB Schools address students' educational needs by delivering a range of traditional and innovative programs. Selecting, implementing, and sustaining a new program is a school improvement initiative. Despite investments of (often) substantial resources, many such programs have relatively short school lives. Effective educational initiatives need to survive in order to continue to deliver personal, social, and economic benefits. However, practical guidance for sustainable implementation of new initiatives in school settings is relatively lacking. Drawing from literature and interviews with 70 school leaders and teachers, we created and delivered to 10 educational sites a self-assessment site improvement tool. Principal components analysis identified 20 components, and feedback from sites indicated the practical usefulness of the tool. Adopting a systems perspective with explicit attention to interactions between goals, processes, and emerging outcomes has the potential to generate more thorough consideration of the range of components that influence sustained program implementation leading to site improvement.

SO MARINE POLICY
AB The ocean is threatened by climate change, overexploitation, pollution, habitat loss, and other pressures as well as their cumulative impacts. Over 60% of the ocean that lies in areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ) is particularly vulnerable. Many are seeking practical measures to make the ocean more resilient. This paper evaluates how key ingredients for enhancing resilience might be applied to ABNJ management and governance. In doing so, it aims to enhance the resilience of both marine ecosystems as well as their governance systems. It also throws light on how the emerging treaty on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ) could contribute to it. A BBNJ treaty based on principles and approaches to safeguard resilience could help marine ecosystems cope with the growing anthropogenic threats and improve the effectiveness of management activities.

TI Holistic Investment Framework for Cloud Computing: A
   Management-Philosophical Approach Based on Complex Adaptive Systems
SO CLOUD TECHNOLOGY: CONCEPTS, METHODOLOGIES, TOOLS, AND APPLICATIONS
AB Cloud computing is a new technology which puts whole or partial parts of the Information Technology (IT) infrastructure and services in a virtualized environment inside and/or outside the traditional IT center perimeter. It touches every level of the IT architecture and thus has a big influence on the way the internal and external users via their business processes are interacting with this architecture. Security is a big issue in this context and a lot of business and IT people are reluctant to move to the Cloud. Besides the security, business and architectural issues may increase the risks and create more uncertainties for these kinds of projects. For this reason, the chapter presents an investment framework, which takes into account the global, the business, the IT and the operational strategies, so that cloud computing projects have more chance to succeed. The need for flexibility in the investments is addressed by the real option valuation, which is placed in the context of the chapter's holistic investment framework for cloud computing.

TI Major drivers of invasion risks throughout the world
SO ECOSPHERE
AB In this paper, we investigate how climate, land use, habitat characteristics, and socioeconomic activities contribute to predict the current potential distributions of the "100 among the world's worst invasive alien species". We calculated the predictive power of each of the 41 variables for the 95 species including a large number of plants, vertebrates and invertebrates. We then calibrated the species distribution models with a set of appropriate variables for each invasive alien species to predict the potential distribution of these species and identify the major regions of origin of the invasive alien species. We found that climate variables were primarily predictors of the distribution of the global invaders studied. In addition, the habitat characteristics were also important predictors following by the socioeconomic variables such as the nearest distance to airports, seaports and human population density. We show that the potential areas at the highest risk of invasions from these species are located in Western Europe, Eastern United States, Central America, the eastern coast of Australia, and some Indonesian islands. We argue that these potential hotspots of invasions should be monitored in priority to prevent new invasions from these species. This study provides evidence of the importance of considering both habitat characteristics, socioeconomic and climate change factors for the current and future predictions of biological invasions.

TI An indicator species approach for result-orientated subsidies of
   ecological services in grasslands - A study in Northwestern Germany
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB Agri-environmental subsidies for grasslands of high conservation interest are usually associated with fairly strict management rules, but have not always been successful in terms of the preservation of species. A new approach now links the subsidies paid to the ecological value of a grassland site: the farmers are paid for keeping up a high plant species richness, and they can control the species richness of their sites by using vascular plants as indicator species. The method was tested in different grassland communities in six regions of Lower Saxony in Northwestern Germany, mainly addressing the question whether the number of selected indicator species was correlated with the total species richness of vascular plants and with the number of endangered species.
   Field work was carried out in 2004. Total species richness of vascular plants was recorded in all grassland sites, and the number of indicators was counted along two transects, usually being the diagonals of a rectangular site. Each transect was divided into three segments in which all indicators growing within 1 m distance from the transect line were recorded. In total 43 indicators were selected, mostly representing species that are fairly easy to recognise.
   The number of indicators was significantly positively correlated with the total number of species in all regions, also when correcting for autocorrelation (except in one region). When using grassland area as a co-variable, the same results were obtained, supporting the low significance of grassland size for the predictive ability of the method. in all regions but one, the mean number of indicators per segment was also significantly positively related to the number of red-listed and near-threatened species in the grasslands. Grassland size and transect length were found to be of minor importance for the application of the method. In conclusion, the study shows that the indicator approach is suitable for identifying those grassland sites that have a high plant species richness and a high number of endangered species. It may thus form the basis for result-orientated subsidies in grasslands. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Multiple-scale integrated assessment of societal metabolism: Introducing
   the approach
SO POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT
AB In this paper we present several concepts related to integrated analysis of societal metabolism across scales. First we introduce the concept of "dynamic energy budget" of human societies, which is based on the distinction between exosomatic and endosomatic energy flows and the possibility of establishing autocatalytic loops (egg-chicken patterns) among them. Second, we discuss the nature of the dramatic changes that the industrial revolution induced on the characteristics of societal metabolism. Finally, we discuss methodological problems related to the representation of complex adaptive systems. Dealing with sustainability of human societies requires the parallel use of non-equivalent descriptive domains. This, in turn, requires the ability of "scaling up and down" when moving across levels handling parallel non-reducible assessments.

TI Applying the Urban Systems Abstraction Hierarchy as a Tool for Flood
   Resilience
SO EARTHS FUTURE
AB Climate change will mean cities are exposed to more frequent short-term shocks such as floods. City-scale resilience is achieved by understanding how these shocks interact with longer-term stressors (e.g., social inequality). The Urban Systems Abstraction Hierarchy (USAH) has been developed for this purpose. In this paper, Glasgow (UK) is used as a case study application, to demonstrate how resilience theory can be operationalized through the application of the USAH. Results demonstrate how the USAH can quantify interdependencies between tangible physical entities in the city and intangible outcomes that monitor city stressors, and specifically how these outcomes change in response to a 1:200-year fluvial flood return period in Glasgow. Resilience concepts such as multifunctionality, redundancy and diversity are applied to interpret the results and their implications for longer-term resilience in Glasgow. The findings from the application of the USAH show that the outcome Social equality and equity is influential for longer-term resilience in Glasgow, whilst Reliable communications and mobility is an important outcome for flood resilience.

TI Data Descriptor: Spread of a model invasive alien species, the harlequin
   ladybird Harmonia axyridis in Britain and Ireland
SO SCIENTIFIC DATA
AB Invasive alien species are widely recognized as one of the main threats to global biodiversity. Rapid flow of information on the occurrence of invasive alien species is critical to underpin effective action. Citizen science, i.e. the involvement of volunteers in science, provides an opportunity to improve the information available on invasive alien species. Here we describe the dataset created via a citizen science approach to track the spread of a well-studied invasive alien species, the harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) in Britain and Ireland. This dataset comprises 48 510 verified and validated spatio-temporal records of the occurrence of H. axyridis in Britain and Ireland, from first arrival in 2003, to the end of 2016. A clear and rapid spread of the species within Britain and Ireland is evident. A major reuse value of the dataset is in modelling the spread of an invasive species and applying this to other potential invasive alien species in order to predict and prevent their further spread.

TI Global patterns in threats to vertebrates by biological invasions
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Biological invasions as drivers of biodiversity loss have recently been challenged. Fundamentally, we must know where species that are threatened by invasive alien species (IAS) live, and the degree to which they are threatened. We report the first study linking 1372 vertebrates threatened by more than 200 IAS from the completely revised Global Invasive Species Database. New maps of the vulnerability of threatened vertebrates to IAS permit assessments of whether IAS have a major influence on biodiversity, and if so, which taxonomic groups are threatened and where they are threatened. We found that centres of IAS-threatened vertebrates are concentrated in the Americas, India, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand. The areas in which IAS-threatened species are located do not fully match the current hotspots of invasions, or the current hotspots of threatened species. The relative importance of biological invasions as drivers of biodiversity loss clearly varies across regions and taxa, and changes over time, with mammals from India, Indonesia, Australia and Europe are increasingly being threatened by IAS. The chytrid fungus primarily threatens amphibians, whereas invasive mammals primarily threaten other vertebrates. The differences in IAS threats between regions and taxa can help efficiently target IAS, which is essential for achieving the Strategic Plan 2020 of the Convention on Biological Diversity.

TI Urban Architecture as Connective-Collective Intelligence. Which Spaces
   of Interaction?
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB During the twentieth century, with the advent of industrial society and globalization, the language of planning changed according to the shifts in construction and use of physical space. By borrowing terms and spatial forms from biology and cybernetics, industrial society and globalization increased the original semantic connotations. Moving from cognitive sciences, this paper outlines the definition of architecture as connective-collective intelligence and presents its implication in urban design. Spontaneous and commercial initiatives are redefining the communication form of urban life, affecting the procedures of the transmission of traditional knowledge. This approach to building environment is moving towards a complex multichannel interaction, involving both the individual and the collective experiences of space and technology. In describing some signs of that process, the authors outline new features that are changing the concept of sustainability in urban design.

TI Sustainable planning model toward reviving Lake Urmia
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT
AB Lake Urmia (Urumieh in Persian) in north-western Iran is one of the largest permanent hyper-saline lakes in the world and the largest lake in the Middle East. It has numerous ecological, economic and social implications in terms of biodiversity, climate, species, habitat, tourism and recreation. However, during the past decade, the lake has shrunk significantly and its depth has fallen by almost 6m. Contrary to other studies that have focused on the geomorphology of the lake, this study analyses the socio-environmental impact and provides a sustainable adaptive governance management model for its revival. This study reveals that unless various stakeholders and affected parties are actively involved in an implementable adaptive governance model, the fate of the lake will remain uncertain.

TI Three Views of Systems Theories and their Implications for
   Sustainability Education
SO JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION
AB Worldwide, there is an emerging interest in sustainability and sustainability education. A popular and promising approach is the use of systems thinking. However, the systems approach to sustainability has neither been clearly defined nor has its practical application followed any systematic rigor, resulting in confounded and underspecified recommendations. The purpose of this article is to extend the notion of systems thinking as it pertains to sustainability pedagogy. The authors draw from systems theory and other literatures to develop three broad approaches to systems thinking: functionalist, interpretive, and complex adaptive systems (CAS). Each perspective is examined regarding its conceptual underpinnings, implications for sustainability, and pedagogical goals, objectives, skills, and exemplar projects and activities. The authors' goal is to provide the reader with an immanently practical set of ideas and pedagogical tools that may be readily adopted by management educators in any discipline.

TI Radical ocean futures-scenario development using science fiction
   prototyping
SO FUTURES
AB Scenarios can help individuals, communities, corporations and nations to develop a capacity for dealing with the unknown and unpredictable, or the unlikely but possible. A range of scientific methods for developing scenarios is available, but we argue that they have limited capacity to investigate complex social-ecological futures because: 1) non-linear change is rarely incorporated and: 2) they rarely involve co-evolutionary dynamics of integrated social-ecological systems. This manuscript intends to address these two concerns by applying the method of science fiction prototyping to developing scenarios for the future of global fisheries in a changing global ocean. We used an empirically informed background on existing and emerging trends in marine natural resource use and dynamics to develop four 'radical ocean futures,' incorporating and extrapolating from existing environmental, technological, social and economic trends. We argue that the distinctive method as applied here can complement existing scenario methodologies and assist scientists in developing a holistic understanding of complex systems dynamics. The approach holds promise for making scenarios more accessible and interesting to non-academics and can be useful for developing proactive governance mechanisms.

TI Toward an Evolutionary and Sustainability Perspective of the Innovation
   Ecosystem: Revisiting the Panarchy Model
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This paper proposes an evolutionary and sustainability perspective of the innovation ecosystem. This study revisits the Panarchy model in order to generate new perspectives on the innovation ecosystem. The Panarchy model describes the evolutionary nature of complex adaptive systems relying on four phases, without, however, being deterministic: exploitation, conservation, decline, and reorganization. When ecosystems face important shocks, adaptive mechanisms and properties within the ecosystem lead the ecosystem to a new reorganization phase, which gives birth to another exploitation phase. In this perspective, the innovation ecosystem allows the avoidance of technology lock-ins and structural and organizational rigidity by providing mechanisms to enhance both resilience and competitiveness. Innovation ecosystem sustainability relies on two major dual forces: the exploitative function and the generative or autopoiesis function. Therefore, evolutionary and sustainability perspectives remain the "natural home" for developing works and models about the innovation ecosystem, and instrumental for policy-makers and practitioners involved in innovation management.

AB The concept of sustainability and, particularly, of sustainable development dominates in the literature among the most ambitious and controversial concepts. The knowledge and researches of state, evolution or development become not only the original means of generation of socio-economic science knowledge, but also an alternative in analyzing strongly sophisticated development problems pertaining to such complexes as city, region, field of activity or state. Finding the ways of such knowledge conversion into the field of science is complex, but necessary. Abundant researches of sustainable development become oriented towards the analysis of multifactor nature of development, or its universality. The paper uses the category of universally sustainable development, which is treated as a qualitatively-innovative instrument of thinking. Universally sustainable development is being analysed through the reality cognition prism of experts pertaining to the four blocks of knowledge, improving the idea of round table already developed in previous researches made by the authors. The impact of universally sustainable development on country economic efficiency and national self-sufficiency is analysed.

TI Management priorities for marine invasive species
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Managing invasive alien species is particularly challenging in the ocean mainly because marine ecosystems are highly connected across broad spatial scales. Eradication of marine invasive species has only been achieved when species were detected early, and management responded rapidly. Generalized approaches, transferable across marine regions, for prioritizing actions to control invasive populations are currently lacking. Here, expert knowledge was elicited to prioritize 11 management actions for controlling 12 model species, distinguished by differences in dispersion capacity, distribution in the area to be managed, and taxonomic identity. Each action was assessed using five criteria (effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, impacts on native communities, and cost), which were combined in an 'applicability' metric. Raising public awareness and encouraging the commercial use of invasive species were highly prioritized, whereas biological control actions were considered the least applicable. Our findings can guide rapid decision-making on prioritizing management options for the control of invasive species especially at early stages of invasion, when reducing managers' response time is critical.

TI Addressing the carbon footprint of health organisations: eight lessons
   for implementation
SO PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH & PRACTICE
AB Background: The scientific evidence for global warming is overwhelming. Health organisations, as large carbon polluters, are at significant 'carbon risk' and must act to reduce their carbon emissions. Many environmental sustainability initiatives, if properly implemented, would not only reduce harm, waste and pollution but also deliver health, social and financial benefits.
   Method: We have been involved for more than a decade in efforts to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of New South Wales (NSW) Health organisations in which we have worked. We draw on our collective experience to offer eight key lessons about implementing environmental sustainability initiatives in health organisations.
   Results: Sustainability plans have been developed in at least three Area Health Services/Local Health Districts in NSW, but in each case they have been imperfectly implemented.
   Lessons learnt: Based on our experience, we offer eight key lessons relating to leadership, engagement and developing networks, data, complex adaptive systems, broadening the issue, and political factors.

TI Will climate change promote future invasions?
SO GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB Biological invasion is increasingly recognized as one of the greatest threats to biodiversity. Using ensemble forecasts from species distribution models to project future suitable areas of the 100 of the world's worst invasive species defined by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, we show that both climate and land use changes will likely cause drastic species range shifts. Looking at potential spatial aggregation of invasive species, we identify three future hotspots of invasion in Europe, northeastern North America, and Oceania. We also emphasize that some regions could lose a significant number of invasive alien species, creating opportunities for ecosystem restoration. From the list of 100, scenarios of potential range distributions show a consistent shrinking for invasive amphibians and birds, while for aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates distributions are projected to substantially increase in most cases. Given the harmful impacts these invasive species currently have on ecosystems, these species will likely dramatically influence the future of biodiversity.

TI Are threat status and invasion success two sides of the same coin?
SO ECOGRAPHY
AB Global change increases both the number of threatened species and the impacts of invasives. These two problems are sometimes assumed to be opposite sides of the same coin, with invasive species having the opposite characteristics of endangered species. However, the validity of this assumption has never been tested. We analysed 20 life-history and other traits of all European and North American freshwater fish and birds. For these 1813 species, we compared the determinants of invasion success and IUCN-threat status and found that traits favouring invasion are not simply the opposite of those that favour endangerment. The size and life history of species are correlated more strongly with threat status than invasiveness. On the other hand, association with humans is the best predictor of invasiveness but is not correlated with threat status. Thus, the rise of invaders is caused by different aspects of global change than the imperilment of endangered species.

TI Standing on the shoulders of giants: Understanding changes in urban
   water practice through the lens of complexity science
SO URBAN WATER JOURNAL
AB Scholars assert that traditional approaches to urban water management need reforming.These debates have identified the need to move toward systemsand complexity thinking. The literature offers limited insight into the utility of complexity theory in enhancing urban water policy and practice.This paper aims to address this gap by: (i) synthesizing the intellectual history of complexity science, (ii) identifying key principles of complexity theory and (iii) providing insights into how complexity theory can contribute to twenty-first century urban water management. We reveal how Newtonian logic isdeeplyembedded in contemporary Western urban water policy and practice. We identify three insights from complexity science that could potentially yield better urban water policy and practice outcomes: system boundaries; agents and networks; and far from equilibrium. These theoretical insights offer an important contribution to scholarlydebates as embedded normative frameworks need to be recognized, understood and addressed beforetransformative change can materialize.

TI Using Scenario-Based Learning to Teach Tourism Management at the
   Master's Level
SO JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY & TOURISM EDUCATION
AB Understanding tourism as a complex system is a challenge in postgraduate tourism education. The complexities of understanding tourism as a system stem from the implications for decision making in business, long-term planning, and adopting sustainability and corporate social responsibility positions. This study evaluates a series of assessment items designed around pedagogical principles of scenario-based learning, role play, and collaborative learning. Using data from end-of-semester surveys and a reflective assessment piece, 30 students evaluated the series of assessment criteria for their effectiveness in helping students to consider tourism as a complex system and how the use of iPads and wikis were used to complete the assessment tasks. Results suggest that the series of assessment tasks was useful in developing critical thinking around tourism, including how tourism is a complex adaptive system, developing collaborative learning, practicing skills useful for a career in tourism, and building teamwork, whereas the wikis and iPads were useful as a platform to support this learning.

AB Enterprise network belongs to complex adaptive system. The coordination of enterprise network resource refers to the rules that enterprise network members are able to comply with and unity action in order to achieve the expected goal. The rules mainly include opportunity discovery mechanism, communication mechanism, strategy consultation mechanism and the network learning mechanism. Network learning in the process of enterprise network resource coordination is in order to achieve sustainable development the behavior subject in the network would access to network resource in a larger limit, actively adjust itself to accommodate the other behavior subjects, and commonly adjust the network resource coordination rules to adapt to external environment. Therefore, network learning mechanism in the process of enterprises network resource coordination is the study of the summary of experience and lesson to the coordinated activity afterwards of the network behavior subjects, through summing up, modify, perfect and discover the new rules. It can divide into two stages: credit assignment stage and new rules discovery stage.

TI Modeling organizational resilience in maritime business: an ISM and
   MICMAC approach
SO BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB PurposeBusiness environments and global transportation system have become more complex than ever due to complexity drivers of industries which create uncertainty and unpredictability to organizations. Like other industries, the maritime business faces different and difficult problems which threaten organizational survival. The ability to cope with those uncertainties, threats and problems shows the resilience ability of organizations that help to survive and prosper. The organizational resilience concept arises as a requirement to deal with problems and uncertainties of business environments which are swiftly changing. This study aims to suggest an organizational framework to show how maritime business organizations as the sea leg of global transportation system can develop resilient organizations via complex adaptive systems (CAS) approach if adequate design features of CAS could be defined and included in organizational properties.Design/methodology/approachA total of 15 CAS features were identified as the enablers of organizational resilience throughout the literature. An interpretive structural modeling (ISM) approach has been conducted to determine the mutual relation between the CAS features which constitute an organizational framework. These CAS features have been categorized by conducting MICMAC analysis.FindingsThis study proposes a framework that identifies CAS features as the enabler of resilient maritime business organizations. The CAS approach offers new managerial toolkit to realize current organizational situations and allows managers to understand that it is difficult to control their system in this dynamic environment where special management practices are required especially in volatile times rather than ordinary times. Also, organizations could not compete as a sole organization but as a web/system of organizations. CAS is more resilient than other systems because resilience is the emergent occurrence of the system formed from nonlinear, dynamic interactions with self-organized agents.Research limitations/implicationsThe research has some limitations, like organizational resilience studies are in the infant stage and further research into this area should be extended. This study uses the CAS approach to develop organizational resilience. Further studies could use different lenses and contemporary subjects in management field which should also be useful while developing resilience in organizations. This study uses ISM and MICMAC analysis where further studies could use quantitative design and methods like formal concept analysis or the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory to determine the relational weighs of CAS features while developing resilient organizations. Future studies may also focus on different maritime stakeholders like IMO or ILO, maritime agencies, freight forwarders or insurance underwriters regarding developing and enhancing resilience of the maritime system.Practical implicationsWorld trade and transportation systems are getting more uncertain and lean on complex relations where maritime transportation is a "vital backbone" of such operations. But becoming more complex structures leads to vulnerable systems and organizations. Most risk management applications are based on predicting the known risks where many of them are not enough to fight with unknowns. Coping with today's problems are difficult for organizations in any industry. But for maritime business stakeholders who work in such a global web of relations, it is much more challenging.
   So, stakeholders of the system like forwarders, ports or ship chandlers may easily apply those features to develop resilient organizations too. Legal authorities of the system and rule-makers like local Chambers of Shipping, IMO or Classification societies can benefit from this framework and provide supportive settings to develop system-wide resilient organizations.Social implicationsBy understanding environmental uncertainty and complexity better than others, organizations become resilient and cope with significant difficulties which make them more competitive as a substantial strategic advantage. Resilient management offers to break down points at the system and shows them ways to restore quickly while transporting goods while traditional risk assessments are not enough.Originality/valueThe originality of the study lies in two folds; first of all the key and most used features of CAS is linked to developing resilient maritime organizations and by maritime expert opinions, this study tries to determine which of these CAS features are the most effective to trigger other features to develop organizational resilience in the maritime business. And secondly, the concept of organizational resilience and the CAS approach are not analyzed in depth in the context of maritime business.

TI Influences on teleconsultation project utilization rates: the role of
   dominant logic
SO BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING
AB Background: This research analyzes teleconsultation from both a mechanistic and complex adaptive system (CAS) dominant logic in order to further understand the influence of dominant logic on utilization rates of teleconsultation projects. In both dominant logics, the objective of teleconsultation projects is to increase access to and quality of healthcare delivery in a cost efficient manner. A mechanistic dominant logic perceives teleconsultation as closely resembling the traditional service delivery model, while a CAS dominant logic focuses on the system's emergent behavior of learning resulting from the relationships and interactions of participating healthcare providers.
   Methods: Qualitative case studies of 17 teleconsultation projects that were part of four health sciences center (HSC) based telemedicine networks was utilized. Data were collected at two points in time approximately 10 years apart. Semi-structured interviews of 85 key informants (clinicians, administrators, and IT professionals) involved in teleconsultation projects were the primary data collection method.
   Results: The findings indicated that the emergent behavior of effective and sustainable teleconsultation projects differed significantly from what was anticipated in a mechanistic dominant logic. Teleconsultation projects whose emergent behavior focused on continuous learning enabled remote site generalists to manage and treat more complex cases and healthcare problems on their own without having to refer to HSC specialists for assistance. In teleconsultation projects that continued to be effectively utilized, participant roles evolved and were expanded. Further, technology requirements for teleconsultation projects whose emergent behavior was learning did not need to be terribly sophisticated.
   Conclusions: When a teleconsultation project is designed with a mechanistic dominant logic, it is less likely to be sustained, whereas a teleconsultation project designed with a CAS dominant logic is more likely to be sustained. Consistent with a CAS dominant logic, teleconsultation projects that continued to be utilized involved participants taking on new roles and continuously learning. This continuous learning enabled remote site generalists to better handle the constantly changing nature of the problems faced. A CAS dominant logic provides a theoretical framework which explains why the teleconsultation literature about the role of technology, which is based on a mechanistic dominate logic, does not have adequate explanatory power.

TI Global Efforts to Address the Wicked Problem of Invasive Alien Species
SO PLANT INVASIONS IN PROTECTED AREAS: PATTERNS, PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES
SE Invading Nature-Springer Series in Invasion Ecology
AB As the globalization of trade continues to expand, species inevitably have more opportunities to spread. Some are intentionally traded and become established in new ecosystems, thereby potentially changing the functioning of the now-modified ecosystem. Invasive alien species are gaining greater public attention, especially when their spread becomes dramatic and threatens ecosystems that people value. But by the time an invasive alien species becomes a problem, it may be too late to effectively respond. Perhaps worse, some people may welcome the alien species, making it even more difficult to implement eradication or control measures. This can make invasive species a 'wicked problem', challenging the building of the consensus necessary to reach a solution. But building public awareness about the impacts of invasive species can help to provide the necessary support, drawing on broad government support through international agreements such as the Convention on Biological Diversity. Practical measures to address the problems posed to native biodiversity (at the level of genes, species, and ecosystems) by invasive species of plants are the subject of active research and practical experience, posing some hope that even a problem as 'wicked' as invasive alien species can be successfully addressed.

TI Darwin: Towards the sustainability of the Larrikin of Australian capital
   cities
SO CITIES
AB Cities, as entities, are inevitably exposed to a range of the internal and external factors that shape their urban development and planning. As complex adaptive systems, cities possess different capabilities and opportunities for the re-configuration, transformation and learning from these disturbances. This city profile explores these processes using Darwin, the Northern Territory's capital and Australia's eighth-largest city as an example. The city profile is situated within Urban Resilience Theory. It unpacks the nuanced way geographic factors and spatial isolation; natural disasters, World War 2 bombing, border security threats, natural resource extraction, and tourism have shaped Darwin's urban development. Understanding these nuances and their spatiotemporal dynamics coalesces into the identified system susceptibilities and opportunities for an adaptive and sustainable development presented in this paper. The city's unique urban governance, successive reconstruction, socio-spatial dynamics, history, and challenges make it an excellent case study of city growth dynamics and resil-ience within the Asian-Pacific region. The profile highlights Darwin's regional planning and the (historic) pro-duction of urban space, along with climate change risks and adaptation, increasingly inaccessible housing and unaffordability, economic growth challenges and demographic dynamics.

AB Undertaking adequate risk management by understanding project requirements and ensuring that viable estimates are made on software projects require extensive application and sophisticated techniques of analysis and interpretation. Informative techniques and feedback mechanisms that help to assess how well and efficiently a specific development methodology is performing are still scanty. Analyzing project tasks would enhance how well individual tasks are estimated, how well they are defined, and whether items are completed on-time and on-budget. In this paper, we propose a temporal probabilistic model that addresses feedback control mechanisms in project planning using the Complex Adaptive Systems Software Engineering framework (CASSE). We have tested our approach in industry with a software development company in South Africa on two commercial project evaluations. Our preliminary results show that the temporal probabilistic model of the framework demonstrably enhances practitioners' understanding in managing software projects profitably - hence increasing business sustainability and management.

TI Informal urbanism and complex adaptive assemblage
SO INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING REVIEW
AB Informal urbanism, from informal settlements to economies and street markets, is integral to cities of the global South - economically, socially, environmentally and aesthetically. This paper seeks to unfold and re-think this informal/formal conception using two interconnected theoretical frameworks. First is assemblage theory derived from the work of Deleuze and Gualtari, in which a series of twofold concepts such as rhizomic/free and smooth/striated resonate with the informal/formal construct. Second is theory on complex adaptive systems, in which dynamic and unpredictable patterns of self-organisation emerge with certain levels of resilience or vulnerability. These approaches are drawn together into the concept of a complex adaptive assemblage, illustrated with brief snapshots of urban informality drawn from Southeast Asian cities. The challenge is to develop multi-disciplinary, multi-scalar methodologies to explore the ways in which informality is linked to squatting, corruption and poverty on the one hand, and to growth, productivity and creativity on the other.

The authors contemplate all human social systems as Complex Adaptive Systems with the capacity for self-organisation derived from a permanent learning process. Accordingly, a shift in the focus of teaching programmes from mere mechanisms of knowledge transmission, to a process focused on learning and in particular, a process of self-directed, connected, and deep learning which has at its core the profile of the eLearner as the central protagonist. The cornerstone of this process is a Complex Ecosystem of Personal Knowledge (CEPK) which will support teaching at an undergraduate level, progressively and transversely, from its outset. Considering the classroom as a networked community of learners whose objective is not only to gain a command of a particular subject (WHAT content do they need to learn?), but also HOW and WHY they need to learn it.

AB Background
   Governments around the world are looking at means to improve health care services and health outcomes for their communities within a sustainable expenditure framework. There is a general agreement that strengthening primary health care is the way for the future. Primary health care organizations (PHCOs) are seen as a means to achieving more effective and efficient health care.
   Results and conclusions
   This paper proposes a complex adaptive framework for PHCOs, taking account of health and illness being subjective experiences, health care being 'whole person'-focused, and PHCOs focusing on all of a community's health determinants and community-based health care needs. Such approach would foster building healthy local communities as much as seamless integration of health services for all. However, despite the expressed intensions towards patient-centred health care reform the bureaucratic mindset of Australian health policy makers risks true reform by imposing highly structured - rather than 'simple' - policy and operational rules.

TI Sustainable food systems science based on physics' principles
SO TRENDS IN FOOD SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Background: In Europe, the Farm to Fork Strategy provides ambitions for sustainable and circular food systems. However, what are the driving and uniting forces that keep systems sustainable?Scope and approach: First, food systems are regarded as open thermodynamic systems, fuelled by solar energy, with seven building blocks: players, pieces, moves, playing fields, rules, wins, and time. Second, sustainable food systems are complex adaptive systems evolving in a melting zone, or safe and just operating space, between frozen states and chaos. Third, players (actors) and pieces (resources and products) are bound by 4 fundamental forces, as in physics, namely the strong, weak, electromagnetic energy, and gravitation forces.Key findings and conclusions: A physics-based first-order approximation concept of sustainable food systems permits formulating relevant, future Food Science and Technology Developments. A network of food actors reorient single food chains towards systems of diverse food products, resources, and diets. Their features are multifunctionality, resilience, adaptability, temporal and spatial flexibility regarding food handling. Their pathways are characterized by balancing patterns between frozen states and chaos, and not endless growth curves.

TI Economic drivers of biological invasions: A worldwide, bio-geographic
   analysis
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB The introduction of invasive alien species (IAS) is generally acknowledged to depend both on the propagule pressure imposed by openness to international trade and on the health of the receiving ecosystem. Bio-geographic factors however play a crucial role in determining the level of risk associated with trade. We develop an analytical treatment of bioclimatic similarity between trade partners, within a model that links the incidence of invasive species to resource extraction, pollution and to import volumes disaggregated by country and region of origin. The model, estimated with data on invasive species of all taxa in 123 countries, shows that considering the geographical structure of trade flows and the bioclimatic similarity between sources and destinations substantially improves our understanding of the drivers of biological invasions. The results allow us to identify, in a worldwide perspective, the relative risk of biological invasions (in general, and by habitat type) entailed by different commercial partners.

AB Sustainable development has taken centre stage in our global conscience. Until recently, we have been focused on economic prosperity, driven by the mechanistic worldview of the scientific method. Once the cracks appeared, as a society, we have been looking for a deeper meaning and approach to life. Through a literature review, the paper proposes that current 'experts', using the engineering profession as an example, are not able to address the wicked problems confronting us, since they prevail within the reductionist mode of knowledge production. We need design thinkers - who are natural systemic practitioners - to solve systemic problems, which is characterised by sustainable development.
   A future second paper will draw on the behavior of non-linear, complex adaptive systems as self-organizing emergence at the edge of chaos and re-interpret the design thinking process in a way which encompasses the intuitive, non-linear and qualitative way in which sustainable development problems need to be addressed.

TI Sustainability and Business in a Complex World
SO BUSINESS AND SOCIETY REVIEW
AB Sustainability is a topic of growing importance today in all aspects of organizational life. Businesses and managers are increasingly considering ways to incorporate a balance among economic, ecological, social, and cultural value creation into their business models. At the same time, the world is becoming exponentially more complex. Indeed, complexity theory and thinking are now apparent in academic and practice accounts of sustainability in business, as scholars and practitioners recognize the limitations of traditional reductionist approaches to systemic problems. To date, however, a more theoretical framing of sustainability lags behind accumulating practical evidence. The purpose of this article is to address this gap by developing a complexity-based framework for understanding and managing sustainability in complex adaptive systems. We aim for simplicity, wholeness, and practicality in our approach, taking a qualitative rather than quantitative perspective on complex systems. Using several contemporary case examples, the article describes the important qualities of complex systems and develops them into a working framework that integrates principles and parameters of sustainability. In doing so, we create an approach to sustainability issues and dilemmas called "sustainability thinking." The article concludes with more generalized sustainability action strategies for managers and recommendations for future researchers.

TI The UK grocery business: towards a sustainable model for virtual markets
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RETAIL & DISTRIBUTION MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose - With the emergence of enabling internet technologies and increased competition between UK supermarkets has led the "big four" - Tesco, J Sainsbury, ASDA and Safeway/Morrisons - to develop grocery operations online. The objective of this paper is to evaluate and present best practice strategies employed by major retail organisations concerning these deployments. The paper argues that Tesco's superior performance can be identified through five critical factors. However, continued success using existing models and thinking is problematic and that future advantages will rely on taking a complex adaptive systems view of the deployment of E-Grocery systems.
   Design/methodology/approach - The methodology employed is a conceptual synthesis of current knowledge, based on theoretical constructs and empirical observations.
   Findings - There is evidence of varying degrees of progress and lessons learnt, from adopting strategies and internet technologies, with new ways of conceptualizing and managing virtual retail operations. The research challenges existing thinking and makes sense of the plexus between this technology and the market place.
   Originality/value - The essential contribution of the paper is the identification of five key elements for online retail success and the development of a proposed "online sustainability" model which is perceived to offer contemporary insights into competitive virtual environments.

TI OVERVIEW OF ENDANGERED ENTOMOPHAUNA OF SHKODRA LAKE
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY
AB In this paper, it is presented the endangered entomophauna of the Lake of Shkodra. In this habitat there are many threatened species, as categorised in the Red List of IUCN (International Union for the Protection of Nature). There are exactly 39 species which belong to threatened categories, from different regions in Northern Albania that are in danger of being extinct (Odonata 2 species, Mantopera 2. Neuroptera 2, Lepidoptera 24, Coleoptera 9). Most of the threatened species of the habitats of this area are also ranked in the Red List of IUCN. They are: 30 species belong to the vulnerable category (VU), such as Erynnis tages, 6 species are near threatened species (LR), such as Lestes dryas, 2 species are endangered (EN), such as Gmnopleurus mopsus, 1 species, Osmoderma eremita, is critically endangered (CR). Some of threatening factors related with this habitat, to be pointed out, are: the deterioration of the eggs, especially during reproductive period, before hatching, the pollution of waters and other ecological changes. However, the quality of the water is considered good. We wish to contribute to a further understanding of the insectophauna in Albania, focusing on the preservation and conservation of endangered species and their respective habitats, especially along the warm plain and hilly regions, rich in vegetation and lukewarm water resources. Most of them have a negative impact on the ecological system.

TI Improving the role of river basin organisations in sustainable river
   basin governance by linking social institutional capacity and basin
   biophysical capacity
SO CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB The river basin organisation (RBO) model has been advocated as organisational best practice for sustainable river basin management, despite scant evidence of its effectiveness to manage complex river systems. This review provides a framework which combines functional social-institutional capacities with basin biophysical indicators in a diagnostic tool to determine RBO governance performance. Each of these two capacities are represented by four groups of indicators respectively covering social learning capacity and biophysical capacity. The distance and alignment between capacity and measure of performance scores can be used to prioritise program planning and resource allocation for improving river basin governance, and to undertake periodic evaluations as part of a trajectory analysis. The diagnostic functional framework provides tangible indicators of performance around key concepts in river basin governance. It offers a first attempt to strengthen the position and effectiveness of an RBO in dealing with complex adaptive systems.

TI Biosecurity measures to prevent the incursion of invasive alien species
   into Japan and to mitigate their impact
SO REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES
AB The 2004 Japanese 'Invasive Alien Species Act' was enacted to control invasive alien species and prevent the damage that they cause to ecosystems. The Act defines invasive alien species as those recognised as, or suspected of, causing damage to ecosystems, human safety, agriculture, forestry and fisheries. Invasive alien species are carefully regulated: raising, planting, keeping or transporting them is prohibited without the express permission of the relevant minister. The Act represents a revolutionary advance for biological conservation in Japan. However, enforcing the Act is problematic. Dealing with the European bumblebee (Bombus terrestris), for example, involved resolving a bitter dilemma between biological conservation and agricultural productivity. The Act also has a serious loophole; it does not include alien micro-organisms. The incursion of amphibian chytridiomycosis into Japan caused confusion for scientists and the Japanese Government because control of such an alien micro-organism was not anticipated in the Act. Japan faces particular difficulties in attempting to control alien species because of its reliance on imports.

TI Analyzing the Social Factors That Influence Willingness to Pay for
   Invasive Alien Species Management Under Two Different Strategies:
   Eradication and Prevention
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Biological invasions occur worldwide, and have been the object of ecological and socio-economic research for decades. However, the manner in which different stakeholder groups identify the problems associated with invasive species and confront invasive species management under different policies remains poorly understood. In this study, we conducted an econometric analysis of the social factors influencing willingness to pay for invasive alien species management under two different regimes: eradication and prevention in the Doana Natural Protected Area (SW Spain). Controlling for the participation of local residents, tourists and conservationists, email and face-to-face questionnaires were conducted. Results indicated that respondents were more willing to pay for eradication than prevention; and public support for invasive alien species management was influenced by an individual's knowledge and perception of invasive alien species, active interest in nature, and socio-demographic attributes. We concluded that invasive alien species management research should confront the challenges to engage stakeholders and accept any tradeoffs necessary to modify different conservation policies to ensure effective management is implemented. Finally, our willingness to pay estimates suggest the Department of Environment of Andalusian Government has suitable social support to meet the budgetary expenditures required for invasive alien species plans and adequate resources to justify an increase in the invasive alien species management budget.

   help social marketing support new identities and more sustainable living
   patterns
SO AUSTRALASIAN MARKETING JOURNAL
AB In an effort to respond to the challenges faced by the environment and society, a plethora of social marketing campaigns have been launched to encourage the adoption of sustainable living patterns. We argue that the majority of these campaigns appeal to existing, self-interested or materialistic values that may lead to limited behaviour change. All too often these campaigns leave fundamental systematic environmental challenges unchanged, and may even undermine any considerations that people have around the change direction. We suggest that changing behaviour is ultimately about helping society and individuals reframing their identity. A systems theory approach, which acknowledges society as a complex adaptive system, is suggested as providing a useful framework for social marketing campaigns in supporting new identities and increasing sustained behavioural change.

TI PROTECTING THE PIPING PLOVER UNDER SECTION-7 OF THE ENDANGERED SPECIES
   ACT
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Section 7(a)(2) of the Endangered Species Act directs federal agencies to ensure that their actions do not jeopardize the continued existence of endangered and threatened species.  The US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) issues jeopardy or nonjeopardy biological opinions on proposed federal actions that affect endangered and threatened species.  We summarize several biological opinions issued by the USFWS to protect the threatened piping plover (Charadrius melodus).  These opinions address federal actions involving hundreds of piping plovers on the Missouri River system and a few piping plover pairs on short stretches of Atlantic coast beach.  Some of these opinions are decisive, but most allow the proposed action to proceed conditional upon a lengthy set of reasonable and prudent alternatives to protect the piping plover.  These conditions may prove difficult to track and will add to the workload of the USFWS.

TI Addressing educations' most intractable problems A case of failing
   schools
SO EMERGENCE-COMPLEXITY & ORGANIZATION
AB Education's most intractable, perennial problems go unresolved not because policy makers and teachers lack the will to address them but because the challenges result from the interconnectedness and complexities of education, creating social problems seemingly beyond reach for systemic, sustained solutions to be attempted. The purpose of this paper is to examine and apply a Futures Inquiry approach and rethink the challenges of school reform from a complex adaptive systems perspective to address the case of perennially low performing schools. The Futures Inquiry approach is a multidimensional approach to deconstructing educational issues that takes advantage of patterned solutions without artificially over-simplifying or prematurely reducing problems while also keeping in mind creating sustainable, adaptive educational futures. This approach is particularly valuable as a solution-pathway during times of rapid change, reduced resources, and social upheaval. The Futures Inquiry approach presented herein is essential for addressing the challenges of systemic educational inequalities to ensure full participation of all of our future citizens in a rapidly changing, global society. Futures Inquiry as a problem-solving tool, provides the basis for transforming education as a fundamental social institution.

TI Resource mismanagement versus sustainable livelihoods: The collapse of
   the Newfoundland cod fishery
SO SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES
AB The term "sustainable development" is only half of the gestalt of sustainability, the other being "sustainable livelihoods." The collapse of the Northwest Atlantic cod fishery off the province of Newfoundland Canada, provides a case study of the interacting biophysical and socioeconomic elements that can decimate a once-abundant natural resource. This collapse has resulted in the devastation of livelihoods, and the long-term impact on the Northwest Atlantic ecosystem remains unknown. This article analyzes the collapse as the first step in suggesting a rational fisheries management based on effective stewardship of the resource. This evaluation provides the knowledge base vital for guiding and improving fisheries policy. Several strategies are suggested to bolster a policy goal of sound conservation and management of fisheries for the benefit of the livelihoods dependent on healthy stocks. The strategies are predicated on the concept that living marine resources belong to complex adaptive systems, and are therefore best managed by decentralized rather than conventional, scientific, and top-down management schemes.

TI Integrating research and education at research-extensive universities
   with research-intensive communities
SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION
AB Although the Boyer Commission (1998) lamented the lack of research opportunities for all undergraduates at research-extensive universities, it did not provide a feasible solution consistent with the mandate for faculty to maintain sustainable physiology research programs. The costs associated with one-on-one mentoring, and the lack of a sufficient number of faculty members to give intensive attention to undergraduate researchers, make one-on-one mentoring impractical. We therefore developed and implemented the "research-intensive community" model with the aim of aligning diverse goals of participants while simultaneously optimizing research productivity. The fundamental organizational unit is a team consisting of one graduate student and three undergraduates from different majors, supervised by a faculty member. Undergraduate workshops, Graduate Leadership Forums, and computer-mediated communication provide an infrastructure to optimize programmatic efficiency and sustain a multilevel, interdisciplinary community of scholars dedicated to research. While the model radically increases the number of undergraduates that can be supported by a single faculty member, the inherent resilience and scalability of the resulting complex adaptive system enables a research-intensive community program to evolve and grow.

TI Innovation, cooperation, and the structure of three regional sustainable
   agriculture networks in California
SO REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB Regional agroecological systems are examples of complex adaptive systems, where sustainability is promoted by social networks that facilitate information sharing, cooperation, and connectivity among specialized components of the system. Much of the existing literature on social capital fails to recognize how networks support multiple social processes. Our paper overcomes this problem by analyzing how the social networks of wine grape growers exhibit structural features related to multiple social processes: ties to central actors that build bridging social capital and facilitate the diffusion of innovations, ties that close triangles and build bonding social capital to solve cooperation dilemmas, and ties to individuals that span community boundaries to connect specialized components of the system. We use survey data to measure the communication networks of growers in three viticulture regions in California. A combination of descriptive statistics, conditional uniform random graph tests, and exponential random graph models provides empirical support for our hypotheses. The findings reflect regional differences in geography and institutional histories, which may influence the capacity to respond to regional environmental change.

TI Evolution of newspaper coverage of water issues in Australia during
   1843-2011
SO AMBIO
AB News accounts both reflect and influence public opinion through their noted 'agenda-setting' capability. We examined newspaper articles in Australia's The Sydney Morning Herald from 1843 to 2011 to observe the evolution of media coverage on water issues related to water resources management. The results showed that water supply-related articles have dominated the reporting of water issues since 1843. This emphasis is reflected in the institutions involved and their related policy/management initiatives, as well as the themes of the articles. Extreme events such as flooding and drought have punctuated the historical record of reports on water issues. An economic development-driven tone was overwhelmingly predominant in newspaper articles (85 % of the total); however, there has been a marked decline in the importance of development-driven tone relative to environmental-sustainability oriented tone of articles since 1994. People from academia and NGOs were rarely quoted. Inclusion of wider range stakeholders should be considered as a strategic break-through and natural events should be considered as an "opportunity" to change public opinion on water issues for environmental sustainability.

TI A mesocosm experiment testing the competition between the invasive
   species Heteranthera reniformis Ruiz & Pav. and the endangered fern
   Marsilea quadrifolia L.
SO AQUATIC BOTANY
AB Biological invasion is one of the most severe threats to biodiversity, with invasive species altering ecosystem functioning and services. Once they arrive in the recipient community, invasive species are likely to spread and outcompete natives through higher competitive ability, with phylogenetically distant species expressing lower degree of competition than close related species. We present the results of a mesocosm experiment where a wet habitat was reproduced aiming at understanding the competitive ability of the threatened fern Marsilea quad-rifolia L. and the invasive monocot Heteranthera reniformis Ruiz & Pav., two species that can coexist in paddy fields of S-Europe. The species were cultivated both in monoculture and in mixed cultures at different pro-portions. We assessed interspecific competition using relative growth rate, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, chlorophyll content, leaf nitrogen and phosphorus content as main indicator of plant efficiency in acquiring resources and physiological stress. Contrarily to what we expected, M. quadrifolia expressed high competitive ability in terms of plant growth versus the invasive species, with H. reniformis maintaining some of the traits typical of invasive species, i.e., higher specific leaf area, nitrogen and phosphorus content. The per-formance of the threatened species depended on plant mixtures, whereas H. reniformis performed best in monoculture. Although higher competitive ability of the invasive species cannot be ruled out in crop cultivation context, the mesocosm experiment demonstrated that the threatened species M. quadrifolia may have chances of survival in co-occurrence with the invasive species H. reniformis. In view of a robust conservation plan for the species, field-based experiments in the real context need to be performed to completely understand the rela-tionship between species, also taking into account the crop species.

AB This session explores how Complex Adaptive Systems provide a framework for analyzing important social, biological, and environmental systems in One Health. Anthropogenic disturbances, many of which are technological, pose a threat to key ecological and sociological processes. They lead us to consider questions such as: Is artificial intelligence a saviour or a demon? What are the political, ethical, and scientific implications for One Health? How might the Global Burden of Disease (human), the Global Burden of Animal Diseases (GBADs) and other Global Burdens constitute a broader "One Health Burdens of Disease" and provide an evidence-base for One Health decisions? It will be necessary to address different data challenges in the developed and developing worlds, many of which are ethical and political, not just technical. Panelists will discuss the GBADs approach to data sharing, including how FAIR-principled metadata can be used to create trustworthy data systems and how the Data Governance Handbook provides important guidance for communicating data sharing principles to data contributors and users. Each panelist will provide a 5-10 minute "primer" talk which will introduce and link the key themes. This will be followed by a moderated panel discussion with opportunities for the audience to pose questions.

TI Implementing ecosystem-based management: evolution or revolution?
SO FISH AND FISHERIES
AB As a dominant paradigm, ecosystem-based fisheries have to come to terms with uncertainty and complexity, an interdisciplinary visioning of management objectives, and putting humans back into the ecosystem. The goal of this article is to suggest that implementing ecosystem-based management (EBM) has to be revolutionary in the sense of going beyond conventional practices. It would require the use of multiple disciplines and multiple objectives, dealing with technically unresolvable management problems of complex adaptive systems and expanding scope from management to governance. Developing the governance toolbox would require expanding into new kinds of interaction unforeseen by the mid-twentieth-century fathers of fishery science governance that may involve cooperative, multilevel management, partnerships, social learning and knowledge co-production. In addition to incorporating relatively well-known resilience, adaptive management and co-management approaches, taking EBM to the next stage may include some of the following: conceptualizing EBM as a wicked problem; conceptualizing fisheries as social-ecological systems; picking and choosing from an assortment of new governance approaches; and finding creative ways to handle complexity.

TI Essential elements of online information networks on invasive alien
   species
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB In order to be effective, information must be placed in the proper context and organized in a manner that is logical and (preferably) standardized. Recently, invasive alien species (IAS) scientists have begun to create online networks to share their information concerning IAS prevention and control. At a special networking session at the Beijing International Symposium on Biological Invasions, an online Eastern Asia-North American IAS Information Network (EA-NA Network) was proposed. To prepare for the development of this network, and to provide models for other regional collaborations, we compare four examples of global, regional, and national online IAS information networks: the Global Invasive Species Information Network, the Invasives Information Network of the Inter-American Biodiversity Information Network, the Chinese Species Information System, and the Invasive Species Information Node of the US National Biological Information Infrastructure. We conclude that IAS networks require a common goal, dedicated leaders, effective communication, and broad endorsement, in order to obtain sustainable, long-term funding and long-term stability. They need to start small, use the experience of other networks, partner with others, and showcase benefits. Global integration and synergy among invasive species networks will succeed with contributions from both the top-down and the bottom-up.

TI Introducing artificial evolution into peer-to-peer networks with the
   distributed remodeling framework
SO GENETIC PROGRAMMING AND EVOLVABLE MACHINES
AB A peer-to-peer (P2P) network is a complex system whose elements (peer nodes, or simply peers) cooperate to implement scalable distributed services. From a general point of view, the activities of a P2P system are consequences of external inputs coming from the environment, and of the internal feedbacks among nodes. The reaction of a peer to direct or indirect inputs from the environment is dictated by its functional structure, which is usually defined in terms of static rules (protocols) shared among peers. The introduction of artificial evolution mechanisms may improve the efficiency of P2P networks, with respect to resource consumption, while preserving high performance in response to the environmental needs. In this paper, we propose the distributed remodeling framework (DRF), a general approach for the design of efficient environment-driven peer-to-peer networks. As a case study, we consider an ultra-large-scale storage and computing system whose nodes perform lookups for resources provided by other nodes, to cope with task execution requests that cannot be fulfilled locally. Thanks to the DRF, workload modifications trigger reconfigurations at the level of single peers, from which global system adaptation emerges without centralized control.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify and analyse collaborative risk management (CRM) literature to establish its current position in supply chain risk management (SCRM) and propose an agenda for future research.
   Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review of 101 peer-reviewed articles over a 21-year period was employed to analyse literature and synthesise findings to clarify terminology, definitions, CRM capabilities, and underlying theory.
   Findings CRM as a field of research is in its infancy and suffers from imprecise definitions, fragmented application of capabilities, and diverse theoretical foundations. The term CRM is identified as a more representative description of relational risk management arrangements. Six capabilities relevant to CRM are identified: risk information sharing, standardisation of procedures, joint decision making, risk and benefit sharing, process integration, and collaborative performance systems.
   Originality/value The paper provides a new definition for CRM; proposes a holistic approach in extending collaboration to SCRM; identifies a new capability; and provides a range of theories to broaden the theoretical scope for future research on CRM.

SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
CT Conference on Adaptation of Forests and Forest Management to Changing
   Climate with Emphasis on Forest Health
CY AUG 25-28, 2008
CL Umea, SWEDEN
AB Uncertainty how ecosystems will behave and look like in the future has been increasing. Several concepts, such as sustainable, adaptive, or risk-based management, were proposed to cope with uncertain, incomplete knowledge, and with changing environmental conditions. However, there is a lack of agreement what those concepts mean and how they differ from traditional forest management approaches. The paper aims at (1) exploring general systems theory, control theory, and risk management theory for general principles that may be guiding the future development of ecosystem management, and that (2) developing a concept in adaptive ecosystem management that may act as a shared mental model for both scholars and practitioners.
   The exploration of systems- and risk-based theories results in decisive foundations of adaptive management: (I) emergence, adaptation, and resilience are fundamental concepts to characterize the dynamic behavior of ecosystems, accounting for their ability for purposeful transformational change. (2) Space-time scale matters. The space-time window of traditional, silviculture-based forestry has been focusing on the patch and stand level, whereas adaptive management has to consider much larger time-space windows, covering a range from the needle to the landscape. (3) Risk-informed management starts with the identification of critical effects, then quantifies the dose-response relationship between exogenous strain and endogenous stress. The paper proposes a concept in adaptive ecosystem management, being founded on three general concepts. First, control theory is the backbone to keep system dynamics within an acceptable range even if external disturbances are acting, the underlying model is based on uncertainties, and if the real process can only be modeled incompletely. Second, adaptive ecosystem management has to focus on processes across different space-time scales instead of looking at the static, "frozen" structures like trees of stands. Third, interaction of processes across space-time scales, characterized by dose-response functions, are the driving forces to shape the long-term development of the systems.
   The proposed concept challenges different domains. Research has to improve its understanding of process interactions across space-time scales, characterized by dose-response models, which are essential to understand system robustness (resilience). Higher education related to ecosystem management should refocus on scientific competences to the analysis of complex adaptive systems, and the use of control theory to continuously improve policies and practices for ecosystem management. Practitioners on the ground have to become convinced that the goal of ecosystem management is a, "moving target", consisting of a portfolio of ecosystem goods and services. They have to internalize the principle of "rule discovery" as a systematic learning process to improve management practices and by looking for "biodiversity in our minds". The paper is expected to trigger discussions among scholars and practitioners, leading to a set of principles for resource use that consider both complexity and dynamics of ecosystems.

TI Multiple multi-tier sustainable supply chain management: a social system
   theory perspective
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB A multi-tier supply chain is a complex system as it covers a focal company and multiple tiers of suppliers in a complex supply chain network. This study explores the complexity in multi-tier sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) through a social systems theory perspective. We carried out a case study on IKEA China's sustainable cotton initiative and examined its five cotton-textile supply chains. The primary data were collected through 22 semi-structured interviews with managers of IKEA China and their multi-tier suppliers. The findings suggest that in order to cope with environmental complexity in implementing multi-tier sustainable initiatives, focal companies tend to create both internal complexity and collaborative complexity in a variety of governance mechanisms. In addition, environmental overlap and available collaborative complexity increase in this process and can feed back into systems to facilitate further creation of requisite variety. We contribute to the multi-tier SSCM literature through providing an in-depth understanding of nuanced mechanisms of managing different tiers of suppliers to cope with complexities by adopting a social systems theory perspective. We also contribute to multi-tier supply chain governance mechanisms from an evolution perspective.

TI Sustainability Science in the Light of Urban Planning
SO CHALLENGES IN SUSTAINABILITY
AB The purpose of this article is to demonstrate that, as part of its mission, sustainability science can change the way planners engage with urban problems on three points: First, that effective standard planning is an illusion, and the crucial task for urban planners should be considering-on a place-based rationale-the long-term consequences of decisions, policies and, technology change. Second, how it is necessary to develop collaborative planning and co-production of knowledge. Third, to build effective actions on the basis of collaborative planning, it is crucial to take first into account how the population and the institutions respond to and resist change. Conversely, this paper shows that urban planning is also a breeding ground for consolidating the theoretical framework of sustainability science, considering that cities can be seen as paragons of both socio-ecological systems and complex adaptive systems-a position that is discussed throughout the article. Bringing sustainability science and urban planning in closer dialogue with each other, to exploit their potential synergies, has not been done sufficiently: It is an important gap in the academic literature that this article aims at filling.

TI Social Ecological Dynamics of Catchment Resilience
SO WATER
AB Catchment resilience is the capacity of a combined social ecological system, comprised of water, land, ecological resources and communities in a river basin, to deal with sudden shocks and gradual changes, and to adapt and self-organize for progressive change and transform itself for sustainability. This paper proposes that analysis of catchments as social ecological systems can provide key insights into how social and ecological dynamics interact and how some of the negative consequences of unsustainable resource use or environmental degradation can be ameliorated. This requires recognition of the potential for community resilience as a core element of catchment resilience, and moves beyond more structural approaches to emphasize social dynamics. The proposals are based on a review of social ecological systems research, on methods for analyzing community resilience, and a review of social science and action research that suggest ways of generating resilience through community engagement. These methods and approaches maximize insights into the social dynamics of catchments as complex adaptive systems to inform science and practice.

AB This article describes the lessons learned by USAID's Health Finance and Governance project over three years of implementation of health system strengthening activities in Vietnam. The authors recount the project's approach to supporting significant advancements in the government of Vietnam's (GVN) efforts to transition the financing of HIV/AIDS from donors to domestic resources, while assuring adequate coverage and financial protection for people living with HIV. Through an adaptive method of technical assistance design and delivery, the project aligned early on with the GVN's policy to finance HIV through Social Health Insurance and supported the Ministry of Health, the Vietnam Authority for AIDS Control, and the Vietnam Social Security agency in ensuring the long-term sustainability of HIV programs in the country. Major lessons included the importance of working within complex adaptive systems, the need to work within the country's existing policy framework, and the aim of creating and disseminating evidence in a cyclical fashion to sustain deliberate, persistent advocacy activities to guide and support the relevant decision makers.

TI Contaminated marine sites: geotechnical issues bridging the gap between
   characterisation and remedial strategies
SO ITALIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL-RIVISTA ITALIANA DI GEOTECNICA
AB The article deals with an original approach to contaminated marine sites where geotechnical engineering is bridging the gap between site characterisation and first selection of remedial strategies. The research has been prompted by a highly contaminated marine site in Italy and it is centred on the Conceptual Design Site Model (CDSM). The CDSM is based not only on the knowledge of the main current system's characteristics and boundary conditions but also on the coupled processes acting within it. The analysis of the model has been developed in light of the Complexity Theory and has brought about the building of the so-called resilience matrix. The matrix is a new tool to address site-specific management options and technology screening. However, the focus on the chemo-mechanical properties of the marine sediments has shown that, at some scale, the whole system can enter the edge-of-chaos. In this condition, the site turns out to be a complex adaptive system and predictions about its future development become more challenging.

SO CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB Drawing from the proceedings of an expert workshop with academics, researchers, government and NGO participants working in diverse countries in southern Africa and beyond, this paper reviews the discourse on resilience, both conceptually and in practice. We highlight opportunities to develop and apply a more situated, equity-sensitive and context-relevant understanding of resilience, particularly in the water sector. To pursue more just and resilient water futures in highly unequal and water stressed regions, we propose that researchers and practitioners (1) place greater emphasis on the transformative potential of resilience, (2) broaden the social dimensions of resilience to account more fully for intangible and other social factors, (3) engage critically with the decision-making processes and practices of building resilience, (4) contribute to the development of indicators and guidelines for building just and resilient water futures, (5) strengthen the role of situated knowledges, (6) critically engage with scale and boundaries in complex adaptive systems, and (7) strengthen the policy-science-civil society interface.

TI Changing antibiotic resistance: sustainability transformation to a
   pro-microbial planet
SO CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB Decades of overuse, misuse, and environmental antibiotic pollution has increased the global pool of resistant bacteria. With estimates of hundreds of thousands of annual human deaths and a lack of new drugs to replace old ones, antimicrobial resistance probably constitutes one of the greatest human health and sustainability challenges of the 21st century. To safeguard treatable infections, a deliberate social-ecological transformation is needed toward stewardship of the global microbiome and long-term sustainable use of antibiotics. We review the foundation for such a transformation using recent insights from sustainability science, evolutionary biology and health, and the understanding of human interactions with microbes as two intertwined complex adaptive systems. A coherent strategy should acknowledge humans as the source of the world's strongest evolutionary force, reflect that antibiotics are building blocks of modern health systems, and strive to build social-ecological resilience to minimize levels of resistance and avoid over dependency on innovation of new drugs. Bottom up opportunities for seeding the transformation include participatory monitoring and stewardship of our personal and environmental microbiomes, as well as collective consumer action. Top down priorities include regular international institutions to coordinate multi-level action.

AB To improve the capabilities of saving energy and reducing pollutant emission of textile printing and dyeing (PD) industry, this article presents a novel agent-based simulation model for assessing the impacts of environmental strategies on a PD enterprise. Two typical PD enterprises in China are simulated with different modelling granularities: one is at a module level, while the other is at an enterprise level. The module-level simulation model depicts detailed production processes in a PD enterprise and evaluates five candidate strategies on their capabilities of improving energy usage and waste emission. The enterprise-level simulation model views a PD enterprise as an agent and assesses three tax strategies for waste discharge. The simulation results show that the proposed general model could be a valuable tool to explore potential solutions to saving energy and reducing waste emission in PD enterprises, after being calibrated to a real case.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR QUALITY IN HEALTH CARE
AB The gap between implementers and researchers of quality improvement (QI) has hampered the degree and speed of change needed to reduce avoidable suffering and harm in health care. Underlying causes of this gap include differences in goals and incentives, preferred methodologies, level and types of evidence prioritized and targeted audiences. The Salzburg Global Seminar on 'Better Health Care: How do we learn about improvement?' brought together researchers, policy makers, funders, implementers, evaluators from low-, middle-and high-income countries to explore how to increase the impact of QI. In this paper, we describe some of the reasons for this gap and offer suggestions to better bridge the chasm between researchers and implementers. Effectively bridging this gap can increase the generalizability of QI interventions, accelerate the spread of effective approaches while also strengthening the local work of implementers. Increasing the effectiveness of research and work in the field will support the knowledge translation needed to achieve quality Universal Health Coverage and the Sustainable Development Goals.

TI Nonlinearity in Social Service Evaluation: A Primer on Agent-based
   Modeling
SO SOCIAL WORK RESEARCH
AB Measurement of nonlinearity in social service research and evaluation relies primarily on spatial analysis and, to a lesser extent, social network analysis. Recent advances in geographic methods and computing power, however, allow for the greater use of simulation methods. These advances now enable evaluators and researchers to simulate complex adaptive systems (CASs) by applying agent-based modeling (ABM). CASs reflect the interactions of competitive and cooperative tendencies found in agents. ABM simulations create and test generated observable patterns using the fewest number of plausible decision rules and agents. This primer presents essential concepts for understanding ABM as social service applications of complexity theory shift from a metaphorical perspective to a formalized evaluation method. Further developments in ABM methods need to focus on concepts emanating from the study of complexity science, including the concepts of the wisdom of groups, strengths found in diverse perspectives, robustness, interconnectedness, sustainability, and conflict and cooperation. Appropriate software programs for developing and testing agent-based models are provided.

SO LANDSCAPE RESEARCH
AB Complexity notions, i.e. ideas or methods that incorporate concepts and rationales from complexity science as analogies or models, frequently appear in landscape architectural discourses. However, debates have arisen about the legitimacy and relevance of complexity notions in landscape architecture. Are complexity notions an ephemeral fashion or derived from the inherent needs of landscape architecture research and practice? What role do complexity notions play in the development of landscape architecture? To answer these questions, we conducted a three-phase review of the complexity notions in landscape architectural theories and practices since early 20th century. We concluded that complexity notions in landscape architecture are a long-standing and increasingly significant subject rather than a passing fad. Complexity notions serve as an exploratory system rather than tyrannical dogma. Addressing the increasing complexity of landscapes and inspired by up-to-date complexity theories, incorporating adaptive learning processes is becoming a new paradigm in landscape research and practice.

AB Globally, entrepreneurs see Information Technology (IT) as a magic ingredient that propels creativity and innovative capabilities. Thus, making tech start-ups a catalyst for job creation, economic growth, and national development. However, achieving viable tech start-ups emergence is problematic and unpredictable. Especially in resource-constrained environments like sub-Saharan Africa where the diverse form of environmental complexities and uncertainties exist. Prior studies have shown to explain tech start-ups emergence. Yet, most of the investigations did not consider multi-dimensional perspectives to emergent events (i.e. opportunity discovery and selection, team formation and domain consensus, bootstrapping, etc.) characterizing tech start-up emergence, and how underlying mechanisms triggers such events. Thus, drawing from activity theory, intelligence complex adaptive systems, and effectuation theory, we conducted a critical realist case study to investigate the multi-dimensional events describing tech start-up emergence and further explicate the generative mechanisms that must exist for such events to occur in the Nigerian digital/entrepreneurial ecosystem.

I provide an overview of two such approaches, one to understand long-term hunting sustainability among mixed forager-horticulturalists in the wet tropics and the other to understand how foragers act as ecosystem engineers in a dry perennial grassland in Australia. I conclude by describing the implications of new approaches that incorporate anthropogenic "intermediate" disturbance (an emergent property of human-environment interaction) as a force shaping environments through time and space, and in so doing patterning the sustainability of subsistence, ways of sharing, ownership norms, and even structures of gendered production.

TI Research on Coevolution Computation and Simulation of Regional Logistics
   Industrial Ecosystem
SO AGRO FOOD INDUSTRY HI-TECH
AB Regional logistics industrial ecosystem is a complex adaptive system composed of various logistics enterprise species within an environment, and the competition and cooperation relationships among various logistics enterprise species are important to the evolution and sustainable development of regional logistics industrial ecosystem. To accurately reveal the coevolution processes and rules of logistics enterprise species, the coevolution mechanism and models of regional logistics industrial ecosystem are proposed based on ecology theory in the study. Firstly, the concept of regional logistics industrial ecosystem is analyzed based on the ecosystem metaphor. Moreover, the coevolution dynamic models of regional logistics industrial ecosystem are constructed based on the Lotka-Volterra equations to discuss the influences of competition and cooperation. Finally, the coevolution dynamic models of regional logistics industrial ecosystem are simulated through numerical examples based on the Matlab software. The result shows that competition and cooperation have a pivotal influence on the evolution trends of logistics enterprise species, and they are key driving forces promoting the sustainable development of regional logistics industrial ecosystem.

TI Exploring the nexus between sustainable tourism governance, resilience
   and complexity research
SO TOURISM RECREATION RESEARCH
AB Governance and complexity have increasingly become subjects of interest within research on sustainable tourism. Governance has been marked by a turn to more corporatist and networked policymaking structures. At the same time, the use of the concept of complexity in research on tourism destinations and governance is gaining momentum in an effort to address the links in increasingly networked systems as well as the interrelatedness of the multiple features of a tourist destination. Meanwhile, resilience has emerged as a new buzzword in research on sustainable development and governance which denotes the ability of a destination to cope with and adapt to change. This article reviews the literature on destination governance to identify critical issues and trends, and discusses the relevance of complexity approaches. Evolutionary studies and research on resilience in a sustainability context are becoming part of this discussion. The review sheds light on the limitations and merits of each of these concepts, as well as on their nexus. The article concludes with some key areas for future research on destination governance. The aim of the review is to contribute to conceptual clarity and to advance the application of complexity approaches in research on destination governance.

TI IUCN SSC Invasive Species Specialist Group: invasive alien species
   information management supporting practitioners, policy makers and
   decision takers
SO MANAGEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB The Invasive Species Specialist Group (ISSG) is a global network of scientific and policy experts on invasive species, organized under the auspices of the Species Survival Commission (SSC) of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). ISSG aims to reduce threats to natural ecosystems and the native species they contain by increasing awareness of invasive alien species, and of ways to prevent, control or eradicate them. Since its establishment, over two decades ago, ISSG has taken the lead on collating, managing and disseminating global invasive species information, promoting practitioner networks and supporting development of policy and regulation aimed at reducing the insidious threat of biological invasions. All this has been accomplished through the development of knowledge products (such as the Global Invasive Species Database (GISD)), promoting dynamic networks such as Aliens-L, advocacy and publications. ISSG has actively catered to emerging needs with activities directed at key areas such as islands, threatened species, protected areas and developing invasive species indicators to support prioritising and monitoring management action. ISSG is working with partners advancing the adoption of a standardised framework of pathway categories and developing criteria for the ranking of known invasive species based on the type and magnitude of impacts. ISSG through participation in the Global Invasive Alien Species Information Partnership (GIASIPartnership) is working with other information providers supporting countries with current and authoritative information to effectively implement Article 8(h), Aichi Biodiversity Target 9 and other related decisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and other Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) such as the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) and the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands.

The dynamics of the e-commerce market can cause different environmental impacts. This paper explores the dynamics of e-commerce market and the associated environmental impacts from a psychological perspective using an agent-based model simulation. A conceptual meta-theory from psychology is adopted to form the behavioural rules of the artificial consumers choosing different methods Of buying a book including conventional bookstores, e-commerce, and a proposed self pick-up logistic system. The introduction of the self pick-up system can be successful according to the simulation results. The advantage of lower price will attract a group of consumers. The simulation results also show that different structures of the social network have significant impacts on the dynamics of this market. The environmental impacts in terms of energy consumption and emission generation will be reduced by the introduction of the proposed self pick-up system.

TI Heads you win, tails you lose: Life-history traits predict invasion and
   extinction risk of the world's freshwater fishes
SO AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
AB 1. Freshwater fishes have the distinction of being both a highly imperilled taxonomic group as well as one that has produced many invasive species with widespread ecological impacts. Faced with the difficult task of identifying those species with the greatest need for management action, ecologists have turned to using predictive suites of ecological and life-history traits to provide reasonable estimates of fish invasion and extinction risk. Whether traits associated with invasiveness are the inverse of those associated with imperillment, known as the two-sides-of-the-same-coin' hypothesis, remains unclear.
   2. A global trait analysis (including maximum total body size, longevity, size at maturation, age at maturation, fecundity and egg size) for 6293 freshwater fishes was conducted to examine the trait correlates of species proneness to invasion or extinction. A meta-analytical procedure was deployed using univariate and multivariate trait analyses that accounted for the effects of shared phylogeny.
   3. Mean trait differences (measured as Hedges' d effect size) were found between invasive and threatened species when compared with native species, thus supporting the two-sides-of-the-same-coin hypothesis for freshwater fish. Invasive species were characterized by larger body size, greater longevity, delayed maturation and higher fecundity than threatened species. Furthermore, invasive species were found to display greater trait variability compared with threatened species, suggesting that different traits may be selected at different stages of the invasion process (from pathway entrainment to establishment) whereas more specific trait combinations may predispose species to higher extinction risk.
   4. The present study demonstrated a strong trait basis to global-scale invasion risk and extinction vulnerability for freshwater fishes. Given that both time and resources are too limited for detailed species-by-species assessments, the results suggest that trait correlates provide a reasonable estimate of invasion and extinction risk that can inform more targeted and proactive conservation strategies.

TI Measuring social-ecological resilience reveals opportunities for
   transforming environmental governance
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB Understanding the resilience of social-ecological systems can advance our ability to transform environmental governance and achieve ecologically sustainable and socially just outcomes. However, measuring this multidimensional emergent system property has been elusive. We translated theoretical principles of resilience into ecological and social metrics and used expert knowledge to assess how they have changed through three sequential governance regimes of the Pacific herring fishery in northwestern Canada. We showed a significant reduction in system-wide resilience between previous Indigenous and historical colonial governance regimes, and limited change with the onset of the latest environmental justice era. We also detected recent signs of recovery among several metrics of resilience, thereby signaling that this system exhibits the preconditions for governance transformation. Pinpointing the erosion and recovery of attributes that confer social-ecological resilience can reveal leverage points and highlight strategic pathways to enable deliberate transformation toward a more ecologically sustainable and socially just future.

TI Towards a sustainable interoperability in networked enterprise
   information systems: Trends of knowledge and model-driven technology
SO COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY
AB In a turbulent world, global competition and the uncertainty of markets have led organizations and technology to evolve exponentially, surpassing the most imaginary scenarios predicted at the beginning of the digital manufacturing era, in the 1980s. Business paradigms have changed from a standalone vision into complex and collaborative ecosystems where enterprises break down organizational barriers to improve synergies with others and become more competitive. In this context, paired with networking and enterprise integration, enterprise information systems. (EIS) interoperability gained utmost importance, ensuring an increasing productivity and efficiency thanks to a promise of more automated information exchange in networked enterprises scenarios. However, EIS are also becoming more dynamic. Interfaces that are valid today are outdated tomorrow, thus static interoperability enablers and communication software services are no longer the solution for the future. This paper is focused on the challenge of sustaining networked EIS interoperability, and takes up input from solid research initiatives in the areas of knowledge management and model driven development, to propose and discuss several research strategies and technological trends towards next EIS generation.

AB Organizations are increasingly looking to trusted data to drive their decision making process. Trusted data has a clear, defined and consistent quality which meets the expectations of the user. Data infrastructures which produce trusted data and provide organizations with the capability to make the right decisions at the right time are socio-technical networks, consisting of technical infrastructures and actor networks, and as such they are often complex and adaptive. Critical issues, challenges, and dilemmas can be identified while looking at data infrastructures as a socio-technical systems. This paper explores conditions and factors for effective and sustainable development of data infrastructures in organizations and suggests that the inherent complexity of data infrastructures requires a multi-faceted way of data governance. Several predefined components of data infrastructures which contain the behavior of agents through various coordination mechanisms have been developed to model the effect of data governance on data infrastructures. These components can be further customized to model an empirical situation more closely. Finally, the paper suggests institutionalization of data governance within an organization as a unifying concept towards the effectiveness and sustainability of data infrastructures, recognizing their inherent complexities. The approach is illustrated with a case study in the asset management domain. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI How Complexity Science Can Inform a Reflective Process for Improvement
   in Primary Care Practices
SO JOINT COMMISSION JOURNAL ON QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY
AB Background: Quality improvement processes have sometimes met with limited success in small, independent primary care settings. The theoretical framework for these processes uses an implied understanding of organizations as predictable with potentially controllable components. However, most organizations are not accurately described using this framework. Complexity science provides a better fit for understanding small primary care practices.
   Methods: The Multimethod Assessment Process (MAP)/Reflective Adaptive Process (RAP) is informed by complexity science. This process was developed in a series of studies designed to understand and improve primary care practice. A case example illustrates the application and impact of the MAP/RAP process.
   Results: Guiding principles for a reflective change process include the following: an understanding of practices' vision and mission is useful in guiding change, learning and reflection helps organizations adapt to and plan change, tension and discomfort are essential and normal during change, and diverse perspectives foster adaptability and new insights for positive change.
   Discussion: A reflective change process that treats organizations as complex adaptive systems may help practices make sustainable improvements.

TI Quantifying the impact of Gambusia holbrooki on the extinction risk of
   the critically endangered red-finned blue-eye
SO ECOSPHERE
AB Managing competing endangered and invasive species in spatially structured environments is challenging because it is often difficult to control invasive species without negatively impacting the endangered species. Effective management action requires an understanding of the factors affecting the presence and absence of each species so that promising sites for relocation of endangered species combined with eradication of invasive species can be identified. We investigate competing hypotheses about the factors affecting occupancy of the critically endangered red-finned blue-eye (Scaturiginichthys vermeilipinnis; hereafter 'RFBE'), a native Australian fish with a global distribution that is restricted to a group of shallow artesian springs. RFBE are threatened by competition with invasive mosquito fish (Gambusia holbrooki), which are steadily colonizing the springs, resulting in local extinctions of RFBE in most cases. While hypotheses about the influences of Gambusia on RFBE exist, none have been tested with a quantitative model. We used a spatially-structured two-species occupancy modeling approach to examine the occupancy dynamics of these fish and tested competing hypotheses on how Gambusia occupancy affected RFBE. Gambusia occupancy had a strong negative effect on RFBE occupancy and colonization potential; increasing the probability of local extinction at a spring and decreasing the persistence probability of RFBE in a spring by 8.0% +/- 2.7% (mean +/- 1 SE). We found strongest support for the hypotheses that elevation and spring area influence colonization, and that spring area influences patch extinction probability. Using colonization and local extinction estimates for both species, we identify promising sites for eradication of Gambusia and relocation of RFBE.

TI Mapping the impact of alien species on marine ecosystems: the
   Mediterranean Sea case study
SO DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
AB Aim To develop a standardized, quantitative method for mapping cumulative impacts of invasive alien species on marine ecosystems.
   Location The methodology is applied in the Mediterranean Sea but is widely applicable.
   Methods A conservative additive model was developed to account for the Cumulative IMPacts of invasive ALien species (CIMPAL) on marine ecosystems. According to this model, cumulative impact scores are estimated on the basis of the distributions of invasive species and ecosystems, and both the reported magnitude of ecological impacts and the strength of such evidence. In the Mediterranean Sea case study, the magnitude of impact was estimated for every combination of 60 invasive species and 13 habitats, for every 10 x 10 km cell of the basin. Invasive species were ranked based on their contribution to the cumulative impact score across the Mediterranean.
   Results The CIMPAL index showed strong spatial heterogeneity. Spatial patterns varied depending on the pathway of initial introduction of the invasive species in the Mediterranean Sea. Species introduced by shipping gave the highest impact scores and impacted a much larger area than those introduced by aquaculture and the Suez Canal. Overall, invasive macroalgae had the highest impact among all taxonomic groups. These results represent the current best estimate of the spatial variation in impacts of invasive alien species on ecosystems, in the Mediterranean Sea.
   Main Conclusions A framework for mapping cumulative impacts of invasive alien species was developed. The application of this framework in the Mediterranean Sea provided a baseline that can be built upon with future improved information. Such analysis allows the identification of hotspots of highly impacted areas, and prioritization of sites, pathways and species for management actions.

SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES, VOL 43
SE Annual Review of Environment and Resources
AB Social-ecological systems (SES) research offers new theory and evidence to transform sustainable development to better contend with the challenges of the Anthropocene. Four insights from contemporary SES literature on (a) intertwined SES, (b) cross-scale dynamics, (c) systemic tipping points, and (d) transformational change are explored. Based on these insights, shifts in sustainable development practice are suggested to recognize and govern the complex and codeveloping social and ecological aspects of development challenges. The potential susceptibility of SES to nonlinear systemic reconfigurations is highlighted, as well as the opportunities, agency, and capacities required to foster reconfigurative transformations for sustainable development. SES research proposes the need for diverse values and beliefs that are more in tune with the deep, dynamic connections between social and ecological systems to transform development practice and to support capacities to deal with shocks and surprises. From these perspectives, SES research offers new outlooks, practices, and novel opportunity spaces from which to address the challenges of the Anthropocene.

TI Habitat requirements of endangered species in a former coppice of high
   conservation value
SO FOLIA GEOBOTANICA
AB Transformation of coppices to high forests has caused fundamental changes in site conditions and a decline of many species across Central Europe. Nevertheless, some formerly coppiced forests still harbour a number of the declining species and have become biodiversity hotspots in the changing landscape. We focused on the best-preserved remnant of formerly grazed and coppiced subcontinental oak forest in the Czech Republic - the DAbrava forest near the town of Hodonin. To improve our understanding of the ecology of declining species, we studied local habitat requirements of vascular plants most endangered at the national level. We recorded vegetation composition and sampled important site variables in plots with the largest populations of endangered species and in additional plots placed randomly across all major forest habitats. We demonstrated that sites with endangered species have a highly uneven distribution in ecological space and that their species composition is often similar to open-canopy oak forests. Within this habitat, the endangered species are concentrated in places with a high light availability and high soil pH. Light-demanding species characteristic of subcontinental oak forests are the best indicators of these sites, while broadly distributed shade-tolerant and nutrient-demanding species avoid them. These results support the view that the occurrence of many endangered species in the DAbrava forest is a legacy of the long history of traditional management that kept the canopies open. Light-demanding species are now threatened by ongoing successional changes. Therefore, active conservation measures are recommended, including opening up the canopies, early thinning of young stands, control of expansive and invasive species and understorey grazing or mowing.

TI Simulation-Based Systems Engineering
SO GUIDE TO SIMULATION-BASED DISCIPLINES: ADVANCING OUR COMPUTATIONAL
   FUTURE
SE Simulation Foundations Methods and Applications
AB Systems engineering (SE) is understood as an interdisciplinary collaborative approach to derive, evolve, and verify a life cycle balanced system solution. Satisfying customer expectations has become more complicated and complex, as we are no longer designing systems optimized for a single point, but instead are focusing on systems which are sustainable, resilient, flexible, and even antifragile. Simulation is established to support analysis and testing of systems. Recent developments the use of executable architecture concepts allowing for dynamic evaluation of system concepts, and the use of agent-based implementation to support learning and adaptive system behavior allow better support of an agile enterprise. To support these ideas, simulation must be fully integrated into SE paradigm. We must establish simulation as an integrated discipline within the SE methodology. Research is needed to support validation and verification of self-modifying systems, as well as improved heuristics for computationally complex problems. This chapter proposes detailed visions and identifies a research agenda needed to realize these visions accordingly.

TI Distribution and conservation of endangered species in Mesoamerica,
   Choco and Tropical Andes
SO REVISTA MEXICANA DE BIODIVERSIDAD
AB This study modeled ecological niches projected as potential distributions for 313 endangered species listed in the IUCN for Mesoamerica, Choco and Tropical Andes, of which 285 were plants, and 28 terrestrial vertebrates. Overlapping of endangered species distributions covered most of the region. Ecuador showed close to 30% of its area with 50 endangered species. Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua y Panama showed more than 50 endangered species in <0.5% of its area. Countries showing >50% of its area with endangered species (21 to 50 species) were Costa Rica, Ecuador, Nicaragua and Panama. El Salvador and Honduras showed > 50% of its area with 11 to 20 endangered species; Mexico showed < 50% of its area with 1 to 5 endangered species. The distribution of endangered species on transformed areas (agriculture and urban settlements) ranged from 11 to 30%. El Salvador, Panama and Guatemala showed > 50% of endangered species in transformed areas; Colombia, Honduras and Mexico showed <40%, and Belize and Ecuador showed <25% of endangered species in transformed areas, respectively. El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, Nicaragua and Mexico showed a high proportion of endangered species in transformed areas for the Classes Amphibia, Liliopsida, Polipodiopsida, and the Orders Asterales, Fabales, Laurales, Myrtales, Scrophulariales and Rubiales. Less than 35% of endangered species occurred in transformed areas for the Orders Campanulales and Rosales. Endangered species occurring in protected areas ranged from 12 to 19%; endangered species from the Orders Fabales, Laurales, Myrtales and Rubiales showed wide distributions in protected areas, while endangered species from the Orders Campanulales and Asterales, and the Class Liliopsida showed marginal distributions in protected areas. Belize and Costa Rica showed the highest representation of endangered species in protected areas. We identified the Cordillera of Talamanca in Panama and Costa Rica, the Paramos and Cordilleras of the Andes, and the tropical rainforest of Ecuador as high priority areas for holding high endangered species diversity.

TI Finding the needle in the haystack: iterative sampling andmodeling for
   rare taxa
SO JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
AB Much like finding a needle in a haystack, the effort required to detect a rare and endangered species increases inversely with limited taxa distribution. The infrequency of detections combined with limited fiscal resources often leaves scientists with knowledge gaps about the ecological niche and habitat requirements necessary for conserving rare species. The Arsapnia arapahoe snowfly (A. arapahoe), was thought to be a rare and cryptic aquatic invertebrate for which only 13 individuals from two locations were known to exist in Colorado. In response to potential listing by the US Fish and Wildlife Service as a threatened species, we sought to implement an improved sampling protocol and tested an iterative predictive modeling approach. Species distribution models successively employed annual presence data collected from 2015 to 2017 and detections improved. Although now understood to be a hybrid taxa, the model predicted the locations of seven additional localities while concurrently narrowing the search area and expanding the known geographic range of A. arapahoe. Given our results, we recommend an iterative species distribution modeling and sampling strategy to refine search areas and improve detection rates for rare and endangered species.

TI Self-organized service orchestration through collective differentiation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS
AB This paper shows how self-* mechanisms give rise to complex but predictable and therefore steerable global system behavior in a cooperative computing environment. The operation of and the interactions between a set of networked autonomic devices are simulated. These are used as access points to a number of services, have the ability to accept or delegate execution of the associated tasks, and can adjust their internal state in response to the demand. At initialization, all devices are assigned a random internal state, i.e., there is no correlation between their configuration and the tasks that they are expected to perform. The authors study the emergence of cooperation and find that it spontaneously occurs when specific conditions are met, which allow individual devices to focus on performing a single task, sacrificing their ability to efficiently perform others. A relatively simple model that can be completely and thoroughly analyzed was chosen so as to demonstrate how the methodology developed to study complex adaptive systems in biology can be a powerful tool when planning the deployment of large ensembles of interacting autonomic devices.

TI Understanding Organizational Reality: Concepts for the Change Leader
SO SAGE OPEN
AB To achieve their purposes, organizations must constantly learn, adapt, and grow, a process typically referred to as change. Research shows that only a relatively few change efforts achieve great success-most just get by while the majority fail to reach predefined performance goals and objectives. That the success of planned change is relatively rare led to the following questions: (a) What facilitates or inhibits the change process? (b) How do these facilitators and inhibitors evolve within an organization? and (c) What are the implications of understanding this evolutionary process relative to achieving a more sustainable level of performance? This article addresses these questions and presents a holistic model for creating an open, fully transparent environment in which the many differences of potential relevance to a change are put in the open for analysis. The approach, the Full Dimensional Systems Model, assumes there are multiple, interrelated domains of influence that affect change and that these must each be appreciated and addressed simultaneously to achieve sustainable performance improvement.

TI A health systems resilience research agenda: moving from concept to
   practice
SO BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH
AB Health system resilience, known as the ability for health systems to absorb, adapt or transform to maintain essential functions when stressed or shocked, has quickly gained popularity following shocks like COVID-19. The concept is relatively new in health policy and systems research and the existing research remains mostly theoretical. Research to date has viewed resilience as an outcome that can be measured through performance outcomes, as an ability of complex adaptive systems that is derived from dynamic behaviour and interactions, or as both. However, there is little congruence on the theory and the existing frameworks have not been widely used, which as diluted the research applications for health system resilience. A global group of health system researchers were convened in March 2021 to discuss and identify priorities for health system resilience research and implementation based on lessons from COVID-19 and other health emergencies. Five research priority areas were identified: (1) measuring and managing systems dynamic performance, (2) the linkages between societal resilience and health system resilience, (3) the effect of governance on the capacity for resilience, (4) creating legitimacy and (5) the influence of the private sector on health system resilience. A key to filling these research gaps will be longitudinal and comparative case studies that use cocreation and coproduction approaches that go beyond researchers to include policy-makers, practitioners and the public.

TI Biological invasion risks and the public good: an economic perspective
SO CONSERVATION ECOLOGY
AB We postulate that the causes of the problem of invasive alien species are primarily economic and, as such, require economic solutions. Invasive alien species are of increasing concern for four reasons. First, introductions are increasing sharply, while mechanisms for excluding or eradicating alien species have been either withdrawn or progressively weakened. Both trends are due to the liberalization of and increase in international travel and trade, an economic phenomenon. Second, the costs of invasions are rising rapidly due partly to increasing human population density, and partly to increasing intensity of production in genetically impoverished agricultural systems. Third, biological invasions are associated with a high degree of uncertainty both because they involve novel interactions, and because invasion risks are endogenous. Actual risks depend on how people react to the possibility of invasions. Fourth, the exclusion and control of invasive species is a "weakest-link" public good. This places the well-being of society in the hands of the least effective provider. We argue that an economic solution to the problem of invasive species has two components. One is to use incentives to change human behavior so as to enhance protection against the introduction, establishment, and spread of invasive behavior. The other is to develop institutions that support the weakest members of global society, converting a "weakest-link" to a "best-shot" public good.

TI Generating pseudo-absence samples of invasive species based on outlier
   detection in the geographical characteristic space
SO JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SYSTEMS
AB Obtaining the diversity samples of invasive alien species (species presence and absence samples) is vital for species distribution models. However, because of the enhanced focus on collecting presence samples, most datasets regarding invasive species lack explicit absence samples. Thus, the generation of effective pseudo-absence samples of invasive species is a critical issue for building species distribution models. This paper proposes a pseudo-absence sampling approach based on outlier detection in the geographical characteristic space. First, principal component analysis is used to model the linear correlation of the original variables, and a statistical index is built to determine the weight of the principal components. Next, in the geographical characteristic space built based on the principal components and their corresponding weights, the local outlier factor is obtained to identify the pseudo-absence samples. The dataset regarding the invasive species Erigeron annuus in the Yangtze River Economic Belt is used to illustrate the general process of the proposed approach. The prediction results from logistical regression with the proposed approach are better than these with the spatial random sampling, surface range envelope, and one-class support vector machine models. These findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed sampling approach.

AB Supply chains are complex adaptive systems for which final performance depends upon numerous interdependent decisions made by numerous firms which synthesise inputs from various resources systems. The dynamic interdependent behaviour of social, economic, material and informational resource systems within eco-industrial settings that support the built environment life cycle supply chains can be studied at the supply chain level. The impact of megaprojects is significant and holds promise to explore the impact of decisions on various systems as it combines project and system boundaries. Megaprojects considered as major events within systems can produce critical revolutionary impacts on the systems within which they are embedded. The decisions that are made on megaprojects are central to risk management. Typically major infrastructure projects are procured through a form of public private partnership (PPP). The core principle of PPP is value for money which refers to the best available outcome attempting to take account of all benefits, costs and risks over the whole life of the procurement. In this paper the focus is on Australia where there has been considerable activity in the use of PPPs. With recent national infrastructure packages proposed to stimulate the economy due to the global financial crisis, decision modelling on risks is a relevant and critical matter not only in practice but also in the research community. PPPs encourage the whole-of-lifecycle approach in the procurement and management of public sector assets by transparently recognising the costs and risks associated with the whole life of the required service or facility, thus integrated whole of life supply chains can be considered. By creating a single point of responsibility for an entire project from inception through operation, a strong incentive is created for thinking about the effects that a design or construction decision will have on the effectiveness and efficiency of managing and maintaining a facility during its operational life. The decision to procure holistic supply chains becomes a much more viable commercial reality in the PPP environment than previously considered in the usual commercial construction spot transactional approach. These types of decisions tend to be imprecise, approximate and complex requiring justification and reasoning logic rather than the classical 'truth' logic. The purpose of this paper is to develop a theoretical decision framework which combines interdependency and multi-valued logic for supply chain procurement modelling..

TI Ecosystem changes following the eradication of invasive species:
   Evaluation of various eradication scenarios by computer simulation
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB The decline of the natural ecosystem on the Ogasawara Islands caused by invasive species has been an important environmental problem and projects for eradicating invasive species are currently underway. Some invasive species have proliferated in the host environment and are affecting the material cycle in the ecosystem. If the invasive species were removed from the environment, the material cycle of the ecosystem may be altered and native species that should be protected may be negatively affected. After the introduction of invasive alien species, namely goats and rats, the vegetation declined on Nakoudojima Island, an island that belongs to the Ogasawara Islands. Therefore, in this study, a mathematical model was developed to simulate and analyze the ecosystem changes that occurred following the eradication of goats and rats. When only rats were eradicated, the island's vegetation changed to grassland but revegetation was delayed and the biomass of the native animal species did not recover significantly. When only goats were eradicated, the vegetation recovered and the biomass of the native animal species increased; however, the island became forested and many native herbaceous plant species became extinct. When goats and rats were eradicated simultaneously, the vegetation recovered and the biomass of the native animal species increased; however, the ecosystem became very unstable and two extreme results were obtained - the vegetation of the entire island changed to either forest or grassland. The results of this study suggest that instead of simply eradicating invasive species, it is necessary to monitor post-eradication changes in the ecosystem and take adaptive measures as required.

TI Basque Cultural Landscapes of the Western French Pyrenees
SO CAPITALE CULTURALE-STUDIES ON THE VALUE OF CULTURAL HERITAGE
AB Results are presented on the co-evolution of agropastoralism and soils in the western Pyrenees Mountains (> 800 masl) over the course of the Holocene conducted in the ethnically Basque commune of Larrau, France. Larrau presents a unique opportunity to examine the structural legacies and biotic factor in soil evolution across millennia. Multi-proxy evidence from geoarchives, archaeology, history and ethnography is analyzed to evaluate the relation between land management practices, soil characteristics and chronostratigraphy in the study area. Research indicates that the landscape of Larrau has been subject to intense human transformation through agropastoral use since at least the early Bronze age, yet there are no signs of significant degradation of the soil mantle. The place-based approach followed in this research provides the means for evaluating modal human behaviors and decision-making within a complex adaptive system. It details how the present is connected to the past and how contemporary land systems can contribute to a sustainable future.

TI The normative dimension and legal meaning of endangered and recovery in
   the US Endangered Species Act
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB The ethical, legal, and social significance of the US. Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) is widely appreciated. Much of the significance of the act arises from the legal definitions that the act provides for the terms threatened species and endangered species. The meanings of these terms are important because they give legal meaning to the concept of a recovered species. Unfortunately, the meanings of these terms are often misapprehended and rarely subjected to formal analysis. We analyzed the legal meaning of recovered species and illustrate key points with details from "recovery" efforts for the gray wolf (Canis lupus). We focused on interpreting the phrase "significant portion of its range", which is part of the legal definition of endangered species. We argue that recovery and endangerment entail a fundamentally normative dimension (i.e., specifying conditions of endangerment) and a fundamentally scientific dimension (i.e., determining whether a species meets the conditions of endangerment). Specifying conditions for endangerment is largely normative because it judges risks of extinction to be either acceptable or unacceptable. Like many other laws that specify what is unacceptable, the ESA largely specifies the conditions that constitute unacceptable extinction risk. The ESA specifies unacceptable risks of extinction by defining endangered species in terms of the portion of a species' range over which a species is "in danger of extinction." Our analysis indicated that (1) legal recovery entails much more than the scientific notion of population viability, (2) most efforts to recover endangered species are grossly inadequate, and (3) many unlisted species meet the legal definition of an endangered or threatened species.

TI Supply Network Structure, Visibility, and Risk Diffusion: A
   Computational Approach
SO DECISION SCIENCES
AB Understanding and managing supply chain risks is a critical functional competency for today's global enterprises. A lack of this competency can have significant negative outcomes, including costly production and delivery delays, loss of future sales, and a tarnished corporate image. The ability to identify and mitigate risks, however, is complicated as supply chains are becoming increasingly global, complex, and interconnected. Drawing on the complex systems and epidemiology literature, and using a computational modeling and network analysis approach, we examine the impact of global supply network structure on risk diffusion and supply network health and demonstrate the importance of supply network visibility. Our results show a significant association between network structure and both risk diffusion and supply network health. In particular, our results indicate that small-world supply network topologies consistently outperform supply networks with scale-free characteristics. Theoretically, our study contributes to our understanding of risk management and supply networks as complex networked systems using a computational approach. Managerially, our study illustrates how decision makers can benefit from a network analytic approach to develop a more holistic understanding of system-wide risk diffusion and to guide network governance policies for more favorable health level outcomes. The article concludes by highlighting the main findings and discussing possibilities of future research directions.

AB The paper focuses on knowledge management in large complex adaptive systems and proposes architectures to support knowledge management in such systems. It sees knowledge capital not only in the explicit or tacit knowledge available in an organization but also knowledge in how to change systems to respond to changes in the environment. Critically important here are the communication structures needed to ensure sustainable knowledge sharing in an organized rather than chaotic way. It is based on the living system metaphor as the basis for sustainability. The metaphor provides guidelines for structuring communities and knowledge flows between them to adapt to their environment. The paper proposes a model where communities generate knowledge. It defines a generic structure for communities. The structure is made up of knowledge, coordination, monitoring and advisory communities. It then defines roles with responsibilities to coordinate communication between communities in ways that ensure sustainability. It includes roles to manage collaboration, set and monitor goals and provide assistance when needed. Knowledge flows are modelled using living systems theory to identify responsibilities for each role and the services needed to carry out these responsibilities.

TI Using Complexity Assessment to Inform the Development and Deployment of
   a Digital Dashboard for Schizophrenia Care: Case Study
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB Background: Health care is becoming more complex. For an increasing number of individuals, interacting with health care means addressing more than just one illness or disorder, engaging in more than one treatment, and interacting with more than one care provider. Individuals with severe mental illnesses such as schizophrenia are disproportionately affected by this complexity. Characteristic symptoms can make it harder to establish and maintain relationships. Treatment failure is common even where there is access to effective treatments, increasing suicide risk. Knowledge of complex adaptive systems has been increasingly recognized as useful in understanding and developing health care. A complex adaptive system is a collection of interconnected agents with the freedom to act based on their own internalized rules, affecting each other. In a complex health care system, relevant feedback is crucial in enabling continuous learning and improvement on all levels. New technology has potential, but the failure rate of technology projects in health care is high, arguably due to complexity. The Nonadoption, Abandonment, and challenges to Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework and complexity assessment tool (NASSS-CAT) have been developed specifically to help identify and manage complexity in technology-related development projects in health care.
   Objective: This study aimed to use a pilot version of the NASSS-CAT instrument to inform the development and deployment of a point-of-care dashboard supporting schizophrenia care in west Sweden. Specifically, we report on the complexity profile of the project, stakeholders' experiences with using NASSS-CAT, and practical implications.
   Methods: We used complexity assessment to structure data collection and feedback sessions with stakeholders, thereby informing an emergent approach to the development and deployment of the point-of-care dashboard. We also performed a thematic analysis, drawing on observations and documents related to stakeholders' use of the NASSS-CAT to describe their views on its usefulness.
   Results: Application of the NASSS framework revealed different types of complexity across multiple domains, including the condition, technology, value proposition, organizational tasks and pathways, and wider system. Stakeholders perceived the NASSS-CAT tool as useful in gaining perspective and new insights, covering areas that might otherwise have been neglected. Practical implications derived from feedback sessions with managers and developers are described.
   Conclusions: This case study shows how stakeholders can identify and plan to address complexities during the introduction of a technological solution. Our findings suggest that NASSS-CAT can bring participants a greater understanding of complexities in digitalization projects in general.

TI Modeling defaults of companies in multi-stage supply chain networks
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB The interest in supply chain networks and their analysis as complex systems is rapidly growing. The physical approach to the topic draws on the concept of heterogenous interacting agents. The interaction among agents is considered as a repeated process of orders and production. The dynamics of production in the supply chain network which we observe is nonlinear due to the random failures in processes of orders and production. We introduce an agent-based model of a supply chain network which represents in more detail the real economic environment in which firms operate. We focus on the influence of local processes on the global economic behavior of the system and study how the proposed modifications change the general properties of the model. We observe collective bankruptcies of firms, which lead to self-emerging network structures. Our results give insight into the dynamics of default processes in supply chain networks, which have important implications both for risk managers and policy makers. Based on the simulations we show that agent-based modeling is a powerful tool for optimization of supply chain networks. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A Decision Theory Perspective on Wicked Problems, SDGs and Stakeholders:
   The Case of Deforestation
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are an opportunity to address major social and environmental challenges. As a widely agreed framework they offer a potential way to mobilise stakeholders on a global scale. The manner in which the goals, with time-based targets and specific metrics, are set out within a voluntary reporting process adopted by both governments and business, provides a fascinating and important case for organisational studies. It is both about advancing performance measurement and evidence-based policy-making for sustainable development, and also participation and consultation at a wider, more global scale, than has ever been possible before. This paper contributes to the notion of SDGs as a wicked problem, answering calls for deeper theorisation, via synthesis with core ideas in the management field of decision theory. A case study on the wicked problem of deforestation and its links to supply chains, multi-stakeholder initiatives and SDG reporting, provides an illustration of the relevance of the application of decision theory to wicked problems, presented using a novel conceptual framework. This helps to illustrate new avenues for research and practical application regarding the balance of technocratic and participative approaches for sustainable development.

TI Public goods in relation to competition, cooperation, and spite
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Public goods and common-pool resources are fundamental features of biological and social systems, and pose core challenges in achieving sustainability; for such situations, the immediate interests of individuals and the societies in which they are embedded are in potential conflict, involving game-theoretic considerations whose resolution need not serve the collective good. Evolution has often confronted such dilemmas-e. g., in bacterial biofilms-in the challenges of cancer, in nitrogen fixation and chelation, in the production of antibiotics, and in collective action problems across animal groups; there is much to learn from the Darwinian resolution of these situations for how to address problems our societies face today. Addressing these problems involves understanding the emergence of cooperative agreements, from reciprocal altruism and insurance arrangements to the social norms and more formal institutions thatmaintain societies. At the core are the issues of how individuals and societies discount the future and the interests of others, and the degree that individual decisions are influenced by regard for others. Ultimately, as Garrett Hardin suggested, the solution to problems of the commons is in "mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon," and hence in how groups of individuals form and how they arrive at decisions that ultimately benefit all.

AB As agency biologists with snore than 30 years of collective recovery experience, we provide our perspective on the endangered species recovery planning process and the Society for Conservation Biology (SCB) recovery planning study. As part of the continuum from listing through recovery planning and implementation to species recovery and delisting, we believe that clearly written, well-designed recovery plans can play a key role in organizing and focusing the recovery effort for endangered and threatened species. We outline major opportunities, constraints, and limitations of the recovery planning process. Next we discuss some of the major results and recommendations of the SCB recovery plan study and identify 10 action items for further U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service consideration as possible ways to strengthen our recovery program for endangered and threatened species.

TI Public participation for sustainability and social learning: Concepts
   and lessons from three case studies in Europe
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB Shaping change such that it avoids losing potentially useful options for future development is a challenging task in the face of complex, coevolving socio-ecological systems. Sustainability appraisal methods, which open up dialogue and options before closing down and making suggestions, pay attention to the inclusion of various and conflicting points of view and address uncertainty, are increasingly used in the science, environment and energy policy domains. The quality of the process is seen as key to high quality appraisal outcomes. Dimensions of quality include learning opportunities which are seen as ways for addressing complexity and uncertainty. Participatory sustainability appraisal methods intend to support social learning among participants. Despite high expectations, social learning processes in sustainability appraisals are poorly conceptualized and empirically understudied. This paper (1) briefly reviews theories of social learning; (2) develops a conceptual framework for the analysis; and (3) presents an empirical application of the framework by use of data obtained from three energy and natural resource management case studies around Europe.

TI Red List Indices to measure the sustainability of species use and
   impacts of invasive alien species
SO BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL
AB After habitat loss and degradation, the leading threats to biodiversity are over-exploitation and invasive alien species. For birds, newly synthesised data using the standard classification schemes for utilisation and threat types for the IUCN Red List allow novel analyses on the importance of these threats and permit the calculation of Red List Indices (RLIs) to show trends in the status of birds driven by these factors. At least 45.7% of extant bird species (4,561 species) are used by humans, principally for pets (37.0%) and for hunting for food (14.2%), but other uses include sport hunting, ornamentation and traditional medicine. Much of this use drives trade at an international scale, involving at least 3,337 species (33.9%, substantially higher than previous estimates), mostly for the pet trade. RLIs show that although Successful control and management of use and trade have led to some species improving in status, this has been outweighed by the number of species deteriorating in status owing to unsustainable exploitation. Overall, the RLI showing trends in extinction risk driven by issues related to use shows a negative slope: human use of birds is currently unsustainable. Similarly, and of relevance to the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), the RLI for internationally traded bird species showing trends in extinction risk driven by issues related to international trade is also declining: international trade remains a threat to the world's birds. Invasive species impact at least one third of the world's threatened bird species (398 Species, 32.6%), with mammals being the most important (impacting 81.1 %), particularly through predation by carnivores and rodents. The RLI illustrating impacts of invasive species shows that they are driving a deterioration in the status of the world's birds. RLIs for the impacts of use and invasive species will be important indicators to help track progress towards the target of significantly reducing biodiversity loss by 2010.

TI Collaboration, Adaptation, and Scaling: Perspectives on Environmental
   Governance for Sustainability
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In preview of the special issue on "Environmental Governance for Sustainability", this manuscript examines three key themes on governance and sustainability. Governance for sustainability, by its nature, requires long-enduring institutional arrangements. Given the complex adaptive systems in which governance decision-making takes place, we explore three key characteristics of successful, long-term governance. The first of these is working across scale. This includes nested institutions as well as communication and coordination both horizontally and vertically between diverse governance groups. Second, we highlight the importance of collaboration. Building on the previous point, we draw on literature from collaborative governance and co-management to emphasize how collaboration can help to build more enduring governance structures. Third, we examine the importance of adaptation and evolution in the resolution of collective action dilemmas in complex systems filled with nonlinearities, unclear causal chains, and environments in which we have less than a full understanding of the ramifications of governance actions.

TI Understanding Multilevel Selection May Facilitate Management of
   Arbuscular Mycorrhizae in Sustainable Agroecosystems
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB Studies in natural ecosystems show that adaptation of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and other microbial plant symbionts to local environmental conditions can help ameliorate stress and optimize plant fitness. This local adaptation arises from the process of multilevel selection, which is the simultaneous selection of a hierarchy of groups. Studies of multilevel selection in natural ecosystems may inform the creation of sustainable agroecosystems through developing strategies to effectively manage crop microbiomes including AM symbioses. Field experiments show that the species composition of AM fungal communities varies across environmental gradients, and that the biomass of AM fungi and their benefits for plants generally diminish when fertilization and irrigation eliminate nutrient and water limitations. Furthermore, pathogen protection by mycorrhizas is only important in environments prone to plant damage due to pathogens. Consequently, certain agricultural practices may inadvertently select for less beneficial root symbioses because the conventional agricultural practices of fertilization, irrigation, and use of pesticides can make these symbioses superfluous for optimizing crop performance. The purpose of this paper is to examine how multilevel selection influences the flow of matter, energy, and genetic information through mycorrhizal microbiomes in natural and agricultural ecosystems, and propose testable hypotheses about how mycorrhizae may be actively managed to increase agricultural sustainability.

TI Emergence in the U.S. Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics
   (STEM) workforce: an agent-based model of worker attrition and group
   size in high-density STEM organizations
SO COMPLEX & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB The United States government forecasts a shortage of 1,000,000 Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workers over the next 10 years, putting STEM workforce sustainability at risk. The U.S. federal government has launched a range of programs, initiatives, and commissions to address this critical shortage. Past research has shown that organizational group-oriented culture, smaller work team groups, and worker homogeneity relate to lower attrition rates and higher levels of reported worker satisfaction. Applying Complex Adaptive Systems, this study takes a systems approach to examine worker attrition rates and worker group sizes in relation to STEM density across high-density STEM organizations. The base-case organization for this study is the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) because it maintains the highest density of STEM workers across all U.S. federal organizations and consistently ranks first in teamwork, innovation, and worker satisfaction in the annual Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey. The methodology for this study comprises an empirically validated NETLOGO agent-based model of worker attrition using OPM data sets for high-density STEM organizations. Model initialization parameters are represented and validated by historical attrition data for NASA and two control group organizations. The control groups include a lower-limit high-density STEM model and a medium high-density STEM model for validation with historical worker attrition data for the Environmental Protection Agency and Federal Communications Commission. The findings for this study confirm that STEM worker density is negatively related to attrition rate across all high-density organization types. The model output observations further show the emergence of a negative relationship between organizational STEM density and average worker group size, yet the opposite association is observed for STEM workers. The agent-based modeling approach is an important addition to the current line of academic focused research on STEM workers because it provides a bottom-up insight which helps inform theories and policy effects on ways to mitigate forecasted STEM shortages. Future research could be extended to apply Tipping Point Theory to STEM density and attrition rate variability to better understand STEM threshold ranges across high-density STEM organizations. Future models could also investigate specific STEM and Non-STEM worker characteristics to include age, gender, salary, or education level.

SP Canadian Risk & Hazards Network
AB Vulnerability is registered not by exposure to hazards alone; it also resides in the resilience of the system experiencing the hazard. Resilience (the capacity of a system to absorb recurrent disturbances, such as natural disasters, so as to retain essential structures, processes and feedbacks) is important for the discussion of vulnerability for three reasons: (1) it helps evaluate hazards holistically in coupled human-environment systems, (2) it puts the emphasis on the ability of a system to deal with a hazard, absorbing the disturbance or adapting to it, and (3) it is forward-looking and helps explore policy options for dealing with uncertainty and future change. Building resilience into human-environment systems is an effective way to cope with change characterized by surprises and unknowable risks. There seem to be four clusters of factors relevant to building resilience: (1) learning to live with change and uncertainty, (2) nurturing various types of ecological, social and political diversity for increasing options and reducing risks, (3) increasing the range of knowledge for learning and problem-solving, and (4) creating opportunities for self-organization,including strengthening of local institutions and building cross-scale linkages and problem-solving networks.

AB The current global scenario of technology change and social change make necessary to rethinking the vision and methods employed by governments, development agencies and private sector to impulse socioeconomic development through the adoption and application of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). We pose that the availability of computing and telecommunications infrastructure, highly converging devices for Internet access and content suited to the population needs and idiosyncrasies are not enough to accomplish long-term socioeconomic development. This paper suggests that non technology centric programs are necessary to effectively achieve sustainable digital inclusion projects, particularly in remote and underserved populations. This new perspective, encompassing strategies for social action with grass roots participation including technology adoption programs and a strong component of moral leadership may contribute to turn ICT into successful development engines. Furthermore, we argue that the confluence of Digital Convergence with social and environmental phenomena is creating new divides whose multifactorial nature can be analyzed using the principles of complex adaptive systems.

SO COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL ORGANIZATION THEORY
AB Emerging cyber-infrastructure tools are enabling scientists to transparently co-develop, share, and communicate about real-time diverse forms of knowledge artifacts. In these environments, communication preferences of scientists are posited as an important factor affecting innovation capacity and robustness of social and knowledge network structures. Scientific knowledge creation in such communities is called global participatory science (GPS). Recently, using agent-based modeling and collective action theory as a basis, a complex adaptive social communication network model (CollectiveInnoSim) is implemented. This work leverages CollectiveInnoSim implementing communication preferences of scientists. Social network metrics and knowledge production patterns are used as proxy metrics to infer innovation potential of emergent knowledge and collaboration networks. The objective is to present the underlying communication dynamics of GPS in a form of computational model and delineate the impacts of various communication preferences of scientists on innovation potential of the collaboration network. Gained insight can ultimately help policy-makers to design GPS environments and promote innovation.

SO ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB Because certain indigenous peoples have lived in the same habitats for centuries, their languages often encode traditional ecological knowledge about interactions between plant and animal species that occur in those habitats. This local knowledge is sometimes complementary to more broadly derived knowledge accrued by academically trained field ecologists. In this analysis of recent ethnoecological studies from the Sonoran Desert, it is clear that O'odham and Comcaac foragers recognize, name, and interpret ecological interactions among locally occurring species, regardless of whether these species directly benefit them economically. It is demonstrated how their knowledge of ecological interactions involving threatened species may offer Western-trained scientists and resource managers hypotheses to test, and to apply to endangered species recovery efforts. It is proposed that endangered species recovery teams include local para-ecologists from indigenous communities to aid in the integration of knowledge bases derived from various cultural perspectives.

TI Identifying cost-effective invasive species control to enhance
   endangered species populations in the Grand Canyon, USA
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB Recovering endangered species populations when confronted with the threat of invasive species is an ongoing natural resource management challenge. While eradication of the invasive species is often the optimal economic solution, it may not be a feasible nor desirable management action in other cases. For example, when invasive species are desired in one area, but disperse into areas managed for endangered species, managers may be interested in persistent, but cost-effective means of managing dispersers rather than eradicating the source. In the Colorado River, a nonnative rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) sport fishery is desired within Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, however, dispersal downriver into the Grand Canyon National Park is not desired as rainbow trout negatively affect endangered humpback chub (Gila cypha). Here, we developed a bioeconomic model incorporating population abundance goals and cost-effectiveness analyses to approximate the optimal control strategies for invasive rainbow trout conditional on achieving endangered humpback chub adult population abundance goals. Model results indicated that the most cost-effective approach to achieve target adult humpback chub abundance was a high level of rainbow trout control over moderately high rainbow trout population abundance. Adult humpback chub abundance goals were achieved at relatively low rainbow trout abundance and control measures were not cost-effective at relatively high rainbow trout abundance. Our model considered population level dynamics, species interaction and economic costs in a multi-objective decision framework to provide a preferred solution to long-run management of invasive and native species.

TI The emergence and evolution of Earth System Science
SO NATURE REVIEWS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
AB Earth System Science (ESS) has emerged as a powerful tool to investigate and understand global change. This Perspective outlines the history of ESS and advocates for the full integration of human and biogeophysical dynamics necessary to build a truly unified ESS effort.
   Earth System Science (ESS) is a rapidly emerging transdisciplinary endeavour aimed at understanding the structure and functioning of the Earth as a complex, adaptive system. Here, we discuss the emergence and evolution of ESS, outlining the importance of these developments in advancing our understanding of global change. Inspired by early work on biosphere-geosphere interactions and by novel perspectives such as the Gaia hypothesis, ESS emerged in the 1980s following demands for a new 'science of the Earth'. The International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme soon followed, leading to an unprecedented level of international commitment and disciplinary integration. ESS has produced new concepts and frameworks central to the global-change discourse, including the Anthropocene, tipping elements and planetary boundaries. Moving forward, the grand challenge for ESS is to achieve a deep integration of biophysical processes and human dynamics to build a truly unified understanding of the Earth System.

TI The Model of Project Management as a Sustainable Pedagogical Device:
   Case Study Research in the Tertiary Education Environment
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The objective of the research was to analyse the use of project management as a sustainable pedagogical device capable of fostering in tertiary education students the development of those transversal skills that enhance their sustainable employability. The qualitative research design was the emergent grounded theory, applied through a case study methodology (first exploratory and then explanatory). The "Seven-factor model of project management as a sustainable pedagogical device" for the development of transversal skills in tertiary education was the main result presented. It is composed of the factors that can be transposed from practice into the context of tertiary education and contains a description of the method for this translation. Moreover, the "holistic project management integration approach in tertiary education" was presented, and it was explained why it is an effective top-down transformation process for integrating project management in every program or academic level. Learning project management proves effective in enhancing students' employability by fostering a process of critical reflection that enables them to develop a sustainable career aligned with their expectations and personal growth as individuals, professionals, and sustainable citizens.

TI An analysis of the live reptile and amphibian trade in the USA compared
   to the global trade in endangered species
SO HERPETOLOGICAL JOURNAL
AB The trade in wildlife is a globally important industry. Amphibians and reptiles are among the most commonly traded animals and this trade has raised concern because of its potential impact on natural populations, animal welfare and the spread of invasive species and emerging infectious diseases. Yet, evaluating the risks involved is difficult due to the lack of quantitative data on the trade. Here, we analyse data on the live reptile and amphibian trade in the USA and the worldwide trade in CITES-listed species over a ten year period. Our analyses show that the trade is dominated by only a few species, with ten species making up the majority of the trade. Moreover, our data show an increase of the contribution of captive bred specimens to the trade in the USA, but not worldwide. Our data do show the presence of several invasive species among those that are traded and bred most. The trade of potential invasive species is problematic and should be more strictly regulated as it may have a global impact on biodiversity and the spread of emerging infectious diseases.

TI Conservation of genetic uniqueness of populations may increase
   extinction likelihood of endangered species: the case of Australian
   mammals
SO FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY
AB Background: As increasingly fragmented and isolated populations of threatened species become subjected to climate change, invasive species and other stressors, there is an urgent need to consider adaptive potential when making conservation decisions rather than focussing on past processes. In many cases, populations identified as unique and currently managed separately suffer increased risk of extinction through demographic and genetic processes. Other populations currently not at risk are likely to be on a trajectory where declines in population size and fitness soon appear inevitable.
   Results: Using datasets from natural Australian mammal populations, we show that drift processes are likely to be driving uniqueness in populations of many threatened species as a result of small population size and fragmentation. Conserving and managing such remnant populations separately will therefore often decrease their adaptive potential and increase species extinction risk.
   Conclusions: These results highlight the need for a paradigm shift in conservation biology practise; strategies need to focus on the preservation of genetic diversity at the species level, rather than population, subspecies or evolutionary significant unit. The introduction of new genetic variants into populations through in situ translocation needs to be considered more broadly in conservation programs as a way of decreasing extinction risk by increasing neutral genetic diversity which may increase the adaptive potential of populations if adaptive variation is also increased.

TI KEY FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS FOR MAPPING AND ASSESSING ECOSYSTEM SERVICES:
   PREDICTABILITY OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICE PROVIDERS AT SCALES FROM LOCAL TO
   GLOBAL
SO ANNALI DI BOTANICA
AB How an apparent static and ordered landscape condition in social ecological landscapes (SELs), can be made sustainable in terms of maintenance and improvement of the provision of ecosystem services (ESs) in face of unpredictable disturbance and change? Our contribution to the Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystem Services (MAES) working group is to advance some recommendations on how to approach the dynamic analysis of complex adaptive systems to improve ecosystem resilience, habitat connectivity and the delivery of ESs. We show exemplary cases where we utilize the NDVI provided by remote sensing to evaluate land cover transformations and processes and ES provisioning. We focus on NDVI because it allows the supply of information on net primary production, i.e., the energetic foundation of nearly all ecosystems and that provides the basis of most of ESs. The use of spectral entropy, and nonlinear analysis of spatial temporal dynamics to investigate trajectory predictability of SELs provide very useful insight into the dynamics of SELs and can assist in the characterization of the links between land cover patterns with ecological processes to support more reliable assessments and accountings of ESs.

TI Applied ethics in human and ecosystem health: The potential of ethics
   and an ethic of potentiality
SO ECOSYSTEM HEALTH
AB We live at a time when billions of people on this earth cannot achieve their full potential. Their lives are cut short or impoverished by malnutrition, pollution, and disease caused by failure of ecosystem and social services. in addition, if we were to project the quality of life enjoyed by those in advanced industrial countries to the world's poor, we would need about two planets to satisfy the demands for resources and waste assimilation services. Superimposed on the degradation of social systems, ecosystems worldwide are experiencing major threats to their integrity and health. Excessive human impacts are degrading ecosystem service provision, breaking and contracting food chains and making them less productive. Despite a growing understanding of social and ecosystem dysfunctionality, there remains little movement toward social sustainability and the restoration of the health of ecosystems worldwide. This paper presents an ethical foundation for those who seek sustainability. The key to such an applied ethic is the idea of directionality, where the natural tendency toward increasing complexity and diversity in complex adaptive systems provides guidance on what constitutes a sustainable society. The achievement of such a society can be facilitated by an ethic of potentiality that will assist humans to reintegrate ecosystem and human health.

It integrates the work of Ilia Prigogine on dissipative systems (open, free flow of information and energy into, out of and throughout the organization), and synthesizes Kevin J. Dooley's discussion of complex adaptive systems, Jeffrey Goldstein's discussions of dissipative structures and self-transcending constructs, Per Bak's self-organizing criticality, John Bennett's Systematics and uses Richard N. Knowles' Process Enneagram, a disciplined, focused dialogue tool which leads to the emergence of new information and releases the creative energy of the people..
   Change is co-created by the people and emerges from focused, disciplined, bounded conversations using the Process Enneagram (c), a dissipative tool, and is sustained using the co-created Process Enneagram Map, a dissipative structure, to guide and focus ongoing conversations as the people and their environment evolve. With the emergence of new information and energy, the people and their organization transform themselves, bridging the business and human sides of the enterprise, developing a highly effective, and more humane and sustainable workplace. Leading with this approach is called Partner-Centered Leadership

TI From policy coherence to 21st century convergence: a whole-of-society
   paradigm of human and economic development
SO PATHS OF CONVERGENCE FOR AGRICULTURE, HEALTH, AND WEALTH
SE Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences-Series
AB The 20th century saw accelerated human and economic development, with increased convergence in income, wealth, and living standards around the world. For a large part, owing to the well-entrenched Western-centric linear and siloed industrialization pattern, this positive transformation has also been associated with complex societal challenges at the nexus of agricultural, industrial, and health sectors. Efforts at cross-sectoral policy coherence have been deployed with limited success. To go beyond what has been possible thus far, the whole-of-society (WoS) paradigm for human and economic development proposes a 21st century convergence where, instead of the rest (of the world) converging with the West, sectoral and cross-sectoral efforts converge in their single and collective policy and action on a common target of human and economic development. In this paper, we first review and discuss contributions and limitations of policy coherence approaches. We then elaborate the institutional foundation of the WoS paradigm, taking as an anchor the well-established model of polycentric governance that views individuals, and state, market, and community, forming society as part of the same complex adaptive system. Actors within such systems self-organize into nested hierarchies that operate at multiple scales and move toward 21st century convergence of human and economic development.

AB The discipline and practice of fisheries science and management have had an useful, successful, and interesting history. The discipline has developed over the past century and a half into a very reductionist, highly quantitative, socially impactful endeavor. Yet given our collective successes in this field, some notable challenges remain. To address these challenges, many have proposed ecosystem-based fisheries management that takes a more systematic approach to the management of these living marine resources. Here I describe systems theory and associated constructs underlying system dynamics, elucidate how aggregate properties of systems can and have been used, contextualize these aggregate features relative to optimal yield, and note how this approach can produce useful estimates and outcomes for fisheries management. I explore two contrasting examples where this approach has and has not been considered, highlighting the benefits of applying such an approach. I conclude by discussing ways in which we might move forward with a portfolio approach for both the discipline and practice of fisheries science and management.

AB Humanity has emerged as a major force in the operation of the biosphere. The focus is shifting from the environment as externality to the biosphere as precondition for social justice, economic development, and sustainability. In this article, we exemplify the intertwined nature of social-ecological systems and emphasize that they operate within, and as embedded parts of the biosphere and as such coevolve with and depend on it. We regard social-ecological systems as complex adaptive systems and use a social-ecological resilience approach as a lens to address and understand their dynamics. We raise the challenge of stewardship of development in concert with the biosphere for people in diverse contexts and places as critical for long-term sustainability and dignity in human relations. Biosphere stewardship is essential, in the globalized world of interactions with the Earth system, to sustain and enhance our life-supporting environment for human well-being and future human development on Earth, hence, the need to reconnect development to the biosphere foundation and the need for a biosphere-based sustainability science.

AB Water, Energy, and Food sectors are interlinked in a nexus wherein actions relevant to one sector can often influence other sectors to a high degree. Globally, there has been a growing focus on ensuring water, energy, and food security in different kinds of frameworks and models. The current research aims to describe the complex interlinks between the three sectors by evaluating the challenges and opportunities in the following domains: policy, management, and technology. The hypothesis is to provide a basic practice framework to secure better outreach to tackle the interlinks and mismatches within the nexus elements. The methods used a dynamic framework through a transdisciplinary team; the team divided the nexus into six sub-sectors and collecting the primary data through fieldwork interviewing 22 stakeholders and secondary data of 211 literature. The approach of complex adaptive systems and evolving mental models have been used to analyse and develop the framework. The results show that interlinks within the water, energy, and food nexus are quite challenging to be identified since each region has different needs. However, the customized framework covered the gaps holistically, which can be used as a fundamental practice guideline. The study also proposed practical solutions and highlighting the opportunities to secure the future of sustainable development goals.

TI Improving Scaling Performance in Research for Development: Learning from

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB Complexity-sensitive decision support approaches (CSDSA) have gained prominence in the research for development (R4D) sector. However, limited attention has been given to critically examining the underlying causal assumptions of CSDSAs and their overall effectiveness in navigating complexity and achieving desired outcomes. Scaling Readiness has emerged as a novel CSDSA that is increasingly applied in R4D programs in low- and middle-income countries to improve the scaling of innovation. This study offers theory-based explanations on the extent to which Scaling Readiness supports evidence-based design, implementation and monitoring of scaling strategies in two R4D interventions. The contribution of Scaling Readiness is influenced by various contextual factors, including pre-existing partnerships and established institutional intervention project and performance management practices. The findings underscore the significance of investing in broader institutional impact culture growth. This includes critical evaluation of how funding, incentive, and performance mechanisms enable or constrain evidence-based decision-making and adaptive management at intervention and organizational level towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals.

TI "Bats, snakes and spiders, Oh my"! How aesthetic and negativistic
   attitudes, and other concepts predict support for species protection
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB This research investigates whether species are perceived differently based on aesthetic and negativistic attitudes, and whether these and other attitudes, naturalistic activities, and gender predict support for the protection of threatened species. 228 undergraduate students completed a survey in which they rated pictures of 10 endangered species on aesthetic and negativistic attitudes, and support for protection. Findings showed that the two-striped garter snake, Ozark big-eared bat, and dolloff cave spider were conceptualized differently than other species, which may be the result of "irrational" fears linked to animal phobias, culture, and emotional reactions to pictures. The regression results support the common belief that aesthetics is an important determinant in perceptions of endangered species and that the importance of negativistic attitudes may be waning. Moralistic worldviews and attitudes toward landowner rights and the Endangered Species Act were significantly related to support for governmental protection of species. Surprisingly, naturalistic activities and gender were not significantly associated with support for governmental protection of species. In general, the results were consistent across both models. However, the amount of variance explained by aesthetic and negativistic attitudes was 23 percent higher in the other species models than in the bat, snake, and spider models. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We take the first step in the development of a new field of research with the aim of merging spatial morphology and resilience science. This involves a revisiting and reunderstanding of the meaning of sustainable urban form. We briefly describe the fields of resilience science and spatial morphology. Drawing on a selected set of propositions in both fields, we put urban form in the context of the adaptive renewal cycle, a dynamic framework model used in resilience science to capture the dynamics of complex adaptive systems, of which urban systems are prime examples. We discuss the insights generated in this endeavor, dealing with some key morphological aspects in relation to four key attributes of resilience, i.e., "change," "diversity," "self-organization," and "learning." We discuss and relate these to urban form and other social variables, with special attention paid to the " backloop phase" of the adaptive renewal cycle. We conclude by postulating ways in which resilience thinking could contribute to the development of a new research frontier for addressing designs for resilient urban social-ecological systems, and end by proposing three strategic areas of research in such a field.

TI Invasive species issues in Canada - How can ecology help?
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE
AB The field of invasive species biology has been growing rapidly in the past decade, spurred on by the US Executive Order on invasive species in 1999. Despite calls to deal with invasive alien species under the International Convention on Biological Diversity in 1992, Canada has been slow to act. Part of the difficulty in managing alien invasive species effectively lies in the lack of ecological knowledge. The Canadian strategy on invasive alien terrestrial plants developed recently by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency sees research as a critical component of the strategy, including study of the biology and ecology of invasive plants. A symposium on ecology and invasive plant species at the Plant Canada meeting in 2007 in Saskatoon served to explore some emerging research in Canada, particularly focusing on Canada's prairie region. Papers derived from five of the presentations are presented here and illustrate well the continuing challenge of applying ecological principles to the complex issues surrounding invasive plants. Canadian ecologists have made a significant contribution, but much remains to be done along the lines of the simple studies provided in this symposium.

TI Plant invasion risk: A quest for invasive species distribution modelling
   in managing protected areas
SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB Preventing biological invasions in areas of conservation concern represents the most cost-effective strategy to minimize the impact of Invasive Alien Species (IAS) on native communities. In this context, invasive Species Distribution Models (iSDMs) are a sound tool for predicting invasion risk in protected areas. Although their potential to support invasive species managers is widely acknowledged, evidence of iSDMs providing actual conservation solutions is still scarce. With this work, we propose an iSDM-based methodology that accounts for the role of multiple invasion drivers to assess the risk posed by 1AS in protected areas. Using a binomial Generalized Additive Model, we predicted the occurrence of a highly invasive plant in Mediterranean dune systems. According to the predicted IAS occurrence, we quantified the invasibility of protected sites inside the study area, classified each site in low to medium-high invasibility categories, and identified site-specific management perspectives. Our results encourage the use of iSDMs as a means of evaluating the risk posed by IAS in protected areas, and, at the same time, represent an attempt to fill the gap between theory and practice in conservation decision-making.

TI Testing the hypothesis of greater eurythermality in invasive than in
   native ladybird species: from physiological performance to life-history
   strategies
SO ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB 1. Global warming and biological invasions are important threats to biodiversity. Nonetheless, there is little information on how these factors influence performance or life-history traits of invasive and native species. 2. The effects of temperature on physiological and fitness traits of two invasive alien species (Harmonia axyridis and Hippodamia variegata) and one native species (Eriopis chilensis) of coccinellid were evaluated, testing a model of eurythermality. Eggs of all species were exposed to four temperature treatments (20, 24, 30 and 33 degrees C). In adult F-2 we measured fecundity, locomotor performance, development time (total and per life stage), survival, and preferred body temperature in a thermal gradient. 3. It was found that H. axyridis had comparatively better performance at low temperatures (i.e. 20 degrees C), while the performance of H. variegata and E. chilensis did not change with temperature or was better at higher temperatures (30 degrees C). The standardised Levins index showed that all species are eurythermic. E. chilensis had a high niche overlap with the invasive alien ladybird species, rejecting the hypothesis of greater eurythermality of invasive species than native species. 4. Although there were differences in the temperature preferences and in the response of some physiological and life-history traits of ladybirds to temperature, both the native and invasive alien species are eurythermic, contrary to the prediction. The better performance of H. axyridis at lower temperatures may result in displacement of its current distribution, and thus not all invasive species will respond favourably to global warming.

TI Understanding approaches to complexity and uncertainty in closed-loop
   supply chain management: Past findings and future directions
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB This article aims to uncover knowledge gaps regarding approaches to dynamic complexity and deep uncertainty in a transition towards closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) management, and it articulates future research challenges addressing the identified gaps. Based on an abductive approach, two concepts are investigated: 'deep uncertainty' from the perspective of the decision-support literature and 'dynamic complexity' from the perspective of the complex adaptive systems literature and the transition management literature. The result is a systematic literature review of 64 CLSC management articles published in English. Conceptual gaps, process gaps and methodological gaps were found in relation to CLSC management under deep uncertainty and dynamic complexity. The analysis results in concrete research challenges for the CLSC management and sustainable supply chain management domains. The added value of this article is that the concepts of deep uncertainty and dynamic complexity for CLSC management are explored systematically for the first time. These two concepts appear to be crucial for the analysis of transitions to CLSC management. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Modeling scale and variability in human-environmental interactions in
   Inner Asia
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB Pastoralism represents a complex adaptive system that has existed in Inner Asia for thousands of years. The challenges of environmental change have highlighted the need to assess the potential for long-term sustainability while also considering the characteristics of systems that have the potential to maintain resilience. Here we assess the interaction between slow and fast processes and how interpretations of adaptive capacity and system resilience are affected by the scale at which observations are made. Agent-based modeling is used to identify the social and demographic interactions between landscape and weather variability for pastoralists in Inner Asia at a variety of social scales and from temporal scales of societal change ranging from a few days to 1000 years. Results indicate that the scale of abrupt changes may not be proportional to the severity or duration of the weather event, but is highly impacted by internal social factors. At the scale of individual families, highly interconnected social systems with less mobility and restricted decision making are less effective. When viewed from the vantage point of larger social units, highly interconnected kinship systems and restrictions in access to land may serve purposes that are counterproductive for individual families.

TI The socio-ecological resilience and sustainability implications of
   seafood supply chain disruption
SO REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES
AB Remaining resilient under disruption, while also being sustainable, is essential for continued and equitable seafood supply in a changing world. However, despite the wide application of resilience thinking to sustainability research and the multiple dimensions of social-ecological sustainability, it can be difficult to ascertain how to make a supply chain both resilient and sustainable. In this review, we draw upon the socio-ecological resilience and sustainability literature to identify links and highlight concepts for managing and monitoring adaptive and equitable seafood supply chains. We then review documented responses of seafood supply networks to disruption and detail a case study to describe the attributes of a resilient seafood supply system. Finally, we outline the implications of these responses for social (including wellbeing and equity), economic and environmental sustainability. Disruptions to supply chains were categorised based on their frequency of occurrence (episodic, chronic, cumulative) and underlying themes were derived from supply chain responses for each type of disruption. We found that seafood supply chains were resilient when they were diverse (in either products, markets, consumers or processing), connected, supported by governments at all scales, and where supply chain actors were able to learn and collaborate through trust-based relationships. With planning, infrastructure and systematic mapping, these attributes also can help to build socio-ecological sustainability and move towards more adaptive and equitable seafood supply.

TI Building community in the healthcare workplace - Part 2, Envisioning the
   reality
SO JOURNAL OF NURSING ADMINISTRATION
AB Squeezed between mounting budget pressures and staffing demands, healthcare managers hare little room to maneuver as they are buffeted by incessant new strategies. So what is the constant that they can use to keep a steady course through all the chaos? We suggest that the overarching constant is "community in the workplace." Although community building may have both short- and long-term benefits, it is not a strategy but a career-long philosophy, structure. and approach to help managers tie together all the facets of their daily work into a more meaningful and satisfying purpose.
   This article, part 2 in a 4-part series, explores the principles and characteristics of community and provides material for further study and discussion. Four conceptual cornerstones-philosophy, influence, culture, and inner transformation-are considered in relation to the community approach.
   Part 1 (April) described the negative dynamics that obstruct sustainable change and reasons for moving to community at work. Part 3 (October) will describe how to build community and will give options for implementing change in complex adaptive systems. The final article (November) presents case studies and discusses how community can be built in a unionized environment.

TI Towards the sustainable development of waste household appliance
   recovery systems in China: an agent-based modeling approach
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB With the rapid development of the economy and society, the number of waste household appliances in China has increased. Although the scale of China's waste household appliance industry continues to expand, the recovery rate is relatively low compared with developed countries. As waste household appliances are important recycling resources that have potential environmental risks and a high resource value, the effective recovery, recycling and utilization of these appliances are necessary to build a circular economy system, ease environmental crises and realize sustainable development in China. An agent based model of a waste household appliance recovery system was established in this study by using complex adaptive system theory and agent-based modeling method. The simulation of agents' behavior and scenario analysis were performed using this model, and the results were analyzed to study the evolutionary trends of the industry under different policy scenarios. Based on the exploration and interpretation of the optimal scenario, policy suggestions are proposed for different parts of the system. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Adapting improvements to context: when, why and how?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR QUALITY IN HEALTH CARE
AB There is evidence that practitioners applying quality improvements often adapt the improvement method or the change they are implementing, either unknowingly, or intentionally to fit their service or situation. This has been observed especially in programs seeking to spread or 'scale up' an improvement change to other services. Sometimes their adaptations result in improved outcomes, sometimes they do not, and sometimes they do not have data make this assessment or to describe the adaptation. The purpose of this paper is to summarize key points about adaptation and context discussed at the Salzburg Global Seminar in order to help improvers judge when and how to adapt an improvement change. It aims also to encourage more research into such adaptations to develop our understanding of the when, why and how of effective adaptation and to provide more research informed guidance to improvers.
   The paper gives examples to illustrate key issues in adaptation and to consider more systematic and purposeful adaptation of improvements so as to increase the chances of achieving improvements in different settings for different participants. We describe methods for assessing whether adaptation is necessary or likely to reduce the effectiveness of an improvement intervention, which adaptations might be required, and methods for collecting data to assess whether the adaptations are successful. We also note areas where research is most needed in order to enable more effective scale up of quality improvements changes and wider take up and use of the methods.

TI Resilience by teaming in supply network formation and re-configuration
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB In an increasingly interconnected world, physical, service, and digital supply networks are becoming progressively more complex, dynamic, and interdependent. Moreover, sustainability concerns push for higher efficiency in the use of resources, reducing protective redundancies and making supply networks more susceptible to disruptions. Supply network resilience is an emerging concept related to the inherent ability of a network to tolerate and overcome disruptions, a central capacity to achieve long term-sustainable operations. However, current understanding of the impact of network formation and re-configuration mechanisms on resilience is at its early stages.
   In this article, resilience by teaming (RBT) association decisions, inspired in the fault-tolerance by teaming principle from Collaborative Control Theory, are characterized and applied in network formation and re-configuration mechanisms. The impact of RBT on emerging supply network topology and resilience under targeted and random disruptions is measured and compared to scenarios were only traditional association rules are applied. Results show that the introduction of supply network agents using RBT association rules significantly (1) increases quality of service (QoS) with no significant cost increase in normal operation, (2) increases post-disruption QoS by 15-30% under random disruptions and 10% under targeted disruptions without cost increase vs. normal operation - when at least 20% of the agents use RBT association rules.

   analysis on local food marketing in Baltimore County, Maryland and
   Chester County, Pennsylvania
SO AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB Local food systems are growing, and little is known about how the constellation of farms and markets change over time. We trace the evolution of two local food systems (Baltimore County, Maryland and Chester County, Pennsylvania) over six years, including a dataset of over 2690 market connections (edges) between 1520 locations (nodes). Longitudinal social network analysis reveals how the architecture, actor network centrality, magnitude, and spatiality of these supply chains shifted during the 2012-2018 time period. Our findings demonstrate that, despite growth in the number of farmers' markets, grocery stores, farms and restaurants in both counties, each local food system also experienced high turnover rates. Over 80% of the market connections changed during the study period. Farms, farmers' markets, and grocery stores showed a 40-50% 'survival' rate, indicating their role in sustaining local food systems over longer time periods. Other actors, such as restaurants, had a much higher turnover rate within the network. Both food systems became more close-knit and consolidated as the center of gravity for both local food systems pulled away from urban areas toward rural farmland. Evidence of both growth and decay within local food systems provides a new understanding of the social networks behind local food markets.

SO INDEPENDENT JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT & PRODUCTION
AB Globally, public sector innovation has become a big issue as citizens demand for greater accountability, effectiveness and efficiency in service delivery, and the liberalisation of the governance system. Debate on e-government evolved in the last decade in parallel with a broader discussion on e-governance, where the concept and practice of e-governance further encompasses the e-government phenomenon. Because of the complexities of governance and egovernance, this chapter presents e-governance as a close, large integrated, open and sociotechnical (CLIOS) framework to meet present and emerging challenges of the e-world, as well as enhance good governance for sustainability. Novel descriptions of egovernance, governance, CLIOS, complex adaptive systems, sociotechnical systems were provided from literature. From a sociotechnical perspective, the design consideration for the adoption and implementation of e-governance architecture for a State in an emerging economy like Nigeria was provided.
   The contextual aspects that needed to be considered for the adoption of egovernance were discussed and citizens interface with governance through egovernance platforms were highlighted. Examples of countries implementing egovernance, benefits and challenges regarding the Bayelsa case were discussed.

TI Invasive alien species as simultaneous benefits and burdens: trends,
   stakeholder perceptions and management
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB In addition to being a major threat to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, biological invasions also have profound impacts on economies and human wellbeing. However, the threats posed by invasive species often do not receive adequate attention and lack targeted management. In part, this may result from different or even ambivalent perceptions of invasive species which have a dual effect for stakeholders-being simultaneously a benefit and a burden. For these species, literature that synthesizes best practice is very limited, and analyses providing a comprehensive understanding of their economics are generally lacking. This has resulted in a critical gap in our understanding of the underlying trade-offs surrounding management efforts and approaches. Here, we explore qualitative trends in the literature for invasive species with dual effects, drawing from both the recently compiled InvaCost database and international case studies. The few invasive species with dual roles in InvaCost provide evidence for a temporal increase in reporting of costs, but with benefits relatively sporadically reported alongside costs. We discuss methods, management, assessment and policy frameworks dedicated to these species, along with lessons learned, complexities and persisting knowledge gaps. Our analysis points at the need to enhance scientific understanding of those species through inter- and cross-disciplinary efforts that can help advance their management.

AB The Amami Islands in southern Japan host many endemic species, including Amami Jay (Garrulus lidthi). Following the introduction of Small Indian Mongoose (Herpestes auropunctatus) in 1979, populations of Amami Rabbit (Pentalagus furnessi), Amami Woodcock (Scolopax mira), Amami Ishikawa's Frog (Odorrana splendida), and other endemic species declined in the 1990s, as the mongoose expanded its population. A mongoose control project since 2000 successfully reduced the mongoose population to a very low density by 2014, resulting in the initial recovery of severely affected animal populations. Amami Jay was removed from Japan's endangered species list in 2008. However the population and range of Amami Jay are still small (ca. 700 pairs, sometimes with other family member(s), in 700 km 2), and other invasive species, such as cats and black rats, continue to damage the native ecosystem. Additionally there is a constant threat of new invasions to the Amami Islands. Our research shows that Amami Jay breeding success depends on the dominant oak (Castanopsis sieboldii) acorn production as much as predation. Therefore conservation plans should consider both short-and long-term effects and potential interaction by both invasive species and other natural factors. Understanding the Amami Jay population dynamics and sustainability from the multiple view points of, such as, population ecology, disease ecology, genetics, and also with ex situ conservation efforts as they relate to invasive species demands, will sophisticate our ecosystem research and management. We discuss how this endeavor of ours might develop as a model activity for maintaining biodiversity under threat from multiple invasive species.

AB Industrial sustainability at the regional level requires collaborative efforts from various participating agents toward common goals consisting of resource conservation, low carbon emissions, production efficiency, economic viability, and corporate social responsibility. Our existing socio-technical systems should transition or evolve towards achieving systems sustainability. This study aims to operationalize the notion of systems sustainability by developing an Agent-based Model (ABM) framework for two potential industrial ecosystems: The Picardie/Champagne-Ardenne oilseed crops agriculture (France). Such applications of agent-based modeling can show possible evolutionary trajectories of given scenarios under different conditions and geographical contexts. In this paper we view these economic activities along with their associated partners (suppliers, customers, government agencies etc) and the natural environment in which they operate to be complex adaptive systems. Therefore, industrial eco-parks organized around agricultural products and the pulp and paper industries are relevant areas of application for ABM. This task will help identify and provide a contextual analysis of the structural factors and main driving forces for the development of industrial symbiosis along the lines of prospective scenarios (ecological constraints; regulations, economic, cultural and behavioural contexts; carbon markets; technological routes, etc). The current model focuses on the cultural and behavioral aspects with the following research question: What are the behavioral factors that favor the development of an industrial symbiosis?

TI Socio-Ecological Adaptation of Agricultural Heritage Systems in Modern
   China: Three Cases in Qingtian County, Zhejiang Province
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This paper, on rural restructuring in China, focuses on the ability of agricultural heritage systems to adapt to modernizing conditions in the rural economy. Since 2002, when FAO initiated the protection of Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS), the value of agricultural heritage has been widely acknowledged, as has the importance and urgency to protect the systems in which they are embedded. However, such complex systems have not been fully assessed for their contribution to food security, ecosystem services and cultural preservation, as well as their ability to adapt to the demands of modernization. In fact, they have not been effectively evaluated as whole systems, largely because we have not yet devised satisfactory ways of studying complex systems, nor have we been able to assess them fully for their multi-faceted contributions to sustainability. This paper accepts the premise that such systems are sustainable in that they have survived as agro-ecosystems for many hundreds of years, having endured the predations of droughts, famines, plagues, floods and wars. This ability to sustain a rich diversity of biological and human systems is considered, in the theory of Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS), to be a form of resilience, meaning that these systems have either formed a new normal or returned to the old normal after a period of environmental or social stress. In effect, ancient agricultural heritage systems can be seen to represent what has been traditional and normal in China, but which today are faced with the overwhelming forces of modernization. Taking three examples from Qingtian County in Southern China, where physical and political conditions are consistent, the paper shows how similar rice-fish systems adapt differently and sustain themselves in the face of modernization, and particularly to the loss of youth and labor to urbanisation. One system self-adjusts by using remittances from abroad to sustain the system: an example of self-organization. In another township, the pursuit of tourism is the main form of adaptation to large losses of working population and marginal incomes. To maintain the landscape as a key attraction for tourists, this community has re-assembled abandoned rice terraces and is farming them as a collective enterprise under the auspices of a co-operative: an example of land and labor restructuring that has become common as the dominant form of agrarian change in China. In a third example, the local rice-fish system is being strengthened by modern farming technology and scientific techniques: an example of technological adaptation. The discussion explores the three responses as evidence of sustainable practice involving local restructuring, continued ingenuity, and the creative support of local governments in the face of the homogenizing demands of modernization.

TI Development of an STR panel for a non-native population of an endangered
   species
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS
AB Background The establishment of non-native populations of threatened and legally protected species can have many implications for the areas where these species have been introduced. Non-native populations of threatened species have the potential to be exploited and therefore the subject of legal protection, while conversely, if they have become invasive in their introduced range, there is the likelihood that population control will be carried out to reduce abundance and negative impacts associated with introduced species. From both a legal and invasive species monitoring standpoint, it is important to know how many individuals are present. Methods and results Short tandem repeats (STRs) were developed for the hog deer, an endangered species that was introduced following European settlement to Victoria, Australia using Illumina MiSeq sequencing technology. These markers were combined with previous STRs characterised for hog deer to create a 29-plex identification system. A total of 224 samples were genotyped across the population in Victoria, and further analyses of null allele frequencies, deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and the removal of monomorphic or low amplifying markers resulted in a final marker panel of 15 loci. Despite low values for number of alleles at each locus (2-4), probability of identity showed sufficient discrimination power, with an average probability of identity at 2.94 x 10(-6), and a probability of sibling identity of 8.9 x 10(-4) across all sites. Conclusions It is feasible to create an informative DNA profiling system that can distinguish between individuals for applications in both wildlife forensic and population control research.

TI One Way Forward to Beat the Newtonian Habit with a Complexity
   Perspective on Organisational Change
SO SYSTEMS
AB We face a global crisis of un-sustainability-we need to change trajectory, but have so far displayed a collective inability to do so. This article suggests that one reason for this is our entrenched approach to change, which has inappropriately applied mechanistic Newtonian assumptions to. living. systems. Applying what has been learned about the behaviour of complex adaptive systems, we develop a pragmatic model for students of sustainability, who want to facilitate profound organizational and community change towards sustainability on the ground. Our model,. one way forward., does not purport to be the only way but one possibility, grounded in a different understanding of the nature and dynamic of change as seen through the lens of complexity. In this way, it challenges more conventional change management practices. One way forward is a model facilitating evolutionary change in a social ecology-one possible expression of a. culture of community self-design. as expressed by Banathy. Its theoretical foundations and its practical application (it is designed for practice) both have their source in a systemic view and in the principles that reflect the paradigm of complexity. Four central components of this new model-envisioning, core messages (values), indicators of progress, and experimentation-are explored in more detail.

TI Setting-up a billboard of marine invasive species in the ESENIAS area:
   current situation and future expectancies
SO ACTA ADRIATICA
AB In this study we present a list of invasive/potential invasive alien species in the East and South European Network for Invasive Alien Species (ESENIAS) countries with marine borders. The species were classified according to the existing literature and experts' judgment, as established, casual, invasive and expected. Finally, factsheets were compiled for ten species of high importance based on their expanding/invading character.
   Of the 160 species comprising the list, 149 were already present in the ESENIAS countries, while eleven were invasive species either present in the Mediterranean or in other European Seas, likely to be recorded in the ESENIAS countries. The majority of the species were of Red Sea/Indo-Pacific origin (97 species; 60.6%). Italy, Turkey and Greece were the countries with the highest representation of species (159, 152 and 139 species respectively), due to their extended coastline and the number of scholars working on marine invasive species. The highest number of established species was recorded in Turkey (116 species), whereas in Italy and Greece the most numerous species were the "expected" ones (85 and 48 species, respectively). The eastern Adriatic Sea countries (i.e. Albania, Croatia, Montenegro and Slovenia) had generally low numbers of species in this list, many of which are still "expected" to arrive from the neighbouring countries of Greece and Italy. Finally, the most frequently potential pathway was transfer stowaways (ship ballast water: 41 cases; ship hull fouling: 55), whereas unaided spread of Lessepsian immigrants followed (95 cases).
   This list is intended to serve as an early warning system that through horizon scanning process would assist ESENIAS countries to prioritise invasive alien species, their pathways and the areas of higher likelihood to appear, in order to take management measures.

TI The Economy, The Biosphere and Planetary Boundaries: Towards Biosphere
   Economics
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB Nine planetary boundaries have been proposed, capturing essential biophysical processes that sustain the Earth System and its biosphere in an accommodating state for humanity. Drawing on economics literature, we propose conditions under which remaining within these boundaries is in line with economic policy. We assert that pervasive uncertainties combined with impacts of trespassing planetary boundaries clearly legitimate using safe minimum standards or precautionary approaches. Moreover, information about the risk structure of these processes, including potential large-scale regime shifts, could help refine policies for how to relate to the zones of uncertainty of the boundaries. Planetary boundaries may be interpreted as "growth within limits" especially in relation to the biophysical expansion of the human dimension. Here, we picture them as warning signs creating incentives for shifting development into new directions, new pathways, where growth in human well-being is the focus rather than growth in GDP. In this sense, we reiterate the framework of ecological economics of sustainable scale (i.e., developing within planetary boundaries), efficient allocation, and fair distribution, and emphasize the need for "biosphere economics" to help navigate globalization within the capacity of the biosphere as the complex adaptive system it truly is.

AB This paper discusses the transition from a game theoretic to a complexity view of world politics with an emphasis on global environmental issues. Game theory is a traditional tool of analysis in international relations and relevant game theoretic models include the prisoner's dilemma, and the North-South divide. The complexity approach to world politics, taking place on a highly interconnected global network of actors organized as agents and meta-agents, constitutes a multiplayer extension of game theory that may help with understanding and anticipating global events. Technology, interconnections, feedback and individual empowerment are important characteristics of the complex world of global politics. Evolution and adaptation are related to the concept of fitness of the actors in world politics. Many events of world politics constitute emergent phenomena of the complex international community of state and non-state actors and may be simulated with agent-based modeling, arguably the most prevalent method of simulating complex systems. Characteristic research works from social science, political science, defense, world politics and the global environment that utilize agent-based simulation, are reviewed. The paper is concluded with a recapping of the main points, suggestions and caveats for future directions.

TI Scale, change and resilience in community tourism planning
SO TOURISM GEOGRAPHIES
AB Resilience planning has emerged in recent years as an alternative to the sustainable development paradigm to provide new perspectives on community development and socio-ecological adjustments to a rapidly changing world. Tourism scholars have been somewhat slow to adopt the recent conceptual ideas related to community resilience that have been published in other disciplinary areas, though this situation is also changing rapidly. While most resilience research focuses on major disasters and crises, new frameworks that encompass slow change variables provide a more comprehensive view on resilience. A model for tourism resilience considers this rate of change (transitioning from slow to fast), and the scale of tourism interest (scaling from that of the entrepreneur to those that are community-wide). The resulting 2 x 2 matrix presents four contexts with distinct resilience issues, methodologies and measurements, ranging from entrepreneurs managing daily maintenance needs, to community disaster readiness, response and recovery.

TI The Rise of Emergent Corporate Sustainability: A Self-Organised View
SO SYSTEMS
AB Escalating climate crisis activism highlights the potential of self-organised approaches in sustainability to address the disconnect between corporate sustainability activities and globally declining ecological systems. This paper argues that corporate sustainability is a co-evolutionary process of emergence which may enable organisations to address this disconnect by creating a context supportive of emergence within the organisation rather than reacting to pressures from outside. An exploratory mixed-methods case study was used to explore how corporate sustainability emerged in two financial services institutions. This article develops the idea of corporate sustainability as a co-evolutionary process of emergence and presents a framework to assist organisations to cultivate sustainability. It adopts a complexity view and posits that reductionism associated with Newtonian thinking has contributed to the sustainability issues faced by humanity. This study suggests that the paradigmatic assumptions that have contributed to the sustainability crisis must be interrogated to create an environment which is conducive to the emergence of corporate sustainability. Through examining corporate sustainability as an emergent process, this paper sheds light on how businesses can foster conditions in which a self-organised response to sustainability challenges is distributed across the organisation whilst being embedded in the containing system.

SO ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB We synthesize the empirical contributions from the existing applied economics literature examining the influence of institutions and governance on environmental policy, environmental performance, and green investment. The literature on the influence of populism and public opinion on environmental policy adoption is also reviewed in line with the special issue. First, the paper describes how the relationship between institutions, environmental performance and environmental policy have been conceptualized and operationalized in the literature and summarizes the main findings. The second part of the paper outlines avenues for future research with specific attention to the energy transition and climate change literature. With respect to the positivist worldview adopted by this paper, we highlight various opportunities for empirical work that have recently emerged with the growing availability of data in the field of green investments, climate, and energy policy. Expanding the current empirical literature towards these research topics is of both scientific and policy relevance and can provide important insights on the broader field of sustainability transition and sustainable development. Regarding the alternative, non-positivist worldviews, future research could explore ways to connect the richer approaches such as complex adaptive systems and socio-technical transition studies with applied econometric methods, as well as future-oriented studies.

TI Salzburg Global Seminar Session 565-'Better Health Care: how do we learn
   about improvement?'
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR QUALITY IN HEALTH CARE
AB A fundamental question for the field of healthcare improvement is the extent to which the results achieved can be attributed to the changes that were implemented and whether or not these changes are generalizable. Answering these questions is particularly challenging because the healthcare context is complex, and the interventions themselves tend to be complex and multi-dimensional. The Salzburg Global Seminar Session 565-'Better Health Care: How do we learn about improvement?' was convened to address questions of attribution, generalizability and rigor, and to think through how to approach these concerns in the field of quality improvement. The Salzburg Global Seminar Session 565 brought together 61 leaders in improvement from 22 countries, including researchers, evaluators and improvers. The primary conclusion that resulted from the session was the need for evaluation to be embedded as an integral part of the improvement. We have invited participants of the seminar to contribute to writing this supplement, which consists of eight articles reflecting insights and learning from the Salzburg Global Seminar. This editorial serves as an introduction to the supplement. The supplement explains results and insights from Salzburg Global Seminar Session 565.

This article approaches tourism as a complex adaptive system composed of consumers, transportation providers, travel intermediaries, and destinations composed of multiple tourism-related companies and other stakeholder groups. Environmental and energy-related challenges of components to the system are examined as well as various units the system as a whole, enterprises and individuals within the system. A total of 92 peer-reviewed articles were studied that address 'energy' and 'tourism' published between 1974 and 2011. Also addressed are the impacts of social and cultural differences between the United States and China concerning responses to environmental and energy-related challenges. This article concludes with recommendations for addressing the challenges associated with such challenges, including building system capacity, technology development and adoption, support of individual behavior change, increasing understanding of the trade-offs and interactions within the system, and adoption of multidisciplinary approaches to these challenges within the tourism system.

TI The mature stage of capitalist development: Models, signs and policy
   implications
SO STRUCTURAL CHANGE AND ECONOMIC DYNAMICS
AB We investigate the possibility that capitalist economies - those that industrialized first and the whole OECD group - may be reaching the growth plateau naturally, in a similar way to other complex systems in nature. In the system model of autocatalytic growth we introduce endogenous and exogenous variables that provide negative feedbacks to material growth and push the economic system into the mature stage of development. Based on general developmental stages for dissipative systems, we identify variables that would uniquely mark the transition to maturity: p.c. energy consumption, GDP and energy consumption distribution, and sector composition of labor and GDP. Empirical findings suggest that the observed groups of economies may have terminated their historic phase of intensive economic growth and are entering the mature stage. This provides a tentative explanation of the observed slow-down of long-run rates of GDP growth in the G7 economies and in Western Europe. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The threat of invasive species to IUCN-listed critically endangered
   species: A systematic review
SO GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB We conducted a comprehensive review of the research literature on interactions between invasive species and species included in the critically endangered category of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. This review reveals that, globally, invasive species threaten 14% (28% on islands) of critically endangered terrestrial vertebrate species (birds, mammals and reptiles), with critically endangered birds (25%; 47% on islands) the most affected, threatened predominantly by a few invasive mammal predators (mainly rodents and feral cat). The chytrid fungal pathogen is the main threat for critically endangered amphibians. The control and management of the invasive species identified in this study should be a high priority for global biological conservation, thereby contributing towards the achievement of the goals of the Post-2020 Framework of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Further research on the impacts of invasive species and interactions with other drivers will be essential for the conservation of highly threatened species.

TI Ecosystem services and the resilience of agricultural landscapes
SO FUTURE OF AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES, PT II
SE Advances in Ecological Research
AB Global social and economic changes, alongside climate change, are affecting the operating environment for agriculture, leading to efforts to increase production and yields, typically through the use of agrochemicals like pesticides and fertilizers, expanded irrigation, and changes in seed varieties. Intensification, alongside the expansion of agriculture into new areas, has increased harvest, but has also had numerous well-known impacts on the environment, ultimately resulting in a loss of resilience and lack of sustainability in agro-ecosystems. Combined with features of agricultural systems such as the differential movement of ecosystem services, and interactions among ecosystem services driven in part by management choices, such intensification has disrupted key feedbacks in agricultural systems. These changes have tended to perpetuate the management choices that have led to efficient, productive agriculture, often at the expense of nature and the provision of important nonfood ecosystem services. Here, we explore how agriculture functions as a complex adaptive system. We assess how recent changes have interacted with agro-ecosystem features to result in a loss of resilience, and suggest key research directions to help harmonize production and ecosystem function, drawing primarily on Canadian examples. Enhancing the resilience of agricultural landscapes is critical to the long-term sustainability of agriculture in a rapidly changing world.

TI Smaller climatic niche shifts in invasive than non-invasive alien ant
   species
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The globalization of trade and human movement has resulted in the accidental dispersal of thousands of alien species worldwide at an unprecedented scale. Some of these species are considered invasive because of their extensive spatial spread or negative impacts on native biodiversity. Explaining which alien species become invasive is a major challenge of invasion biology, and it is often assumed that invasiveness is linked to a greater ability to establish in novel climates. To test whether invasive species have expanded more into novel climates than non-invasive alien species, we quantified niche shifts of 82 ant species. Surprisingly, invasive species showed smaller niche shifts than non-invasive alien species. Independent of their invasiveness, the species with the smallest native niches and range sizes, experienced the greatest niche shifts. Overall, our results challenge the assumption that invasive species are particularly good pioneers of novel climates.

TI Sustainable learning and education: A curriculum for the future
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF EDUCATION
AB This article introduces sustainable learning and education (SLE), an emerging philosophy of learning and teaching founded on principles of sustainability. SLE is not necessarily education for sustainability, but rather sustainable learning, a new and different idea. The intention behind SLE is to create and proliferate sustainable curricula and methods of learning and teaching. These are designed to instil in people the skills and dispositions to thrive in complicated, challenging and ever-changing circumstances, and contribute to making the world a better place. This article contributes to the literature by (1) elucidating the concept and purpose of SLE; (2) enumerating principles of sustainability that apply in the educational and professional development context; and (3) proposing a curriculum for SLE framed as a university course or professional development programme. The authors emphasise the importance of systems and ecological thinking and the essential role of self-sufficiency as both a means and an end of sustainable learning and education. They conclude with a comment on community: the more fully we accept and appreciate our neighbours, organisations and societies as important, interdependent and deserving of a viable future, and the more we engage with them towards positive ends, the more universally accepted the imperative of sustainability will be, and the more likely we are to attain it.

TI Habitat fragmentation: Simple models for local persistence and the
   spread of invasive species
SO JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY
AB Understanding the persistence and growth of natural populations in environments subject to random localised change is relevant both to the conservation of threatened species and to the control of invasive species. By developing and analysing simple strategic growth models in environments subject to random fragmentation events, we show that simple approximations can be used to predict invasion speeds and extinction probabilities. The rate and size of fragmentation events interact in a nonlinear way, a finding with important consequences for the efficient control of invasive species. Infrequent, large-scale fragmentation events provide more effective means of control than more frequent, smaller scale efforts. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Complexity approaches to self-organisation: a case study from an Irish
   eco-village
SO KYBERNETES
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to reflect on results of recent research about the self-organisation (SO) of communities that aim to regenerate and/or improve their sustainability, also to reflect upon methodological and epistemological issues related to the application of complexity approaches to support SO in communities and in general, social enterprises.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper summarises recent research findings on SO and self-transformation in communities using a combination of complexity approaches. It describes the methodological framework used to conduct action research about the self-transformation and learning of a European eco-community and reflects about the approaches used and lessons learned.
   Findings - This research confirms the complementarity between two approaches to complexity management: the viable systems model from S. Beer, a pioneering approach to managing complexity in institutions, and complex adaptive systems, a more recent approach to deal with SO in organisations. Mapping the organisational dynamics and the structural changes decided by the community members shows interesting insights about emergence and SO. This is a state-of-the-art research on multi-methodological approaches to support complexity management in organisations.
   Originality/value - As in many action research projects, early findings are limited to one particular organisation. Nevertheless, the theoretical frameworks of the broader research are useful for a wide variety of organisations, both in terms of guiding organisational transformations and supporting networking management of networks collaborating to create more sustainable evolutionary pathways.

SO TURKISH JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
AB In autumn 2011 and spring 2012, the diet of pike (n = 112) captured in a backwater in eastern Hungary was examined. Eight species of prey-fish were found in the stomachs of 31 of the 112 pike individuals, and 71.9% of the prey-fish in the stomachs of 16 of the 31 pike individuals were European weather loach, Misgurnus fossilis. This first recording of European weather loach in the diet of pike is a valuable finding, because it provides new information on an endangered species categorized as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The high number of European weather loach found in the diet of pike suggests that this species was easy prey for the predator after the spawning period when pike start to feed intensively to replace the energy used for reproduction.

TI Risks, decisions and biological conservation
SO DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
AB Aim Risk assessments in applied scientific disciplines have evolved somewhat in isolation, adopting conventions, assumptions and tools from other disciplines almost haphazardly. This editorial provides background for the articles in this special issue, which sample six broad themes in risk assessment in conservation biology and presenting new innovations and applications. Location Global. Methods The articles in the special issue address themes related to species distribution modelling, population viability analysis, threatened species management, biosecurity, uncertainty analysis, costbenefit analysis and foresight. We sought articles that address new and emerging topics in each of these areas. Results The articles identify new and potentially useful innovations in a variety of areas relevant to conservation biology. Collectively, they paint a picture of risk assessment as an important element in supporting transparent, rational decisions and effective policy. Main conclusions Policy makers and conservation managers aspire to set evidence-based priorities, and technical specialists aim to have their methods used in decision-making. Scientists will succeed if, as the articles in this issue exemplify, they develop a sound understanding of the context of the decisions in which their tools are to be used and shape them accordingly.

   Species? The Case of Alien Bee-Hawking Yellow-Legged Hornet in Iberian
   Peninsula
SO CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY
AB Biological invasions cause great damage to native ecosystems, therefore, it is extremely important to take measures to contain the progress of existing invasions and prevent new ones. Here, we used the Species Distribution Models approach to compare two independent datasets for the invasive alien species the Yellow-legged hornet in the Iberian Peninsula. One dataset compiles occurrence records gathered by expert people (e.g. environmental services' technical staff and researchers); and the other compiles occurrence records gathered by non-expert people (e.g. amateur entomologists, beekeepers). The main aim is to assess the effectiveness and reliability of the dataset managed by non-experts when comparing it to the dataset managed by experts. Our results showed a high degree of concordance and similarity between models. Thus, both datasets would have the same reliability to be used in management strategies for this species.

AB Developing an economic net-zero energy infrastructure for the manufacturing industry can play a critical role to achieve the goal of affordable, reliable, and sustainable clean energy paradigm for the next generation. However, it is quite challenging to develop such an infrastructure due to the uncertain demand of the manufacturing system, intermittent electricity generation from the renewable sources, time of use (TOU) pricing of electricity, and integrated operational planning for the long-term planning horizon. In this paper, a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model is developed to economically design an onsite microgrid system considering the critical conditions and achieve a net-zero energy operation planning for the manufacturing industry. A linearization strategy is adopted to obtain the optimal design of the microgrid and the utilization of the resources. A numerical case study is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the model.

TI A Relational Vulnerability Analytic: Exploring Hybrid Methodologies for
   Human Dimensions of Climate Change Research in the Himalayas
SO HIMALAYAN WEATHER AND CLIMATE AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT
AB Vulnerability assessments are critical tools when exploring the Human Dimensions of Climate Change in the Global South. Additionally, Social Ecological Systems research utilizes such assessments to describe and predict potential spaces/tools of policy intervention. However, much of the assessment methodology fails to address the coupled structural processes underlying vulnerability and the experience of climate change. First, most scholarship does not operationalize mixed-methods research using plural epistemologies. Second, it fails to incorporate the communally produced knowledge of marginalized regional populations. Ultimately, power inequalities and their impact on vulnerability within complex adaptive systems, are overwhelmingly ignored. This project attempts to address these issues through a 'Relational Vulnerability Analytic' (RVA). We utilize a plural epistemological approach to construct an analytic that envisions the various relationships, processes and tools that need to be cultivated and managed in order to empower the community as co-producers of knowledge, while challenging the disciplinary bias in explorations of climate change risk and adaptation. Our method brings top-down spatial analysis tools, mathematical models, grounded ethnographic fieldwork and participatory feminist epistemologies into productive tension to reveal the sources of vulnerability and the agency of subjects, in rural Himalayan households. Additionally, we addresses the appeal for long term, collaborative, multi--dimensional research mobilization in the Himalayas. While the analytic is parameterized for the Himalayan region, it can be implemented in other regions with certain salient customizations. The project concludes that future efforts should be to operationalize this analytic for different regions and populations.

TI Ad global, but think local: accountability at the frontlines
SO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MATTERS
AB There is a worrying divergence between the way that sexual and reproductive health and rights problems and solutions are framed in advocacy at the global level and the complex reality that people experience in health services on the ground. An analysis of approaches to accountability used in advocacy at these different levels highlights the different assumptions at play as to how change happens. This paper makes the case for a reinvigorated approach to accountability that begins with the dynamics of power at the frontlines, where people encounter health providers and institutions. Conventional approaches to accountability avoid grappling with these dynamics, and as a result, many accountability efforts do not lead to transformative change. Implementation science and systems science are promising sources for fresh approaches, beginning with the understanding of health systems as complex adaptive systems embedded in the broader political dynamics of their societies. By drawing insights from disciplines such as political economy, ethnography, and organizational change management - and applying them creatively to the experience of people in health systems - the workings of power can begin to be uncovered and tackled, sharpening accountability towards those whose health and rights are at stake and generating meaningful change.

AB Angraecum jeannineanum, a new species endemic to Mauritius, is described and its ecology and conservation status are discussed. Angraecum jeannineanum differs from A. cadetii, which is the morphologically most closely related species, as follows: (i) leaves are smaller, thicker and darker green, (ii) inflorescences and flowers are thinner and smaller, (iii) flowers are more greenish and non-fleshy. Angraecum jeannineanum belongs to Angraecum section Hadrangis, endemic to the Mascarenes, which also includes A. bracteosum, A. cadetii and A. striatum. An updated key for the section is provided. The species should be considered as Critically Endangered (CR) according to the Red List Criteria of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This assessment is based on the highly restricted species distribution, small population size, and habitat sustaining degradation by invasive alien plants and animals.

TI Complexity Leadership Theory: A Perspective for State-Owned Enterprises
   in Ghana
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT
AB This article explores the need to change the bureaucratic leadership structure which has bedeviled state-owned enterprises for many decades and how they compete in the 21st-century business environment where there are uncertainty and chaos. The SOEs suppose provide employment, meet social and political needs, and operate in the sectors of the economy that are of strategic importance to the state. Therefore, SOEs are critical to economic development in emerging economies. The pace of change confronting organizations today has added complexity to the organizational landscape and now calls for more flexible and adaptive leadership. Adaptive leaders can work more effectively in the unstable global business environment and are also able to adopt a proactive approach in order to keep abreast of the increasing stakeholder pressures in the enterprises. However, inadequate applicability of traditional leadership models has indicated the need to develop new leadership models to solve the complex organizational challenges. Hence complexity leadership approach seeks to combine these dynamics to the bureaucratic hierarchies in order to explain the way informal organizational dynamics function correctly and also to describe how these valuable adaptive functions can be promoted to better the operations of SOEs in Ghana

TI Scaling up of Brazil's Crianca Feliz early childhood development
   program: an implementation science analysis
SO ANNALS OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF SCIENCES
AB To address inequities that prevent socioeconomically vulnerable young children from reaching their full developmental potential, Brazil implemented Programa Crianca Feliz (PCF) ("Happy Child" early childhood development program) in 2934 of its 5570 municipalities. A qualitative case study was carried out on the basis of in-depth interviews with 22 key informants, employing purposive sampling, from past or current national and state coordination teams. Thematic analysis followed the RE-AIM framework, and complex adaptive system constructs mapped how barriers and enablers influenced scale-up. One overarching theme related to PCF emergence, and 18 subthemes were identified within the RE-AIM. An enabling national political environment favored PCF emergence through a top-down approach that led to governance challenges. Changes in the enrollment criteria for families facilitated reach, and evidence-based methodology favored the designing of the home visits. However, operationalizing the intersectoral actions remains a barrier for effectiveness, while intrasectoral resistance across levels delayed adoption. WhatsApp facilitated networking, capacity building, and adoption. Rushed scale-up generated barriers for quality delivery and led to different implementation pathways across municipalities. Legal institutionalization is critical to assure permanent funding and maintenance. PCF has enhanced early childhood services in Brazil, but strong negative feedback loops need to be addressed for effective sustainability.

TI The future of futures decision making
SO FUTURES
AB At the dawn of a new millennium, with the past one thousand years ready for reflection and the up-coming one thousand years primed for exciting new adventures, humankind seems to be trapped in the box of myopic, short-term decision making. Voices pleading to expand the horizons of our decision making to ensure sustainability of our species and countless other species on this earth are Currently drowned out by a cacophony of voices trumpeting economic globalization, rapid technology development, and real-time financial markets. While futures decision making is not much in evidence today, the question addressed by this paper is whether futures decision making is even possible. Are there inherent constraints in our ability to make decisions that encompass time frames covering centuries if not millennia? An enormous amount of research has been conducted in the general area of decision making over the past several decades. Much has been learned about the psychology of human decision making and decision making within organizations. Countless methods have been developed to guide decision making. Recent work in areas such as imprecise probability and complex adaptive systems is beginning to provide boundaries as to what can be known about the future. This paper reviews much of this diverse literature and synthesizes important research findings across several disciplines to identify numerous significant barriers to futures decision making. The paper presents several recommendations on how to improve futures decision making in the future. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

To assess SES resilience, we constructed an Agent-Based Model (ABM) of a land use system as a stereotypical example of SES and investigated how resilience of the represented system is affected by both external disturbances and internal dynamics. The model explicitly considered different aspects of resilience in a framework derived from literature, which includes "resilience to", "resilience of", "resilience at", "resilience due to", and "indicators of resilience". External disturbances were implemented as shocks in crop yields. Internal dynamics comprised of two types of social interaction between agents (learning and cooperation), an ecological feedback of soil depletion and an economic feedback of agglomeration benefits. We systematically varied these mechanisms and measured indicators that reflected spatial, social, and economic resilience. Results showed that (1) internal mechanisms increased the ability of the system to recover from external shocks, (2) feedbacks resulted in different regimes of crop cultivation, each with a distinctive set of functions, and (3) resilience is not a generic system property, but strongly depends on what system function is considered. We recommend future studies to include internal dynamics, especially feedbacks, and to systematically assess them across different aspects of resilience.

TI Resistance Genes in Global Crop Breeding Networks
SO PHYTOPATHOLOGY
AB Resistance genes are a major tool for managing crop diseases. The networks of crop breeders who exchange resistance genes and deploy them in varieties help to determine the global landscape of resistance and epidemics, an important system for maintaining food security. These networks function as a complex adaptive system, with associated strengths and vulnerabilities, and implications for policies to support resistance gene deployment strategies. Extensions of epidemic network analysis can be used to evaluate the multilayer agricultural networks that support and influence crop breeding networks. Here, we evaluate the general structure of crop breeding networks for cassava, potato, rice, and wheat. All four are clustered due to phytosanitary and intellectual property regulations, and linked through CGIAR hubs. Cassava networks primarily include public breeding groups, whereas others are more mixed. These systems must adapt to global change in climate and land use, the emergence of new diseases, and disruptive breeding technologies. Research priorities to support policy include how best to maintain both diversity and redundancy in the roles played by individual crop breeding groups (public versus private and global versus local), and how best to manage connectivity to optimize resistance gene deployment while avoiding risks to the useful life of resistance genes.

TI Towards Conserving Crop Wild Relatives along the Texas-Mexico Border:
   The Case of Manihot walkerae
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Walker's Manihot, Manihot walkerae, is an endangered species endemic to south Texas and northeastern Mexico and is a Crop Wild Relative (CWR) of the international and economically important crop cassava (M. esculenta). Manihot walkerae is globally endangered (IUCN's Redlist, Texas list, USA); however, it is not recognized on the Mexican list of endangered species (NOM-059-SEMARNAT). We assessed the status of M. walkerae in Mexico and re-evaluated its global status. According to our analysis, M. walkerae should be considered an endangered species based on the IUCN's assessment method and a threatened species in Mexico based on the Mexican criteria. Our findings encourage the establishment of sound conservation plans for M. walkerae along the Texas-Mexico border.

TI Limitations of threatened species lists in Canada: A federal and
   provincial perspective
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB Threatened species lists are valuable tools used to inform conservation decisions when developed appropriately. However, inherent problems associated with current listing and recovery processes exist in Canada (bias, legislative requirements, and data discrepancies). Canadian Species at Risk lists (national) and Nova Scotia's Endangered Species lists (regional) were assessed to determine i) coverage of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) (global) listed vulnerable, endangered, and critically endangered species; ii) recovery compliance; and iii) recovery plan completeness. Results indicated that many globally threatened species lack adequate protection nationally and regionally in Canada. Different taxonomic groups received different listing and recovery priorities. Mammals received the highest likelihood of listing and recovery action time, while fish were less likely to be listed. Many nationally threatened and endangered species have recovery plans, though most (141 species) were developed later than legislated. Environmental management related to biases, economic considerations, and late recovery planning (i.e., non-compliance) needs serious improvement in listing and recovery processes to enhance protection of biodiversity nationally and regionally within Canada.

TI Mathematical Tools for Controlling Invasive Species in Protected Areas
SO MATHEMATICAL APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS IMPACTS: MAC2I
SE Springer INdAM Series
AB A challenging task in the management of Protected Areas is to control the spread of invasive species, either floristic or faunistic, and the preservation of indigenous endangered species, typically competing for the use of resources in a fragmented habitat. In this paper, we present some mathematical tools that have been recently applied to contain the worrying diffusion of wolf-wild boars in a Southern Italy Protected Area belonging to the Natura 2000 network. They aim to solve the problem according to three different and in some sense complementary approaches: (i) the qualitative one, based on the use of dynamical systems and bifurcation theory; (ii) the Z-control, an error-based neural dynamic approach; (iii) the optimal control theory. In the case of the wild-boars, the obtained results are illustrated and discussed. To refine the optimal control strategies, a further development is to take into account the spatio-temporal features of the invasive species over large and irregular environments. This approach can be successfully applied, with an optimal allocation of resources, to control an invasive alien species infesting the Alta Murgia National Park: Ailanthus altissima. This species is one of the most invasive species in Europe and its eradication and control is the object of research projects and biodiversity conservation actions in both protected and urban areas [11]. We lastly present, as a further example, the effects of the introduction of the brook trout, an alien salmonid from North America, in naturally fishless lakes of the Gran Paradiso National Park, study site of an on-going H2020 project (ECOPOTENTIAL).

TI How "smart cities" will change supply chain management
SO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the impact of smart city initiatives and big data on supply chain management (SCM). More specifically, the connections between smart cities, big data and supply network characteristics (supply network structure and governance mechanisms) are investigated.
   Design/methodology/approach - An integrative framework is proposed, grounded on a literature review on smart cities, big data and supply networks. Then, the relationships between these constructs are analyzed, using the proposed integrative framework.
   Findings - Smart cities have different implications to network structure (complexity, density and centralization) and governance mechanisms (formal vs informal). Moreover, this work highlights and discusses the future research directions relating to smart cities and SCM.
   Research limitations/implications - The relationships between smart cities, big data and supply networks cannot be described simply by using a linear, cause-and-effect framework. Accordingly, an integrative framework that can be used in future empirical studies to analyze smart cities and big data implications on SCM has been proposed.
   Practical implications - Smart cities and big data alone have limited capacity of improving SCM processes, but combined they can support improvement initiatives. Nevertheless, smart cities and big data can also suppose some novel obstacles to effective SCM.
   Originality/value - Several studies have analyzed information technology innovation adoption in supply chains, but, to the best of our knowledge, no study has focused on smart cities.

   Species Rosa rugosa Thunb.
SO MITOCHONDRIAL DNA PART B-RESOURCES
AB Rosa rugosa Thunb. is an endangered species in China and also an invasive species in Northern Europe with important ornamental value, economic value, and breeding value, especially wild R. rugosa. In this study, the complete plastid genome of R. rugosa was sequenced and analyzed using next-generation DNA sequencing technology. We subjected the genomic analyses and constructed the maternal phylogenetic relationships. The complete plastid genome was 157,110 bp in length, including a large single copy (LSC) region of 86,214 bp, a small single copy (SSC) region of 18,820 bp and a pair of inverted repeat (IR) regions of 26,038 bp. In total of 116 unique genes were identified, containing 79 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 30 transfer RNA genes, four ribosomal RNA genes, and three pseudogenes (psi ycf1, psi ycf15, psi ycf68), respectively. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that R. rugosa and R. praelucens formed an independent clade with a 100% bootstrap support.

TI Assortativity and mixing patterns in international supply chain networks
SO CHAOS
AB As economic globalisation increases, inclination toward domestic protectionism is also increasing in many countries of the world. To improve the productivity and the resilience of national economies, it is important to understand the drivers and the barriers of the internatiolisation of economic activities. While internatiolisation of individual economic actors is difficult to explain using traditional theories, aggregate patterns may be explained to some extent. We take a network-centric perspective to describe the extent of corporate internatiolisation in different countries. Based on Newman's assortativity coefficient, we design a range of assortativity metrics which are appropriate in the firm network context. Using these, we quantify companies' appetite for internatiolisation in relation to the internatiolisation of their partners. We use the Factset Revere dataset, which is provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc., that captures global supply chain relationships between companies. We identify countries where the level of internationalisation is relatively high or relatively low, and we show that subtle differences in the assortativity metrics used change the ranking of countries significantly in terms of the assortativity correlation, highlighting that companies in different countries are prone to different types of internationalisation. Overall, we demonstrate that firms from most countries in the dataset studied have a slight preference to make supply chain relationships with other firms which have undergone a similar level of internationalisation, and other firms from their own country. The implications of our results are important for countries to understand the evolution of international relationships in their corporate environments, and how they compare to other nations in the world in this regard.

TI The American West as a social-ecological region: drivers, dynamics and
   implications for nested social-ecological systems
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB The American West exists in the popular imagination as a distinct region, and policies and politics often suggest that both the challenges and the opportunities for land management and human well-being across the region are relatively homogeneous. In this paper, we argue that there are key characteristics that define the West as a social-ecological region, and also that there are myriad social-ecological systems (SESs) within the region that require diverse and dynamic approaches to managing change over time. We first conceptualize aridity, topography, and a unique political economy of land as exogenous factors that persist over time and space to define the American West as a contiguous social-ecological region. We then identify a second set of characteristics that show high degrees of variation across SESs within the American West. Finally, we operationalize the relationships between regional characteristics and local dynamics through a set of case studies that exemplify specific types of SESs in the region. The results of these empirical representations of the regional and intra-regional social-ecological dynamics of the contemporary American West highlight the implications for research and management of taking a cross-scale integrated approach to address pressing social-ecological opportunities and challenges in complex adaptive systems.

TI Challenges and current developments for Sensing, Smart and Sustainable
   Enterprise Systems
SO COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY
AB As technology advances and thus Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) evolve, a new enterprise model must be devised to face future digital enterprise needs. This paper discusses issues and emerging trends that must be addressed if a true sensing and smart enterprise is to be achieved to meet sustainability requirements. Methods are required to capture enterprise reality and to provide a seamless interoperable digital enterprise model. The paper summarises several challenges to be addressed by future research in enterprise modelling. Challenges are discussed from the Enterprise, Information, Computational, Engineering and Technological points of view, according to the ODP-RM (Open Distributed Processing-Reference Model). To some extent, progress on some challenges has already been made and solutions are expected to materialise in the near future. Other challenges have only recently been identified and potential solutions cannot yet be predicted. The paper offers a discussion of these challenges for the future enterprise along with the required enterprise model; it also introduces the concept of the Sensing, Smart and Sustainable (S boolean AND 3) Enterprise System. The position paper expresses opinions derived from the existing general research priorities and directions identified by the International Federation for Automatic Control-Technical Committee on Enterprise Integration and Networking (IFAC-TC 5.3).

TI Research on supply network resilience considering random and targeted
   disruptions simultaneously
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB Supply networks (SN) must maintain operations and connectedness under disruptions to remain competitive; this is referred to as SN resilience. Building a resilient SN is an underlying challenge in supply chain management. In this paper, SN resilience is examined from the complex network topology perspective to understand how supply chain managers construct resilient networks. The proposed growth model considers enterprises leaving the network, which previous studies have ignored. Considering the heterogeneous roles of enterprises, new metrics based on a new proposed sub-network concept are presented to evaluate resilience. Using a computer simulation, the resilience of the SN generated by the model proposed in this paper is compared with that of other models, and the results indicate that (i) the proposed model can be tuned to generate a desired resilient network; (ii) the proposed metrics capture the resilience requirements of the SN very well; (iii) the more uniform the distribution of the enterprises, the more resilient the corresponding SN; and (iv) the higher the values of alpha and beta, the lower the SN resilience, and beta affects the resilience more than alpha does.

TI The economic cost of managing invasive species in Australia
SO NEOBIOTA
AB Like most jurisdictions, Australia is managing a broad range of invasive alien species. Here, we provide the first holistic quantification of how much invasive species impact Australia's economy, and how much Australia spends on their management. In the 01-02 financial year (June to July), the combined estimated cost (economic losses and control) of invasive species was $9.8 billion, rising to $13.6 billion in the 11-12 financial year. Approximately $726 million of grants funded through the Commonwealth of Australia (i.e. federal funding) was spent on invasive species management and research between 1996 to 2013. In 01-02, total national expenditure on invasive species was $2.31 billion, rising to $3.77 billion in 11-12. Agriculture accounted for more than 90% of the total cost. For 01-02 and 11-12, these expenditure figures equate to $123 and $197 per person per year respectively, as well as 0.32 and 0.29% of GDP respectively. All values provided here are most likely to be underestimates of the real values due to the significant constraints of the data obtainable. Invasive species are clearly a significant economic burden in Australia. Given the extent of the issue of invasive species globally, there is a clear need for better quantifications of both economic loss and expenditure in more jurisdictions, as well as in Australia.

TI Adaptive management of alien invasive species: putting the theory into
   practice
SO NATUREZA & CONSERVACAO
AB Even though often based on scarce information, many actions due to conservation of biodiversity need to be carried out as matters of urgency. In the case of biological invasions this is a common situation as the real possibilities for controlling an invasive alien species are significantly reduced as it establishes and spreads over natural eosystems. Adaptive management that is management practices planned on a solid experimental basis allows managers to tackle urgent problems at the same time they generate essential information to test the effectiveness of control practices and the precision of assessments of the impacts of invasive species over natural ecosystems or of the need to crry out complementary restoration practices. The basic principles of adaptive management are presented in this paper with examples of its application in the control of invasive alien species in the pampas of Argentina.

AB The United States Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) is the strongest tool for protecting plants and animals in the US and has served as a model of species protection for many other nations. Because the goals of the Act - to conserve all endangered and threatened species in the US and the ecosystems upon which they depend - are widely supported among US environmentalists and biologists, it is commonly believed that these groups offer united support for the legislation. Within the US, however, vigorous debate ensues among conservation biologists as to the effectiveness of the species-oriented approach of the Act.

AB The reliability of transferring species distribution models (SDMs) to new ranges and future climates has been widely debated. Biological invasions offer the unique opportunity to evaluate model transferability, as distribution data between species' native and introduced ranges are geographically independent of each other. Here, we performed the first global quantitative synthesis of the spatial transferability of SDMs for 235 invasive species and assessed the association of model transferability with the focal invader, model choice and parameterisation. We found that SDMs had limited spatial transferability overall. However, model transferability was higher for terrestrial endotherms, species introduced from or to the Southern Hemisphere, and species introduced more recently. Model transferability was also positively associated with the number of presences for model calibration and evaluation, respectively, but negatively with the number of predictors. These findings highlight the importance of considering the characteristics of the focal invader, environment and modelling in the application and assessment of SDMs.

TI Science, Policy, and Conservation Management for a Critically Endangered
   Primate in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil
SO FRONTIERS IN CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB Long-standing concerns about the status of the world's endangered primates have stimulated significant international efforts, such as the primate action plans published by the Primate Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Species Survival Commission. However, national-level action plans that bring together diverse scientific experts, non-governmental organizations, and governmental agencies to focus on improving the status of endangered species are generally rare. Here, we highlight one such plan published a decade ago, the Brazilian National Action Plan for the Conservation of Muriquis, which promoted the integration of scientific findings about the behavioral ecology, demography, and genetics of northern muriquis with conservation measures supported by the Brazilian government. This plan provided a holistic framework for the development of an effective national strategy that has contributed to significant advances in research and management applied to the conservation of this Critically Endangered species. We hope that this model for muriquis will stimulate conservationists around the world to pursue integrative national-level sponsorship of action plans on behalf of other endangered species.

TI Predicting potential distributions of invasive species: where to go from
   here?
SO DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
AB Aim
   There has been considerable recent interest in modelling the potential distributions of invasive species. However, research has developed in two opposite directions: the first, focusing on screening, utilizes phenomenological models; the second, focusing on predictions of invasion dynamics, utilizes mechanistic models. Here, we present hybrid modelling as an approach to bridge the gap and to integrate the advantages of both research directions.
   Location
   Global.
   Methods
   First, we briefly summarize the characteristics and limitations of both approaches (screening vs. understanding). Then, we review the recent developments of hybrid models, discuss their current problems and offer suggestions to improve them.
   Results
   Generally, hybrid models are able to combine the advantages of currently used phenomenological and mechanistic approaches. Main challenges in building hybrid models are the choices of the appropriate degree of detail and efficiency and the decision on how to connect the different sub-models. Given these challenges, we discuss the links between the phenomenological and the mechanistic model parameters, the underlying concepts of fundamental and realized niches and the problem of feedback loops between population dynamics and environmental factors.
   Main conclusions
   Once the above challenges have been addressed and the necessary framework has been developed, hybrid models will provide outstanding tools for overcoming past limitations and will provide the means to make reliable and robust predictions of the potential distribution of invasive species, their population dynamics and the potential outcomes of the overall invasion process.

TI ICT Powered Strategic Flexibility System Dynamic Model: A Pillar for
   Economic Development in Micro and Small Enterprises
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEM DYNAMICS APPLICATIONS
AB Resource-Based View (RBV) of the firm in strategic management literature focuses on firm internal endowments in terms of resources, capabilities and dynamic capabilities for their development. By establishing a learning mechanism, where they are able to adapt and influence the environment, enterprises build a dynamic competence and sustainable competitive advantage. This paper posits that this dynamic competence or strategic flexibility as referred to by strategic management scholars is a phenomenon that needs to be understood by scholars and practitioners in MSEs so that effective intervention programs can be designed. The paper argues that by treating strategic flexibility as a CAS provides a methodology within which models based on known theories in strategic management are employed and tested using system dynamics. The paper also posits that System Dynamics (SD) modeling is a good modeling methodology that captures the dynamism in a CAS. The paper therefore presents a conceptual model for strategic flexibility and a system dynamic model that reveals the variables in play and their relationships. In so doing the paper exposes influence points in the CAS that act as intervention points by practitioners in strategic flexibility of firms. The paper presents ICTs as interventions at the influence points and presents a generic strategic flexibility system dynamic model that brings to play the impact of ICT.

TI Disentangling the four demographic dimensions of species invasiveness
SO JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB A definitive list of invasive species traits remains elusive, perhaps due to inconsistent ways of identifying invasive species. Invasive species are typically identified using one or more of four demographic criteria (local abundance, geographic range, environmental range, spread rate), referred to here as the demographic dimensions of invasiveness. In 112 studies comparing invasive and non-invasive plant traits, all 15 combinations of the four demographic dimensions were used to identify invasive species; 22% of studies identified invasive species solely by high abundance, while 25% ignored abundance. We used demographic data of 340 alien herbs classified as invasive or non-invasive in Victoria, Australia, to test whether the demographic dimensions are independent and which dimensions influence invasive species listing in practice. Species' abundances, spread rates and range sizes were independent. Relative abundance best explained the invasiveness classification. However, invasive and non-invasive species each spanned the full range of each demographic dimension, indicating that no dimension clearly separates invasive from non-invasive species. Graminoids with longer minimum residence times were more frequently classified as invasive, as were forbs occurring near edges of native vegetation fragments.Synthesis. Conflating multiple forms of invasiveness, by not distinguishing invasive species that are identified using different demographic criteria, may obscure traits possessed by particular subsets of invasive species. Traits promoting high abundance likely differ from those enabling fast spread and broad ranges. Examining traits linked with the four demographic dimensions of invasiveness will highlight species at risk of becoming dominant, spreading quickly or occupying large ranges.

TI Measuring progress in US endangered species conservation
SO ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB Since passage of the Endangered Species Act in 1973, over 1300 endangered and threatened species have been protected in the USA and its territories. Most species continue to face a significant risk of extinction, but the status of many species is improving. Here we present analyses of federal agency reports to the United States Congress (1988-2002) that describe differences in species status and show which variables are correlated with improving or declining status. We found that 52% of species showed repeated improvements or were not declining over this time. Species status improves over time, with only 35% still declining 13 years or more after protection. Taxonomy, funding by US Fish and Wildlife Service and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and agency assessment of risk of extinction and potential to recover were significantly correlated with status.

TI Cryobanking of viable biomaterials: implementation of new strategies for
   conservation purposes
SO MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB Cryobanking, the freezing of biological specimens to maintain their integrity for a variety of anticipated and unanticipated uses, offers unique opportunities to advance the basic knowledge of biological systems and their evolution. Notably, cryobanking provides a crucial opportunity to support conservation efforts for endangered species. Historically, cryobanking has been developed mostly in response to human economic and medical needs - these needs must now be extended to biodiversity conservation. Reproduction technologies utilizing cryobanked gametes, embryos and somatic cells are already vital components of endangered species recovery efforts. Advances in modern biological research (e.g. stem cell research, genomics and proteomics) are already drawing heavily on cryobanked specimens, and future needs are anticipated to be immense. The challenges of developing and applying cryobanking for a broader diversity of species were addressed at an international conference held at Trier University (Germany) in June 2008. However, the magnitude of the potential benefits of cryobanking stood in stark contrast to the lack of substantial resources available for this area of strategic interest for biological science - and society at large. The meeting at Trier established a foundation for a strong global incentive to cryobank threatened species. The establishment of an Amphibian Ark cryobanking programme offers the first opportunity for global cooperation to achieve the cryobanking of the threatened species from an entire vertebrate class.

TI Plant-microbe-herbivore interactions in invasive and non-invasive alien
   plant species
SO FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB Plants interact with many organisms, such as microbes and herbivores, and these interactions are likely to affect the establishment and spread of plants. In the context of plant invasions, mycorrhizal fungi and constitutive and induced resistance of plants against herbivores have received attention independently of each other. However, plants are frequently involved in complex multi-trophic interactions, which might differ between invasive and non-invasive alien plants. In a multi-species comparative experiment, we aimed to improve our understanding of plant traits associated with invasiveness. We tested whether eight invasive alien plant species use the mycorrhizal symbiosis in a more beneficial way, and have higher levels of constitutive or induced resistance against two generalist bioassay herbivores, than nine non-invasive alien species. We further assessed whether the presence of mycorrhizal fungi altered the resistance of the plant species, and whether this differed between invasive and non-invasive alien species. While invasive species produced more biomass, they did not differ in their biomass response to mycorrhizal fungi from non-invasive alien species. Invasive species also did not have higher levels of constitutive or induced resistance against the two generalist herbivores. Mycorrhizal fungi greatly affected the resistance of our plant species, however, this was also unrelated to whether the alien species were invasive or not. Our study confirms the previous findings that invasive species generally grow faster and produce more biomass than non-invasive alien species. We further show that alien plant species used a variety of defence strategies, and also varied in their interactions with mycorrhizal fungi. These multi-trophic interactions were not consistently related to invasiveness of the alien plant species. We suggest that awareness of the fact that alien plant species are involved in multi-trophic interactions might lead to a more complete understanding of the factors contributing to a plant's success.

TI Alien invasions and livelihoods: Economic benefits of invasive
   Australian Red Claw crayfish in Jamaica
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB Invasive species have caused widespread economic and environmental disruption, which have been widely studied. However, their potential benefits have received much less attention. If invasive species contribute to livelihoods, their eradication may negatively impact wellbeing. Failing to value these benefits may lead to an undervaluation of invaded ecosystems. We assess the potential economic benefits of an invasive species within an artisanal fishery in Jamaica. We monitored catches over 259 fisherman-days, and conducted 45 semi-structured interviews, with 76 fishermen. We show that the invasive Australian Red Claw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus) is an important source of income for fishermen within the Black River Lower Morass of Jamaica and supplement incomes during periods when native shrimp (Macro brachium spp.) catches decline. We also show that full-time fishermen and those who have no alternative occupations expend the greatest fishing effort. We use the intraannual variation of fishermen's harvest effort between seasons (when catch per unit effort changes) as a proxy for dependence. Using this measure, we found that the least wealthy appear to be the most dependent on fishing, and consequently benefit the most from the invasive crayfish. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering the potential benefits of invasive species within integrated landscape management. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The functional complex network approach to foster forest resilience to
   global changes
SO FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
AB Human impacts on Earth's ecosystems have greatly intensified in the last decades. This is reflected in unexpected disturbance events, as well as new and increasing socio-economic demands, all of which are affecting the resilience of forest ecosystems worldwide and the provision of important ecosystem services. This Anthropocene era is forcing us to reconsider past and current forest management and silvicultural practices, and search for new ones that are more flexible and better at dealing with the increasing uncertainty brought about by these accelerating and cumulative global changes. Here, we briefly review the focus and limitations of past and current forest management and silvicultural practices mainly as developed in Europe and North America. We then discuss some recent promising concepts, such as managing forests as complex adaptive systems, and approaches based on resilience, functional diversity, assisted migration and multi-species plantations, to propose a novel approach to integrate the functionality of species-traits into a functional complex network approach as a flexible and multi-scale way to manage forests for the Anthropocene. This approach takes into consideration the high level of uncertainty associated with future environmental and societal changes. It relies on the quantification and dynamic monitoring of functional diversity and complex network indices to manage forests as a functional complex network. Using this novel approach, the most efficient forest management and silvicultural practices can be determined, as well as where, at what scale, and at what intensity landscape-scale resistance, resilience and adaptive capacity of forests to global changes can be improved.

TI Gearing to success with national breastfeeding programmes: The Becoming
   Breastfeeding Friendly (BBF) initiative experience
SO MATERNAL AND CHILD NUTRITION
AB Evidence-based policy toolboxes are essential for decision makers to effectively invest in and scale up maternal-child health and nutrition programs, and breastfeeding is no exception. This special issue focuses on the experiences implementing the Becoming Breastfeeding Friendly (BBF) toolbox in England, Scotland, and Wales. BBF is an initiative that includes a toolbox for decision making based on the Complex Adaptive System-based Breastfeeding Gear Model. The BBF initiative experience in Great Britain presented in this special issue illustrates how versatile BBF is as it can be readily adapted to the specific application context. In this instance one country, England was trained by the Yale School of Public Health team that developed BBF. England, in turn, trained and assisted Scotland and Wales with the implementation and oversight of BBF in those countries. The positive experience implementing BBF in Great Britain is fully consistent with findings related to this initiative in other countries with contrasting economic, social, political and health care systems; including Germany, Ghana, Mexico, Myanmar, and Samoa. In all instances BBF has led to breastfeeding policy improvements with strong implications for enabling breastfeeding environments including maternity benefits, workforce development, the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative and behavior change communication campaigns. In conclusion, BBF is a powerful tool to help guide the effective scaling up of evidence-based programmes to advance breastfeeding protection, promotion and support globally.

Currently terrestrial vertebrates and vascular plants dominate the schedules, but a small number of threatened invertebrate species have been listed. Three snails and four insects have been placed an the endangered species schedule. However, experience has shown that there are difficulties in using the Act to protect invertebrates. Issues include: use of criteria in the Act; taxonomic and scientific impediments; the need to protect habitat rather than individual species; conflicts with the scientific community and amateur collectors; and the exclusion from consideration of all aquatic invertebrates.

AB This paper explores several issues associated with the adaptation of inland systems to climate change, particularly by addressing the vulnerabilities of inland centers of people, industry, and agriculture that are interconnected at multiple temporal and spatial scales. The aim of the paper is to improve understanding needed for sustainable climate change adaptation of inland systems, where sustainability encompasses social and psychological adaptation, environmental justice, and the preservation and enhancement of human dignity and natural resources. This requires participatory approaches with iterative problem framing and solution generation that are respectful of both human dignity and the integrality of nature. A vital component of developing adaptation strategies is the assessment of current vulnerabilities, namely the extent to which current climate variability and change, acting together with other stressors, impact inland systems. This assessment requires an understanding of the climate system and its impacts to inland systems, as well as the responses of the systems to changing climate. A complex adaptive systems approach can be useful in carrying out such an assessment. Important factors include how inland centers especially marginal lands, disadvantaged populations, and threatened ecosystems are resilient to both episodic shocks and to steady trends, which may be difficult to measure, monitor, or forecast. Climate change adaptation strategies for inland systems must also take into account transboundary issues, and take advantage of opportunities where present.

AB Purpose - Businesses are always seeking resilient strategies so they can weather unpredictable competitive environments. One source of unpredictability is the unsustainability of commerce's environmental, economic or social impacts and the limitations this places on businesses. Another is poor resilience causing erroneous and unexpected outputs. Companies prospering long-term must have both resilience and sustainability, existing in a symbiotic state. The purpose of this paper is to explore the two concepts and their relationship, their combined benefits and propose an approach for supporting decision makers to proactively build both characteristics.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper looks at businesses as complex adaptive systems, how their resilience and sustainability can be defined and how these might be exhibited. It then explores how they can be combined in practice.
   Findings - The two qualities are related but have different purposes, moreover resilience has two major forms related to timescales. Both kinds of resilience are identified as key for delivering sustainability, yet the reverse is also found to be true. Both are needed to deliver either and to let businesses flourish.
   Practical implications - Although the ideal state of resilient sustainability is difficult to define or achieve, pragmatic ways exist to deliver the right direction of change in organisational decisions. A novel approach to this is explored based on transition engineering and robustness engineering.
   Originality/value - This paper links resilience and sustainability explicitly and develops a holistic pragmatic approach for working through their implications in strategic decision making.

TI Looming extinctions due to invasive species: Irreversible loss of
   ecological strategy and evolutionary history
SO GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB Biological invasions are one of the main drivers of biodiversity decline worldwide. However, many associated extinctions are yet to occur, meaning that the ecological debt caused by invasive species could be considerable for biodiversity. We explore extinction scenarios due to invasive species and investigate whether paying off the current extinction debt will shift the global composition of mammals and birds in terms of ecological strategy and evolutionary history. Current studies mostly focus on the number of species potentially at risk due to invasions without taking into account species characteristics in terms of ecological or phylogenetic properties. We found that 11% of phylogenetic diversity worldwide is represented by invasive-threatened species. Furthermore, 14% of worldwide trait diversity is hosted by invasive-threatened mammals and 40% by invasive-threatened birds, with Neotropical and Oceanian realms being primary risk hotspots. Projected extinctions of invasive-threatened species result in a smaller reduction in ecological strategy space and evolutionary history than expected under randomized extinction scenarios. This can be explained by the strong pattern in the clustering of ecological profiles and families impacted by invasive alien species (IAS). However, our results confirm that IAS are likely to cause the selective loss of species with unique evolutionary and ecological profiles. Our results also suggest a global shift in species composition away from those with large body mass, which mostly feed in the lower foraging strata and have an herbivorous diet (mammals). Our findings demonstrate the potential impact of biological invasions on phylogenetic and trait dimensions of diversity, especially in the Oceanian realm. We therefore call for a more systematic integration of all facets of diversity when investigating the consequences of biological invasions in future studies. This would help to establish spatial prioritizations regarding IAS threats worldwide and anticipate the consequences of losing specific ecological profiles in the invaded community.

TI Roles of Chinese Government on Prevention and Management of Invasive
   Alien Species
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS AND ITS MANAGEMENT IN CHINA, VOL 1
SE Invading Nature-Springer Series in Invasion Ecology
AB The invasion and expansion of alien species in China is rising sharply in recent decades, due to increased transport, trade, and travel. China has become one of the countries most seriously affected by invasive species. In response to the severe threat of invasive alien species in China, the national strategies for managing invasive species have been developed, which defined the roles and responsibilities of government. In the past decades, Chinese government has initiated a series of activities to build administrative capacity, strengthen research capacity, promote international cooperation and raise public awareness. In addition, Chinese government promoted the implementation of coordinated measures and cooperative efforts throughout China and development of new prevention and control technology to prevent or minimize adverse impacts of invasive alien species (IAS) on biodiversity, as well as their consequences for the economy and human health and well-beings. But to meet the challenge of IAS in the new era, continued support of both existing and new initiatives should be reinforced or established.

TI Modelling an urban water system on the edge of chaos
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
AB Viewing an urban water system as a complex adaptive system provides new opportunities for analysis and avoids some critical simplifications. Taking this perspective, it is possible to explore the inter-related effects of changes to the system. This is particularly important in the developing world where donors providing aid aim to improve conditions but struggle to understand and quantify the systemic impacts of their actions. This is because an intervention aiming to improve condition may also have unintended and undesirable effects. To provide decision support, this paper describes an agent-based model of an urban water system, developed on the basis of ethnographic interviews, and subsequently evaluated by local stakeholders. The paper describes the model design as well as the results of scenarios. The model provides guidance on which system amendments may produce the best outcomes in terms of output variables, and on the basis of sense-checking and sensitivity analysis it is judged that model results are likely to give a good indication about possible real world outcomes. It is clear that no single strategy will solve all problems on its own, but that a combined strategy - with a strong focus on groundwater management and protection - is likely to be most successful.

TI Extinctions of Threatened Frogs may Impact Ecosystems in a Global
   Hotspot of Anuran Diversity
SO HERPETOLOGICA
AB Human activity is accelerating rates of extinction around the world, and there is therefore an urgent need to understand the potential consequences of species loss on functional diversity and ecosystem functioning. It is frequently assumed that the extinction of threatened species, which are usually rare species, may have limited effects on ecosystem functioning, especially within highly diverse regions, given the low abundance of individuals of each species and the potentially high functional redundancy among them. However, these rare species may contribute unique and irreplaceable functional roles, and therefore their extinction could have disproportionate impacts on ecosystems. We assess the functional importance of highly threatened anurans (frogs and toads) and then explore how the loss of these threatened species would impact spatial patterns of beta-diversity in Ecuador, a hotspot of anuran biodiversity and endemism. We found that highly threatened species are, on average, more functionally distinct at an assemblage level than are less threatened anurans. We then show that the potential extinction of these highly endangered species would drive the taxonomic, phylogenetic, and, especially, functional homogenization of anuran assemblages across the Ecuadorian Andes. We suggest this could lead to profound alterations in the stability of local ecosystem functioning. Finally, we highlight the limited scope of the existing network of protected areas in Ecuador to effectively cover anuran assemblages predicted to become increasingly functionally homogenous. Our study underscores the potential losses of functional diversity that accompany species extinctions and the importance of considering the many facets of biodiversity in conservation decision-making.

TI Maintaining the high diversity of pine and oak species in Mexican
   temperate forests: a new management approach combining functional zoning
   and ecosystem adaptability
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB Mexican temperate forests, at the southernmost end of the distribution range of this ecosystem, are the world's centre of diversity of pine and oak, with 55 and 161 species, respectively. Such forests are threatened by land-use change, unsustainable forest management practices, and climate change; these threats reduce their diversity, alter the distribution ranges of species, modify disturbance regimes, and reduce ecosystem adaptability. This paper briefly reviews (i) the ecology of the Mexican temperate forests, (ii) the ecological basis for the unique diversity of pine and oak species, (iii) the main disturbances as well as the main drivers of global changes affecting these forests, in particular climate change, and (iv) the social, economic, and cultural factors to be considered in proposing a new forest management approach. It proposes a new conceptual framework to manage Mexican temperate forests that are in line with (i) their natural dynamics, (ii) the rapidly changing and uncertain global environmental, social, and economic conditions, and (iii) the complex adaptive system approach. This new forest management combines functional zoning, multispecies plantations, and sylvicultural interventions to increase the adaptive capacity of forests as a way to balance the increasing need for timber products with the need for other ecosystem services facing rapidly changing and uncertain future environmental, social, and economic conditions.

TI COMMUNICATING INVASION: UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL ANXIETIES AROUND MOBILE

SO GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES B-HUMAN GEOGRAPHY
AB This article explores how discourses of threat concerning invasive alien species emerge and how ordinary citizens understand, receive and appropriate them. It explores the ambivalence of scientists and policy-makers using emotive or highly charged terms and vocabulary, arguing that many make strategic yet cautious use of fear to raise awareness. Based both on in-depth interviews of scientists and/or expert policy-makers involved in communicating with the public about invasive species, as well as citizen focus groups, it further discusses how individuals reflect critically on the terms used in written documents. We argue that the various scientific uncertainties concerning the impacts of invasive species foster and feed other domains of social anxiety beyond the usual concern previous research has shown for xenophobic connotations. These include wider fears about environmental technology, science and expertise, changing environments, and threats to human health.

AB Main features of the male and female generative sphere of Ambrosia artemisigolia and Iva xanthiifolia - two invasive species in the Bulgarian flora, belonging to the family Asteraceae, were established during the study, namely: tetrasporangiate anthers; four-layered anther wall that develops according to Dicotyledonous-type and comprises epidermis, endothecium without typical fibrous thickenings, an ephemeral middle layer and glandular tapetum that differentiates in false periplasmodium; three-celled mature pollen; anatropous, tenuinucellate, unitegmic ovule, one-cellular (sporadically two or three-cellular) archesporium; Polygonum (monosporic)-type development of the embryo sac; Asterad-type embryogenesis. The established high amount of viable pollen, relatively high percent of viable seeds (up to 50%), as well as almost correctly running processes in the male and female generative sphere ensure the successful reproduction and seed production of the two studied invasive species.

SP Soc Conservat Biol
AB Community-based conservation (CBC) is based on the idea that if conservation and development could be simultaneously achieved, then the interests of both could be served. It has been controversial because community development objectives are not necessarily consistent with conservation objectives in a given case. I examined CBC from two angles. First, CBC can be seen in the context of paradigm shifts in ecology and applied ecology. I identified three conceptual shifts-toward a systems view, toward the inclusion of humans in the ecosystem, and toward participatory approaches to ecosystem management-that are interrelated and pertain to an understanding of ecosystems as complex adaptive systems in which humans are an integral part. Second, I investigated the feasibility of CBC, as informed by a number of emerging interdisciplinary fields that have been pursuing various aspects of coupled systems of humans and nature. These fields-common property, traditional ecological knowledge, environmental ethics, political ecology, and environmental history-provide insights for CBC. They may contribute to the development of an interdisciplinary conservation science with a more sophisticated understanding of social-ecological interactions. The lessons from these fields include the importance of cross-scale conservation, adaptive comanagement, the question of incentives and multiple stakeholders, the use of traditional ecological knowledge, and development of a cross-cultural conservation ethic.

TI Economic costs of biological invasions in the United States
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB The United States has thousands of invasive species, representing a sizable, but unknown burden to the national economy. Given the potential economic repercussions of invasive species, quantifying these costs is of para -mount importance both for national economies and invasion management. Here, we used a novel global data-base of invasion costs (InvaCost) to quantify the overall costs of invasive species in the United States across spatiotemporal, taxonomic, and socioeconomic scales. From 1960 to 2020, reported invasion costs totaled $4.52 trillion (USD 2017). Considering only observed, highly reliable costs, this total cost reached $1.22 trillion with an average annual cost of $19.94 billion/year. These costs increased from $2.00 billion annually between 1960 and 1969 to $21.08 billion annually between 2010 and 2020. Most costs (73%) were related to resource damages and losses ($896.22 billion), as opposed to management expenditures ($46.54 billion). Moreover, the majority of costs were reported from invaders from terrestrial habitats ($643.51 billion, 53%) and agriculture was the most impacted sector ($509.55 billion). From a taxonomic perspective, mammals ($234.71 billion) and insects ($126.42 billion) were the taxonomic groups responsible for the greatest costs. Considering the apparent rising costs of invasions, coupled with increasing numbers of invasive species and the current lack of cost information for most known invaders, our findings provide critical information for policymakers and managers.

TI Modeling agricultural water-saving compensation policy: An ABM approach
   and application
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB With the increasing conflict between water availability and demand on a global scale, regulating water user behavior from the bottom-up perspective has gained attention from both water managers and researchers. This paper presents an agent-based model (ABM) to simulate the farmer behavior under changing physical and institutional environments in a case study of Miyun Reservoir watershed, China. The ABM model simulates the complex adaptive systems of agricultural water users under an agricultural water-saving compensation policy. The model we developed in this study characterizes agents' sensitivity, learning capability, and information radius, which impacts agricultural income and water consumption of a household. By applying this model to a local 'paddy to dryland' subsidy policy program aiming at reshaping the agricultural water-saving behavior, the results show that this policy program reduces agricultural water consumption while also reducing household agricultural income. The policy depends on administrative intervention and financial subsidies at first to ensure compliance and gradually shape household behavior in the long run. And we also propose a suitable subsidy range of 250-350 yuan for this policy program in the long run. The model we built can help to understand agricultural water use adaptation to both anthropogenic and environmental interventions. This research also contributes to the coupled natural and human systems study with the bottom-up agent-based model, and the empirical case study provides solid policy implications for the agricultural water use allocation and adaptative management at the watershed scale.

TI Laevicaulis haroldi (Veronicellidae: Gastropoda), a potential future
   invader to India
SO CURRENT SCIENCE
AB Invasive alien species are considered one of the greatest threats to biodiversity, ecosystem services, economy and human health. Global climate change will only exacerbate the impact of several invasive species in the introduced range. Hence the control and management of invasive species is crucial. Spatial tools such as GIS/RS and ecological niche models can help understand the potential region where the species might invade and predict invasive spread under different climate change scenarios. This study explores if the newly introduced slug from South Africa, Laeviedulis haroldi (Purcell's hunter slug or caterpillar slug) will become invasive in India under current as well as future climate scenarios. Our result suggests that most parts of western and Peninsular India are vulnerable to the invasion, and suitable regions will only increase under both climate change scenarios. It calls for the early detection and management of this potential invader to India.

TI Community currency (CCs) in Spain: An empirical study of their social

SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB Despite its sudden proliferation along the economic crisis period, no previous study has investigated the social effects of the community currency (CCs) experiences in Spain. Previous research on CCs experiences from different countries provided evidences about social capital improvement, introducing CCs as sustainability tools. This research uses the theoretical frameworks of social capital and complex adaptive systems to approach concepts like sustainability, networks, trust, norms, participation and cooperation. Statistical analysis of the data collected in June 2013 through online survey explores social capital and resilience indicators among the Spanish exchange community users, conduding that Spanish CCs systems improve community social capital through the proposed dimensions, although they are in an early stage and several weakness need to be corrected. The values, motivations, attitude and positive perception of their members suggest that CCs could be appropriate tools for sustainability due its potential to improve social capital and resilience. Detected weakness may affect the interests and commitment of their members. Therefore experience from senior currency systems may help them to face adversities and fully develop their potential for sustainability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Co-Creation Approach with Action-Oriented Research Methods to Strengthen
   "Krachtvoer"; A School-Based Programme to Enhance Healthy Nutrition in
   Adolescents
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB In recent years, the nutritional pattern of the Dutch adolescent has cautiously improved. However, progress can be gained if more Dutch adolescents adhere to the nutritional guidelines. School-based initiatives offer opportunities to deal with the unhealthy eating behaviours of adolescents via nutrition educational interventions. In designing and/or re-designing school-based interventions, it is important to enhance optimal context-oriented implementation adaptation by involving the complex adaptive school system. This paper elaborates on the way of dealing with the dynamic implementation context of the educational programme "Krachtvoer" (ENG: "Power food") for prevocational schools, how the programme can be adapted to each unique implementation context, and how the programme can be progressively kept up to date. Following a co-creation-guided approach with various intersectoral stakeholders within and outside the school setting, action-oriented mixed research methods (i.e., observations, semi-structured interviews, focus group interviews, programme usage monitoring, and questionnaires) constantly provide input to develop the programme and its implementation strategy via continuous micro-process cycles. Successful co-creation of school-based health promotion seems to be dependent on proper intersectoral cooperation between research and practice communities, a national partner network that can provide project-relevant insights and establish capacity building aimed at improving contextual fit, and a time-investment balance in and between sectors.

TI Process network modularity, commonality, and greenhouse gas emissions
SO JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT
AB A process network is a complex system of linked unit processes that constitute the life cycle of a product. In this article, we consider how the structural and functional characteristics of a product's process network impact the network's collective greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. At a unit process level, GHG emissions are primarily related to process efficiency. We hypothesize that a process network's GHG emissions will be less when the process network has a modular structure and when its constituent unit processes are more functionally similar. A modular process network architecture promotes autonomous innovation and improvements in knowledge management and problem-solving capabilities, leading to more efficient processes. Functional commonality in a process network enables economies of scale and knowledge spillover and also leads to process efficiencies, thus reducing GHG emissions. We test these two hypotheses using a sample of 4,189 process networks extracted from an environmental life cycle inventory database. Empirical results support our hypotheses, and we discuss the implications of our findings for product development and supply network design.

Empirical research of this issue is scarce given the complexity of addressing management issues. Systems analysis and participatory modeling were applied in this study to construct a conceptualization of a management system in the context of Australian governmental programs. This allowed examination of the structure, key elements and dynamics in order to address two research questions: a) which management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery planning? and b) what modifications could be made to improve recovery planning effectiveness? The methods employed comprised stakeholder interviews, expert workshops and qualitative and quantitative analyses to estimate management performance and effectiveness. The management system model was constructed using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential factors: a) coordination among federal, state and territory agencies, b) inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, c) management of threatened species on private land, d) incorporation of science into recovery planning, e) prioritization schemes of conservation action and f) funding for plan implementation. Recovery planning effectiveness could be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports, creating a national forum on threatened species, designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers and establishing a national management information system.

TI Towards a theory of multi-tier sustainable supply chains: a systematic
   literature review
SO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a comprehensive framework that synthesizes approaches and contingency variables to manage the sustainability of multi-tier supply chains and sub-suppliers.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using a systematic literature review, the authors analyse 39 studies and relevant theories to develop a comprehensive framework that integrates research efforts so far.
   Findings - The authors build a conceptual framework that incorporates four approaches to manage the sustainability of multi-tier supply chains. They also identify several contingency variables (e. g. power, dependency, distance, industry, knowledge resources) and their effect on the proposed approaches.
   Research limitations/implications - Based on the framework, six research propositions that advance the theories on multi-tier supply chain management, allow lead firms to develop comprehensive sustainable supply chain strategies and set the ground for future research in the area were developed.
   Originality/value - This study provides a novel framework for studying sustainability in multi-tier supply chains that goes beyond the single-tier perspective and incorporates the extended supply chain.

SO FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST
AB An annotated list of the aquatic invertebrates inhabiting water impounded in the leaf axils of Florida's native epiphytic bromeliads is provided. Of the 22 species reported, 9 are yet undescribed. Of the 13 described species, 10 are believed to be native. Five of the native species and perhaps all of the undesciibed species are precinctive ("endemic"). These invertebrate animals and their bromeliad host plants are at risk of extinction due to destruction of the host plants by Metamasius callizona (Chevrolat) (Coleoptera: Dryophthoridae), an invasive weevil.

TI Biological invasions and deletions: community change in south Florida
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB This study used the endangered and exotic fauna of south Florida, USA, to test three non-exclusive hypotheses about community change. Over one third of the vertebrate fauna of south Florida is either endangered or exotic. We assumed that in the future, many of the currently endangered species will become extinct, while established exotics become more widespread and abundant. Using species' distributions, body mass data, and niche classifications, we compare the past (without exotics) and our predicted future (with exotics, without endangered species) vertebrate communities to determine if the future fauna would be on average smaller, more generalized feeders, or if there would be direct niche replacement. The results of the comparisons indicate that none of the hypotheses explained all of the expected changes in the vertebrate fauna of south Florida, and that the future vertebrate fauna of south Florida is likely to be very different from that of the recent past. These changes are symptomatic of the profound ecosystem-level changes occurring here. Hypotheses generated by systemic-level investigations are more likely to increase our understanding of invasions and extinctions. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Quantifying the direct network effect for online platforms supporting
   industrial symbiosis: an agent-based simulation study
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB This paper explores the direct network effect for online platforms supporting industrial symbiosis (IS), which is a recommended strategy to support the transition towards the circular economy. Through IS, companies can use wastes produced by other companies as inputs to production processes. Online platforms supporting companies in operating IS relationships can play a critical role in developing the IS practice.
   In this paper, an agent-based model is designed to simulate the emergence of IS relationships among companies located in a given geographical area. Companies can establish relationships traditionally (relying on faceto-face contacts) or by using a platform. Several scenarios, defined by different platform usage rates, are simulated. Results show that there is a minimum platform usage rate allowing companies to benefit from using the platform. If the platform usage rate is lower than this threshold, the platform does not contribute to generate further benefits for companies. When the platform usage rate is higher than the threshold, the individual benefits for users are higher the greater the number of other companies using the platform. Based on these results, implications on how to ensure a win-win approach for companies and platform owners can be provided, as well as implications for policymakers.

TI The Crossovers and Connectivity between Systems Engineering and the
   Sustainable Development Goals: A Scoping Study
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The United Nation's sustainable development goals (SDGs) are interconnected and indivisible and need to be addressed in a systematic and holistic way. However, a lack of stakeholder perspective, fragmented responses, and a dearth of integration across sectors have long been perceived as the SDGs' main pitfalls. In recent years, scholars are calling to address these issues by adopting a systems engineering perspective, as this approach espouses a stakeholder-focused position, embraces a holistic and dynamic mindset, and provides a variety of technical and managerial toolkits, which can help to untangle the complexity and interactions inherent in global sustainability. Nevertheless, little has been done to map the existing literature, comprehensively review, and synthesize research evidence in this field. Therefore, this paper aims to conduct a scoping study that analyzes the extant evidence to uncover the contributions of systems engineering in advancing the SDGs. A three-phase methodology integrating natural language processing and systematic literature review is used to investigate this space. We conclude that systems engineering has been an active catalyst promoting the SDGs, and that systems engineering has the potential to support more transdisciplinary research to achieve long-term transformational and sustainable change across sectors and disciplines.

TI All that changes is not shift: methodological choices influence niche
   shift detection in freshwater invasive species
SO ECOGRAPHY
AB Species distribution models are often used to predict the potential distributions of invasive species outside their native ranges and rely on the assumption of realized niche conservatism. Analyses observed that freshwater invasive species often show high degrees of niche expansion, suggesting limited reliability of species distribution models. However, observed niche shifts can arise because of both actual niche shifts, determined by biological factors, and apparent shifts, due to methodological issues. We compared metrics of niche dynamics calculated using different sets of variables to identify factors that could influence the rate of niche shifts. We collected presence-only data for 40 freshwater invasive animal species, then measured niche shift dynamics using 14 different combinations of environmental variables. Shifts were assessed measuring niche overlap, expansion and unfilling, and testing for niche conservatism. We then built generalized linear mixed models relating niche shifts to methodological choices and biological features. Our results showed that methodological choices strongly affected all the considered niche dynamics metrics, while the effects of biological features were less prominent. Moreover, different niche dynamic measures sometimes provided contradictory assessments of niche conservatism. Niche analyses are powerful tools to predict areas at risk of invasion, but inappropriate methodological choices can lead to apparent niche shifts, questioning niche model reliability and biological interpretation. The high rate of niche expansion observed in freshwater invasive species highlights the importance of delineating objective criteria to determine the set of variables to be used in niche dynamic assessments.

TI Ecological complexity and the biosphere: the next 30 years
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Global warming, habitat loss and overexploitation of limited resources are leading to alarming biodiversity declines. Ecosystems are complex adaptive systems that display multiple alternative states and can shift from one to another in abrupt ways. Some of these tipping points have been identified and predicted by mathematical and computational models. Moreover, multiple scales are involved and potential mitigation or intervention scenarios are tied to particular levels of complexity, from cells to human-environment coupled systems. In dealing with a biosphere where humans are part of a complex, endangered ecological network, novel theoretical and engineering approaches need to be considered. At the centre of most research efforts is biodiversity, which is essential to maintain community resilience and ecosystem services. What can be done to mitigate, counterbalance or prevent tipping points? Using a 30-year window, we explore recent approaches to sense, preserve and restore ecosystem resilience as well as a number of proposed interventions (from afforestation to bioengineering) directed to mitigate or reverse ecosystem collapse. The year 2050 is taken as a representative future horizon that combines a time scale where deep ecological changes will occur and proposed solutions might be effective.This article is part of the theme issue 'Ecological complexity and the biosphere: the next 30 years'.

TI LICENSED TO KILL: A DEFENSE OF VICARIOUS LIABILITY UNDER THE ENDANGERED
   SPECIES ACT
SO DUKE LAW JOURNAL
AB The Endangered Species Act (ESA) makes it illegal to "take" an endangered and threatened species by killing, harming, or harassing the animal. Although the classic example of a take is an individual poacher shooting an endangered species, these protected species are also harmed by larger-scale policies and programs. In several court cases, local and state governments have been held vicariously liable for the take of endangered species when their policies or actions caused third parties to commit a take.
   The vicarious liability theory, as applied to the ESA, is controversial and has been criticized by numerous scholars. This Note argues that a limited version of the vicarious liability theory is consistent with the text of the ESA and plays an essential role in fulfilling the promise of the ESA's take prohibition. As a case study, this Note examines how the vicarious liability theory could be used to hold the state of Louisiana liable for licensing shrimping gear that causes the take of endangered and threatened sea turtles. As illustrated by the Louisiana example, the acceptance of a narrowly construed vicarious liability theory would protect endangered species without placing an unreasonable or unconstitutional burden on state and local governments.

Among crustaceans, the bacteria have been mainly found in isopods, but its complete range of hosts is still unknown. We investigated the presence of Wolbachia in 10 species of Aegla Leach, 1820, a freshwater anomuran endemic to southern South America. We found no evidence for the presence of the bacteria, ensuring the reliability of studies employing mitochondrial DNA as molecular markers in aeglids.

TI Regenerative-The New Sustainable?
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Over time, sustainability paradigms have evolved from meeting human needs throughout time to improving human wellbeing and the viability of ecological systems. Regenerative sustainability (RS), the next wave of sustainability, includes and transcends these goals, aiming for thriving living systems in which whole-system health and wellbeing increase continually. A key difference between sustainability paradigms is the thinking underlying them, with regenerative sustainability based on a holistic worldview and paradigm, integrating recent understandings from science and practice, different ways of knowing, and inner and outer dimensions of sustainability necessary for systemic transformation. RS, practiced through regenerative development and design for over 50 years, aligns human consciousness and actions with living systems principles. When this alignment occurs, sustainable development goals are elevated to become regenerative development goals, with living systems principles and characteristics guiding the development of regenerative indicators and strategies made specific to a place through transformational co-creative processes. We should aim for regenerative sustainability because it offers holistic approaches based on how thriving living systems function, addresses the root causes of (un)sustainability, and is inherently more inspiring and motivational. Advancing regenerative sustainability will require fundamental shifts supported by more awareness and education, theoretical and practical development, leadership, empowering communities, and integrating spirituality.

TI Performance Based Planning of complex urban social-ecological systems:
   The quest for sustainability through the promotion of resilience
SO SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB Urban systems and human settlements have been growing exponentially in size and complexity in the last decades, defying current approaches to sustainable development. While urban planning has been identified as one of the main tools for attaining specific sustainability goals, consideration of cities as complex social-ecological and adaptive systems challenges traditional views, demanding new flexible and creative planning solutions. In this conceptual study, we analyse the capacity of performance-based planning (PBP) to provide sustainable solutions for urban planning problems. To do so, we examine the different conceptualizations of PBP in the current planning environment. To better define the challenges posed by the complexity of urban systems, we explore the similarities and common ground between PBP and other approaches such as adaptive planning and management (APM) and problem structuring methods (PSM). We analyse a case study, in Queensland (Australia), using SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis to identify potential advantages and barriers to the implementation of PBP. Finally, we discuss the potential role of APM and PSM in PBP, the utility of an extended conceptualization of resilience as an important reference for its implementation and a potentially stronger role for planners in PBP as decision shapers.

TI Health systems resilience in fragile and shock-prone settings through
   the prism of gender equity and justice: implications for research,
   policy and practice
SO CONFLICT AND HEALTH
AB Fragile and shock-prone settings (FASP) present a critical development challenge, eroding efforts to build healthy, sustainable and equitable societies. Power relations and inequities experienced by people because of social markers, e.g., gender, age, education, ethnicity, and race, intersect leading to poverty and associated health challenges. Concurrent to the growing body of literature exploring the impact of these intersecting axes of inequity in FASP settings, there is a need to identify actions promoting gender, equity, and justice (GEJ). Gender norms that emphasise toxic masculinity, patriarchy, societal control over women and lack of justice are unfortunately common throughout the world and are exacerbated in FASP settings. It is critical that health policies in FASP settings consider GEJ and include strategies that promote progressive changes in power relationships. ReBUILD for Resilience (ReBUILD) focuses on health systems resilience in FASP settings and is underpinned by a conceptual framework that is grounded in a broader view of health systems as complex adaptive systems. The framework identifies links between different capacities and enables identification of feedback loops which can drive or inhibit the emergence and implementation of resilient approaches. We applied the framework to four different country case studies (Lebanon, Myanmar, Nepal and Sierra Leone) to illustrate how it can be inclusive of GEJ concerns, to inform future research and support context responsive recommendations to build equitable and inclusive health systems in FASP settings.

TI An Analytical Framework for Formulating Conservation and Development
   Measures for Important Agricultural Heritage Systems
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (IAHS) are complex adaptive systems that are multidimensional and exhibit strategic values of sustainability. In the context of modernization, IAHS have been increasingly challenged. Thus, the heritage sites must explore dynamic conservation approaches and formulate adaptive management strategies. However, few studies have provided either theoretical methods or practical cases as support. In this study, we put forward an analytical framework for IAHS conservation and development measure formulation based on the Driver -Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model and applied it to the Shexian Dryland Stone Terraced System (SDSTS). With this framework, we analyzed the supportive mechanisms for the stable state of the SDSTS, diagnosed the threats and challenges it faces, and then formulated 34 conservation and development measures from six aspects, namely management mechanism construction, ecological conservation, cultural inheritance, green and organic product development, sustainable tourism development, and capacity building. It is demonstrated that the DPSIR-based analytical framework can provide both theoretical and technical support for the formulation of IAHS conservation and development measures, thus having the potential to become a general tool for the dynamic conservation and sustainable development of IAHS.

SO ORGANIZING FOR SUSTAINABLE HEALTH CARE
SE Organizing for Sustainable Effectiveness
AB Purpose - This chapter provides a reflective synopsis of the chapters in the volume and highlights the learning from the cases about the development of new orientations, design configurations, and learning mechanisms. It charts directions for further research and possible managerial actions.
   Design - The chapters in this second volume of the book series "Organizing for Sustainable Effectiveness" capture a rich set of cases in which organizing for sustainable health care was the central focus. Each chapter illuminated the development of a distinct health care system in a unique cultural and national context, and had a special focus on reporting theoretically informed and rigorously explored knowledge to guide purposeful design and learning approaches. Collectively the chapters highlighted the processes, organization and design, system regulation, and continuous learning approaches in complex organizational and multi-organizational health care systems that enable focus on and advancement of economic, social, and ecological outcomes.
   Findings - Several critical themes have emerged from the cases, and from the broader literature on health care transformation: the importance of purpose; the need to overcome fragmentation; the need for alternative business models; technology as an investment in sustainable health care; the centrality of knowledge management; the importance of partnership and collaboration; the role of self-organization and leadership; and the criticality of building change capabilities.

TI Mapping social-ecological systems to understand the challenges
   underlying wildlife management
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB A holistic understanding of the complex interactions between humans, wildlife, and habitats is essential for the design of sustainable wildlife policies. This challenging task requires innovative and interdisciplinary research approaches. Using the newly implemented ecosystem-based management of moose (Alces alces) in Sweden as a case, we applied Ostrom's social-ecological system (SES) framework to analyse the challenges that wildlife management faces throughout the country. We combined data derived from natural and social science research to operationalize the framework in a quantitative way; an approach that enabled a spatially explicit analysis on the national and regional levels. This study aimed to discover patterns In the social-ecological context of Swedish moose management. Identifying these patterns can provide input for an in-depth evaluation of the institutional fit of the current system and subsequently for national policy development. Our SES maps suggest that there are spatial variations in factors challenging moose management. In some areas, ecological aspects such as the co-occurrence of carnivores and other ungulate species burdens future management, while in other regions challenges are shaped by governance aspects, e.g. diverse property rights. These findings demonstrate that the new management system must apply adaptive learning principles to respond to local context attributes in order to be successful. Our innovative approach provides a valuable tool for the assessment of other natural resource management issues and the avoidance of panacea traps, especially when repeated over time.

TI Biases in conservation: A regional analysis of Spanish vertebrates
SO JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
AB Apart from being the main cause of biodiversity loss, humans are also essential for sustainability and biological conservation. Regulations for the conservation of threatened species are key to respond to this challenge. Here we evaluate the efficacy of mandatory regulations in Spain, a decentralized country, for the effective protection of threatened terrestrial vertebrates. We studied the association between the number of both "vulnerable" and "endangered" species on regional lists of threatened species and approved management plans for such species (mandatory) with ecological (e.g. percentage of forest and agricultural areas), social (e.g. environmental awareness and GPD per capita) and geographical (e.g. total and protected areas) variables on the regional scale. Our results showed that an approved management plan is available for only 20% of threatened terrestrial vertebrates and there were important taxonomical and regional biases. Higher protection levels appeared in regions with higher percentages of protected area, more citizens' environmental awareness, lower GPD per capita and shorter regional lists. Herpetofauna has fewer approved management plans than mammals or birds. Our results highlight the importance of integrating the perspective, knowledge and practices of all stakeholders (Academia, governments and society) to effectively apply environmental regulations.

TI Modeling experiential learning: The challenges posed by threshold
   dynamics for sustainable renewable resource management
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB Adaptive management incorporates learning-by-doing (LBD) in order to capture learning and knowledge generation processes, crucial for sustainable resource use in the presence of uncertainty and environmental change. By contrast, an optimization approach to management identifies the most efficient exploitation strategy by postulating an absolute understanding of the resource dynamics and its inherent uncertainties. Here, we study the potential and limitations of LBD in achieving optimal management by undertaking an analysis using a simple growth model as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of an agent equipped with a 'state-of-the-art' learning algorithm. The agent possesses no a priori knowledge about the resource dynamics, and learns management solely by resource interaction. We show that for a logistic growth function the agent can achieve 90% efficiency compared to the optimal control solution, whereas when a threshold (tipping point) is introduced, efficiency drops to 65%. Thus, our study supports the effectiveness of the LED approach. However, when a threshold is introduced efficiency decreases as experimentation may cause resource collapse. Further, the study proposes that: an appropriate amount of experimentation, high valuation of future stocks (discounting) and, a modest rate of adapting to new knowledge, will likely enhance the effectiveness of LBD as a management strategy.

TI Five potential consequences of climate change for invasive species
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB Scientific and societal unknowns make it difficult to predict bow global environmental changes such as climate change and biological invasions will affect ecological systems. In the long term, these changes may have interacting effects and compound the uncertainty associated with each individual driver. Nonetheless, invasive species are likely to respond in ways that should be qualitatively predictable, and some of these responses will be distinct from those of native counterparts. We used the stages of invasion known as the "invasion pathway" to identify 5 nonexclusive consequences of climate change for invasive species: (1) altered transport and introduction mechanisms, (2) establishment of new invasive species, (3) altered impact of existing invasive species, (4) altered distribution of existing invasive species, and (5) altered effectiveness of control strategies. We then used these consequences to identify testable hypotheses about the responses of invasive species to climate change and provide suggestions for invasive-species management plans. The 5 consequences also emphasize the need for enhanced environmental monitoring and expanded coordination among entities involved in invasive-species management

TI Macroscopic-microscopic coupled water-energy nexus simulation and
   behavior optimization under uncertainty
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB Investigating the nexus of water and energy is important for understanding their complex interrelationships and promoting sustainable development. This study used a complex adaptive system model to explore the interaction mechanism of the water-energy nexus at the regional scale and generate behavior-optimization schemes for industries and individuals under uncertainty. This model was integrated with a system dynamics model and an agent-based model, as well as a fuzzy optimization approach that considered uncertainty in agents' behavior. A novel index of the water-energy nexus was constructed to express its characteristics. This framework was applied to Tianjin, China, to evaluate water-energy outputs considering the interaction between micro-and macrolevel systems. The results revealed the following: 1) Water and energy consumption showed a slowly increasing trend, whereby energy and water consumption will reach, respectively, 29.66 x 10(8) m(3) and 101.80 x 10(6) tons of coal equivalent (tce) by 2030. 2) A low degree of satisfaction among agents will lead to larger amounts of water-related energy and energy-related water from household use and efficiency investment by enterprise. A high degree of satisfaction is key to achieving high energy-related water-consumption intensity in the early stage; that dominance will turn into a low degree of satisfaction in the late stage. 3) Aggressive behavior and willingness among agents will have a greater effect on the water-energy nexus in the early stage. Conservative behavior, meanwhile, will have considerable potential to control the development of the water-energy nexus in the future.

TI Exploring Water Landscape Adaptability of Urban Spatial Development Base
   on Coupling Coordination Degree Model A Case of Caidian District, Wuhan
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Under the background of rapid urbanization, the study explored the adaptive relationship between urban spatial development and water landscape in different stages in Caidian District, Wuhan in order to reveal the characteristics and influencing factors of water landscape adaptability of urban spatial development and improve urban sustainability aiming at optimizing spatial development and improving water landscape function. Caidian District was seen as a complex adaptive system formed by the interaction between the base layer and the occupation layer. The assessment system of urban spatial development is constructed based on land use data and landscape pattern indices, and the coupling coordination degree model and correlation analysis were used to describe the characteristics of water landscape adaptability of urban spatial development. The results showed that: (1) the adaptation relationship between urban space and water landscape in Caidian District was becoming tense; (2) different spatial systems have unique adaptation cycles to water landscape; (3) the 1000 m buffer is the main area affected by water landscape adaptability of urban spatial development. This study provides a new perspective for the urban adaptability. Finally, improvement suggestions were put forward by three aspects of water landscape structure control, urban development control, and ecological space demarcation.

TI Building up resilience in cities worldwide - Rotterdam as participant in
   the 100 Resilient Cities Programme
SO CITIES
AB Cities worldwide are challenged by a high complexity of acute and chronic problems, including challenges related to economic development, social polarisation and segregation as well as climate change and ecological degradation. While all of these problems are complex in themselves, they are also interrelated. Addressing them in a meaningful way requires governance systems with systemic capacities to deal with complexity. In order to create resilience in urban systems, cities need to be able to learn, adapt and transform across sectors and levels. One definition of urban resilience is the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses, and systems within a city to survive, adapt, and grow regardless of the kinds of chronic stress and acute shocks they experience. This is the definition the Rockefeller Foundation adopts in its mission to promote the well-being of humanity throughout the world by facilitating the building of resilience in cities worldwide through its 100 Resilient Cities Programme, launched in 2013. Rotterdam is one of the first cities to participate in this programme. The city has been a front-runner in preparing for climate change and striving for urban sustainability. This paper assesses the concept of urban resilience, introduces the Rockefeller Foundation's effort in building city resilience worldwide and illustrates this with the Rotterdam case.

TI Putting relational thinking to work in sustainability science - reply to
   Raymond et al.
SO ECOSYSTEMS AND PEOPLE
AB We welcome Raymond et al.'s invitation to further discuss the 'pragmatics' of relational thinking in sustainability science. We clarify that relational approaches provide distinct theoretical and methodological resources that may be adopted on their own, or used to enrich other approaches, including systems research. We situate Raymond et al.'s characterization of relational thinking in a broader landscape of differing approaches to mobilizing 'relationality' in sustainability science. A key contribution of relational thinking in the process-relational, pragmatist and post-structural traditions is the focus on the generation and use of concepts. This focus is proving methodologically useful for sustainability scientists. We caution against viewing the generation of concepts purely in terms of 'applying the knife' to 'divide components.' Relational thinking offers alternatives more congruent with complexity: away from an 'external' actor cutting away at the world with an 'either/or' logic, towards an 'immersed' actor contributing generatively within it using a 'both/and not only' logic. The pragmatics of relational thinking will vary according to purposes. We describe two possible pathways for using relational thinking in research practice - (i) working forwards from relations, and (ii) working backwards from existing concepts - and discuss how relational thinking can contribute to complexity-oriented visions of 'solutions-oriented sustainability science.'

TI Analysis of Rooftop Photovoltaics Diffusion in Energy Community
   Buildings by a Novel GIS- and Agent-Based Modeling Co-Simulation
   Platform
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The present work introduces an empirically ground agent-based modeling (ABM) framework to assess the spatial and temporal diffusion of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems on existing buildings of a city district. The overall ABM framework takes into account social, technical, environmental, and economic aspects to evaluate the diffusion of PV technology in the urban context. A city district that includes 18 720 households distributed over 1 290 building blocks and a surface area of 2.47 km2 is used to test the proposed ABM framework. Results show how the underlying regulatory framework (i.e., the rules of the internal electricity market) influences the pattern and intensity of adoption, thus realizing different shares of the available potential. Policies that support the establishment of 'prosumers' within Condominiums (i.e., energy community buildings), and not in single-family houses only, is key to yield high diffusion rates. The installed capacity increases by 80% by switching from the one-to-one configuration to the one-to-many paradigm, i.e., from 5.90 MW of rooftop PV installed on single-family households and/or single PV owners to 10.64 MW in energy community buildings. Moreover, the possibility to spread the auto-generated solar electricity over the load profile of the entire population of Condominium results in self-consumption rates greater than 50% and self-sufficiency ratios above 20% for the majority of the simulated buildings.

TI Population projection models for 14 alien plant species in the presence
   and absence of aboveground competition
SO ECOLOGY
AB Plant population ecologists strive to understand how environmental drivers influence demographic vital rates and thus population dynamics. Hundreds of studies have collected demographic data and used matrix and/or integral projection models to quantify lifetime fitness and population dynamics of plants. However, most of these studies have focused on native plant species, and there is a need for more studies on alien plants. Further, few studies on alien plants have experimentally manipulated environmental drivers in order to understand the mechanisms that allow alien plant species to have positive population growth. A synthetic understanding of the population dynamics of alien plant species will only be achieved if ecologists collect demographic data on many plant species and environments and provide the demographic data and model structure in a data archive for future comparisons and meta-analyses. Invasive alien species are a social, economic, and ecological issue that has become increasingly important in an increasingly globalized world. Researchers continue to forecast impacts and prevent new introductions by seeking a robust understanding of drivers of invasive species success and failure. Researchers have hypothesized that competitive differences may play a key role in determining alien species success in novel environments. Studies that experimentally manipulate competitors while quantifying demography provide mechanistic insight into species' responses to competition. To date, nearly all field manipulations of competition that measure plant demography and population dynamics have focused on native plant species. The data we provide here aim to address this gap in our knowledge for alien plant species. We present raw data and population-projection models for 14 alien plant species in eastern Missouri, USA. We sampled under ambient conditions and with all individuals of nonfocal species removed from the community, allowing us to project population dynamics in the presence and absence of competition. We have also included the data quantifying how much biomass we removed at the plot level during each removal procedure and data from our germination experiment.

TI Exploring sustainable primary care responses to intimate partner
   violence in New Zealand: Qualitative use of complexity theory
SO BMJ OPEN
AB Objective To explore what affects sustainable responses to intimate partner violence within New Zealand primary care settings using complexity theory.
   Design Primary care professional interviews on intimate partner violence as a health issue are analysed using a complexity theory-led qualitative research methodology grounded in poststructuralism.
   Setting Four general practices in one region of the North Island of New Zealand, two serving a general patient population and two adopting an indigenous approach.
   Participants Seventeen primary care professionals and management from the four recruited general practices.
   Results The complex adaptive system approach the 'Triple R Pathway', calls attention to system interactions influencing intimate partner violence responsiveness across health system levels. Four exemplars demonstrate the use of the Triple R Pathway. Two key system areas challenge the emergence of primary care responsiveness: (1) Non-recognition of intimate partner violence as a key determinant of ill-health. (2) Uncertainty and doubt.
   Conclusions The relationship between intimate partner violence and ill-health is not well recognised, or understood in New Zealand, at both policy and practice levels. Inadequate recognition of socioecological determinants of intimate partner violence leads to a simple health system response which constrains primary care professional responsiveness. Constant intervention in system interactions is needed to promote the emergence of sustainable responses to intimate partner violence.

TI Dominated Taxonomic and Phylogenetic Turnover but Functional Nestedness
   of Wetland Bird Beta Diversity in North China
SO LAND
AB The decomposition of taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional beta diversity into their turnover and nestedness components could provide novel insights into biodiversity conservation, e.g., provide implications for the Single Large Or Several Small reserves debate (SLOSS debate). Due to dramatic climate change and massive anthropogenic activities in recent decades in North China, the wetlands and the associated biodiversity in this region have declined significantly. This study applied the taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional beta diversity decomposition for the first time in wetland bird communities in North China, aiming to propose scientific and comprehensive suggestions for bird diversity conservation in this region. A paired t-test was used to compare the differences between taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional turnover, and their nestedness components. In addition, a spearman correlation analysis was used to assess the associations between each explanatory variable (differences in mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation, as well as spatial distances) and each beta diversity index. A total of 546 bird species were found in 38 wetlands in North China, with three critically endangered species, 19 endangered species, 22 vulnerable species, and 61 near threatened species. The number of threatened species (critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable) found in these lakes was about 30% of all threatened species in China. The results showed that taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity among wetland bird communities in North China was mainly dominated by turnover, while functional beta diversity was mainly dominated by nestedness. Importantly, the phylogenetic and functional results showed similar patterns even after controlling for the effects of taxonomic beta diversity. In addition, the taxonomic and phylogenetic turnover was more associated with both climate variables and spatial distances than other components. The contrasting patterns among the taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional decompositions of wetland bird communities in North China indicate that distinctive conservation strategies should be considered for different biodiversity dimensions. Specifically, the conservation of taxonomic and phylogenetic bird diversity in this region should focus on multiple wetlands, while the conservation of bird functional diversity should focus on a single wetland with high functional diversity.

SO PHYTOTAXA
AB Turraea dargentiana (Meliaceae), a new endemic species from Mauritius, is described, its ecology and conservation are discussed, and a revised key to the Mascarenes species of Turraea is provided. Turraea dargentiana is the smallest and the only species of the genus known to display cryptic dioecy in the Mascarenes, and also the only one possessing adult leaves that are often irregularly lobed in their distal half. The species appears restricted to the understory of relatively well-preserved native vegetation remnants in a few wet mountain tops and ridges. Given this restricted distribution, a small total population size and the encroachment of invasive alien plants, which are causing continued degradation of the species' habitat, the species should be considered as Critically Threatened according to the Red List Categories and Criteria of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

SO PHYTOTAXA
AB Eugenia alletiana, a new endemic species from Mauritius, is described and its ecology and conservation is discussed. The morphological diagnostic features for Eugenia alletiana are chartaceous, discoloured leaves, very thin terminal branchlets, flowers solitary or in fascicles of 2-3 flowers, totally fused hypanthium without apical pore or calyptra, that encloses the numerous stamens (>500) and petals before anthesis; seed enclosed in a woody endocarp with a lamellated outer surface. The species should be considered as Critically Endangered (CR) according to the Red List Criteria of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. This assessment is based on the plant's restricted distribution, very small population size, a habitat sustaining degradation by invasive alien plants and animals and predation of immature fruits and seeds by invasive alien monkeys and rats respectively leading to a weak regeneration.

TI The effect of listing the lesser prairie chicken as a threatened species
   on rural property values
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB This paper estimates the effect of Endangered Species Act protections for the lesser prairie chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) on rural property values in Oklahoma. The political and legal controversy surrounding the listing of imperiled species raises questions about the development restrictions and opportunity costs the Endangered Species Act imposes on private landowners. Examining parcel-level sales data before and after the listing of the endemic lesser prairie chicken, we employ difference-indifferences (DD) regression to measure the welfare costs of these restrictions. While our basic DD regression provides evidence the listing was associated with a drop in property values, this finding does not hold up in models that control for latent county and year effects. The lack of a significant price effect is confirmed by several robustness checks. Thus, the local economic costs of listing the lesser prairie chicken under the Endangered Species Act appear to have been small. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Invasive Alien Species in Belgian marine waters: an information platform
   and checklist for science and policy support
SO MANAGEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB Since 2006, the 'VLIZ Alien Species Consortium' has collected data and information on species that were introduced by humans in marine and brackish habitats and have established reproducing populations in the study area. The consortium consists of a network of experts in marine and brackish environments in Belgium, representing more than 22 different institutions and supported by a secretariat hosted at Flanders Marine Institute VLIZ. Evidence on invasiveness is reported for 12 of the 73 alien species that are currently included in the checklist for the study area (October 2014). The network brings together scientific information from distributed sources in a central platform. It is a first step to developing an evidence-based approach to inform environmental policy objectives for Belgian marine waters and support effective measures to address invasive alien species in the study area. The information platform and species checklist are presented, approaches for collection and integration of information are described, and opportunities for collaboration between information systems at different governance levels are briefly discussed.

   future course
SO ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN
AB Over the past decade, mounting evidence has shown the pervasive and escalating harmful impacts of invasive alien species on native species and ecosystems. Thousands of non-native species are established in the United States and many more worldwide. Few areas appear immune to invasions, some of which unfold over decades to centuries as species' ranges slowly expand across the landscape. A plethora of ecological effects have been attributed to invasive species, and other global change processes and widespread habitat destruction will likely multiply these effects. Many conservationists now consider invasive species among the top threats to biological diversity and are grappling with identifying pragmatic, effective solutions. They know that the future will involve mixed assemblages of native and non-native species and have important questions about which invasive species to tackle and which ones to ignore, and even whether to deliberately introduce certain species for restoration. Addressing these issues will push hard against the limits of today's ecological knowledge and our ability to predict the long-term ecological consequences of such decisions. Better envisioning the conservation goals, though, could help to guide the science.

TI Confronting the invasive species crisis with metamodel analysis: An
   explicit, two-species demographic assessment of an endangered bird and
   its brood parasite in Puerto Rico
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB Invasive species pose a significant threat to native species persistence worldwide. Effective invasives management requires a detailed understanding of the mechanisms by which they impact native taxa, yet most quantitative models used to inform management do not address these complex interactions. Populations of the endangered Yellow-shouldered Blackbird (Agelaius xanthomus, YSBL) have declined dramatically across southwestern Puerto Rico, largely through brood parasitism by the invasive Shiny Cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis, SHCO). YSBL management is focused on removing SHCO eggs from Blackbird nests and on constructing artificial nest structures (ANS) that are resistant to terrestrial predators and easily monitored for SHCO parasitism. Despite these efforts, successful recovery of YSBL requires a more thorough knowledge of the complex two-species system. We used a new "metamodel" approach to explicitly simulate demographic interactions between these two species. The metamodel featured two separate, individual-based demographic models running concurrently, with specific data-driven linkages simulating the species interactions and their impacts on population dynamics. Results indicated that YSBL management may be most effective by direct removal of SHCO eggs from parasitized nests, which can also reduce the number of fledged Cowbirds that subsequently prefer YSBL nests as adults. Fledging success and post-fledging survival, previously not considered serious threats, were also identified as critical determinants of YSBL population viability and important targets for management Importantly, trapping of SHCO did not emerge as an effective-method of YSBL management This is among the first population viability simulation models featuring explicit, simultaneous treatment of linked demographic dynamics in a native invasive species system.

TI Environmental risk assessment for invasive alien species: A case study
   of apple snails affecting ecosystem services in Europe
SO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW
AB The assessment of the risk posed by invasive alien species (IAS) to the environment is a component of increasing importance for Pest Risk Analysis. Standardized and comprehensive procedures to assess their impacts on ecosystem services have been developed only recently. The invasive apple snails (Pomacea canaliculata and P. maculate) are used as a case study to demonstrate the application of an innovative procedure assessing the potential impact of these species on shallow freshwater ecosystems with aquatic macrophytes in Europe. The apple snail, Pomacea maculate, recently established in the Ebro delta in Spain resulting in a serious threat to rice production and wetlands, having also a high risk to spread to other European wetlands. Here, the population abundance of apple snails is regarded as the main driver of ecosystem change. The effects of ecosystem resistance, resilience and pest management on snail population abundance are estimated for the short (5 years) and the long (30 years) term. Expert judgment was used to evaluate the impacts on selected ecosystem services in a worst case scenario. Our study shows that the combined effects of apple snails are estimated to have profound effects on the ecosystem services provided by shallow, macrophyte-dominated ecosystems in Europe. This case study illustrates that quantitative estimates of environmental impacts from different IAS are feasible and useful for decision-makers and invasive species managers that have to balance costs of control efforts against environmental and economic impacts of invasive species.

TI The strategy for protecting threatened forest species richness in the
   northeastern China from the effects of climate change
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION
AB Climate change has the potential to severely threaten the plant species in the forests of northeastern China. The field surveys performed for this study spanned 4 years and identified the endangered species present in the forests of northeastern China. We conducted a detailed investigation of 2,884 study plots and selected 29 nationally protected plant species (sample sizes >= 5), namely, threatened species for further analysis. We modelled and mapped the potential distributions of these 29 threatened species, and found that threatened species richness hotspots are currently distributed in the eastern and northeastern areas of the studied region and will move geographically. This study focused on the strategy for protecting threatened forest species richness by analysing the change trend of species richness and planning of priority protection areas due to climate change.

TI Knowledge Diffusion in a Global Supply Network: A Network of Practice
   View
SO JOURNAL OF SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
AB This study investigates how knowledge diffusion occurs in a globally dispersed supply network, wherein buying firms and suppliers often do not have strong relationships and competitive tensions prevail. We elaborate the Network of Practice (NoP) view by examining a global supply network in the food sector that is as an exemplar of high global dispersion. This paper provides several novel insights into global knowledge diffusion. We introduce the NoP concept of homophily into the field of supply chain management to explain knowledge diffusion within global supply networks. We take a longitudinal perspective to show that although prior contractual ties (relational homophily) and co-location (location homophily) initially drive knowledge diffusion, in the long-term, shared practices (practice homophily) are the principal driver of knowledge diffusion. We demonstrate that buying firms' assurance of procedural justice, together with the predominance of geographically dispersed suppliers and the emergence of nexus members, can help dampen supplier resistance to knowledge diffusion. The study shows that knowledge diffusion in a global supply NoP occurs in two complementary forms-broadcasting forums and action groups-which vary in breadth, depth, and tie diversity. Ultimately, we present vertical (buyer-supplier), horizontal (suppliersupplier), and diagonal (non-competitive) relationships as important refinements of the NoP view that characterize a global supply NoP. Overall, our findings offer a path for buying firms to establish adequate online infrastructure to support the emergence of decentralized and self-organized knowledge diffusion in a globally dispersed supply network.

TI On the riskiness of lower-tier suppliers: Managing sustainability in
   supply networks
SO JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT
AB Although multinational companies (MNCs) have increasingly embraced a sustainability strategy for their own operations, fewer have tried to engage their (tier-one) suppliers in their sustainability initiatives. It is even rarer that MNCs engage their suppliers' suppliers (lower-tier suppliers), despite the latter having a higher incidence of violations with more acute environmental and social impacts that can jeopardize the MNCs' operations and reputation. We conducted inductive research on three supply networks in the automotive, electronics, and consumer product/pharmaceutical industries. We collected data on three leading sustainable MNCs and a subset of 9 tier-one suppliers and 22 lower-tier suppliers and complemented that information with data on several NGOs and industry organizations. This study (1) reveals that many lower-tier suppliers address their environmental and labor issues passively and constitute the riskiest suppliers in a supply network; (2) provides a grounded theoretical framework for managing a sustainable supply network that accounts for multiple network members as well as three sustainability dimensions (the 3Ps: profit, people, and planet); and (3) shows how processes MNCs use to manage their suppliers differ from processes these suppliers use with their own (lower tier) suppliers. The study reveals the practices that leading sustainable MNCs use to manage their supply networks and provides important future research directions.

TI Correlated recovery of five lizard populations following eradication of
   invasive mammals
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB Many conservation decisions rely on the assumption that multiple populations will respond similarly to management. However, few attempts have been made to evaluate indicators of population trends (i.e. population indicator species). Eradication of introduced mammals from offshore islands is a commonly used management technique for conservation of native taxa in New Zealand. Pacific rats and rabbits were eradicated from Korapuki Island in 1986/1987 enabling population recovery of native species that had been suppressed by predation or competition. However, the degree to which species' responses were correlated has not been evaluated. We investigated correlations among lizard population trends on Korapuki Island as a test of the population indicator species concept. Our dataset consisted of captures of the five resident lizard species (three skinks, two geckos) from biannual pitfall trapping over a 10 year period (1986-1995) immediately following rodent eradication. We used a Bayesian modelling approach to examine correlations in population trends (based on mean annual counts) between species. Population trends were positively correlated for all species pairs (substantively for 90 % of pairs) and we detected no negative correlations. Systematic searches for single lizard species may indicate correlated recovery of lizard populations following rodent eradication and provide a cost-effective alternative to traditional 'whole community' monitoring. Our findings support evidence-based use of the population indicator species concept in cases where a shared ecological driver can be identified.

TI Assessing risk of Lymantria dispar L. invasion management to monarch
   butterflies (Danaus plexippus)
SO CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
AB Conflicting conservation goals that lead to management tradeoffs are not uncommon in conservation practice. In this study, we explore a potential conflict between the management of a destructive invasive insect pest, Lymantria dispar, and conservation of a widely declining iconic species, the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus). Specifically, we assess the risk of exposure of susceptible monarch larvae to aerial applications of Btk, a Lepidoptera-specific larvicide used in L. dispar suppression and eradication. Our findings indicate minimal conflict between L. dispar management and monarch conservation, as spatial overlap between Btk aerial applications and monarch larvae was found to be marginal. Furthermore, the results of our study indicated specific actions management can take to further minimize potential conflict between these conservation goals. Our study could serve as a guide to other efforts to evaluate potential tradeoffs between the management of invasive species and the conservation of vulnerable species.

TI Using genetic and morphological analysis to distinguish endangered taxa
   from their hybrids with the cultivated exotic pest plant Lantana
   strigocamara (syn: Lantana camara)
SO CONSERVATION GENETICS
AB Because highly invasive species can rapidly assimilate rare taxa, we questioned whether two Florida endangered Lantana depressa varieties existed 21 years after Sanders documented their widespread hybridization with exotic Lantana strigocamara, and whether morphological traits could accurately discriminate genetic individuals. Stepwise discriminant analysis of morphological characters discriminated the three taxa, correctly classifying 98, 91, 89% of L. strigocamara, L. depressa var. depressa, and var. floridana. Hybrids blurred taxonomic distinctions of varieties and reduced classification accuracy by 7-17%. Species-specific Random Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP-PCR) confirmed hybridization has occurred. Intersimple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) fingerprints analyzed with STRUCTURE identified three groups indicating introgression. Morphological traits significantly, but weakly correlated with q ratios (P = 0.0001; r(2) = 0.45). Although L. strigocamara introgression is widespread and ongoing, wild populations contain individuals that are predominantly L. depressa genome, supporting actions to remove adventive L. strigocamara, prevent its sale, and promote sales of genetically confirmed natives.

TI Assessing the aggregated risk of invasive crayfish and climate change to
   freshwater crabs: A Southeast Asian case study
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB Primary freshwater crabs represent a culturally and ecologically significant component of freshwater habitats globally that has a high percentage of threatened species. Invasive species (especially non-indigenous crayfish) and climate change are not only important standalone threats, but are also expected to compound existing threats (e.g., habitat loss/modification, pollution) and challenge the long-term survival of these decapod crustaceans. This study illustrates the importance of considering these two emerging and growing threats in conservation or management strategies by quantifying (via species distribution models) the individual and aggregated risks of these threats in Southeast Asia, a region with the highest diversity of primary freshwater crabs and a high proportion of imperiled species. Results predicted that most species of crabs (82.1%) will co-occur (and hence interact) with invasive crayfish to a moderate to high degree, and most species (69.2%) will also experience a reduction in suitable climate conditions in the future. In terms of aggregated risk, the results also predict an increased overlap between invasive crayfish and native crabs for three out of the seven species analyzed (namely Procambarus virginalis, Cherax destructor and Orconectes rusticus). Findings from this study provide a quantitatively derived rationale for the development of adaptive regulations and conservation plans in the region to minimize the risk of invasive species in a cost-effective way, thereby enabling the protection of Southeast Asia's natural heritage and its vital ecosystem services.

AB Wildlife@Home is citizen science project developed to provide wildlife biologists a way to swiftly analyze the massive quantities of data that they can amass during video surveillance studies. The project has been active for two years, with over 200 volunteers who have participated in providing observations through a web interface where they can stream video and report the occurrences of various events within that video. Wildlife@Home is currently analyzing avian nesting video from three species: Sharptailed-Grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus) an indicator species which plays a role in determining the effect of North Dakota's oil development on the local wildlife, Interior Least Tern (Sternula antillarum) a federally listed endangered species, and Piping Plover (Charadrius Melodus) a federally listed threatened species. Video comes from 105 grouse, 61 plover and 37 tern nests from multiple nesting seasons, and consists of over 85,000 hours (13 terabytes) of 24/7 uncontrolled outdoor surveillance video. This work describes the infrastructure supporting this citizen science project, and examines the effectiveness of two different interfaces for crowd sourcing: a simpler interface where users watch short clips of video and report if an event occurred within that video, and a more involved interface where volunteers can watch entire videos and provide detailed event information including beginning and ending times for events. User observations are compared against expert observations made by wildlife biology research assistants, and are shown to be quite effective given strategies used in the project to promote accuracy and correctness.

SE Science for Sustainable Societies
AB Invasive alien species management requires public participation to overcome a lack of human and financial resources in management; however, little is known about the demand for public participation in invasive alien species management. To address this knowledge gap, the present study evaluated demand for management of invasive carp, which is one of the worst but publicity invasive species worldwide. A choice experiment survey was conducted in Amami Oshima Island, Japan to quantify tourists' demand for participating in invasive carp removal in nature-based tourism, and to evaluate the impact of ecological information provision on their preference. The results show most tourists would avoid participating in carp removal activities as a tour option without any financial discounts; however, over 35.2% of tourists were willing to work for carp removal, based on their own motivations. We also found that ecological information encouraged tourists to participate in tours that included carp removal activities. Incorporation of invasive alien species management in nature-based tourism can enhance the economic benefits for local tourism industries. Our findings indicate that tourists could play an important role in invasive alien species management by compensating for a lack of human and financial resources in management.

TI Threat-abatement framework confirms habitat retention and invasive
   species management are critical to conserve Australia's threatened
   species
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB Earth's extinction crisis is escalating, and threat classification schemes are increasingly important for assessing the prominent drivers and threats causing species declines. However, a complementary framework for assessing the conservation responses needed to abate these threatening processes is lacking. Here we draw on expert knowledge and published literature to develop a threat-abatement framework which groups threats based on the shared conservation goal of the actions needed to abate their impact and apply it to 1532 threatened species across the Australian continent. Our analysis shows that the most important conservation actions across Australia are to retain and restore habitat, due to the threats posed by habitat destruction and degradation (via logging, mining, urbanisation, roads, and agriculture) to 86 % of Australia's threatened species. Most species also require the effective control of invasive species and diseases (82 %) and improved fire management (66 %). Countering individual threats will not be enough to support species survival or recovery, because almost all species (89 %) require multiple, integrated management responses to redress their threats. Our threat abatement framework enables rapid identification of broad conservation responses to aid recovery of threatened species and can be applied in other regions, scales and contexts.

TI Guidelines for Addressing Invasive Species in Protected Areas
SO PLANT INVASIONS IN PROTECTED AREAS: PATTERNS, PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES
SE Invading Nature-Springer Series in Invasion Ecology
AB Biological invasions pose a severe and increasing threat to the world's protected areas, and protected areas are being called upon to improve their management efficacy. Based on a review of best practice cases presented in this book and other sources, a set of guidelines to deal with invasive alien species is proposed, discussing the challenges and opportunities that protected areas face. These guidelines have a broader scope than the management of invasive alien plants within protected areas only, and include recommendations on all aspects related to invasive species, from raising awareness within the public and decision makers, to developing staff capacity, encouraging responsible behaviour, implementing prevention actions, improving the ability to react promptly to new incursions, developing surveillance and monitoring frameworks, integrating invasive species into management plans, and also for encouraging action at a broader scale than that of the protected area. These guidelines can help protected areas play a key role in preventing and mitigating the global effects of biological invasions, also catalysing more stringent action and policies at all scales.

TI Analysing economic costs of invasive alien species with the invacost r
   package
SO METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB The reported costs of invasive alien species from the global database InvaCost are heterogeneous and cover different spatio-temporal scales. A standard procedure for aggregating invasive species cost estimates is necessary to ensure the repeatability and comparativeness of studies. We introduce here the invacost r package, an open-source software designed to query and analyse the InvaCost database. We illustrate this package and its framework with cost data associated with invasive alien invertebrates. First, the invacost package provides updates of this dynamic database directly in the analytical environment R. Second, it helps understand the heterogeneous nature of monetary cost data for invasive species, processes to harmonize the data and the inherent biases associated with such data. Third, it readily provides complementary methods to investigate the costs of invasive species at different scales, all the while accounting for econometric statistical issues. This tool will be useful for scientists working on invasive alien species, by (a) facilitating access to and use of this multi-disciplinary data resource and (b) providing a standard procedure which will facilitate reproducibility and comparability among studies, one of the major critics of this topic until now. It should facilitate further interdisciplinary works including economists and invasion ecology researchers.

TI Barriers to globally invasive species are weakening across the Antarctic
SO DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
AB Aim: Biological invasions are a substantial threat to Antarctic biodiversity and a priority conservation policy focus for Antarctic Treaty Parties and the sovereign states of surrounding islands. Key to their strategies is prevention, including assessment of establishment risk for alien species. Despite establishment of some of the worst globally invasive species across the Antarctic region, assessments of establishment potential of these species are non-existent. Here, we address this deficit and determine whether these invasive species constitute a significant conservation threat to the broader Antarctic region both now and in response to future regional climate change.
   Location: Antarctica and the Southern Ocean islands (45 degrees-90 degrees S).
   Methods: We used ensemble species distribution models to assess the current and future climate suitability of the Antarctic region for 69 of the worst globally invasive species and 24 insect and plant species that have already established somewhere in the region.
   Results: The Antarctic continent is unsuitable for all of the worst globally invasive species under current conditions, but areas of the Antarctic Peninsula are predicted to become climatically suitable for up to six globally invasive species within the next century. By contrast, all Southern Ocean islands are presently climatically suitable for additional non-native species, with the threat increasing in the future.
   Main conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that climate, which is often cited as a key barrier to alien species establishment, may afford some protection to continental Antarctica, but that this protection is not currently extended to the Southern Ocean islands. Furthermore, existing climatic barriers to alien species establishment will weaken as warming continues across the region. This not only illustrates the value of applying distribution modelling methods to this largely ice-covered region, but demonstrates how these methods can be used to inform targeted surveillance of introduction pathways and sites that have the highest risk of establishment of invasive alien species.

TI Defining invasive species and demonstrating impacts of biological
   invasions: a scientometric analysis of studies on invasive alien plants
   in Brazil over the past 20 years
SO NEOBIOTA
AB Despite biological invasions being widely recognised as an important driver of environmental change, lack of consensus regarding the definition of invasive alien species (IAS) and vagueness around the demonstra-tion of their impacts limits knowledge and research in this field. In this study, a scientometric approach was used to analyse academic documents published between 2002 and 2021 in three databases with refer-ence to invasive alien plants in Brazil. Despite the growing body of scientific literature in the area, only 10% of the publications provided some definition of invasive species. Of the 398 publications analysed, 23.6% found some type of damage caused by the invader and, of these, only 5% addressed economic or social damage. Only 17% of the publications proposed a method for controlling and/or mitigating bio-logical invasions. The absence of clear terminology and the lack of focus on impacts limits understanding of IAS of plants in Brazil. Based on the present findings, future studies on IAS of plants should move towards a consensus on the definition of biological invasion, as well as understand the impact caused by these species. In addition, it is recommended that further scientometric studies should guide future efforts to support objective measures for management and decision-making.

TI Life history of Gymnotus refugio (Gymnotiformes; Gymnotidae): an
   endangered species of weakly electric fish
SO ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES
AB The present study describes the life history of Gymnotus refugio, a species classified as Endangered in the last published list of threatened species of the Brazilian fauna. The study was conducted at a conservation unity that protect one of the last remaining semideciduous forests in the region. The reproductive period was estimated as occurring from the end of winter to the last summer months. Gymnotus refugio exibited fractional spawning, the lowest relative fecundity registered among the Gymnotifomes species studied at the present, and male parental care behavior. The analyses showed a seasonal pattern on the species diet, associating different food categories to winter, autumn, and spring. According to food items analysis and estimated intestinal quotient, G. refugio was classified as invertivorous, feeding mainly on autochthonous insects. The results obtained herein suggest that the position of G. refugio as an Endangered species might be influenced by its territoriality, habitat specificity, parental care behavior, and low fecundity, reinforcing the importance of swampy forest environment conservation as the only means of the species maintenance.

TI Identifying plant and environmental indicators of ancient and recent
   calcareous grasslands
SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB Dry calcareous grasslands are among the most species-rich habitats in Central Europe, harbouring numerous threatened species. Because of their strong decline, they are being protected under the European Habitats Directive. However, apart from this general decline, new grasslands developed after the abandonment of arable fields on marginal land over the course of the last few centuries or even decades.
   The main question of this study was which species may indicate the age of a dry calcareous grassland habitat in the Franconian Jurassic mountains near Kallmunz. We compared the diversity parameters and nature conservation value of both grassland types. Additionally, we searched for differences in habitat and soil parameters. Furthermore, we asked if there is a general pattern of indicator species among available studies on ancient (i.e. those continuously used as pastures at least since 1830) and recent (i.e. those temporarily farmed as arable fields after 1830) calcareous grasslands.
   We compiled a list of indicator species of both ancient and recent grasslands in the study region. Comparison with other studies leads to the conclusion that there are not many species that clearly indicate grassland age across different regions (the best indicators are Carex caryophyllea, Cirsium acaule and Hippocrepis comosa for ancient grasslands, and Agrimonia eupatoria and Astragalus glyciplyllos for recent grasslands).
   Ancient grasslands harbour a somewhat greater number of threatened species than recent grasslands. Many species of the ancient grasslands under study can be considered relict species of steppic grasslands or open pine forests (e.g. Hippocrepis comosa, Pulsatilla vulgaris, Teucrium chamaedrys, Teucrium montanum and Thymus praecox). Recent grasslands also harbour rare and endangered species, especially disturbance-tolerant relicts of former arable use (e.g. Melampyrum arvense) and may therefore be of high conservation value, too.
   The average number of species per plot is greater in ancient grasslands. However, the most species-rich plot (46 species of vascular plants within a 4-m(2) quadrat) was found in a 60 years old grassland.
   Arable cultivation in the past has altered the physical and chemical properties of the soil of recent grasslands. In general, ancient grasslands occur on nutrient-poorer and less calcium-rich soils with high water holding capacity. High water holding capacity is connected with high humus content, which increases the importance of ancient grasslands for carbon storage.
   The challenges and benefits of differentiating grasslands of different age in the management of protected areas and landscape planning (e.g. the identification of High Nature Value farmland) are discussed.

TI Engineering Urban Sustainability
SO SUSTAINABILITY: MULTI-DISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES
AB Population growth and increased concentration of economic activities in urban areas pose significant challenges for sustainable development of urban regions. Our ability to make correct choices about future development will depend upon our understanding of the impact of these choices on the future quality of life of the urban inhabitants. Land use, construction material use and construction practices are among the most critical drivers of sustainability, given that where and how we choose to build will affect a range of environmental attributes including energy use, water use, air quality, waste handling, and public health, among others. The challenge is the quantification and visualization of the interdependent future consequences in the regional/urban landscape by independent decisions at the urban area. This requires a meta -model framework that integrates the outcomes resulting from growth and spatial distribution of economic and social activities. A framework that integrates land use, construction practices, transportation and air quality were given as an example.

TI Evaluating conservation dogs in the search for rare species
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB Detecting rare species is important for both threatened species management and invasive species eradication programs. Conservation scent dogs provide an olfactory survey tool that has advantages over traditional visual and auditory survey techniques for some cryptic species. From the literature, we identified 5 measures important in evaluating the use of scent dogs: precision, sensitivity, effort, cost, and comparison with other techniques. We explored the scale at which performance is evaluated and examined when field testing under real working conditions is achievable. We also identified cost differences among studies. We examined 61 studies published in 1976-2018 that reported conservation dog performance, and considered the inconsistencies in the reporting of scent dog performance among these studies. The majority of studies reported some measure of performance; however, only 8 studies reported all 3 aspects necessary for performance evaluation: precision, sensitivity, and effort. Although effort was considered in 43 studies, inconsistent methods and incomplete reporting prevented meaningful evaluation of performance and comparison among studies. Differences in cost between similar studies were influenced by geographical location and how the dog and handler were sourced for the study. To develop consistent reporting for evaluation, we recommend adoption of sensitivity, precision, and effort as standard performance measures. We recommend reporting effort as the total area and total time spent searching and reporting sensitivity and precision as proportions of the sample size. Additionally, reporting of costs, survey objectives, dog training and experience, type of detection task, and human influences will provide better opportunities for comparison within and among studies.

TI Agricultural land underutilisation in the hills of Nepal: Investigating
   socio-environmental pathways of change
SO JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB Why should a parcel of agricultural land be abandoned when there is a scarcity of food? In this paper, we address this question in relation to the hills of Nepal, where agricultural land is being abandoned at an unprecedented rate, despite looming food scarcity. Responding to studies that have highlighted land abandonment trends, we conducted in-depth case studies in two of Nepal's hill districts to understand how land abandonment is taking place, and under what circumstances. Using an interdisciplinary lens and transcending linear models of agrarian change which attribute land abandonment to one or more prominent factors, our study unravels complex, cross-scalar processes, involving the interaction among social forces and environmental factors which lead to land underutilisation. The paper shows that land underutilisation happens through what we term 'socio-environmental pathways', which operate across scales, yet are deeply rooted in local dynamics of agrarian change. These pathways are triggered by, and embroiled within, three wider socio-economic and political dynamics in contemporary Nepal, namely: socio-cultural changes that favour out-migration; evolving economic opportunities that make farming less profitable; and a policy context in which the gravity of the land abandonment challenge goes unrecognised. The framework of 'socio-environmental pathways' applied here also advances a theoretical lens to explain agrarian change in a way that integrates multiple scales and multiple sectors, emphasising a thoroughly empirical approach. Finally, we identify key policy implications of this research on livelihoods and sustainable development. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Australian pastoralists in time and space: The evolution of a complex
   adaptive system
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB Newcomers and exotic livestock have displaced indigenous hunter-gatherers from Australia's drylands over the past 200 yr. This paper seeks to learn from and explain the adaptive process involving the initially nave newcomers, their stock, and Australia's ancient landscapes. We review pastoral adaptation at the national, regional, and enterprise scales. These scales are linked, and so we use "panarchy" theory with its concept of "adaptive cycles" as an analytical framework. Past pastoral adaptation can be summarized by changes in key linkages: pastoralists (1) are now connected to more individuals than when they first moved into the rangelands, but are less reliant on local hubs for these connections; (2) have weaker links to the environment as environmental feedbacks have been reduced; (3) have stronger links to alternate land uses, but weaker links to governance; and (4) have stronger links to the global economy. Further change is inevitable. Pastoralism is likely to remain as the core activity in Australian rangelands, but the dynamic linkages that shape the system will, in future, connect pastoralists more strongly to post-production economies, information and more distant social networks, and to a more diverse group of land users.

TI Potential effects of climate change on the distribution of an endangered
   species: Melanophryniscus montevidensis (Anura: Bufonidae)
SO PHYLLOMEDUSA
AB Species distributions are linked with climate. Among the effects predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are changes in precipitation patterns and increases in mean temperatures factors potentially having a major impact on threatened, rare, and endemic species. Using models to forecast possible changes in the distributions of different species under different climate-change scenarios, we can identify probable impacts on species and build effective conservation strategies. We modeled the effects of two climate-change scenarios on the geographical distribution of the regionally endemic bufonid, Melanophryniscus montevidensis, categorized as vulnerable by the IUCN and as endangered by the Uruguayan Red List of amphibians. Ecological niche models were generated to describe the present and possible future distributions of this species in 2050 and 2080, given severe (A2) and moderate (B2) climatic changes. Legacy data for M. montevidensis were obtained from Uruguayan biocollections and climate data were acquired from the WorldClim database. At present, M. montevidensis could occur along the Atlantic Uruguayan coast and a small section of the southern Brazilian coast. However, changes in climate may lead to a loss of suitable environmental conditions for this toad; thus, this endangered species is vulnerable and in urgent need of protection.

TI Gorging on gobies: beneficial effects of alien prey on a threatened
   vertebrate
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE
AB Invasive species often have rapid and far-reaching negative impacts on populations and ecological communities. These effects are most common when invasive species have few competitors or predators. Although higher level carnivores do consume invasive species, quantitative effects of new and abundant food sources on predators have rarely been documented and, as a consequence, potentially positive effects of invasive species may be under appreciated. We investigated the effects of the invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas, 1814)) on diet composition, growth rate, and body size of the Lake Erie Water Snake (Nerodia sipedon insularum (Conant and Clay, 1937)), which is threatened in the USA and endangered in Ontario, Canada. Water Snakes have shifted their diet, and round gobies now constitute > 92% of prey consumed. This shift in diet has occurred in just one or two Water Snake generations, yet has resulted in more rapid growth and attainment of larger body size in Water Snakes. These positive effects may reduce predation, speed reproductive maturity, increase offspring production, and fuel population growth of this threatened species.

TI Pattern of Urban Flora in Intra-City Railway Habitats (Alexandria,
   Egypt): A Conservation Perspective
SO BIOLOGY-BASEL
AB Simple Summary Intra-city railway areas can play a role in enhancing the diversity and dynamics of urban flora. The current study sheds the light on the role that overlooked railway habitats can provide in the conservation of biodiversity through surveying the floristic composition and diversity along intra-city railway and tram tracks in Alexandria. The plant communities were identified using multivariate analysis techniques. Spontaneous flora in intra-city railway areas represent distinct adaptations to unique urban-industrial ecosystems with different levels of anthropogenic disturbance. Despite the high level of disturbance, native species dominated the investigated habitats, including rare and endemic species. The study emphasizes the role that these ruderal habitats provide as valuable refuge areas for rare and endangered species worthy of proper management and conservation action. Intra-city railway areas are deemed large greenspaces and are believed to be key in enhancing the diversity and dynamics of urban flora. In the current study, the floristic composition and diversity along intra-city railway and tram tracks in Alexandria were surveyed. The floristic composition of the plant communities in relation to environmental factors, ecological indicators, and level of human impact was analyzed using multivariate analysis (two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) for classification and detrended correspondence analysis (DECORANA) for ordination. The multivariate ordination techniques (CCA) revealed differences in the environmental factors and climatic factors influencing the floristic composition of the railway and tram track habitats. Tram tracks suffered higher human impact while maintaining higher vitality and cover compared to train tracks. Species recorded were mainly therophytes, followed by phanerophytes and hemicryptophytes dominated by native species; however, invasive species' contribution was higher compared to surrounding regions. The number of invasive species was greater in railway areas compared to tram track areas (19 and 15, respectively). The occurrence of two endemic species (Sinapis allionii and Sonchus macrocarpus) with limited national distribution highlights the importance of these habitats as valuable refuge areas for rare and endangered species worthy of conservation action.

TI Spatial structure and the control of invasive alien species
SO ANIMAL CONSERVATION
AB Invasive alien species pose a significant threat to biodiversity worldwide and many eradication programmes are now underway in an effort to reduce the impact they may have on native species and ecosystems. The spatial structure of such invasive species populations is likely to have important implications for designing effective control strategies. Here, a simple source-sink population model is used to address the following question: if a population of an invasive alien species is source-sink in nature, what is the best way of dividing limited resources for its control? Results from this model indicate that allocation of resources solely to the source population does not always result in the most effective control strategy. The most efficient control measure is determined by the relative strengths (net gains and losses) of the source and sink populations and, crucially, the nature of dispersal between them. We present a case study for the control of an invasive species illustrating the use of these types of model.

TI Practical wisdom as an adaptive algorithm for leadership: Integrating
   Eastern and Western perspectives to navigate complexity and uncertainty
SO BUSINESS ETHICS-A EUROPEAN REVIEW
AB In this paper, we integrate Eastern and Western perspectives of practical wisdom to answer the question,how can practical wisdom transfer across cultural boundaries in a world of increasing interconnection?We describe key properties of practical wisdom in early Western and Eastern schools of thoughts and explain how the concept of practical wisdom in ancient philosophy aligns with modern-day complex system science. We identify seven qualities of complex adaptive systems as a universal pattern that underlies both Eastern and Western perspectives. From these qualities, we develop an integrated conceptual framework of practical wisdom as factors both internal and external to the self that promote continuous coupling with the broader operating environment. We propose that practical wisdom functions as an adaptive algorithm capable of continuously evaluating its processing rules to maintain fit with the operating environment while generating ongoing novelty. This generativity expands developmental potential across multiple levels and fosters open-endedness, evolvability, and antifragility. With this functional understanding, ethics can no longer be marginalized-it must be recognized as the foundation for sustainable organizing because it reliably creates a network topology that makes innovation and long-term success possible. We close with actions leaders can take to foster practical wisdom.

TI A global picture of biological invasion threat on islands
SO NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
AB Biological invasions are among the main drivers of biodiversity losses. As threats from biological invasions increase, one of the most urgent tasks is to identify areas of high vulnerability. However, the lack of comprehensive information on the impacts of invasive alien species (IAS) is a problem especially on islands, where most of the recorded extinctions associated with IAS have occurred. Here we provide a global, network-oriented analysis of IAS on islands. Using network analysis, we structured 27,081 islands and 437 threatened vertebrates into 21 clusters, based on their profiles in term of invasiveness and shared vulnerabilities. These islands are mainly located in the Southern Hemisphere and many are in biodiversity hotspots. Some of the islands share similar characteristics regarding their connectivity that could be useful for understanding their response to invasive species. The major invaders found in these clusters of islands are feral cats, feral dogs, pigs and rats. Our analyses reveal those IAS that systematically act alone or in combination, and the pattern of shared IAS among threatened species, providing new information to implement effective eradication strategies. Combined with further local, contextual information this can contribute to global strategies to deal with IAS.

TI Reconfigurable supply chain: the X-network
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB Research on supply chain (SC) digitalization, resilience, sustainability and leagility has remarkably progressed, most of it focused on the individual contributions of these four major frameworks. However, a lack of integration spanning these individual frameworks can be observed. In this conceptual paper, we hypothesize that reconfigurability can be considered such an integral perspective that consolidates the research in SC adaptation to ever changing environments. We theorize a new notion - a Reconfigurable SC or the X-network - that exhibits some crucial design and control characteristics for complex value-adding systems in highly vulnerable environments. We support our argumentation and conceptual viewpoints by a literature analysis along with tertiary studies to review and structure contextual factors of designing the X-networks. We propose respective frameworks and discuss the implementation principles and technologies at the macro and micro levels. Two novel concepts - dynamic SC meta-structures and dynamic autonomous services - are introduced. Distinctively, we go beyond the existing knowledge to predict proactively the future directions in the reconfigurable SCs. Our results can be of value for decision-makers to decipher chances and barriers in contemporary SC transformations.

TI Conservation or politics? Australia's target to kill 2 million cats
SO CONSERVATION LETTERS
AB The Australian Government's 5-year Threatened Species Strategy contains four priority action areas and associated targets. Here, we argue that the well-publicized target to cull 2 million feral cats has a weak scientific basis because: (1) reliable estimates of Australia's cat population size did not exist when the target was set; (2) it is extremely difficult to measure progress (numbers of cats killed) in an accurate, reliable way; and, most importantly, (3) the cull target is not explicitly linked to direct conservation outcomes (e.g., measured increases in threatened species populations). These limitations mean that the cull target fails to meet what would be considered best practice for pest management. The focus on killing cats runs the risk of distracting attention away from other threats to biodiversity, most prominent of which is widespread, ongoing habitat loss, which has been largely overlooked in the Threatened Species Strategy. The culling target is a highly visible symbol of a broader campaign around feral cat research and management in Australia, rather than a direct indicator of conservation action and success. We are concerned that progress toward the 2 million target could be misinterpreted as progress toward conserving threatened species, when the link between the two is not clear.

TI Socio-technical discourses of European electricity decarbonization:
   Contesting narrative credibility and legitimacy with quantitative
   story-telling
SO ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB This paper presents an innovative approach to the responsible use of quantitative analysis when dealing with the governance of sustainability. Rather than using complicated models which try to predict and control the future evolution of complex adaptive systems, quantitative story-telling is proposed to check, first of all, the plausibility of proposed policies. As a case study, we check the plausibility of 'a radical decarbonization of the European economy based on a quick deployment of alternative sources of electrical energy generation'. Although our case study includes a high-level set of quantitative results, it is primarily methodological. The procedure of quantitative story-telling includes: (1) identification of the narratives used to inform policy; (2) identification of the relevant factors determining the feasibility, viability and desirability of expected results; (3) a quantitative analysis which falsifies at least one of these three factors, indicating an implausibility of the expected results; and (4) identification of knowledge gaps in the existing discussions over the issue. The modern European energy system does need an urgent and radical transformation. However, before imposing drastic and ambitious policies, it is essential to check the quality of the diagnosis. Our analysis flags the existence of a few reasons for concern with regard to the current story-telling.

TI Impact and control of invasive alien species on small islands
SO INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
CT Workshop on Small Island Developing States held in Connection with the
   16th Commonwealth Forestry Conference
CY 2001
CL HOBART, AUSTRALIA
AB Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are confronted with significant problems of biological invasions, arising from conscious or accidental introduction of invasive alien species. Small islands are considered to be fragile and more prone to such invasions than continental areas because of the combined effect of the special characteristics island species have evolved, and the gregariousness of invasive species. Examples from small islands around the world are provided to demonstrate the impacts of invasive alien species on the ecology of small islands, where they have caused large-scale degradation and impoverishment of the indigenous flora and fauna. Many SIDS have embarked on an ambitious control programme of invasive alien species, including exclusion of large introduced animals, and eradication programmes using poisons, manual weeding and /or herbicides. It is considered important that research on biological invasions continues to enhance the understanding of the behaviour of invasive alien species and their impacts on islands.

TI When should we save the most endangered species?
SO ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB At the heart of our efforts to protect threatened species, there is a controversial debate about whether to give priority to cost-effective actions or whether focusing solely on the most endangered species will ultimately lead to preservation of the greatest number of species. By framing this debate within a decision-analytic framework, we show that allocating resources solely to the most endangered species will typically not minimise the number of extinctions in the long-term, as this does not account for the risk of less endangered species going extinct in the future. It is only favoured when our planning timeframe is short or we have a long-term view and we are optimistic about future conditions. Conservation funding tends to be short-term in nature, which biases allocations to more endangered species. Our work highlights the need to consider resource allocation for biodiversity over the long-term; 'preventive conservation', rather than just short-term fire-fighting.

TI Integrated Management of Forest Ecosystem Services: An Optimization
   Model Based on Multi-objective Analysis and Metaheuristic Approach
SO NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH
AB The goal of this research was to implement an optimization model that allows definition of best management strategies in the forest sector. The case study is depicted in a coniferous stand (silver firAbies alba Mill.) of Tuscany (central Italy). Four ecosystem services were quantified from biophysical (timber produced, carbon stored, ecosystem diversity, recreational function) and economic (total economic value of the above parameters) perspective. The indicators are aggregated through a multi-objective approach (compromise programming). In the framework of forest seen as complex adaptive systems, different management strategies can lead to emergent reaction of forest functions. Due to nonlinear and non-continuous interactions as well as to the presence of feedbacks and loops among environmental and socioeconomic forest components, results are optimized by means of differential evolution and particle swarm algorithm. The genetic algorithm was applied to minimize the distance from ideal point. The best value of the decision variable (rotation period) was defined for different scenarios based on compensatory level of criteria, constraints and presence/absence of forest thinning. Conflicting trends and trade-offs are highlighted when different criteria were optimized. Among outputs, thinning intervention seems to reduce the performance of several criteria in the study area. Strengths and weaknesses of the model as well as potential future improvements are finally discussed.

TI A relational turn for sustainability science? Relational thinking,
   leverage points and transformations
SO ECOSYSTEMS AND PEOPLE
AB In sustainability science, revising the paradigms that separate humans from nature is considered a powerful 'leverage point' in pursuit of transformations. The coupled social-ecological and human-environment systems perspectives at the heart of sustainability science have, in many ways, enhanced recognition across academic, civil, policy and business spheres that humans and nature are inextricably connected. However, in retaining substantialist assumptions where 'social' and 'ecological' refer to different classes of entity that interact, coupled systems perspectives insist on the inextricability of humans and nature in theory, while requiring researchers to extricate them in practice - thus inadvertently reproducing the separation they seek to repair. Consequently, sustainability researchers are increasingly drawing on scholarship from the 'relational turn' in the humanities and the social sciences to propose a paradigm shift for sustainability science: away from focusing on interactions between entities, towards emphasizing continually unfolding processes and relations. Yet there remains widespread uncertainty about the origins, promises and challenges of using relational approaches. In this paper, we identify four themes in relational thinking - continually unfolding processes; embodied experience; reconstructing language and concepts; and ethics/practices of care - and highlight the ways in which these are being drawn on in sustainability science. We conclude by critically discussing how relational approaches might contribute to (i) a paradigm shift in sustainability science, and (ii) transformations towards sustainability. Relational approaches foster more dynamic, holistic accounts of human-nature connectedness; more situated and diverse knowledges for decision-making; and new domains and methods of intervention that nurture relationships in place and practice.

TI ILLEGAL BIRD HUNTING IN EASTERN SPAIN: A DECLINING TREND, BUT STILL
   WORRYING
SO ARDEOLA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY
AB The illegal killing of many threatened species is an ongoing conservation concern, especially in the Mediterranean region. This study provides quantitative data on non-game birds admitted with gunshot injuries to wildlife rehabilitation centres (WRC) of the Valencian Community (eastern Spain), over a 25-year period (1991-2015). A total of 2,076 shot non-game birds of 101 different species were admitted, including 112 individuals belonging to 17 threatened species. Raptors were the most affected group, comprising 74% of the total admissions. The number of yearly admissions was positively related to the number of issued hunting licences, and both declined over the study period. Evidently, illegal hunting occurred throughout the year, although it peaked during the official hunting season. The occurrence of birds admitted with gunshot wounds was higher in more densely populated municipalities and in those closer to WRCs. Our results show that illegal hunting of protected bird species prevails despite legislative efforts, and it could pose a major problem for some endangered species. Accordingly, it is necessary to focus current action to reduce illegal hunting in conflictive areas.

TI A cautionary tale: surrogates for radio-tagging practice do not always
   simulate the responses of closely related species
SO MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
AB Telemetry is useful for monitoring rare and threatened species if they can be effectively tagged. Relatively abundant, closely related species are sometimes used as surrogates in refining tagging methods or testing the suitability of methods before transfer to rare and threatened species. A decision framework for developing a radio-tagging method of an endangered fish (Macquaria australasica; Percichthyidae) is presented based on experiences with tagging a closely related, surrogate species (Macquaria ambigua). Aquaria and field-based trials demonstrated the suitability of internally implanting a radio-tag with an externally exited antenna on the surrogate species. However, transferring this method to the endangered species under field conditions was unsuccessful in terms of mortality and/or radio-tag rejection. In this case, a surrogate species served to refine radio-tagging methods, but did not successfully indicate the suitability of these methods for a closely related species. This cautionary tale illustrates that surrogate species are not always effective and extrapolation of methods, even across closely related species, may be perilous.

TI The aspects and the role of diversity in socioeconomic systems: an
   evolutionary perspective
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB In an evolutionary perspective, diversity is seen as a systemic and resilient property of both biological and socioeconomic systems. Functional aspects of biological and cultural diversity relate to adaptation to different environments, avoidance of head-to-head competition, efficient use of energy and resources, and in providing a range of responses to new selective pressures. Structural aspects of diversity are identified in asymmetric distributions of key variables like size, metabolism and complexity, which take the form of skewed distributions and power law across various hierarchical levels. The existence of functional and structural analogues between biological and socioeconomic systems suggests the possibility of similar constraints and propensities of self-organization at work in both systems. These could shed new light on the ongoing process of globalization and economic development. This paper proposes the hypothesis of required socioeconomic diversity if systemic coherence and integrity of the world socioeconomic system is to be maintained. The reduction of this diversity below a certain threshold may provoke a critical instability of the world economic system leading to collapses of all sizes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Regional food security risk assessment under the coordinated development

SO NATURAL HAZARDS
AB Agricultural water use plays an important role in maintaining food security. The present paper utilizes an agent-based model of the complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory for the dynamic simulation of four water resource utilization plans and was able to forecast the per capita food share, per capita income and water security rate under three climatic conditions in Heilongjiang Province, China, in 2020. The forecasts were performed under the broad principle of coordinated regional development and based on Heilongjiang's food production, water resources and population data 2003-2010. The measured data for Heilongjiang Province in 2011 were used to perform joint risk analyses of the forecast results. The results showed that the comprehensive plan combining technological innovation and policy control provides the best method of achieving food security under the three climatic conditions. However, compared to maintaining the status quo, this combination plan decreases by approximately 8 % under the three climatic conditions, but the per capita share of food and the rate of water security increase to over 10 and 20 %, respectively. Therefore, to further reduce the pressure on water resources in Heilongjiang Province and to lessen the impact of climate on food production, advanced technology and policy regulations should be increasingly integrated into various industries to ensure the sustainable supply of regional water resources for food production.

TI Economic costs of biological invasions in Asia
SO NEOBIOTA
AB Invasive species have caused severe impacts on biodiversity and human society. Although the estimation of environmental impacts caused by invasive species has increased in recent years, economic losses associated with biological invasions are only sporadically estimated in space and time. In this study, we synthesized the losses incurred by invasions in Asia, based on the most comprehensive database of economic costs of invasive species worldwide, including 560 cost records for 88 invasive species in 22 countries. We also assessed the differences in economic costs across taxonomic groups, geographical regions and impacted sectors, and further identified the major gaps of current knowledge in Asia. Reported economic costs of biological invasions were estimated between 1965 and 2017, and reached a total of US$ 432.6 billion (2017 value), with dramatic increases in 2000-2002 and in 2004. The highest costs were recorded for terrestrial ectotherms, for species estimated in South Asia, and for species estimated at the country level, and were related to more than one impacted sector. Two taxonomic groups with the highest reported costs were insects and mammals, and two countries with the highest costs were India and China. Non-English data covered all of 12 taxonomic groups, whereas English data only covered six groups, highlighting the importance of considering data from non-English sources to have a more comprehensive estimation of economic costs associated with biological invasions. However, we found that the estimation of economic costs was lacking for most Asian countries and for more than 96% of introduced species in Asia. Further, the estimation is heavily biased towards insects and mammals and is very limited concerning expenditures on invasion management. To optimize the allocation of limited resources, there is an important need to better and more widely study the economic costs of invasive alien species. In this way, improved cost reporting and more collaborations between scientists and stakeholders are needed across Asia.

TI Infrastructure ecology: an evolving paradigm for sustainable urban
   development
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Increasing urbanization places cities at the forefront of achieving global sustainability. For cities to become more sustainable, however, the infrastructure on which they rely must also become more productive, efficient and resilient. Unfortunately the current paradigm of urban infrastructure development is fragmented in approach lacking a systems perspective. Urban infrastructure systems are analogous to ecological systems because they are interconnected, complex and adaptive components that exchange material, information and energy among themselves and to and from the environment, and exhibit characteristic scaling properties that can be expressed by Zipfs Law. Analyzing them together as a whole, as one would do for an ecological system, provides a better understanding about their dynamics and interactions, and enables system-level optimization. The adoption of this "infrastructure ecology" approach will result in urban (re)development that requires lower investment of financial and natural resources to build and maintain, is more sustainable (e.g. uses less materials and energy and generates less waste) and resilient, and enables a greater and more equitable opportunities for the creation of wealth and comfort. The 12 guiding principles of infrastructure ecology will provide a set of goals for urban planners, engineers and other decision-makers in an urban system for urban (re) development.

TI A market approach to sturgeon conservation under the US Endangered
   Species Act
SO FISHERIES
AB The U.S. Endangered Species Act represented an extraordinary and unprecedented conservation effort when it was enacted in 1973. Since that time, it has provided significant protection for some of the world's most endangered and threatened species. However, such protection has come at the cost of not utilizing available natural resources to their fullest economic potential. With these two conflicting interests in mind, this article attempts to objectively evaluate the benefits and costs of the current Endangered Species Act and suggests policy and listing changes that could further the conservation purposes of the act while also reducing the economic costs associated with protection. More specifically, this article addresses whether a captive-bred exception for the shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum) could help conserve other wild, endangered sturgeon species while also promoting a safe, regulated source of high-value food products to meet an ever-increasing demand.

TI Placing invasive species management in a spatiotemporal context
SO ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB Invasive species are a worldwide issue, both ecologically and economically. A large body of work focuses on various aspects of invasive species control, including how to allocate control efforts to eradicate an invasive population as cost effectively as possible. There are a diverse range of invasive species management problems, and past mathematical analyses generally focus on isolated examples, making it hard to identify and understand parallels between the different contexts. In this study, we use a single spatiotemporal model to tackle the problem of allocating control effort for invasive species when suppressing an island invasive species, and for long-term spatial suppression projects. Using feral cat suppression as an illustrative example, we identify the optimal resource allocation for island and mainland suppression projects. Our results demonstrate how using a single model to solve different problems reveals similar characteristics of the solutions in different scenarios. As well as illustrating the insights offered by linking problems through a spatiotemporal model, we also derive novel and practically applicable results for our case studies. For temporal suppression projects on islands, we find that lengthy projects are more cost effective and that rapid control projects are only economically cost effective when population growth rates are high or diminishing returns on control effort are low. When suppressing invasive species around conservation assets (e.g., national parks or exclusion fences), we find that the size of buffer zones should depend on the ratio of the species growth and spread rate.

TI What Should Be Focused on When Digital Transformation Hits Industries?
   Literature Review of Business Management Adaptability
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB How traditional industries adapt to the digital economy to achieve sustainable development has attracted scholars and practitioners. Exploring the concept of BMA (business management adaptability) can not only theoretically explain adaptive micro-operation mechanisms but can provide practical guidance for enterprises to form adaptability. To date, although a lot of effort is being spent on detecting the adaptive construction elements, refining the BMA to specific management levels, a comprehensive review combines adaptability construction elements and specific levels have not yet been formed. In this trial, this paper innovatively utilizes a hybrid method that consists of a bibiometric and structural literature review to conduct a comprehensive theoretical study of relevant literatures from 1970 to 2020. By displaying current research conclusions and their defects, this study combines adaptability construction elements and innovatively forms a multi-level BMA framework. In this framework, this paper reveals the importance of setting up performance evaluation systems that focus on corporate profitability, probing and counterpoising relations between internal and external environments. Finally, this paper provides recommendations for practitioners about how to build their own competitive advantages when the digital economy hits the global world.

TI 'Blame it on the Weeds' : Politics, Poverty, and Ecology in the New
   South Africa
SO JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN STUDIES
AB In January of 2000, spectacular fires burned in the natural veld of Cape Town, South Africa. As the fire-fighting effort finished, a theory emerged: invasive alien species, trees from other countries, such as Australia and the United States, were to blame for the fires. While the invasive alien hypothesis captured the attention of media and policy makers alike, there was little ecological evidence to support it. This article places the fires of 2000 in a longer history of post-apartheid policy and science surrounding invasive alien floral species, arguing that the fires allowed for a synergy between concerns over poverty relief, nature conservation, and scientific research. The most visible example of this synergy was an increased commitment to the Working for Water programme on the Cape Peninsula, a large-scale employment programme utilising unskilled labour to clear invasive alien species in order to conserve South African water resources. In addition to providing employment for South Africa's poorest citizens, Working for Water provided funding for ecological research about invasive alien species. The studies that resulted from this funding focused on gathering information to make practical suggestions for invasive species control. Although the focus of these studies was on management, the science used was itself as rigorous as it had ever been. In the post-apartheid era, as poverty relief and nature conservation came together, scientists ensured that they would continue to play a role in nature conservation by making their research relevant to both invasive species control and to poverty relief.

TI What Does the Sustainability-Risk Interaction Look Like? Exploring
   Nuanced Relationships in Emerging Economy Sustainability Initiatives
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB To be viable long-term, sustainability programs must be profitable. Unfortunately, current sustainability practices increase risk, increasing costs and threatening revenues. Higher costs and lower revenues negatively impact profitability and, thus, the viability of sustainability. To understand how sustainability-induced risks affect food production systems, sustainability-induced risks in food production systems are identified and classified. It is also explored how sustainability risks interact, making it especially costly and difficult to eradicate them. An inductive, interview-based method was employed, which relies on 41 semi-structured interviews, with managers at 32 companies. The study documents the interaction between sustainability and risk in five risk categories-behavioral, opportunism, organizational routines, safety and traceability routines and systems design. The negative impact of intensive interactions among these risk categories threatens food production systems' sustainability initiatives. Behavioral risks are particularly pervasive and harmful as they either induce or exacerbate other risk clusters. Elaborating the interaction between sustainability and risk, as well as documenting risk types and interactions, provides a more holistic view of sustainability implementation. This nuanced view will lead to a more accurate and insightful costing of sustainability programs. Lamentably, the most pervasive risk category-i.e., behavioral risks-are often overlooked in the supply chain management literature. However, this research shows a clear need to delve more deeply into the behavioral dimension to improve risk management and to increase the viability of sustainability. This study identifies and categorizes sustainability-induced risk factors in food production systems, and shows how they interrelate, providing the foundation for better planning and execution of viable sustainability programs.

AB With the emergence of pervasive computing technologies into vehicles, driving has moved from an active task of steering towards an interaction or adaptation task with respect to the driver-vehicle feedback loop. Up to now vehicular interfaces have mostly been evaluated from a single-driver single-car viewpoint, however, driving is a more complex task involving - beside the local interaction - the interrelationship between all the cars in a certain community of interest.
   The question investigated in this research work is how a vehicle's local parameters in a bulk of cars (e.g. vehicle speed, braking parameters) affect the global behavior of this system (traffic congestion, driving speed variation, throughput). To explore this, two traffic models have been developed and simulated using the NetLogo simulation environment.
   Simulation results have shown that the intercar distance has a direct impact on both the throughput and the mean trip time. The proactive driving approach using vibro-tactile driver notification followed in the second, advanced model achieved much better results regarding these parameters compared to the simple manual-driven case. Finally, the outcomes legitimate the implementation of a prototype, and the installation of such a technology into a large number of cars in order to provide evidence for the improved traffic flow and decreased probability of traffic accidents in real driving scenarios.

TI Agent-based model for simulating building energy management in student
   residences
SO ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB Reducing energy consumption in buildings through behavioural changes has been regarded as a relatively low-cost and sustainable method. However, studies that focus on occupant building energy consumption in student residences are few. In the context of shared residences, the energy behaviour could be very different. This is because student-student and student-building system interactions are complex. To address this research gap, this study developed an agent-based simulation model regarding students as heterogeneous individuals. Simulation parameters include student basic information, status of staying at dormitories and applicances using behaviours. All data were obtained from a university campus in Shenzhen, China. Energy-saving scenarios under different strategies were simulated, including different energy-saving strategies and interaction behaviour energy-saving advertising. Results show that (1) occupancy is the most important factor for dormitory energy consumption; (2) reducing the time of air conditioner use has the largest impact on energy-saving; (3) reducing computer standby time has a great energy-saving potential; (4) students' attitude and awareness of energy conservation and the communication and exchange of energy information amongst students play an important role in energy saving. According to these results, the university can take measures to promote energy saving, which include strengthening education, establishing a energy saving championship system for dormitory energy consumption and implementing a reward-and-punishment mechanism.(C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI Agent-Based Analysis of Biomass Feedstock Production Dynamics
SO BIOENERGY RESEARCH
AB The success of the bioenergy sector based on lignocellulosic feedstock will require a sustainable and resilient transition from the current agricultural system focused on food crops to one also producing energy crops. The dynamics of this transition are not well understood. It will be driven significantly by the collective participation, behavior, and interaction of various stakeholders such as farmers within the production system. The objective of this work is to study the system dynamics through the development and application of an agent-based model using the theory of complex adaptive systems. Farmers and biorefinery, two key stakeholders in the system, are modeled as independent agents. The decision making of each agent as well as its interaction with other agents is modeled using a set of rules reflecting the economic, social, and personal attributes of the agent. These rules and model parameters are adapted from literature. Regulatory mechanisms such as Biomass Crop Assistance Program are embedded in the decision-making process. The model is then used to simulate the production of Miscanthus as an energy crop in Illinois. Particular focus has been given on understanding the dynamics of Miscanthus adaptation as an agricultural crop and its impact on biorefinery capacity and contractual agreements. Results showed that only 60% of the maximum regional production capacity could be reached, and it took up to 15 years to establish that capacity. A 25% reduction in the land opportunity cost led to a 63% increase in the steady- state productivity. Sensitivity analysis showed that higher initial conversion of land by farmers to grow energy crop led to faster growth in regional productivity.

TI Threatened species face similar types and numbers of threats as
   endangered species when listed under the Endangered Species Act
SO WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN
AB With species increasingly imperiled due to anthropogenic activities, conservation practitioners are tasked with determining conservation priorities to make the best use of limited resources. One way of setting priorities is to categorize species based on risk of extinction. The United States' Endangered Species Act (ESA) has two listing statuses into which imperiled species are placed to receive protections: threatened or endangered. Our objective was to identify differences between threatened and endangered (T&E) species beyond what is outlined in their ESA definitions. For 6 broad-resolution threats (habitat modification, overutilization, pollution, species-species interactions, environmental stochasticity, and demographic stochasticity), we investigated whether there is a difference in the number and types of threats which impacted T&E species at the time of their listing. We found that threatened (x = 2.9, SD = 1.4) and endangered (x = 3.0, SD = 1.1) species faced a similar number of threats at time of their listing. The only broad-resolution threat that impacted endangered species more than threatened species was demographic stochasticity, with endangered species being 2.1 times (95% CI = 1.5-2.8) more likely to be impacted than threatened species. We examined demographic stochasticity by breaking it down into finer-resolution threats to identify additional differences between T&E species. We found 4 finer-resolution demographic stochasticity threats (few individuals in one population, few individuals in multiple populations, lack of reproduction, and genetic loss) to be strong predictors of endangered status. The similarities in the number and types of broad-resolution threats faced by T&E species indicated that they are equally conservation reliant.

Development of the regional, Ponto-Caspian online information system on aquatic alien species is urgently needed, in view of the accelerating rates of introductions of harmful alien species in the region, severe impacts of these species on the environment, and associated economic losses. Such an information system should be developed using already available information technologies, in order to ensure its effective incorporation in a global invasive species information network.

TI Abrupt Fen-Bog Transition Across Southern Patagonia: Timing, Causes, and
   Impacts on Carbon Sequestration
SO FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB Fens and bogs are distinct in terms of their biogeochemistry, water table behavior, and net peat-accumulation regimes. While most peatlands start developing as fens, a large fraction of them eventually shift to bogs in a step-like ecosystem shift. This transition has traditionally been assumed to be primarily controlled by the ecosystem itself (autogenic control). Here we use 90 peat profiles from southernmost South America (SSA) as a case study that illustrates a synchronous, regional-scale shift from fen to bog around 4200 years ago. In light of these results, we propose and discuss conceptual models that link environmental change (allogenic control) as a trigger to the fen-bog transition (FBT). In addition, our stratigraphic analyses show thatSphagnumdeposits are associated with greater peat masses, larger soil-carbon stocks, and higher rates of peat-carbon accumulation than their non-Sphagnumcounterparts, withSphagnumbogs being characterized by soil-carbon densities over twice that of non-Sphagnumpeatlands (medians = 141 vs. 56 kgC/m(2)). Since fens and bogs also behave differently in terms of their carbon exchanges with the atmosphere, a better appraisal of the processes involved in the FBT could help elucidate the role of this critical ecosystem shift in the past and future global carbon cycle.

TI A distribution analysis of the central Maya lowlands ecoinformation
   network: its rises, falls, and changes
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB We report a study of central Maya lowland dynastic information networks, i.e., six cities' external elite ceramic influences, and how they reflect the decision-making practices of Maya elites over 3000 years. Forest cover, i.e., Moraceae family pollen, was added to the network analysis to provide ecological boundary conditions, thus ecologically moderated information networks. Principal components analysis revealed three dominant patterns. First, the networking of interior cities into powerful polities in the Late Preclassic and Classic periods (400 BCE-800 CE). In a second pattern, coastal cities emerged as key entrepots based on marine navigation (Terminal and Postclassic periods, 800-1500 CE). Climate dynamics and sustainability considerations facilitated the transition. Forest cover, a measure of ecosystem health, shows interior forests diminished as interior cities networked but rebounded as their networks declined. By contrast, coastal forests flourished with networks implying that the marine-based economy was sustainable. Third, in the Classic, the network-dominant coast, west or east, changed with interior polities' political struggles, the critical transition occurring after 695 CE as Tikal gained dominance over the Calakmul-Caracol alliance. Beginning with the Late Preclassic about 2000 years ago, it is possible to assign names to the decision makers by referencing the growing literature on written Maya records. Although the detectable decision sequence evident in this analysis is very basic, we believe it does open possible avenues to much deeper understanding as the study proceeds into the future. The Integrated History and Future of People on Earth-Maya working group that sponsored the analysis anticipates that it will provide actionable social science intelligence for future decision making at the global scale.

TI Integrating local ecological knowledge, citizen science and long-term
   historical data for endangered species conservation: Additional records
   of angel sharks (Chondrichthyes: Squatinidae) in the Mediterranean Sea
SO AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
AB All three species of angel sharks (genus Squatina) inhabiting the Mediterranean Sea are listed as Critically Endangered in the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species due to overexploitation. New records from Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Libya were collected from citizen-scientists and integrated with local knowledge obtained using structured interviews in the four countries. Observations and reports, together with an analysis of the reconstructed fisheries data, resulted in the identification of areas of interest, a review of the illegal trade of the species and a debate about the credibility of fisheries data for assessing threatened and/or protected species. Unconventional sources of information, such as social media, were identified as important tools for monitoring rare and endangered marine wildlife. This work will contribute to promoting international cooperation for advancing angel shark conservation in line with the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Angel Shark Conservation Strategy.

TI Plants of the Big Cypress National Preserve, Florida
SO JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY
AB A new survey of the Big Cypress National Preserve shows that the vascular flora consists of 145 families and 851 species. Of these, 72 are listed by the State of Florida as endangered or threatened plants, while many others are on the margins of their ranges. The survey also shows 158 species of exotic plants within the Preserve, some of which imperil native species by competing with them. Finally, we compare the flora of the Big Cypress National Preserve with those of the nearby Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve and the Everglades National Park. Although Big Cypress is less than half the size of Everglades National Park, it has 90% of the native species richness (693 vs. 772).

CL Melbourne, AUSTRALIA
AB Within Australia, excessive clearing of native vegetation has resulted in many landscapes becoming increasingly dysfunctional with respect to the retention of water and nutrients, and the maintenance of biodiversity. Natural Resource Management (NRM) groups are now engaging in 'on-ground activities' based upon their respective regional plans to address many of the issues that have arisen from the inappropriate or excessive removal of native vegetation across the landscape. From a land manager's perspective, the performance of alternative landscape designs that incorporate native vegetation as a key functional component to address processes that aid soil structure and stability, fertility, and water available for plant growth. Catchment managers must deliver considerable improvements in soil erosion, riparian vegetation condition, water quality, and environmental flows. The multiple functions of native vegetation and their affects upon hydrology throughout the landscape over time are termed ecohydrology in this paper.
   Under varying management and seasonal influences, differing amounts and spatial configurations of native vegetation and other land covers, can result in numerous possible feedbacks to local microclimates. This subsequently affects the flows of water, nutrients, and sediments across the landscape. Landscape designs that use native vegetation or other vegetative covers to improve ecohydrological functioning within production landscapes, must equally address environmental, economic, and social values. This should be considered across a continuum of spatial scales and through time. This is of particular importance in the face of climate change.
   The reciprocal feedbacks between physical and biophysical processes as well as the multitude of human land use modifications to these systems, results in bottom-up, non-linear, complex adaptive landscapes. Such incessant adaptations within and between landscape components and their supporting systems may result in landscapes residing in one of a number of multiple quasi-stable states which depends upon historical conditions and current positive and negative feedback mechanisms between components. The use of historical data to infer likely future responses may therefore, lead to erroneous inferences. Complex adaptive systems offers a means by which landscape complexity can be reduced to common component types, and their possible states, via feedback mechanisms captured in a much simplified form.
   The paradigm of complex adaptive systems also lends itself to comparable modelling approaches that utilise bottom-up organisation based upon simple rules and a large number of components. One such example introduced in this paper is agent based models. This method develops a coupled simulation model that integrates an agent rule based optimization process with the outputs from
   ANSWERS-2000 (Dillaha et al. 1998). ANSWER-2000 is a distributed parameter hydrological process model that generates both climatic inputs in the form of variable frequencies, durations, and intensities of precipitation, as well as probable runoffs of water, nutrients, and sediments from various land cover types. Using the output files generated at each iteration as inputs into the agent based model, numerous possible configurations of land cover types are tested in order to find optimised soil and water outputs across the landscape.
   Farmer expert knowledge is used to generate the initial rule set, while successive iterations alter the rules to find possible alternatives that may lead to designs for rehabilitating dysfunctional catchments. The focus is on understanding which parts of the landscape native vegetation provides a key role in regulating ecohydrological functions, and which configurations may lead to more sustainable production outcomes.

TI Opportunities and obstacles to socioecosystem-based environmental policy
   in Mexico: expert opinion at the science-policy interface
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB The urgent need to revert the ecological and social equity crises of the current development model and realize the potential of sustainable development has led several disciplines to converge on the socioecosystem concept as the most appropriate theoretical framework for research and public policy. The socioecosystem approach recognizes that social systems are integrated with natural systems and seeks to adaptively comanage socioecosystem coevolution for the sustainable development of both systems. We hypothesize that incorporation of this approach into environmental policy in Mexico could help resolve many of the problems that currently undermine policy effectiveness. To find out to what extent policy professionals might concur with this hypothesis, and what the opportunities and obstacles to implementing socioecosystem-based policy might be, research was conducted to elicit the expert opinion of officials responsible for formulating and implementing environmental policy in Mexico. The principle opportunities consist in the fact that experts intuitively understand the socioecosystem approach, and that most perceive advantages in adopting it because its policy attributes can potentially help to resolve many of the factors they identify as limiting the success of current environmental policies. Obstacles to its adoption include institutional barriers and the vested interests that benefit from the status quo.

TI Degradation and Recovery in Changing Forest Landscapes: A Multiscale
   Conceptual Framework
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES, VOL 42
SE Annual Review of Environment and Resources
AB Conceptual confusion revolves around how to define, assess, and overcome land, ecosystem, and landscape degradation. Common elements link degradation and recovery processes, offering ways to advance local, regional, and global initiatives to reduce degradation and promote the recovery of ecosystems and landscapes in forest biomes. Biophysical attributes of degradation and recovery can be measured, but the relevance of selected attributes across scales is subject to values that determine preferred states. Degradation defined in the context of a resilience-based approach is a state where the capacity for regeneration is greatly reduced or lost, recovery is arrested, core interactions and feedbacks are broken, and human intervention is required to initiate a trajectory of recovery. Another approach combines degradation and recovery processes through the concept of recovery debt, the cumulative lost benefits incurred, relative to a target state during phases of degradation and recovery. Degradation and recovery can also be described in terms of societal willingness to invest in improved management or restoration. Interventions can facilitate recovery to new stable or persistent states that provide multiple social and ecological benefits at land, ecosystem, and landscape scales. Multiple trajectories of recovery, as well as historic and ongoing chronic environmental change, might, however, mean that recovery to an original reference state is not possible.

TI An agent-based model for assessing grazing strategies and institutional
   arrangements in Zeku, China
SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB The assessment of grassland grazing strategies and institutional arrangements is essential for ensuring the sustainable development of grassland grazing systems. By employing per-pixel grazing information derived from remote sensing data, this paper presents an agent-based model of grassland grazing (ABMGG) for Zeku, China that was designed as a framework for assessing the effects of different combinations of grazing strategies and institutional arrangements on grassland status. By calibrating the parameter values of the ABMGG to the system status values under a policy that has already been implemented, the ABMGG can help us to understand grassland degradation in response to management interventions for each patch of land. In the Zeku implementation, it was found that although different grazing policy scenarios could not significantly improve or decrease the overall grassland leaf area index, a rotational group grazing scenario with a land market tenure system did produce a smaller number of severely degraded grass patches than other policy scenarios (except regional continuous grazing). This provides a new perspective on the consequences of grassland management practices where past research has concentrated more on overall grassland productivity. The ABMGG can extend the ability of policy assessment tools to a high resolution level with pixel-specific real-time remote sensing data, making the assessment results more accurate and representative.

TI Patterns of temporal community turnover are spatially synchronous across
   boreal lakes
SO FRESHWATER BIOLOGY
AB 1. Ecosystems are often exposed to broad-scale environmental change, which can potentially synchronise community dynamics and biodiversity trends. Detection of temporal coherence may, however, depend on the metrics used and their sensitivity to detect change, requiring several lines of evidence to elucidate the full range of temporal responses to environmental change. 2. Here, we tested whether the patterns of synchrony among littoral invertebrate communities of Swedish lakes over 20 years (19882007) differed when analysed using univariate (taxon richness, evenness, Shannon diversity and total abundance) or multivariate (temporal turnover in community composition) metrics. We included both culturally acidified and circumneutral lakes to examine whether anthropogenic stress influenced the patterns of synchrony. 3. Average total abundance, taxon richness and temporal turnover in community composition changed monotonically with time, while evenness and Shannon diversity fluctuated around a long-term mean. However, among-lake variability was high, resulting in a weak temporal coherence. Only trends of temporal turnover changed synchronously across lakes, irrespective of their acidification history. 4. Spatially synchronous trends in turnover across lakes were correlated with increasing water colour and decreasing sulphate concentrations, showing the importance of regional drivers of spatiotemporal coherence. 5. Our results underpin an increasing body of evidence that the detection of diversity patterns varies among metrics that ignore (taxon richness, evenness, Shannon diversity) or consider (turnover) species identities. More generally, our results suggest that community-level studies of synchrony are suitable for elucidating the role of intrinsic versus extrinsic factors in mediating complex community assembly processes in the long term. This, in turn, contributes to our understanding of temporal patterns of biodiversity.

TI Challenges of operations research practice in agricultural value chains
SO JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY
AB Operations research (OR) methodologies in optimization have been extensively applied to problems in different agricultural value chains in recent years. We take a critical stock take of such applications to date, and reflect on their contribution to value chain sustainability and resilience. The stock take shows that the rate of industry or policy adoption has been limited, partly due to the complex interactions across the segments of agricultural value chains, and the mathematical representation being different to the way the decision maker understands the problem. OR practice in agriculture is also being asked to cover greater spatial scales and engage more stakeholders, and is required to embrace resilience and sustainability objectives. A single-minded focus on optimizing parts of these complex systems without considering the whole system is no longer adequate, and new methods and approaches are required. Complex systems science methods are being applied to analyse the dynamics of complex social-ecological systems, and are starting to find a home in industrial supply chain analysis. We demonstrate how three complex system methods, agent-based modelling, dynamical systems modelling and network analysis, can be applied to agricultural value chains as a means of gaining insights into system dynamics under different and dynamic conditions. The relevance and utility of OR in ensuring the success of agricultural value chains into the future will require practitioners to understand and model value chains as complex adaptive systems.

TI Ecological Viability or Liability? Insurance System Responses to Climate
   Risk
SO ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNANCE
AB Climate change is a phenomenon of the Earth system, which is characterized by thresholds and non-linear change. This analysis considers the adequacy of insurance (in its broadest sense) responses to climate risk. This paper provides novel critiques of insurance system responses to climate change and of the attendant political economy perspective on the relationship between insurance and climate change. A complex adaptive systems (CAS) analysis suggests that ecologically effective (i.e. strong) mitigation is the only viable approach to manage medium-and long-term climate risk - for the insurance system itself and for human societies more widely. In contrast, we find that even the most substantial insurance system responses to date are generally adaptive and weakly mitigative. This analysis extends an earlier political economy perspective that explains the limitations of insurance system responses to climate change, but provides little guidance to the ecological implications of such responses. As such, this paper raises questions about the ongoing viability of the insurance system, and hence about the many aspects of human societies globally reliant on the insurance system as their primary risk governance tool. We conclude that the CAS approach provides new insights, which could prompt insurance system evolution in support of effective climate risk governance.

TI Restricted geographic distribution of tree species calls for urgent
   conservation efforts in the Subtropical Atlantic Forest
SO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB The Atlantic Forest encompasses a high level of biodiversity, endemism and degradation; hence, it is a biome of particular interest for biological conservation. We aimed to investigate the actual geographic distribution of tree species and, among the indicator species of each vegetation type, the conservation status and potential distribution of each species along a vegetation gradient of the Subtropical Atlantic Forest. We analysed the species' relative constancy to determine their actual distribution, obtained 21 indicator species of the different vegetation types and modelled their potential distribution using the maximum entropy algorithm. The potential distribution models were pooled to yield a single map, which was used to predict the distribution of climatic suitability for these species in South America. Our results showed that the actual geographic distribution is restricted for most species (similar to 72 %). Araucaria angustifolia and Euterpe edulis were categorized as threatened species. The sum of the indicator-species maps showed reduced climatic suitability across most of South America. The southern region of Brazil and the southeastern Brazilian highlands, as well as a few areas of seasonal forests on higher elevations of the Bolivian Chiquitania and Andean Piedmont, exhibited the best climatic suitability. Elevation was the most important variable in our models. Given the concerning level of forest degradation and the presence of endangered and geographic restricted species, our results are a relevant contribution to biodiversity conservation in the Subtropical Atlantic Forest areas, highlighting their floristic and environmental uniqueness and, therefore, the urgent necessity of preserving their biological heritage.

SO REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ORNITOLOGIA
AB Annotated checklist of birds recorded between 1998 and 2009 at nine areas in the Belem area of endemism, with notes on some range extensions and the conservation status of endangered species. The Belem center of endemism is one of the best known areas in Amazonia from an ornithological standpoint, in part due to the fact that the capital city of the state of Para is included within its limits. However, the expansion of agribusiness and logging has currently made this the most deforested sector of Amazonia, with only a few large and well-preserved forest tracts. Here we present novel data on the avifauna of this part of Amazonia by reporting on field data collected by us between 1998 and 2009 at some localities in the municipalities of Capitao Poco, Dom Eliseu, Paragominas, Santa Barbara do Para, Tailandia, and Tome-Acu; all situated in the Belem center of endemism. In addition to contributing to the ornithological knowledge of this part of Amazonia, we also sought to evaluate the current conservation status of several threatened species found in the area. Our surveys recorded a total of 441 species, a significant number when compared to the total avian species richness reported so far for the Belem center of endemism (i.e., 529 species). This has indicated that the largest and more connected fragments of Paragominas, Tailandia, and Tome-Acu have the highest species richness, including 14 endangered species/taxa, which is the highest number recorded so far in the entire Amazon. The fact that those fragments of land are owned by companies linked to the timber and biofuel industries demonstrates the importance and responsibility of these economic sectors to biodiversity conservation in the Amazon.

TI The Case of Lionfish (Pterois miles) in the Mediterranean Sea
   Demonstrates Limitations in EU Legislation to Address Marine Biological
   Invasions
SO JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB The European Regulation (EU) 1143/2014 on Invasive Alien Species entered into force in 2015, with the aim to fulfill regional and international biodiversity goals in a concerted manner. To date, the Regulation listed 66 Invasive Alien Species (IAS) that are subject to legal controls. Only one of these is marine. A recent lionfish (Pterois miles) invasion has been closely monitored in the Mediterranean and a detailed risk assessment was made about the profound impacts that this invasive fish is likely to have on the fisheries and biodiversity of the region. In 2016-21, lionfish rapidly became dominant predators along Eastern Mediterranean coasts, yet the process for their inclusion on the EU IAS list has been lengthy and is ongoing. There is an urgent need to learn from this experience. Here, we recommend improvements to the Regulation 1143/2014 and the risk assessment process to protect marine ecosystems and secure the jobs of people that rely on coastal resources.

TI Groundwater as a social-ecological system: A framework for managing
   groundwater in Pacific Small Island Developing States
SO GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Groundwater in Pacific Small Island Developing States is a critical source of freshwater for island ecosystems and human communities. Groundwater systems face challenges from growing populations, climate change and climate variability. Many groundwater systems in the region have been inappropriately managed, with increasing occurrences of groundwater pollution and saltwater intrusion. This limits the availability of freshwater, increases the likelihood of contracting water borne diseases, and the cost of access to alternative freshwater sources. In this paper, we argue that groundwater systems are social-ecological systems, where anthropogenic activities and groundwater conditions are linked through dynamic, non-linear processes. We also argue that groundwater management failures in the region, are associated with traditional command and control approaches to management, which ignore the systemic nature of coupled social and ecological groundwater systems; and assumes that groundwater resources, and the dependant human communities can be managed independently. Recognising the linkages and feedbacks between groundwater and dependant social communities is important for the long-term sustainability of groundwater in these regions. Conceptual frameworks are useful tools to order phenomena and material, revealing patterns and processes, and enabling the joining of multiple areas of understanding into a single conceptual-empirical structure. We propose a framework to manage groundwater as a social-ecological system. The framework is comprised of three building blocks: complex adaptive systems, resilience thinking and strategic adaptive management. We discuss how the application of the framework in the Republic of Nauru may alter decades of groundwater mismanagement and steer the resource towards a sustainable path.

TI Knowledge, perceptions and willingness to control designated invasive
   tree species in urban household gardens in South Africa
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB Many biological invasions result in negative impacts on the environment and human livelihoods, but simultaneously some also provide benefits that are valued differently by various stakeholders. To inform policy and management of invasive species it is important to assess landowners' and broader society's knowledge and perceptions of invasive species, something which is lacking in many contexts, especially in urban settings. In this study we interviewed 153 householders living in a medium-sized South African town who had declared invasive alien trees in their gardens. Less than half of the respondents could identify the invasive tree on their property and only one-third knew that it was an invasive alien species. There was a positive association between income and education levels with exposure to media about invasive alien species and respondents' ability to identify the species and name any other invasive alien tree species. Knowledge levels were unequal across species. Amongst those who knew the tree was an invasive alien species, reasons why they retained it in their gardens included that it would be costly or too much effort to remove, they liked the tree, that it was not causing any harm and that the property was rented and so its removal was not their responsibility. However, the majority of people (83 %) were willing to have it removed from their garden if done for free by appropriate agencies, which is promising for compliance with new regulations on invasive species implemented at the end of 2014 in South Africa. The results also highlight the need for targeted and appropriate education and awareness programs amongst urban householders on invasive alien species, relevant legislation and their obligations.

TI Simulating multiple class urban land-use/cover changes by RBFN-based CA
   model
SO COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
AB Land use systems are complex adaptive systems, and they are characterized by emergence, nonlinearity, feedbacks, self organization, path dependence, adaptation, and multiple-scale characteristics. Land use/cover change has been recognized as one of the major drivers of global environmental change. This paper presents a coupled Cellular Automata (CA) and Radial Basis Function Neural (RBFN) Network model, which combines Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to contribute to the understanding of the complex land use/cover change process. In this model. GIS analysis is used to generate spatial drivers of land use/cover changes, and RBFN is trained to extract model parameters. Through the RBFN-CA model, the conversion probabilities of each cell from its initial land use state to the target type can be generated automatically. Future land use/cover scenarios are projected by using generated parameters in the model training process. This RBFN-CA model is tested based on the comparison of model output and the real data. A BPN-CA model is also built and compared with the RBFN-CA model by using a variety of calibration metrics, including confusion matrix, figure of merit, and landscape metrics. Both the location and landscape metrics based assessment for model simulation indicate that the RBFN-CA model performs better than the BPN-CA model for simulating land use changes in the study area. Therefore the RBFN-CA model is capable of simulating multiple classes of land use/cover changes and can be used as a useful communication environment for stakeholders involved in land use decision-making.

TI HEADCOUNT 2010: THE MULTIPLICATION OF THE GREY SQUIRREL INTRODUCED IN
   ITALY
SO HYSTRIX-ITALIAN JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY
AB The introduction of non-native animal species is an important cause of loss of biodiversity. Tree squirrels as a taxon and grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) in particular are among the most successful invasive alien species. Here we present the current situation (October 2010) of the grey squirrel in Italy. The grey squirrel was first reported in Piedmont in 1948. Subsequent major introductions were reported in Genova-Nervi (1966) and the Ticino Valley Regional Park in Lombardy (1999). In 2010, there were 24 areas with a (meta) population or nucleus of grey squirrels: 23 of these were in the three regions most affected by the invasive species Piedmont, Lombardy and Liguria. The number of known areas with grey squirrel presence has strongly increased in the last years. With the exception of the Genova-Nervi population, there is a lack of detailed knowledge on grey squirrel distribution and population size in areas where animals are now known or believed to be present. We underline the need for the immediate ban of squirrel trade and control or eradication actions.

TI Using Complexity and Network Concepts to Inform Healthcare Knowledge
   Translation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT
AB Many representations of the movement of healthcare knowledge through society exist, and multiple models for the translation of evidence into policy and practice have been articulated. Most are linear or cyclical and very few come close to reflecting the dense and intricate relationships, systems and politics of organizations and the processes required to enact sustainable improvements. We illustrate how using complexity and network concepts can better inform knowledge translation (KT) and argue that changing the way we think and talk about KT could enhance the creation and movement of knowledge throughout those systems needing to develop and utilise it. From our theoretical refinement, we propose that KT is a complex network composed of five interdependent sub-networks, or clusters, of key processes (problem identification [PI], knowledge creation [KC], knowledge synthesis [KS],implementation [I], and evaluation [E]) that interact dynamically in different ways at different times across one or more sectors (community; health; government; education; research for example). We call this the KT Complexity Network, defined as a network that optimises the effective, appropriate and timely creation and movement of knowledge to those who need it in order to improve what they do. Activation within and throughout any one of these processes and systems depends upon the agents promoting the change, successfully working across and between multiple systems and clusters. The case is presented for moving to a way of thinking about KT using complexity and network concepts. This extends the thinking that is developing around integrated KT approaches. There are a number of policy and practice implications that need to be considered in light of this shift in thinking.

TI Analysis of Food Hub Commerce and Participation Using Agent-Based
   Modeling: Integrating Financial and Social Drivers
SO HUMAN FACTORS
AB Objective: Factors influencing long-term viability of an intermediated regional food supply network (food hub) were modeled using agent-based modeling techniques informed by interview data gathered from food hub participants.
   Background: Previous analyses of food hub dynamics focused primarily on financial drivers rather than social factors and have not used mathematical models.
   Method: Based on qualitative and quantitative data gathered from 22 customers and 11 vendors at a midwestern food hub, an agent-based model (ABM) was created with distinct consumer personas characterizing the range of consumer priorities. A comparison study determined if the ABM behaved differently than a model based on traditional economic assumptions. Further simulation studies assessed the effect of changes in parameters, such as producer reliability and the consumer profiles, on long-term food hub sustainability.
   Results: The persona-based ABM model produced different and more resilient results than the more traditional way of modeling consumers. Reduced producer reliability significantly reduced trade; in some instances, a modest reduction in reliability threatened the sustainability of the system. Finally, a modest increase in price-driven consumers at the outset of the simulation quickly resulted in those consumers becoming a majority of the overall customer base.
   Conclusion: Results suggest that social factors, such as desire to support the community, can be more important than financial factors.
   Application: An ABM of food hub dynamics, based on human factors data gathered from the field, can be a useful tool for policy decisions. Similar approaches can be used for modeling customer dynamics with other sustainable organizations.

TI Evolutionary macroeconomics: a research agenda
SO JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY ECONOMICS
AB In this article, the goal is to offer a new research agenda for evolutionary macroeconomics. The article commences with a broad review of the main ideas in the history of thought concerning the determinants of economic growth and an introduction to the evolutionary perspective. This is followed by a selective review of recent evolutionary approaches to macroeconomics. These approaches are found to be somewhat disconnected. It is argued that the 'micro-meso-macro' approach to economic evolution is capable of resolving this problem by offering an analytical framework in which macroeconomics can be built upon 'meso-foundations', not micro-foundations, as asserted in the mainstream. It is also stressed that the economic system and its components are complex adaptive systems and that this complexity must not be assumed away through the imposition of simplistic assumptions made for analytical convenience. It is explained that complex economic systems are, at base, energetic in character but differ from biological complex systems in the way that they collect, store and apply knowledge. It is argued that a focus upon stocks and flows of energy and knowledge in complex economic systems can yield an appropriate analytical framework for macroeconomics. It is explained how such a framework can be connected with key insights of both Schumpeter and Keynes that have been eliminated in modern macroeconomics. A macroeconomic framework that cannot be operationalized empirically is of limited usefulness so, in the last part of the article, an appropriate methodology for evolutionary macroeconomics is discussed.

TI The threats endangering Australia's at-risk fauna
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB Reducing the rate of species extinctions is one of the great challenges of our time. Understanding patterns in the distribution and frequency of both threatened species and the threatening processes affecting them improves our ability to mitigate threats and prioritize management actions. In this quantitative synthesis of processes threatening Australian at-risk fauna, we find that species are impacted by a median of six threats (range 1-19), though there is considerable variation in numbers of threats among major taxonomic groups. Invasive species, habitat loss, biological resource use, natural systems modification and climate change are the processes most commonly affecting Australian threatened species. We identified an uneven distribution of research knowledge among species, with half of the total number of species-specific peer-reviewed scientific publications associated with only 11 threatened species (2.7%). Furthermore, the number of threats associated with each species was correlated with the research effort for that species, and research effort was correlated with body mass. Hence, there appears to be a research bias towards larger-bodied species, and certain charismatic species, that could result in inferences biased towards these favored species. However, after accounting for these effects we found that for birds, amphibians, reptiles and marine mammals body mass is positively correlated with the number of threats associated with each species. Many threats also co-occur, indicating that threat syndromes may be common.

TI Construction of computer model for enterprise green innovation by
   PSO-BPNN algorithm and its impact on economic performance
SO PLOS ONE
AB The present work aims to analyze the elements that affect corporate green technology innovation and investigate a method suitable for predicting and evaluating corporate performance. First, the elements of green technology innovation and their relationships are analyzed and explained. Then, the Complex Adaptive System (CAS) theory is introduced. On this basis, a computer model for the driving mechanism system of corporate green technology innovation is constructed on the Recursive Porus Agent Simulation (Repast) platform. Finally, the Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) model is optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), constituting the PSO-BPNN algorithm to evaluate corporate performance. The results of network training and simulation demonstrate that compared with traditional BPNN, PSO-BPNN achieve a faster convergence speed and fewer errors. Besides, the actual output value has a tiny difference from the expected value, showing the application potential of this algorithm in corporate performance prediction. Moreover, the driving factors of green technology innovation greatly affect the profitability and performance of enterprises. Given insufficient corporate profit margin, continuous technological innovation activities can ensure the normal operation of enterprises. A smaller corporate tax rate can shorten the time for the system to reach equilibrium. When the corporate tax rate is above 0.2, the system takes longer to reach equilibrium. In addition, the public opinion coefficient directly affects the time needed for the system to attain equilibrium. When the public opinion coefficient is within 50,00 ~ 6,000 interval, the time that the system takes to reach equilibrium changes significantly. Furthermore, corporate internal and external driving factors have a direct effect on corporate green technology innovation and performance. The research findings indicate that the PSO-BPNN algorithm is of vital practical value to corporate performance evaluation.

Using the principles of adaptive governance, evolved from institutional theory, we explore how the concepts of lateral information flows, incentive alignment, and policy experimentation might shape Australia's invasive species defense mechanisms. We suggest design principles for biosecurity policies emphasizing overlapping complementary response capabilities and the sharing of invasive species risks via a polycentric system of governance.

TI Anthropogenic factors predict movement of an invasive species
SO ECOSPHERE
AB Humans are playing an increasingly large role in the expansion of invasive species' distributions, but few (if any) studies have evaluated anthropogenic factors associated with intentional translocation of invasives. The wild pig (Sus scrofa) is an extremely destructive and rapidly expanding invasive species whose movement is thought to be facilitated by humans. We sought to (1) identify a suite of genetic markers that can be applied to population genetic analyses of wild pigs, (2) find quantitative evidence of human-mediated dispersal of wild pigs, and (3) determine which anthropogenic factors were associated with their translocation. We identified 43 polymorphic microsatellite loci and employed population genetic analyses to evaluate population structure and movement of wild pigs among populations in California, USA. Hierarchical Bayesian models were used to evaluate the influence of anthropogenic covariates on wild pig movement, and to predict migration risk. Natural dispersal of wild pigs among populations was low, as indicated by a large number of genetic clusters (K = 21), significant population differentiation, and low rates of recent migration. This suggests that the observed movement resulted from human-mediated translocation. Movement of pigs was positively predicted by the number of domestic pig farms, the number of captive game hunting farms, the amount of public land, the number of wild pigs harvested by hunters, and the number of game outfitters. While hunting has been hypothesized to play a role in wild pig movement, our study is the first to provide quantitative evidence of such a relationship. We argue that future efforts to manage invasive species must consider the potential role of humans in their dispersal.

TI Future Directions in Conservation Research on Petrels and Shearwaters
SO FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB Shearwaters and petrels (hereafter petrels) are highly adapted seabirds that occur across all the world's oceans. Petrels are a threatened seabird group comprising 124 species. They have bet-hedging life histories typified by extended chick rearing periods, low fecundity, high adult survival, strong philopatry, monogamy and long-term mate fidelity and are thus vulnerable to change. Anthropogenic alterations on land and at sea have led to a poor conservation status of many petrels with 52 (42%) threatened species based on IUCN criteria and 65 (52%) suffering population declines. Some species are well-studied, even being used as bioindicators of ocean health, yet for others there are major knowledge gaps regarding their breeding grounds, migratory areas or other key aspects of their biology and ecology. We assembled 38 petrel conservation researchers to summarize information regarding the most important threats according to the IUCN Red List of threatened species to identify knowledge gaps that must be filled to improve conservation and management of petrels. We highlight research advances on the main threats for petrels (invasive species at breeding grounds, bycatch, overfishing, light pollution, climate change, and pollution). We propose an ambitious goal to reverse at least some of these six main threats, through active efforts such as restoring island habitats (e.g., invasive species removal, control and prevention), improving policies and regulations at global and regional levels, and engaging local communities in conservation efforts.

AB Suppliers are a potential source of innovation through knowledge sharing and creation. By making full use of knowledge sharing and creation organizations can generate sustainable advantage through innovation. This research studies the role of procurement management in enabling innovation throughout the supply chain, identifying best knowledge practices and possibilities. The primary question asks: What knowledge based practices successfully facilitate innovation in supply chains. The secondary question asks: Are there regional differences in the use of these knowledge based practices between Europe, North America and Asia? This research addresses the use of knowledge based practices to successfully facilitate innovation from in the supply chain, identifying and capturing these practices, and investigates regional differences in the use of these knowledge based practices. The overlap between knowledge processes facilitating knowledge sharing and knowledge based practices enabling innovation is also explored. The importance of knowledge based innovation on cost optimization (research shows businesses spend two thirds of revenue on non-labour costs), risk management (floods, tsunamis and horsemeat scandals have all recently demonstrated supply chain risk), and new product and service offerings development to the organization, are also explored. This study is important to any organization that has a need to acquire goods and services, or outsources operations. It is important for those involved in procurement and supply chain management to have insights into the knowledge based practices that help an organization share and create knowledge with suppliers that can generate value both for the organization, its suppliers and customers.

TI Prevention of childhood obesity and food policies in Latin America: from
   research to practice
SO OBESITY REVIEWS
AB Background: Addressing childhood obesity in Latin America requires a package of multisectoral, evidence-based policies that enable environments conducive to healthy lifestyles.
   Objective: Identify and examine key elements to translating research into effective obesity policies in Latin America.
   Methods: We examined obesity prevention policies through case studies developed with an expert in the specific policy. Policies were selected based on their level of implementation, visibility and potential impact to reduce childhood obesity. They include: (i) excise taxes on sugar sweetened beverages and energy-dense foods; (ii) front-of-package food label legislation; (iii) trans fatty acids removal from processed foods; and (iv) Ciclovias recreativas or 'open streets'. Case studies were coded to identify components that explained successful implementation and sustainability using the Complex Adaptive Health Systems framework.
   Results: The analysis identified key elements for effective and sustainable policy, including evidence justifying policy; evidence-based advocacy by civil society; political will; and legislation and skillful negotiations across government, academia, the private sector and civil society. Scientific evidence and evaluation played an important role in achieving tipping points for policies' launch and sustain effective implementation.
   Conclusions: Well-coordinated, intersectoral partnerships are needed to successfully implement evidence-based anti-obesity policies. Prospective policy research may be useful for advancing knowledge translation.

TI Conceptualizing a circular framework of supply chain resource
   sustainability
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose - In response to calls for conceptual frameworks and generic theory building toward the advancement of sustainability in supply chain resource utilization and management, the purpose of this paper is to advance a circular framework for supply chain resource sustainability (SCRS), and a decision-support methodology for assessing SCRS against the backdrop of five foundational premises (FPs) deduced from the literature on resource sustainability.
   Design/methodology/approach - Taking a conceptual theory-building approach, the paper advances a set of SCRS decision-support criteria for each of the theoretical premises advanced, and applies the theory of constraints to illustrate the conceptual and practical applications of the framework in SCRS decision making.
   Findings - This study uses recent conceptualizations of supply chains as "complex adaptive systems" to provide a robust and novel frame and a set of decision rules with which to assess the interconnectedness of environmental, economic, and social capital of supply chain resources from pre-production to post-production.
   Research limitations/implications - The paper contributes to theory building in sustainability research, and the SCRS decision framework developed could be applied in tandem with existing quantitative hybrid life-cycle and input-output approaches to facilitate targeted resource sustainability assessments, with implications for research and practice.
   Originality/value - The novel SCRS framework proposed serves as a template for evaluating SCRS and provides a decision-support methodology for assessing SCRS against the five theorized FPs.

SO CONSERVATION GENETICS RESOURCES
AB Artamus cinereus (Passeriformes: Artamidae) is a vocal and conspicuous bird listed on the IUCN Red List because of deforestation and habitat degradation. Thus, it is necessary for us to take effective measures to protect this endangered species. Molecular biology research will provide the scientific basis for the conservation of the threatened species. Here, we first report the complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequence of A. cinereus via Illumina sequencing. The complete mitogenome was 16,896 bp in length and the GC content is 44.4%. In addition, the complete mitogenome contained 22 transfer RNA genes, 13 protein coding genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, and one non-coding control region (D-loop). The newly assembled mitogenome sequence will be valuable for conservation biology and biodiversity studies of this threatened species.

TI Red-listed lichens in Sweden: habitats, threats, protection, and
   indicator value in boreal coniferous forests
SO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB The three major threats to lichens in Sweden; forestry, air pollution, and structural changes in the agricultural landscape, are outlined. Forestry is the most serious. The majority of the red-listed lichens in forests are found in productive forests with a continuity in tree growth, but nearly 70% of the protected area in Sweden consists of alpine landscapes. Examples of important habitats with red-listed lichens are described, e.g. Alnus glutinosa marshes, alvar-vegetation, broad-leaved deciduous forests and different Picea abies forests. The use of selected indicator species of lichens and microfungi (mainly red-listed species) in boreal coniferous forests provides information on continuity in tree growth of an area, and on earlier influences of forestry. Examples of indicator species for different types of forest are presented and discussed. In spite of the Swedish 'right of common access', collecting of lichens is forbidden without permission from the land-owner. Collecting in protected areas is allowed only with a permit obtained from the authorities.

TI Stress in biological invasions: Introduced invasive grey squirrels
   increase physiological stress in native Eurasian red squirrels
SO JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY
AB Invasive alien species can cause extinction of native species through processes including predation, interspecific competition for resources or disease-mediated competition. Increases in stress hormones in vertebrates may be associated with these processes and contribute to the decline in survival or reproduction of the native species. Eurasian red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) have gone extinct across much of the British Isles and parts of Northern Italy following the introduction of North American invasive grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis). We extracted glucocorticoid metabolites from faecal samples to measure whether the presence of the invasive species causes an increase in physiological stress in individuals of the native species. We show that native red squirrels in seven sites where they co-occurred with invasive grey squirrels had glucocorticoid concentrations that were three times higher than those in five sites without the invasive species. Moreover, in a longitudinal study, stress hormones in native red squirrels increased after colonisation by grey squirrels. When we experimentally reduced the abundance of the invasive grey squirrels, the concentration of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites in co-occurring red squirrels decreased significantly between pre- and postremoval periods. Hence, we found that the invasive species acts as a stressor which significantly increases the concentrations of glucocorticoids in the native species. Given that sustained elevations in glucocorticoids could reduce body growth and reproductive rate, our results are consistent with previous studies where the co-occurrence of the invasive grey squirrel was associated with smaller size and lower reproductive output in red squirrels.

TI A New Approach to Conservation of the Mojave Desert Tortoise
SO BIOSCIENCE
AB The Mojave desert tortoise was listed as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act (ESA) because of local population declines and an array of threats. Challenges to the recovery of this species include an incomplete understanding of the threats most responsible for its decline, insufficient information on the effectiveness of management actions, and the intractability of threats across a large geographical range and multiple jurisdictions. Recognition that these challenges require long-term conservation efforts to ensure the species' persistence with or without the protections of the ESA-necessitates a more structured approach to recovery, including broad stakeholder participation. A conservation-reliant perspective will probably be increasingly relevant for additional species and for adapting land management in the face of climate change by improving regional coordination of management activities, broadening spatial and temporal points of view in management and increasing the emphasis on addressing multiple threats simultaneously.

TI Conservation status of the forest beetles (Insecta, Coleoptera) from
   Azores, Portugal
SO BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL
AB Background
   Island biodiversity is under considerable pressure due to the ongoing threats of invasive alien species, land use change or climate change. The few remnants of Azorean native forests harbour a unique set of endemic beetles, some of them possibly already extinct or under severe long term threat due to the small areas of the remaining habitats or climatic changes. In this contribution we present the IUCN Red List profiles of 54 forest adapted beetle species endemic to the Azorean archipelago, including species belonging to four speciose families: Zopheridae (12 species), Carabidae (11 species), Curculionidae (11 species) and Staphylinidae (10 species).
   New information
   Most species have a restricted distribution (i.e. 66% occur in only one island) and a very small extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO). Also common to most of the species is the severe fragmentation of their populations, and a continuing decline in EOO, AOO, habitat quality, number of locations and subpopulations caused by the ongoing threat from pasture intensification, forestry, invasive species and future climatic changes. Therefore, we suggest as future measures of conservation: (1) a long-term monitoring plan for the species; (2) control of invasive species; (3) species-specific conservation action for the most highly threatened species.

TI Intersecting security, equity, and sustainability for transformation in
   the Anthropocene
SO ANTHROPOCENE
AB Transformative rather than incremental adaptation will be necessary to keep pace with rapidly changing socialecological systems characteristic of the Anthropocene. Alongside mounting urgency for transformative adaptation, there is also growing recognition that it is no longer possible to achieve sustainable transformation without also addressing security and equity concerns. Thus, dimensions of security, equity, and sustainability (SES) are increasingly intersected in transformation research and practice. However, interpretations of SES dimensions and their intersections vary widely across disciplines, policy sectors, and problem domains, and knowledge of SES intersections is fragmented. To navigate this vast body of knowledge, a conceptual framework is presented that: 1) integrates a set of guiding critical questions for defining and assessing different framings for each SES dimension; 2) identifies modes of theorizing SES intersections; and 3) relates the previous two elements to leverage points targeted, either theoretically or in practice, for transformative change. Nine prominent integrated concepts and associated case studies were identified that explicitly addressed intersections among all SES dimensions. Integrated concepts addressed a diversity of leverage points, but only two mixed epistemological and methodological approaches sufficiently to provide explanatory insight into SES intersections while also supporting science-based change-making. Potential risks of ambiguity around SES framings and needs for addressing SES intersections in future transformation research are highlighted. Optimistically, transformation scholarship has moved beyond simply stating the importance of SES dimensions to focusing on the causal interactions among SES dimensions, which is leading to compelling new blends of explanatory and action-oriented paradigms to pursue transformation.

TI Cellular Automata Modeling Framework for Urban Water Reuse Planning and
   Management
SO JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB Water reuse provides a sustainable approach to balance water supply and demand in urban areas, and reclaimed water can be used for nonpotable applications to reduce demands on freshwater sources. Construction of a secondary network is required to distribute reclaimed water. Implementing water reuse projects on a wider scale is challenged by the need for communitywide public acceptance and adoption, which may be a dynamic and adaptive process. The adoption of new water infrastructure can drive hydraulic conditions in both the reclaimed network and an existing drinking water network. This research develops a dynamic modeling framework using a cellular automata (CA) approach to simulate consumer adoption of reclaimed water. The framework couples the CA model of consumer adoption with water distribution system models of the drinking and reclaimed water systems. Emergent distribution system hydraulic conditions are simulated, and the capacity utilization and system performance are evaluated as consumers adopt water reuse. The Town of Cary, North Carolina, is used as case study to develop and demonstrate the modeling framework. The CA parameters and rules are developed and validated using data about the addition of new accounts for the period 2001-2012. Projected water reuse adoption is simulated in Cary for the period 2012-2030, and impacts on the existing drinking water infrastructure and planned reclaimed water infrastructure are evaluated.

TI Ecological regulation for healthy and sustainable food systems:
   responding to the global rise of ultra-processed foods
SO AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB Many are calling for transformative food systems changes to promote population and planetary health. Yet there is a lack of research that considers whether current food policy frameworks and regulatory approaches are suited to tackle whole of food systems challenges. One such challenge is responding to the rise of ultra-processed foods (UPF) in human diets, and the related harms to population and planetary health. This paper presents a narrative review and synthesis of academic articles and international reports to critically examine whether current food policy frameworks and regulatory approaches are sufficiently equipped to drive the transformative food systems changes needed to halt the rise of UPFs, reduce consumption and minimise harm. We draw on systems science approaches to conceptualise the UPF problem as an emergent property of complex adaptive food systems shaped by capitalist values and logics. Our findings reveal that current food policy frameworks often adjust or reform isolated aspects of food systems (e.g., prices, labels, food composition), but under-emphasise the deeper paradigms, goals and structures that underlie the rise of UPFs as a systems phenomenon, and its socio-ecological implications. We propose that a 'leverage points' framework illuminates where to intervene in food systems to generate multi-level changes, while the theory of ecological regulation highlights how to respond to complex multi-factorial problems, like the rise of UPFs, in diverse ways that respect planetary boundaries. More research is needed to better understand the transformative potential of ecological regulation to advance food systems transformation and attenuate whole of food systems challenges.

TI Novel Approaches to Manipulating Bacterial Pathogen Biofilms:
   Whole-Systems Design Philosophy and Steering Microbial Evolution
SO BIOPHYSICS OF INFECTION
SE Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology
AB Understanding and manipulating bacterial biofilms is crucial in medicine, ecology and agriculture and has potential applications in bioproduction, bioremediation and bioenergy. Biofilms often resist standard therapies and the need to develop new means of intervention provides an opportunity to fundamentally rethink our strategies. Conventional approaches to working with biological systems are, for the most part, "brute force", attempting to effect control in an input and effort intensive manner and are often insufficient when dealing with the inherent non-linearity and complexity of living systems. Biological systems, by their very nature, are dynamic, adaptive and resilient and require management tools that interact with dynamic processes rather than inert artefacts. I present an overview of a novel engineering philosophy which aims to exploit rather than fight those properties, and hence provide a more efficient and robust alternative. Based on a combination of evolutionary theory and whole-systems design, its essence is what I will call systems aikido; the basic principle of aikido being to interact with the momentum of an attacker and redirect it with minimal energy expenditure, using the opponent's energy rather than one's own. In more conventional terms, this translates to a philosophy of equilibrium engineering, manipulating systems' own self-organisation and evolution so that the evolutionarily or dynamically stable state corresponds to a function which we require. I illustrate these ideas with a description of a proposed manipulation of environmental conditions to alter the stability of co-operation in the context of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm infection of the cystic fibrosis lung.

TI Endemics and endangered species in the biodiversity hotspot of the Shada
   Mountains, Saudi Arabia
SO JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
AB Shada Mountains in Saudi Arabia, separated by Maleel Wadi into twin mountains (i.e., Shada Alalah and Shada Asfal), are rich in biodiversity. We investigated the diversity of endemics and endangered species of the mountains based on the data collected from 38 stands falling in 8 elevational zones ranging from 500 to 2215 m a.s.l. Results indicated that 495 plant species falling in 314 genera and 76 families occurred in the Shada Mountains, including 19 endemic species and 43 endangered species, and accounting for 22% of the total flora in Saudi Arabia. Canonical correlation analysis indicated that physiographic features, particularly altitude play an important role in the frequency and abundance of species. Endemics were not evenly distributed in the Shada Mountains and mostly restricted in the elevation zone of 1000-1500 or >1500 m a.s.l. When the altitude reached up to 2000 m a.s.l., the endemics decreased substantially due to the significantly low temperature. The endangered species existed three different distribution patterns: (i) most endangered species distributed in the altitudes of 1000-1800 m a.s.l.; (ii) endangered trees, lianas, and shrubs occupied the altitudes 1000-1300 m a.s.l.; and (iii) endangered subshrubs and herbs inhabited the altitudes 1500-2100 m a.s.l. The results demonstrated that the biodiversity of endangered species in the Shada Mountains is high and undisturbed by invasive species, and protective measures should be taken against human disturbances to the small-scale hotspot.

TI Different flowering phenology of alien invasive species in Spain:
   evidence for the use of an empty temporal niche?
SO PLANT BIOLOGY
AB Flowering phenology is an important and poorly understood plant trait that may possibly be related to the invasiveness potential of alien species. The present work evaluates whether flowering time of invasive alien species is a key trait to overcome the climatic filters operating in continental Mediterranean ecosystems of Spain (characterised by summer drought and low temperatures in winter). We conducted comparisons between the flowering phenology of the invasive species in their native range and in Spain, and between flowering phenology of 91 coexisting invasive-native species pairs. For the alien species, geographical change from the native to the invaded region did not result in shifts in the start and the length of the flowering period. Overall, climatic conditions in the native range of species selected for a flowering pattern is maintained after translocation of the species to another region. Flowering of tropical and temperate invasive alien species peaked in summer, which contrasts with the spring flowering of native and invasive alien species of Mediterranean climate origin. By exploiting this new temporal niche, these invasive alien species native to tropical and temperate regions benefit from reduced competition with natives for abiotic and biotic resources. We suggest that human-mediated actions have reduced the strength of the summer drought filter in particular microhabitats, permitting the invasion of many summer-flowering aliens.

TI Predicting the potential sites of Chromolaena odorata and Lantana camara
   in forest landscape of Eastern Ghats using habitat suitability models
SO ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
AB Conservation strategies need reliable information on species distribution and habitat suitability. Modelling the invasion probability of species is required for invasive alien species management. The present study aims in predicting the suitable habitat and potential distribution of invasive plant species - Chromolaena odorata and Lantana camara. We used the Maximum entropy (MaxEnt), Random forest, Surface range envelope, Boosted regression tree analysis, Classification tree analysis, and Generalised boosted model to identify the suitable habitats for potential environmental distribution of invasive alien species in the Eastern Ghats of Visakhapatnam district, Andhra Pradesh, India. The Area under Curve (AUC) for each model has been estimated for predicting the potentially suitable habitats of invasion. The results suggested that the MaxEnt model, Random forest, boosted regression tree, and Surface range envelope were suitable approaches in identifying areas of potential habitats of selected invasive alien species. This study aids in developing long-term conservation practices for the management of invasive alien species.

   Management
CY SEP 09-13, 2000
CL CALGARY, CANADA
SP TransCanada, TERA Environ Consultants Ltd, Elect Power Res Inst
AB The electric utility industry concern for those species listed as endangered or threatened found to reside within our transmission and distribution line rights-of-way (ROW) is twofold; first we often welcome the fact that our ROW vegetation management practices have created these unique and valuable habitats that have allowed such "species of concern" to become a resident of the ROW environs. The basic objective of ROW vegetation management is to virtually eliminate, to the practical extent feasible and necessary, all the tall growing trees that could cause electrical disruptions from the ROW and conversely to facilitate the development of various low growing plant assemblages. This process, often referred to as Integrated Vegetation Management (IVM), then may provide opportunities (new ecological niches) for colonization by various endangered, threatened, rare, unique or other species of interest or concern within the confines of the limits of the ROW and/or its area of ecological influence, i.e., along the immediate ROW edge. The second concern is that due to these highly developed ROW vegetation management strategies that have promoted the floristic evolvement of the low growing shrubs, herbs, grasses, ferns, etc., the electric industry is now in some instances being "penalized" for having achieved these milestones in biodiversity in that costly studies, inventories, and surveys, are often requested/mandated when these listed endangered/threatened species (or even prospective ones) are "found" or even thought to occur on or close to our ROW. In addition, when these endangered/threatened species are actually physically detected on a ROW segment the resultant instantaneous reaction following their discovery by some members of the environmentally informed public and even some staff of environmental regulatory agencies is to immediately request a halt to all ongoing utility ROW vegetation management practices in the near vicinity of the newly discovered species of concern. This drastic "rescue" action is believed required to provide the species of concern needed "protection" and thus "preserve" it's ROW habitat from any further undue meddling by the electric utility. This paper explores the possible ramifications of the Endangered Species Act in regards to ROW vegetation management as well as some of the resulting potential consequences of regulatory programs designed to enhance the recovery of listed, proposed and even candidate species.

TI A priority-setting scheme for the management of invasive non-native
   species in protected areas
SO NEOBIOTA
AB Invasion by non-native species is one of the major threats to the conservation of biodiversity and to the provision of ecosystem services by protected areas. Invasive species often co-occur in protected areas, represented by sparse, isolated individuals or populations in different stages in the process of invasion. Species invasiveness, habitat invasibility and impact also differ between ecosystems, so the risk of invasion varies. Besides, prioritization is required due to constraints on time, financial and other resources. Priority-setting is therefore key to help protected area managers invest efforts on biological invasions that offer the best chances of producing large-scale positive results at the lowest cost possible. A priority-setting scheme for the control of invasive non-native species in natural areas is presented in this paper. The scheme, based on field observations of species occurrences, was applied to the Itatiaia National Park (Brazil). Priorities are calculated from a combination of three criteria attributed to each occurrence: species risk of invasion considering local ecosystems, invasion stage, and species frequency. Data collected in the field in the Itatiaia National Park were used to calculate priorities for 50 non-native species (six animals and 44 plants) in four locations in the Park. The highest priorities were attributed to species of high risk in an early stage of invasion occurring in one site, whereas a few widespread species of low risk were given lower priority. The scheme has proven functional for setting priorities for the control of non-native species in the Itatiaia National Park and in many other protected areas in Brazil.

TI Does Reshoring Affect the Resilience and Sustainability of Supply Chain
   Networks? The Cases of Apple and Jaguar Land Rover
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT
AB Extending the notion that reshoring can have a significant impact on a firm's supply network owing to the associated location decisions, we explore how reshoring influences the resilience and sustainability of a focal firm's supply network. While reshoring is triggered by aspects related to both the home (domestic) and the host (foreign) country, frequently more favourable aspects in the home country lead to the reshoring decision. To investigate these dynamics, we construct two large-scale networks consisting of 2066 and 1283 firms, respectively, capturing the supply networks of Apple and Jaguar Land Rover. Both networks have been experiencing the reshoring of previously foreign suppliers to domestic locations. Our investigation captures the network dynamics created by this relocation of tier 1 suppliers for the overall supply chain network, that is, also for higher-tier/sub-tier suppliers. The results reveal, contrary to our expectations, that indirect (sub-tier) foreign suppliers positively influence the network's resilience, with this impact, however, being negatively moderated by their degree centrality, that is, the number of ties a node possesses. In addition, existing indirect (sub-tier) domestic suppliers do not have a significant influence on the resilience of the network. No evidence was found for the impact of reshoring on sustainability. Overall, our study contributes to the reshoring literature by delineating its influence on both the resilience and the sustainability of a focal firm's supply chain network.

TI Better Representation Is Needed in US Endangered Species Act
   Implementation
SO FRONTIERS IN CONSERVATION SCIENCE
AB In the United States, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service uses the concepts of resilience, redundancy, and representation-often known as the "3Rs"-to guide implementation of the Endangered Species Act, which requires the U.S. government to designate imperiled species as threatened or endangered, and take action to recover them. The Service has done little, however, to relate the 3Rs to the statutory requirements of the Act. Here we focus on interpreting the concept of representation given core tenets of science and conservation policy. We show that the Service's current interpretation, which focuses on a narrow set of characteristics intrinsic to species that facilitate future adaptation, falls far short of a reasonable interpretation from the scientific literature and other policy, and has significant consequences for the conservation of threatened and endangered species, including those found in other countries. To illustrate the shortcomings in practice, we discuss the cases of the Lower 48 gray wolf (Canis lupus) delisting, the proposed Red-cockadedWoodpecker (Picoides borealis) downlisting, and the possible downlisting of the Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis). We then propose an alternative interpretation of representation that accommodates the Service's narrow interpretation and broadens it to include the importance of intraspecific variation for its own sake as well as extrinsic characteristics such as a species' role in ecological communities. We argue that this interpretation better reflects the intent of the Endangered Species Act, the best available science, and policy needs for conserving imperiled wildlife, all of which recognize the importance not only of preventing global extinction but also of preventing ecological extinction and extirpation across significant portions of a species' range.

Here we introduce seven terms (native, nonnative, introduced, established, invasive, nuisance, and range change) that are applicable across invasive taxa, understandable, typically interpreted correctly, and useful for describing most situations regarding invasive species. We also list six terms to avoid (native invasive, invasive exotic, invasive weed, alien, foreign, and nonindigenous) that create confusion via their misuse and misinterpretation. The terms we propose will increase understanding, thereby promoting behavior changes aimed at limiting the negative impacts of invasive species.

TI Modeling the impacts of floating seaweeds on fisheries sustainability in
   Ghana
SO MARINE POLICY
AB The ongoing Sargassum invasions in the Atlantic Ocean present both opportunities and threats to open-access fisheries. Due to the lack of entry and harvest regulations, West African fisheries are on the verge of collapse. Floating seaweeds can help rebuild fish stocks by enhancing fish growth and naturally reducing harvest by impeding fishing boats and gears. However, in high volumes, floating seaweeds can harm fish stocks and reduce landings. To improve fisheries sustainability, a policy prescribing the periodic removal of seaweeds should be anchored on a thorough understanding of the trade-offs between different levels of seaweed removal. We developed an agent-based model (ABM) to identify the optimal seaweed removal policy capable of maximizing fish stocks and landings in the long-term in Ghana's marine fishery. Our policy experiments suggest that, by leaving behind 25% of relative seaweed biomass (i.e. seaweed biomass expressed as a percentage of carrying capacity) in each fishing zone every week after seaweed removal, fishery managers can take advantage of floating seaweeds to naturally regulate fishing mortality and maximize fish stocks and landings in the long-term. Our ABM can assist scientists interested in studying the long-term interactions between floating seaweeds and fisheries sustainability, and help fishery managers understand the potential of floating seaweeds to naturally regulate fishing pressure in developing countries where the lack of adequate employment opportunities outside fishing makes it difficult to address overfishing. Our ABM can also assist countries struggling with seaweed invasions to assess the impacts of different seaweed removal strategies on fisheries sustainability.

TI Communicable disease control programmes and health systems: an
   analytical approach to sustainability
SO HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
AB There is renewed concern over the sustainability of disease control programmes, and re-emergence of policy recommendations to integrate programmes with general health systems. However, the conceptualization of this issue has remarkably received little critical attention. Additionally, the study of programmatic sustainability presents methodological challenges. In this article, we propose a conceptual framework to support analyses of sustainability of communicable disease programmes. Through this work, we also aim to clarify a link between notions of integration and sustainability. As a part of development of the conceptual framework, we conducted a systematic literature review of peer-reviewed literature on concepts, definitions, analytical approaches and empirical studies on sustainability in health systems. Identified conceptual proposals for analysis of sustainability in health systems lack an explicit conceptualization of what a health system is. Drawing upon theoretical concepts originating in sustainability sciences and our review here, we conceptualize a communicable disease programme as a component of a health system which is viewed as a complex adaptive system. We propose five programmatic characteristics that may explain a potential for sustainability: leadership, capacity, interactions (notions of integration), flexibility/adaptability and performance. Though integration of elements of a programme with other system components is important, its role in sustainability is context specific and difficult to predict. The proposed framework might serve as a basis for further empirical evaluations in understanding complex interplay between programmes and broader health systems in the development of sustainable responses to communicable diseases.

TI THREATENED LYCOPHYTES AND FERNS IN FOUR PROTECTED AREAS OF MINDANAO,
   PHILIPPINES
SO NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH
AB There are nearly a thousand threatened species of vascular plants in the Philippines and of which about 12% are lycophytes and ferns. However, there are not enough data on the distribution of the species. Thus, the threatened lycophytes and ferns were determined based on field surveys in four protected areas in Mindanao, namely Mt. Apo Natural Park, Mt. Kitanglad Range Natural Palk, Mt. Malindang Range Natural Palk, and Mt. Hamiguitan Range Wildlife Sanctuary. The conservation status assessment was based on the Department of Environment and Natural Resources DAO 2017-11 updated list of threatened plants of the Philippines. A total of 45 species of threatened lycophytes and ferns was documented belonging to 16 families and 25 genera. Of these, three species are Critically Endangered, 23 Endangered, 15 Vulnerable, and three are other threatened species. Families with the highest number of threatened species are Cyatheaceae, Polypodiaceae, Lycopodiaceae, Ophioglossaceae, and Psilotaceae. The Critically Endangered species are Platycerium coronarium, Phlegmariurus magnusianus, and Helminthostackys zeylanica. The threatened species endemic to the Philippines am Phlegmariurus magnusianus,Alsophila apoensis, A. atropurpuiva, A. hennannii, A. fuliginosa, A. heterochlamydea, A. negrosiana, A. rujbpannosa, Lindsaea hamiguitanensis, Tmesipteris zamorarum, Aglaomorpha cornucopia, and A. sagitta. The highest number of threatened taxa was observed in the Mt. Apo Natural Palk (29 species), followed by the Mt. Kitanglad Range Natural Palk (28 species), Mt. Malindang Range Natural Park (27 species), with the lowest number in the Mt. Hamiguitan Range Wildlife Sanctuary (19 species). Most of the species were recorded in the lower and upper montane forests. The occurrence of threatened and endemic lycophytes and ferns in the four protected areas calls for a strict implementation of the ordinances necessary for a long term conservation and protection of the species.

This paper examines the recovery process for species at risk under the two country's domestic laws: Canada's Species at Risk Act and the American Endangered Species Act. These two countries could be working together to recover shared species, especially migratory and cross-border species. Through comparing the recovery strategies and plans for the 30 species, and interviewing recovery team members on both sides of the border, it is shown that cross-border collaboration is limited. The paper argues that more collaboration, data sharing, and cross-border recovery teams are needed. Biodiversity loss is an increasing problem in both countries.

TI The dynamics of de-adoption: a case study of policy change, de-adoption,
   and replacement of an evidence-based HIV intervention
SO TRANSLATIONAL BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE
AB Evidence-based intervention (EBI) de-adoption and its influence on public health organizations are largely unexplored within public health implementation research. However, a recent shift in support for HIV prevention EBIs by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides an opportunity to explore EBI de-adoption. The current mixed-method study examines EBI de-adoption and the subsequent impact on a community-based organization (CBO) dedicated to HIV prevention. We conducted a case study with a CBO implementing RESPECT, an HIV prevention EBI, over 5 years (2010-2014), but then deadopted the intervention. We collected archival data documenting RESPECT implementation and conducted two semistructured interviews with RESPECT staff (N = 5). Using Fixsen and colleagues' implementation framework, we developed a narrative of RESPECT implementation, delivery, and deadoption and a thematic analysis to understand additional consequences of RESPECT de-adoption. Discontinuation of RESPECT activities unfolded in a process over time, requiring effort by RESPECT staff. RESPECT deadoption had widereaching influences on individual staff, interactions between the staff and the community, the agency overall, and for implementation of future EBIs. We propose a revision of the implementation framework, incorporating EBI deadoption as a phase of the implementation cycle. Furthermore, EBI deadoption may have important, unintended consequences and can inform future HIV prevention strategies and guide research focusing on EBI de-adoption.

TI Strong agents and weak systems: University support for school level
   improvement
SO JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL CHANGE
AB This study examined individual and school level factors that advance and suppress the traits of high performing schools. Based on action plans and reflective journals of 28 school level practitioners in 14 schools across 10 school districts, researchers tracked the progress of each practitioner from participation in a university-based school improvement institute through the initial 5 months of action plan implementation at the school site. This study also presents a conceptual model for a strong system, based on an extensive literature review. Findings are as follows: (1) Internal, school-level change agents who are knowledgeable and skillful with the traits of strong systems were able to make significant inroads within weak systems. (2) School and district level leadership knowledgeable and skillful with the traits of strong systems were crucial to the sustainability of improvement efforts. (3) The effectiveness of change agents in initiating improvement did not necessarily align with positional power, confirming prior complexity research findings that posit nonlinearity of change. (4) Effective change agents focused in their work with colleagues on the cultivation of intellectual dispositions and complex skills. Such activity stands in contrast to much contemporary Professional Learning Community (PLC) work (so called) that focuses on "training'' teachers in scripted procedures and suggests that much contemporary PLC work needs to be redirected from the learning of procedural skills to the cultivation of intellectual dispositions and complex skills. University colleges of education, whose signature traditions include inquiry, analysis, and reflection, are well-positioned to support such work.

TI The Topodiverse City: Urban Form for Subjective Well-Being
SO FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB Research is now better than ever able to unveil how urban inhabitants' movement, behavior and experiences relate to the urban forms in which they take place. Consequently, urban form might increasingly be able to function as a focal point for different strands of research that focus on sustainable urban life, and as a link between research and planning practice through the development of empirically informed design principles. Drawing on literature from urban morphology, complex systems analysis, environmental psychology, and neuroscience, I provide a wide-angle view of how urban form relates to subjective well-being through movement, social and economic activity, experiences and psychological restoration. I propose three principles for urban form that could promote subjective well-being while also mitigating the environmental impact of cities in industrialized societies. The principles revolve around so-called topodiversity, meaning variation across an urban area in spatial conditions that allows subjective well-being to be promoted through several different pathways. The principles together suggest an urban form that I call the topodiverse city. The topodiverse city displays a polycentric structure and is more spatially contained than the sprawling city, yet not as compact as the dense city. I also propose indicators to measure the principles using mostly openly available data and analysis methods, to further research on how urban form can enable urban subjective well-being with low environmental impact.

TI Navigating adaptive cycles to understand destination complex
   evolutionary process
SO CURRENT ISSUES IN TOURISM
AB There is a recent surge to unfold the tourism destination's intrinsic nature as a complex adaptive system, such as the dynamic and scale interactions among tourism system components and its environment. As the world gets more uncertain, it becomes more critical to understand how dynamic and complex interactions shape the destination's resilience and its evolution process. Yet, such is under-explored. Taking the East Suburb Coconut Trees scenic area in Hainan (ESCT), China, as a case, this study adopts adaptive cycle heuristics to shed light on the critical evolution mechanisms. This study shows that ESCT had undergone two adaptive cycles, suffered three shocks, and experienced interaction mode from external enterprises-led to interdependent development mode and, finally, local-oriented mode. During this process, the destination's resilience changed from vulnerable to absorptive and, finally, rigid. There is no reorganization stage between the two cycles, which resulted in a limited increase in the destination's resilience. The increasing local involvement built absorptive capability but also locked the destination into a rigidity trap in the long term. This study is the first to reveal the role of resilience in understanding complex system interactions and the destination evolution process. Practical implications for resilient destination management are provided.

TI Biological invaders are threats to human health: an overview
SO ETHOLOGY ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
AB Invasive alien species are one of the major agents of human-accelerated global change: they threaten biodiversity, alter ecosystem structure, functions and services, inflict large economic costs and cause serious problems to human health. The effects on human health are indeed a major problem and also cause substantial costs but, surprisingly, very few studies have analyzed this topic. The paper describes and analyses the hazards to human health associated with species introductions, and discusses major correlates and possible responses. Four categories were identified: invasive species (1) causing diseases or infections; (2) exposing humans to wounds from bites/stings, biotoxins, allergens or toxicants; (3) faciliting diseases, injuries or death; and (4) inflicting other negative effects on human livelihood. Invasive species affect human health via several ways, i.e. as alien pathogens and invaders that bring/facilitate parasites or produce toxins. Others cause denutrition/malnutrition or exert displaced or deferred impacts. Their negative impacts are expected to intensify in the near future due to the increased opportunities of invasions associated with climate change, the augmented pathways of introductions and the synergic effects of climate change. It is imperative to improve our understanding of the pathways of arrival of invasive species affecting human health, their biological patterns and the mechanisms of impact, because all this information is essential to develop more effective and stringent policies for preventing and mitigating the negative effects that these species cause.

TI The role of network structural properties in supply chain
   sustainability: a systematic literature review and agenda for future
   research
SO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to systematically review and assess the current status of research on supply chain sustainability from a network structural perspective and provide an organising framework for future scholarship in this area.
   Design/methodology/approach
   By adopting an evidence-based approach, this study conducts a systematic review of 73 articles from 18 peer-reviewed journals published between 2000 and 2020.
   Findings
   Adopting a social network analysis approach, the review identifies specific node-level (i.e. degree centrality, closeness centrality and betweenness centrality) and network-level (i.e. network density, network sub-groups and network diversity) structural properties that play a role in supply chain sustainability. The results reveal that structural properties determine the extent of perception of sustainability risks, the diffusion of sustainability targets, introduction of sustainable innovations, development of sustainability capabilities, adoption of sustainability initiatives and the monitoring of sustainability performance throughout the supply chain.
   Originality/value
   By distinguishing between supply network and sustainable supply network types, this study extends the existing understandings of the role of network connectivity patterns in supply chain sustainability through synthesising and evaluating the extant literature. This study further clarifies the role of these network structural properties in supply chain sustainability by describing their impact on a set of sustainable supply chain management practices through which firms achieve sustainability goals across their supply chains.

TI Harnessing implementation science to improve care quality and patient
   safety: a systematic review of targeted literature
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR QUALITY IN HEALTH CARE
AB Getting greater levels of evidence into practice is a key problem for health systems, compounded by the volume of research produced. Implementation science aims to improve the adoption and spread of research evidence. A linked problem is how to enhance quality of care and patient safety based on evidence when care settings are complex adaptive systems. Our research question was: according to the implementation science literature, which common implementation factors are associated with improving the quality and safety of care for patients?
   We conducted a targeted search of key journals to examine implementation science in the quality and safety domain applying PRISMA procedures. Fifty-seven out of 466 references retrieved were considered relevant following the application of exclusion criteria. Included articles were subjected to content analysis. Three reviewers extracted and documented key characteristics of the papers. Grounded theory was used to distil key features of the literature to derive emergent success factors.
   Eight success factors of implementation emerged: preparing for change, capacity for implementation-people, capacity for implementation-setting, types of implementation, resources, leverage, desirable implementation enabling features, and sustainability. Obstacles in implementation are the mirror image of these: for example, when people fail to prepare, have insufficient capacity for implementation or when the setting is resistant to change, then care quality is at risk, and patient safety can be compromised.
   This review of key studies in the quality and safety literature discusses the current state-of-play of implementation science applied to these domains.

TI Spending to save: What will it cost to halt Australia's extinction
   crisis?
SO CONSERVATION LETTERS
AB As with most governments worldwide, Australian governments list threatened species and proffer commitments to recovering them. Yet most of Australia's imperiled species continue to decline or go extinct and a contributing cause is inadequate investment in conservation management. However, this has been difficult to evaluate because the extent of funding committed to such recovery in Australia, like in many nations, is opaque. Here, by collating disparate published budget figures of Australian governments, we show that annual spending on targeted threatened species recovery is around U.S.$92m (AU$122m) which is around one tenth of that spent by the U.S. endangered species recovery program, and about 15% of what is needed to avoid extinctions and recover threatened species. Our approach to estimating funding needs for species recovery could be applied in any jurisdiction and could be scaled up to calculate what is needed to achieve international goals for ending the species extinction crisis.

TI Coupling Coordination between Marine S&T Innovation and the High-Quality
   Development of the Marine Economy: A Case Study of China's Coastal
   Provinces
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Promoting coupling coordination between marine scientific and technological (S&T) innovation and the high-quality development of the marine economy is an important measure to realizing sustainable marine development. Based on the complex adaptive systems theory, sustainable development theory and regional coordinated development theory, this study analyzed the coupling coordination and its influencing factors between marine S&T innovation and the high-quality development of the marine economy with China's coastal provinces as study areas. The result showed that: (1) The coupling coordination fluctuated upward, changing from on the verge of dissonance to well-coordinated. (2) There was an agglomeration of high-level coupling coordination in central and eastern coastal provinces while the polarization between high-level and low-level coupling coordination was significant. (3) The improvement of coupling coordination mainly depended on the consumption expansion demand, multidimensional spatial integrated development, and industrial improvement demand. Regional heterogeneity of influencing factors existed in southern and northern coastal regions. (4) To improve coupling coordination, we should establish a demand-oriented mechanism for coordinated development between marine S&T innovation and the marine economy, and strengthen the multi-dimensional spatial planning and the guidance and guarantee functions of coastal governments, in particular to introduce and implement policies that suit local conditions. This research may supplement and improve the theoretical discussion and practical experience concerning sustainable marine development.

TI The complexity continuum, Part 1: hard and soft theories
SO KYBERNETES
AB Purpose Complex systems adapt to survive, but little comparative literature exists on various approaches. Adaptive complex systems are generic, this referring to propositions concerning their bounded instability, adaptability and viability. Two classes of adaptive complex system theories exist: hard and soft. Hard complexity theories include Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) and Viability Theory, and softer theories, which we refer to as Viable Systems Theories (VSTs), that include Management Cybernetics at one extreme and Humanism at the other. This paper has a dual purpose distributed across two parts. In Part 1, the purpose of this paper is to identify the conditions for the complementarity of the two classes of theory. In Part 2, the purpose is to explore (in part using Agency Theory) the two classes of theory and their proposed complexity continuum. Design/methodology/approach A detailed analysis of the literature permits a distinction between hard and softer approaches towards modelling complex social systems. Hard theories are human-incommensurable, while soft ones are human-commensurable, therefore more closely related to the human condition. The characteristics that differentiate between hard and soft approaches are identified. Findings Hard theories are more restrictive than the softer theories. The latter can embrace degrees of "softness" and it is explained how hard and soft approaches can be mixed, sometimes creating Harmony. Originality/value There are very few explorations of the relationship between hard and soft approaches to complexity theory, and even fewer that draw in the notion of harmony.

TI Modelling lifecycles of inter-organizational collaborations in
   healthcare: a systematic review and best-fit framework synthesis
SO JOURNAL OF HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
AB PurposeInter-organisational collaboration (IOC) across healthcare settings has been put forward as a solution to mounting financial and sustainability challenges. Whilst ingredients for successful IOC have been explored, there remains limited understanding of the development of IOCs over time.Design/methodology/approachThe authors systematically reviewed the literature to identify models applied to IOCs in healthcare across databases such as Healthcare Management Information Consortium (HMIC) and MEDLINE, identifying 2,763 titles and abstracts with 26 final papers included. The authors then used a "best fit" framework synthesis methodology to synthesise fourteen models of IOC in healthcare and the wider public sector to formulate an applied composite model describing the process through which collaborations change over time. This synthesis comprised extracting stages and behaviours from included models, selecting an a priori framework upon which to code these stages and behaviours and then re-coding them to construct a new composite model.FindingsExisting models often did not consider that organisations may undergo many IOCs in the organisations' lifetime nor included "contemplation" stages or those analogous to "dissolution", which might negatively impact papers using such models. The formulated' composite model utilises a life-cycle design comprising five non-linear phases, namely Contemplating, Connecting, Planning, Implementation and Maintenance or Dissolution and incorporates dynamic elements from Complex Adaptive Systems thinking to reflect the dynamic nature of collaborations.Originality/valueThis is the first purpose-built model of the lifecycles of IOCs in healthcare. The model is intended to inform implementers, evaluators and researchers of IOCs alike.

TI Scaling up breastfeeding in England through the Becoming Breastfeeding
   Friendly initiative (BBF)
SO MATERNAL AND CHILD NUTRITION
AB Breastfeeding is the most accessible and cost-effective activity available to public health and has been shown to be one of the most effective preventive measures mothers can take to protect their children's health. Despite the well-documented benefits, the UK has one of the lowest breastfeeding rates in the world. The Becoming Breastfeeding Friendly (BBF) toolkit was developed through highly structured technical and academic collaboration, led by Yale University. It provides an evidence-based process to help countries assess their breastfeeding status and readiness to scale up, and identifies concrete measures countries can take to sustainably increase breastfeeding rates, based on data-driven recommendations. BBF is grounded in the Breastfeeding Gear Model complex adaptive systems framework which is made up of eight simultaneous conditions that sustain breastfeeding. In 2018, a committee of multi-agency stakeholders implemented the BBF process in England, collecting evidence to score the 'gear' components of England's breastfeeding environment against 54 benchmarks. The Training and Programme Delivery gear received the highest score, attributable to existing learning outcomes for health professionals and practitioners, peer supporters and specialist services, although there is a need for greater coordination and integration. The lowest scores were given for Promotion and Coordination, Goals and Monitoring due to the lack of a dedicated national strategy for breastfeeding and poor sharing of localised strategies and programmes. The process generated clear recommendations highlighting the need for more robust routine infant feeding data collection and reporting, and the necessity for strengthening leadership, monitoring and oversight to scale up and sustain breastfeeding.

TI Integrating Water Management Instruments to Reconcile a Hydro-Economic
   Water Allocation Strategy With Other Water Preferences
SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
AB Increasing scarcity and pollution has called for changes in water policies, which should reflect society's preferences toward water use, development, and the environment. Water management is still limited in incorporating changing policies and in deriving directives to implement water instruments under long-term planning. Some examples are water charges that do not reflect watershed externalities and water permits lacking future vision of allocation. Hydro-economic modeling has explored trade-offs of water allocation and improved water operations but still does not address instruments' integration. This paper proposes a modeling approach that identifies how to apply water management instruments integrated with each other to deliver a water allocation strategy reconciled with economic development projections and changing water use preferences. This improves our understanding on adjusting the implementation of water management instruments considering future outcomes and trade-offs. The methodology combines discrete dynamic programming to determine increments in water permits, multiobjective linear programming to generate a Pareto set to model users' water preferences, and nonlinear programming to allocate water permits over different river reaches subject to water quality targets. The reconciliation allowed to identify sustainable water allocation strategies supported by a watershed, and instruments' integration to make it feasible. Strategies imposing limited water permits to economic users and watershed regions indicated where (and when) water conservation programs should be applied, along with quantitative targets (how much). The economic trade-offs identified reference values for economic instruments to compensate the externalities. Finally, less strict water quality targets did not result in higher economic returns.

AB Overcoming environmental challenges requires understanding when and why individuals adopt cooperative behaviors, how individual behaviors and interactions among resource users change over time, and how group structure and group dynamics impact behaviors, institutions, and resource conditions. Cultural multilevel selection (CMLS) is a theoretical framework derived from theories of cultural evolution and cultural group selection that emphasizes pressures affecting different levels of social organization as well as conflicts among these levels. As such, CMLS can be useful for understanding many environmental challenges. With this paper, we use evidence from the literature and hypothetical scenarios to show how the framework can be used to understand the emergence and persistence of sustainable social-ecological systems. We apply the framework to the Balinese system of rice production and focus on two important cultural traits (synchronized cropping and the institutions and rituals associated with water management). We use data from the literature that discusses bottom-up (self-organized, complex adaptive system) and top-down explanations for the system and discuss how (1) the emergence of group structure, (2) group-level variation in cropping strategies, institutions, and rituals, and (3) variation in overall yields as a result of different strategies and institutions, could have allowed for the spread of group-beneficial traits and the increasing complexity of the system. We also outline cultural transmission mechanisms that can explain the spread of group-beneficial traits in Bali and describe the kinds of data that would be required to validate the framework in forward-looking studies.

TI Exploring nurtured company resilience through human capital and human
   resource development Findings from Spanish manufacturing companies
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANPOWER
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the importance and contribution of human capital, combined with human resources and research and development (R&D) measures, to nurturing company resilience as new knowledge and human capital artifices to face challenges derived from globalization, competitiveness, and the knowledge-based economy.
   Design/methodology/approach - By means of structural equation modeling with latent variables, a new type of synthetic index is developed, with which the evolution and incidence of human capital structure, human resources development, and R&D in the company's accumulated resiliency can be tested.
   Findings - The results indicate a remarkable contribution of human capital to company resilience (standardized path coefficient 0.8365; po0.0001 and R-2 = 0.7486). Differences in company- nurtured resilience are related to categories such as productivity, products diversification, human capital structure, human resources management, innovation results, technology, and a productive environment.
   Research limitations/implications - The main limitation is that the applied literature on this topic is scarce in economics and focused on company survival. Practical implications - Management for resilience requires the development of the ability to balance efficiency in the short term with adaptability in the medium and long term. Recruitment and training and development policies should consider the role of emotions and motivation in creative thinking and innovation.
   Originality/value - Most research on the topic has been conducted within the ecological resilience approach. The adaptive resilience approach is considered an integrated framework based on the internal perspective of company capabilities, the theory of complex adaptive systems, and the Schultz-Nelson/Phelps view on human capital.

TI Disability Data Collection in a Complex Humanitarian Organisation:
   Lessons from a Realist Evaluation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB In recent years, global attention to disability inclusion in humanitarian and development contexts, notably comprising disability inclusion within the Sustainable Development Goals, has significantly increased. As a result, UN agencies and programmes are increasingly seeking to understand and increase the extent to which persons with disabilities are accounted for and included in their efforts to provide life-saving assistance. To explore the effects and effectiveness of such measurement, this paper applies a complexity-informed, realist evaluation methodology to a case study of a single measurement intervention. This intervention, 'A9', was the first indicator designed to measure the number of persons with disabilities assisted annually by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP). Realist logic of analysis combined with complexity theory was employed to generate context-mechanism-outcome configurations (CMOC's) against which primary interviews and secondary data were analysed. We show that within the complexity of the WFP system, the roll-out of the A9 measurement intervention generated delayed, counter-intuitive and unanticipated effects. In turn, path dependency and emergent behaviours meant that the intervention mechanisms of yesterday were destined to become the implementation context of tomorrow. These findings challenge the current reliance on quantitative data within humanitarian-development disability inclusion efforts and contribute to our understanding of how data can best be leveraged to support inclusion in such contexts.

TI How to Sustainably Use Water Resources-A Case Study for Decision Support
   on the Water Utilization of Xinjiang, China
SO WATER
AB Global warming has led to a serious crisis on regional water resources. Establishing a decision support system (DSS) on the sustainable utilization of water resources for arid areas is an increasingly critical problem. Selecting Xinjiang as a case study, this paper developed a system dynamics (SD) model. Through the simulation operation of the model, we achieved the decision on sustainable utilization of water resources. The extensive economic development is the main factor restricting the sustainable utilization of water resources in Xinjiang. We propose to adjust the planting structure and implement water-saving irrigation in Xinjiang, especially the Tarim Basin and Turpan-Hami Basin. This research provides the sustainable utilization plan of water resources for Xinjiang and its sub-regions in the next 30 years. By 2050, we recommend that the reuse rate of urban domestic water consumption and industrial sewage should reach 75%; the rural domestic water quota should be 70 L/(person center dot day); water consumption per industrial output value of ten thousand Yuan should be 28 m(3); the irrigation water quota should be 5000 m(3)/hectare in Xinjiang. This research can provide references for the decision on sustainable utilization of water resources in arid regions around the world.

TI A review of global instruments to combat invasive alien species in
   forestry
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB Although impacts of biological invasions may be local, at least at first, the causes of introduction are mostly international. Through trade and transport pathways, countries both send and receive non-native species. There are numerous international and regional instruments, binding and nonbinding, which have been developed to deal with the problem of the movement of alien invasive species, however there are gaps in the current international framework. Global goals in the management of forestry-related threats from invasive alien species should include making best use of existing regulatory frameworks, investing more into global research initiatives, and targeting existing tools and resources more effectively. Given the lack of resources for many developing countries to undertake research, conduct risk assessments and implement quarantine measures, there is a need for regional and global support for countries that lack sufficient resources to implement effective phytosanitary systems.

SO BIOINVASIONS RECORDS
AB Marisa cornuarietis (Linnaeus, 1758) (giant ramshorn snail) is an aquatic snail of the family Ampullariidae Gray, 1824, which are generally referred to as apple snails. Several ampullariids, including M. cornuarietis, are invasive alien species across several islands of the Caribbean, where they are associated with considerable ecological and economic outcomes. During an aquatic snail assessment survey conducted from May to June 2021, 153 giant ramshorn snails were collected from two ponds and trenches exiting those ponds in the parish of St. Andrew, Jamaica. The specimens were photographed and carefully identified using distinguishing morphological features. Here we confirm the presence of the species in Jamaica and discuss potential environmental, economic, and social implications of this invasive species.

AB In Tasmania, 59 threatened species recovery projects were written and/or implemented between 1990 and 1995. Of these 22 are still active. Most recovery projects have been successful in implementing their recovery actions but few have achieved the broader goals of increasing populations in the wild or reversing population trends. Some of the problems encountered and benefits to the recovery profess are identified. Over 70% of the funding received has been directed to fauna programs, most of which are species specific. Changing our emphasis to include a landscape or regional approach is inevitable. So too is the recognition that species recovery is co-operative and must be supported by a range of other processes.

TI A review of the conservation threats to carnivorous plants
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB Over half of the carnivorous plant species assessed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) are listed as threatened (i.e. vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered), but the threats to carnivorous plants have not previously been quantified systematically. In this review, we quantify the conservation threats to carnivorous plant taxa worldwide. Using the IUCN Red List, a literature search of Web of Knowledge, and the National Red Lists database, we collected data on the threats to 48 species of carnivorous plants from nine genera. The most common threat was habitat loss from agriculture, followed by the collection of wild plants, pollution, and natural systems modifications. A principal coordinate analysis revealed that species within a genus often faced similar threats, and an indicator species analysis found positive associations among species in the genus Sarracenia and agricultural activities, over-collection, invasive species, and pollution. Future research should further quantify the effects of pollution on carnivorous plants, and more thoroughly examine the potential role of carnivorous plants as indicator species for wetland health. More research is also needed to quantify the extinction risk for many carnivorous plants, as presently only around 17% of species have been assessed by the IUCN. Ensuring the conservation of carnivorous plants will help maintain the important ecosystem services they provide and prevent secondary extinctions of specialist species that rely on them.

TI Urban ecology and sustainability: The state-of-the-science and future
   directions
SO LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
AB Ecosystems and landscapes around the world have become increasingly domesticated through urbanization. Cities have been the engines of socioeconomic development but also the centers of major environmental problems since the industrial revolution. Numerous studies have shown that our urban ecosystems and landscapes are on an unsustainable trajectory. Global sustainability depends critically on cities, and urban ecology can and needs to play a key role in the transition toward sustainability. In this paper, I review different definitions and perspectives of urban ecology, discuss major advances and key issues, and propose a framework to help move the field forward. After almost 90 years of development, urban ecology has evolved into a truly transdisciplinary enterprise that integrates ecological, geographical, planning, and social sciences. The most salient thrust of current research activities in the field is the emerging urban sustainability paradigm which focuses on urban ecosystem services and their relations to human well-being. While urbanization is complex in many ways, we do know a lot about its patterns, processes, and effects. More specifically, we know a great deal about urban growth patterns in space and time, the underlying drivers and mechanisms, and myriad effects of urbanization on biodiversity, ecological processes, and ecosystem services. Compared to their ancient counterparts, contemporary cities tend to be bigger in physical size and ecological footprint, faster in growth rate in terms of both population and urbanized land, and more irregular in landscape composition and configuration. As coevolving human-environment systems, cities are spatially heterogeneous, complex adaptive systems. As such, the dynamic trajectory of cities can never be fully predicted or controlled, but can and should be influenced or guided in more desirable directions through planning and design activities that are based on urban ecological knowledge and sustainability principles.

TI No consistencies in abundance-impact relationships across herbaceous
   invasive species and ecological impact metrics
SO JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB The general shape (from linear to complex curve), direction (negative and positive) and strength (steepness of the slope) of abundance-impact relationships for different impact metrics are poorly known, despite their importance in understanding and predicting ecological repercussions of invasive species. It is also an open question how the functional traits of invasive species may influence the abundance-impact relationship. We studied 11 widespread herbaceous invasive alien species of East-Central Europe and their 16 impact metrics (resident plant communities' ecological characteristics, trait composition, functional diversity and soil parameters) by sampling invaded and similar, uninvaded sites (space-for-time substitution method). Our aim was to (1) investigate the detailed ecological impacts of invasive plants on native plant communities; (2) explore the type of cover-impact relationships across impact metrics and their consistency across species and (3) study whether the cover-impact relationship depends on functional traits of invasive species. When considering all invasive species together, we found that invaded plant communities were less species rich and less functionally even but showed higher values of Rao's Q diversity index, and higher nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon soil nutrient content compared to uninvaded communities. However, the species-wise analyses revealed strikingly different impacts among the 11 invasive species and also among impact metrics. Regarding the type of cover-impact relationships, we found no consistencies across invasive species and impact metrics. Still, nonlinear relationships prevailed when species were analysed together and linear relationships when species were studied individually. The functional traits of the invasive species explained only a small part of this response heterogeneity; mostly, the small-seeded perennial invasive species affected the cover-species richness relationship. Synthesis: Herbaceous invasive plant species have a cover-dependent impact on resident plant communities, but there are no consistent patterns across impact metrics and invasive species. Specific traits or trait syndrome of invasive species may affect the heterogeneity of cover-impact relationships, but that would need further study. We highlighted the importance of impact assessments involving invasive species' abundance to unmask cryptic impacts for species that show contrasting effects along an abundance gradient.

TI Raising the bar: Recovery ambition for species at risk in Canada and the
   US
SO PLOS ONE
AB Routinely crossing international borders and/or persisting in populations across multiple countries, species are commonly subject to a patchwork of endangered species legislation. Canada and the United States share numerous endangered species; their respective acts, the Species at Risk Act (SARA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA), require documents that outline requirements for species recovery. Although there are many priorities for improving endangered species legislation effectiveness, species recovery goals are a crucial component. We compared recovery goal quality, as measured by goal quantitativeness and ambition, for species listed under SARA and ESA. By comparing across ESA and SARA, the intent of the study was to identify differences and similarities that could support the development of stronger species' recovery goals under both legislations. Our results indicated that: (1) overall, only 38% of recovery goals were quantitative, 41% had high ambition, and 26% were both quantitative and with high ambition; (2) recovery goals had higher quantitativeness and ambition under ESA than SARA; (3) recovery goals for endangered species had higher ambition than threatened species under ESA and SARA, and; (4) no recovery goal aimed to restore populations to historic levels. Combined, these findings provide guidance to strengthen recovery goals and improve subsequent conservation outcomes. In particular, species at risk planners should seek to attain higher recovery goal ambition, particularly for SARA-listed species, and include quantitative recovery goals wherever possible.

TI Navigating Complexities: Agent-Based Modeling to Support Research,
   Governance, and Management in Small-Scale Fisheries
SO FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB The sustainable governance and management of small-scale fisheries (SSF) is challenging, largely due to their dynamic and complex nature. Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a computational modeling approach that can account for the dynamism and complexity in SSF by modeling entities as individual agents with different characteristics and behavior, and simulate how their interactions can give rise to emergent phenomena, such as over-fishing and social inequalities. The structurally realistic design of agent-based models allow stakeholders, experts, and scientists across disciplines and sectors to reconcile different knowledge bases, assumptions, and goals. ABMs can also be designed using any combination of theory, quantitative data, or qualitative data. In this publication we elaborate on the untapped potential of ABM to tackle governance and management challenges in SSF, discuss the limitations of ABM, and review its application in published SSF models. Our review shows that, although few models exist to date, ABM has been used for diverse purposes, including as a research tool for understanding cooperation and over-harvesting, and as a decision-support tool, or participatory tool, in case-specific fisheries. Even though the development of ABMs is often time- and resource intensive, it is the only dynamic modeling approach that can represent entities of different types, their heterogeneity, actions, and interactions, thus doing justice to the complex and dynamic nature of SSF which, if ignored can lead to unintended policy outcomes and less sustainable SSF.

TI Are Hong Kong and Taiwan stepping-stones for invasive species to the
   mainland of China?
SO ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB Understanding the origins and introduction pathways of invasive species is a fundamental issue for invasion biology, which is necessary for predicting and preventing future invasion. Once an invasive species is established in a new location, this location could serve as a stepping-stone for further invasions. However, such stepping-stone effect has not been widely investigated. Using the published literature and records, we compiled the first found locations of 127 top invasive species in China. Our study showed that the most common landing spots of these invasive species were Hong Kong (22 species) and Taiwan (20 species), which accounted for one-third of the invasive species in China. Our analysis revealed that the invasive species in mainland China were more likely to transport from Hong Kong than Macau, a neighboring region with a similar area and colonial history. Similarly, more invasive species were also first landed on Taiwan than Hainan, a nearby island sharing similar climate conditions. Together, our findings indicate that Hong Kong and Taiwan are the most important stepping-stones for invasive species to the mainland of China and suggesting that the increasing trade exchange of China's coastal ports constitutes a potential risk for the spread of more invasive species. We suppose that they would be the future stepping-stones for invasive species to the mainland of China and these coastal ports regions where improved biosecurity is needed now.

TI Supporting the evolution and interoperability of organisational models
   with e-learning technologies
SO ANNUAL REVIEWS IN CONTROL
AB Models are instruments that allow agents to gain understanding and plan future steps required for being sustainable. Unfortunately, social, economical and ecological systems are in constant flux. The modelling process in a dynamic environment is a never ending, ongoing concern. As a theoretical lens for the analysis of enterprise sustainability the theory of Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) is used. This theory allows to capture dynamic aspects in models. Theoretical aspects of CASs are briefly introduced and used to analyse learning support for the active agents in the enterprise. A learning system is conceptualised. Support for enterprise models in general and the enterprises' active agents in particular is discussed to show how to support getting along with the dynamics of the overall system. Interoperability is derived as a key property of the overall system. Interoperability requires system-parts to be independent, while supporting the overall system's functionality. On the one hand multi-faced problems are independently analysed by active agents. On the other hand partial solutions realised by active agents need to be interoperable on the enterprise level. Taking a CAS point of view interoperability between system parts becomes a necessity, which, if not met, might bring the overall system to a halt. Requirements and properties for a support environment for organisations' agents to keep pace with permanent changes in their environments are described. Technologies are presented that fit to the used theoretical point of view and support both: the individual evolution and learning of agents who update local models and the interoperability between models.

AB The paper examines the Commonwealth and New South Wales threatened species legislation from the perspective of local communities and a local government seeking to protect threatened species. Both the Commonwealth and State legislation are identified potentially to be useful tools, providing ample opportunities for involvement in protecting threatened species and ecological communities and their habitats. However, groups and individuals in the community who have an interest in conserving these key elements of unique natural environments are disengaging. Ministerial discretion is undermining commitment to the Commonwealth's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995.
   Local Governments, faced with a growing suite of State and Commonwealth demands, have scarcely begun to engage with Commonwealth threatened species legislation, even though Matters of National Environmental Significance addressed by the Commonwealth legislation may be locally relevant.
   The protection of endangered species, ecological communities and populations on North Head at Manly is used to highlight some of these concerns as they relate to both Commonwealth and State threatened species legislation. The paper concludes with a call for stronger partnerships between scientists, local government, local communities and the environment movement, to bring governments to greater accountability in using the existing legislation to protect Australia's unique biodiversity, some of which has an iconic status locally.

TI Effective removal of the American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) on
   a landscape level: long term monitoring and removal efforts in Yosemite
   Valley, Yosemite National Park
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB Invasive alien species are a major threat to freshwater ecosystems, and American bullfrogs are among the world's 100 most prominent aquatic invasive species causing negative direct and indirect effect on native aquatic fauna worldwide. Bullfrogs were intentionally introduced into Yosemite Valley, Yosemite National Park in the 1950s where they became well established in the subsequent years. Starting in 2005, the National Park Service (NPS) began bullfrog removal, targeting various life stages using hand, net, and spear techniques. Starting in 2015, the NPS conducted environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys and deployed audio recordings devices to ensure adequate detection of bullfrogs. During the first year of cencerted effort in the Valley in 2005, the NPS removed 86% of all recorded bullfrog. The subsequent decade was spent searching for individuals with lower return on effort. In 2012, the NPS removed the last observed signs of bullfrog breeding, and the last observed bullfrog in 2019. Following removal of the breeding bullfrog population, the NPS began restoration projects for species of special concern. The NPS introduced the federally threatened California red-legged frogs (Rana draytonii) into Yosemite Valley beginning in 2016. This is the first published successful eradication of bullfrogs on a landscape level. National Parks and Monuments often provide refuges for imperiled wildlife and should be managed to remove invasive species. Our work highlights effective bullfrog removal is obtainable and can lead to local recovery of endangered species.

TI Invasive Plant Atlas of New England: The Role of Citizens in the Science
   of Invasive Alien Species Detection
SO BIOSCIENCE
AB In response to the global threat of invasive alien species, there has been a proliferation of volunteer-based monitoring programs. The valuable data sets collected through these programs facilitate large-scale, baseline population monitoring. The Invasive Plant Atlas of New England, created in 2001, was the first such regional database and is the only one in which both presence and true absence data have been collected. Building on the success of volunteer atlas projects for other taxa, the Web-based network uses trained volunteers, along with experts, to collect distribution data and detailed environmental information. The incorporation of true absence data allows for the building of robust statistical models, which contributes significantly to the invasive species literature. This collaborative database allows citizen science data to be used by the general public and as a data source for researchers and policymakers. As a template for other invasive plant projects, we highlight the need for more collaborative efforts in invasion ecology.

   invasive alien species and the preservation of biodiversity
SO REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES
AB The missions of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) include the design of surveillance and control methods for infectious transboundary animal diseases (including zoonoses), the provision of guarantees concerning animal health and animal production food safety, and the setting of standards for, and promotion of, animal welfare. The OIE role in setting standards for the sanitary safety of international trade in animals and animal products is formally recognised in the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (the SPS Agreement). While the primary focus of the OIE is on animal diseases and zoonoses, the DIE has also been working within the WTO framework to examine possible contributions the organisation can make to achieving the goals of the Convention on Biological Diversity, particularly to preventing the global spread of invasive alien species (IAS). However, at the present time, setting standards for invasive species (other than those connected to the cause and distribution of diseases listed by the OIE) is outside the OIE mandate. Any future expansion of the OIE mandate would need to be decided by its Members and resources (expertise and financial contributions) for an extended standard-setting work programme secured. The other international standard-setting organisations referenced by the SPS Agreement are the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) and the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC). The IPPC mandate and work programme address IAS and the protection of biodiversity. The CAC is not involved in this field.

TI Eight qualities of resilient food systems: Toward a
   sustainability/resilience index
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE FOOD SYSTEMS AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
AB The concept of ecological resilience fills lacunae in sustainability. Solving the world's wicked problems is undermined by the fact that defining sustainability itself is a wicked problem. Traditionally, sustainability is defined by a focus on social, economic, and environmental criteria. In contrast, the ecological resilience perspective on sustainability focuses on continuing adaptation and innovation of complex adaptive systems rather than any evaluation criteria. Prominent among the qualities enabling such resilience is local self-organization. Locally self-organized processing and marketing has long been recognized as a crucial component of sustainable agricultural systems. Ecological resilience research focuses on understanding qualities such as the local self-organization necessary for systems to withstand and overcome disturbances (for example, climate change). This study seeks to determine the common qualities of such resilient locally organized food systems and compare them with those proposed by the most prominent resilience frameworks in the literature. Our case studies of resilient food systems in recalcitrant areas of the U.S. South result in eight common qualities that are consistent with the most prominent frameworks. This study is part of a long-term effort to define qualities of ecologically resilient systems that are universal across as many scales as possible. Toward that end, this article discusses those eight qualities in order to lay a foundation for future establishment of quantitative indicators and thus form a sustainability/ resilience index (SRI). Such a quantitative index enables investigation of the relationships between agricultural system resilience and economic and social demographic indicators.

TI Multiscale system dynamics of humans and nature in The Bahamas:
   perturbation, knowledge, panarchy and resilience
SO SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
AB The analysis of the dynamic interactions between social systems, integrated by governance and communication, and biophysical systems, connected by material and energy flows, remains a challenge. In this paper, we draw on the heuristic models of the "adaptive renewal cycle" and "panarchy" [Gunderson and Holling (eds) Panarchy: understanding transformations in human and natural systems. Island Press, Washington, 2002], which are embedded in the theory of complex adaptive systems. Taking island development research in The Bahamas as a case study, we investigate environmental stressors, knowledge and social response in the context of three distinct social-ecological subsystems: (1) the interaction between tropical storms/hurricanes and the social system of disaster preparedness/management; (2) coastal ecosystem degradation coupled with land development; and (3) the fishery, in which we also consider the impact of a recent biological invasion, the Indo-Pacific red lionfish. The findings demonstrate the complexity of panarchical relations and the crucial role of diverse and uncertain knowledge systems and underlying mental models of risk and environment for resilience and sustainability. These are acquired at different scales and form key variables of change. This also applies to processes of communication. Bringing together the various constantly evolving multi-level knowledge systems for effective communication and decision-making remains a major challenge.

TI ROLE OF A CAMPESINE RESERVE ZONE IN THE MAGDALENA VALLEY (COLOMBIA) IN
   THE CONSERVATION OF ENDANGERED TROPICAL RAINFORESTS
SO NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH
AB Tropical forests of Colombia have one of the highest deforestation rates in the world. The humid forest of the Magdalena valley region is one of the ecosystems with the highest risk of landscape transformation, despite being home to many endemic and threatened species. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of a Peasant Reserve Zone in the conservation of tropical humid forests and endangered species in the Magdalena valley region. To reach this aim, we performed a multi-temporal analysis of the forest dynamics in the Peasant Reserve Zone-Cimitarra River Valley (PRZ-CRV) and assessed the extinction risk of eight species endemic to Colombia. Our outcomes indicated that the most extended land cover in the PRZ-CRV is the forest (56.30%), followed by open areas (38.75%). The forest dynamics analysis indicated that the forest cover has decreased by 3.82% between 2017 and 2019, being the area with redoubts from the Serrania de San Lucas Forest the most conserved. Finally, our results indicated that less than 50% of the climatically suitable areas for each species are covered by forests and that less than 10% of those areas are covered by Protected Areas, while for such species as Agalychnis terranova and Ateles hybridus the PRZ-CRV covered a higher percentage of their distribution than all Protected Areas together in this ecosystem. In conclusion, our results have indicated that the PRZ-CRV could be an important area for the maintenance and conservation of humid forests and their associated fauna, playing an important role as an ally to the Protected Area system in the Magdalena valley region.

TI Insect conservation in an urban biodiversity hotspot: The San Francisco
   Bay Area
SO JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
AB The San Francisco Bay Area hosts a diverse insect fauna and a dense cluster of urban areas. The high diversity of insects in the Bay Area arises for three primary reasons: its location in the California biotic province, the diverse local environment and the entomologist-area effect. The juxtaposition of high insect diversity and an area intensively used by humans led to the first recorded extinction as well as the first efforts to conserve insects in the United States. Habitat loss due to urbanization, agriculture, and invasive species is largely responsible for local extinctions and reduction in abundance of the remaining species. Invasive species such as the Argentine ant and pathogens causing mortality of oaks and pines are poised to have substantial impacts on the insect fauna of the Bay Area in the near future. Understanding which taxa can or cannot persist in remnant habitat patches within an urban or agricultural matrix, and what management practices would encourage persistence should be a focus of future research. Assessments of population status should be focused on insects at risk of extinction because of their restricted geographic ranges, low vagility, interactions with invasive species, or known reduction in their habitat. Assessments that combine examinations of museum collections, literature, and field surveys might enable determination of the status of many species within the Bay Area. Such an approach might better define the scope and magnitude of the problem of conserving insects in an increasingly urbanized region.

TI Effective communications on invasive alien species: Identifying
   communication needs of Swedish domestic garden owners
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Invasive alien species threaten biodiversity with domestic gardens acting as a major pathway for the introduction of alien species. Even though the Nordic region is not currently a hotspot for biological invasions, the number of invasions in the Nordic area has been predicted to increase due to climate change. Given a time lag between introduction and invasion, many non-invasive horticultural alien species already introduced into gardens may become invasive in the future. This study aimed to identify the communication needs of Swedish garden owners regarding their management of invasive alien species. A survey among domestic garden owners, informed by topic specialists and local area experts, and interviews with garden owners were conducted in three different bioclimatic areas in a latitudinal gradient across Sweden. The questions targeted invasive alien species and their relations to biodiversity loss and climate change, as well as measures taken to control these species. Analysing the survey data collected in relation to measures taken to control invasive species, Bayesian Additive Regression Tree (BART) modelling was used to identify geographically varying communication needs of the domestic garden owners. In all study areas, the garden owners' measures taken to control invasive alien species were correlated with their strength of beliefs in having experienced local biodiversity loss. A majority of the garden owners were, moreover, uncertain about the impact of climate change on the invasiveness of alien species. In addition, the garden owners' capacity for identifying invasive alien species was often in need of improvement, in particular with respect to the species Impatiens glandulifera, Reynoutria japonica and Rosa rugosa. The results suggest that the evidence-based guidelines for effective communications we developed, have the potential to help communicators meet the local communication needs of garden owners across Sweden, in relation to the management of invasive alien garden species.

TI Exotic animal cafes in Japan: A new fashion with potential implications
   for biodiversity, global health, and animal welfare
SO CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
AB Wildlife trade is a multibillion-dollar industry and concerns not only the exploitation of animals for their body parts but is also largely fueled by the demand for exotic pets. We document, in Japan, a recent phenomenon closely related to the pet trade and rapidly spreading in Asia: the display of exotic animals in a cafe/bar context. We surveyed 142 exotic animal cafes (EACs) by visiting their website and/or social media accounts. We recorded every available exotic animal species, their status based on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species and Appendix according to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). We compared the CITES Appendix-listed species imported in Japan during 1975-2019 to the species present in EACs. Most EACs opened in major cities between 2015 and 2017 under the label "owl cafe. " We recorded 3793 individuals belonging to 419 different species in 137 EACs active in 2019. The most numerous exotic animals were birds (62% - owls 40%) but reptiles (21%), mammals (15%) and to a lesser extent, amphibians (2%) were also found. A total of 403 individuals belonged to 52 threatened species. The majority (60%) of the species identified were CITES-listed (Appendix I: 53 individuals, 9 species; Appendix II:2482 individuals, 235 species and Appendix III:16 individuals, 6 species). While most species present in EACs are mainly imported as "captive bred " in Japan, we found 30 species that were mainly imported as "wild-caught, " "ranched " or "farmed. " The increase of importations of owl species is concomitant with the openings of EACs, reflecting the demand for owls in Japan. We argue that these EACs promoted through social media: (1) might have consequences for biodiversity as they encourage the purchase of exotic animals and represent a pool of potentially invasive species with their pathogens; (2) present a risk of pathogen transmission due to frequent close interactions with consumers; and (3) raise serious concerns about animal welfare.

TI Endangered species diversity 'hot spots' in Russia and centers of
   endemism
SO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB Geographic distributions of all 125 endangered and threatened animals and all 70 endangered flowering plant species were compiled and mapped by administrative territory (republics, states, provinces, and districts) of the Russian Federation, based on distributional data in the official Red Data Books of the R.S.F.S.R. [Eliseev et al. (eds) (1985) Red Book of the R.S.F.S.R.: Animals. Rosleskhoz Publishing, Moscow; Golovanov et al. (eds). (1988). Red Book of the R.S.F.S.R.: Plants. Rosagprom Publishing, Moscow]. Territories were ranked using an algorithm that gives highest rank to the single territory with the greatest number of endangered species present, then iteratively assigns the next highest rank to the territory containing the greatest number of species not found in a territory of higher rank. This algorithm minimizes the number of territories necessary to include one population of each endangered species, but may designate very low rank to a territory that holds high numbers of endangered species if many of those species are found in a territory of higher rank. When different sets of species were used to determine territory rank with this algorithm the only significant correlation between rank lists was between ranks generated when all species are used and when only species endemic to single territories were used. Mountainous territories on Russia's southern borders held the greatest numbers of endangered species and were highly ranked whether or not species occurring outside of Russia were excluded from the ranking algorithm. The Maritime state, Krasnodar state, Dagestan republic, Sakhalin province and the Jewish province all are centers of endangered species diversity that together contain 50 or more of endangered species for multiple taxonomic groups; this was the Dobson et al. [(1997) Science 275: 550-553] definition of an endangered species 'hot spot.' These are all mountainous territories on Russia's southern border. Precise territorial ranking within the mountainous southern regions of the Southern Far East, Caucasus, and Altai/Sayan regions of southern Siberia was highly influenced by species endemic to single territories.

TI Growth, Collapse, and Reorganization of the Annapurna Conservation Area,
   Nepal: an Analysis of Institutional Resilience
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB Community-based conservation institutions can be conceptualized as complex adaptive systems that pass through a cycle of growth, maturation, collapse, and reorganization. We test the applicability of this four-phase adaptive cycle in the institutional context of the Annapurna Conservation Area (ACA), Nepal. We use the adaptive cycle to assess changes in structures and processes and to explore the past, present, and possible future trends in ACA. We focus on the crisis brought about by the Maoist insurgency and changes that took place in ACA during and after this period. Our analysis suggests that the conservation institution has passed through one and a half forms of the adaptive cycle in five major historical periods in the Annapurna region since 1960. It also appears to have been resilient to the insurgency because the system maintained its identity throughout, avoided alternative undesirable states, and entered into the reorganization phase following collapse. All forms of capital and institutional performance decreased to some extent during collapse, but flexible nested governance structures, including the devolution of responsibility to local entities, the maintenance of capital stocks, the retention of institutional memory, and the perceptions of institutional legitimacy among constituencies, facilitated reorganization. The institutional system is reorganizing along the original regime, but it has also developed an alternative pathway that will transform it in the near term. We evaluate the usefulness, strengths, and weaknesses of the adaptive cycle analogy in this application.

TI Assessing multi-species recovery plans under the endangered species act
SO ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) is relying increasingly on a mufti-species, rather than the more traditional single-species, approach to recovery planning under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). Supporters of the mufti-species approach note potential efficiency gains in terms of biodiversity protection and agency resources. By the end of 1998, >55% of all ESA-listed species with recovery plans were covered within multi-species plans. A recent analysis found that species within mufti-species plans are significantly more likely to exhibit a declining status trend. Given this finding, we compared single- to mufti-species plans and found that mufti-species plans reflect a poorer understanding of species-specific biology, are less likely to include adaptive management provisions, and are revised less frequently. USFWS guidelines recommend that species be combined into mufti-species plans primarily on the basis of threat similarity. We developed a threat similarity index to evaluate the USFWS's conformance with these guidelines. Nearly half of the mufti-species plans failed to display threat similarity greater than that for randomly selected groups of species. We advocate the explicit use of threat similarity analyses to identify appropriate groups of species for concurrent management, thereby maximizing benefits and minimizing potential drawbacks of a mufti-species approach. We conclude that, as currently employed by the USFWS, mufti-species recovery plans are less effective management tools than single-species plans. Given the increasing number of species covered by mufti-species plans and the problems identified with these plans, we recommend that the USFWS reevaluate its use of the mufti-species approach to recovery planning.

TI Potential applications of population viability analysis to risk
   assessment for invasive species
SO HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT
AB Population viability analysis, the use of ecological models to assess a population's risk of extinction, plays an important role in contemporary conservation biology. The premise of this review is that models, concepts, and data analyses that yield results on extinction risk of threatened and endangered species can also tell us about establishment risks of potentially invasive species. I briefly review important results for simple unstructured models, demographic models, and spatial models, giving examples of the application of each type of model to invasive species, and general conclusions about the applicability of each type of model to risk analysis for invasive species. The examples illustrate a portion of the range of potential applications of such models to invasive species, and some of the types of predictions that they can provide. They also highlight some of the limitations of such models. Finally, I present several conjectures and open research questions concerning the application of population viability analyses to risk analysis and control of invasive species.

TI Incalculable Instrumental Value in the Endangered Species Act
SO PHILOSOPHIA
AB The Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973 is one of America's most powerful statutes, not only in American domestic environmental law, but in American domestic law in general. The first part of the ESA gives us the 'Findings, Purposes, and Policy' that underlie the Act. In this prefatory language, we see the following: The Congress finds and declares that: (1) horizontal ellipsis . (3) these [endangered or threatened] species of fish, wildlife, and plants [in the United States] are of esthetic, ecological, educational, historical, recreational, and scientific value to the Nation and its people horizontal ellipsis . (5) encouraging the States and other interested parties horizontal ellipsis to develop and maintain conservation programs horizontal ellipsis is a key to horizontal ellipsis better safeguarding, for the benefit of all citizens, the Nation's heritage in fish, wildlife and plants. 16 U.S.C. </n>1531 (a). Considering (3) and (5), it is explicit that the ESA is referring to instrumental aesthetic, ecological, educational, historical, recreational, and scientific values. But J. Baird Callicott and Andrew Wetzler argued that the ESA is also implicitly committed to endangered species having intrinsic value. I argue that the best explanation of the seeming tacit intrinsic value in the ESA is not that such value really is implicit in the ESA; rather, the best explanation is that the ESA is committed to instrumental value with a certain feature that has not been carefully considered in the environmental ethics/philosophy literature before, that of incalculable (or indeterminable) instrumental value, in this case held by endangered species.

TI Intensity of grass invasion negatively correlated with population
   density and age structure of an endangered dune plant across its range
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB Invasive species are a global threat to ecosystem biodiversity and function; non-native grass invasion has been particularly problematic in sparsely vegetated ecosystems such as open dunes. Native plant population responses to invasion, however, are infrequently translated to landscape scales, limiting the effectiveness of these data for addressing conservation issues. We quantified population density, total population size, and age class distribution of the federally-endangered plant species Antioch Dunes evening primrose (Oenothera deltoides subsp. howellii), at sites along a non-native grass invasion gradient in California, USA. We then scaled relationships between invasion and plant density across the species' range using spatial models and remote sensing data. Adult and juvenile O. deltoides subsp. howellii densities were more than 10 times higher in non-invaded areas (grids with 10% total plant cover) when compared to highly-invaded areas (grids with 80% total plant cover). The ratio of O. deltoides subsp. howellii juveniles to adults decreased to less than 1 at 54% total cover, highlighting sensitivity of the regeneration niche to invasion. Spatial models mapped hotspots of O. deltoides subsp. howellii abundance and population structure across the landscape at sub-meter scales. Scaling the impacts of increasing invasion on plant species of conservation concern holds promise when coupled with remote sensing approaches, especially in naturally low-cover ecosystems where readily available metrics (e.g., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) can be used to quantify invasion. These spatial models inform how future invasive species management may influence population size and spatial distribution of species of conservation concern.

TI Organization of complexity in water limited ecohydrology
SO ECOHYDROLOGY
AB Water limited ecohydrological systems (WLES), with their broad extent, large stores of global terrestrial carbon, potential for large instantaneous fluxes of carbon and water, sensitivity to environmental changes, and likely global expansion, are particularly important ecohydrological systems. Strong nonlinear responses to environmental variability characterize WLES, and the resulting complexity of system dynamics has challenged research focussed on general understanding and site specific predictions. To address this challenge our synthesis brings together current views of complexity from ecological and hydrological sciences to look towards a framework for understanding ecohydrological systems (in particular WLES) as complex adaptive systems (CAS). This synthesis suggests that WLES have many properties similar to CAS. In addition to exhibiting feedbacks, thresholds, and hysteresis, the functioning of WLES is strongly affected by self-organization of both vertical and horizontal structure across multiple scales. As a CAS, key variables for understanding WLES dynamics are related to their potential for adaptation, resistance to variability, and resilience to state changes. Several essential components of CAS, including potential for adaptation and rapid changes between states, pose challenges for modelling and generating predictions of WLES. Model evaluation and predictable quantities may need to focus more directly on temporal or spatial variance in contrast to mean state values for success at understanding system-level characteristics. How coupled climate and vegetation changes will alter available soil, surface and groundwater supplies, and overall biogeochemistry will reflect how self-organizational ecohydrological processes differentially partition precipitation and overall net metabolic functioning.

TI Global assessment of forest quality for threatened terrestrial
   vertebrate species in need of conservation translocation programs
SO PLOS ONE
AB Conservation actions such as habitat protection, restoration, and translocations are critical actions in preventing further extinctions of threatened species. We used the 152 threatened species on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Red List with conservation translocations as a recommended conservation action to access the habitat quality of these species' ranges. We determined where multi-species conservation translocation and forest restoration efforts can be concentrated. To determine the habitat quality of species' ranges, we assessed forest cover, forest restoration potential, protected area status, and invasive species concerns. Forty-four percent (67 species) of species with translocations recommended have part of their range in a protected area, existing forest cover, and currently no invasive species risk. However, the majority (85 species) currently need habitat management (63 species), invasive species control (71 species), or protection (34 species). We also identified key differences between species recommended for reintroductions (115 species) and benign introductions (37 species), such as the percentage of a species' range within a protected area, in which reintroductions (median = 7.4%) had more than benign introductions (median = 0.9%). Mauritius, central Africa, eastern Australia and Himalaya regions each have areas with range overlap of three or more species recommended for translocations and forest restoration potential. For those species with CT programs in place, mean forest cover was 32% and restoration potential was 16%, suggesting potential minimum habitat requirements for initial releases. Results provide a global perspective on reintroduction and translocation needs of threatened species with evidenced-based information on habitat quality, i.e. forest restoration potential, forest cover, protected areas, and invasive species control, to aid conservation translocation scientists and ultimately improve the success of such projects.

TI Stochastic models for the Trojan Y-Chromosome eradication strategy of an
   invasive species
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL DYNAMICS
AB The Trojan Y-Chromosome (TYC) strategy, an autocidal genetic bio-control method, has been proposed to eliminate invasive alien species. In this work, we develop a Markov jump process model for this strategy, and we verify that there is a positive probability for wild-type females going extinct within a finite time. Moreover, when sex-reversed Trojan females are introduced at a constant population size, we formulate a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model as an approximation to the proposed Markov jump process model. Using the SDE model, we investigate the probability distribution and expectation of the extinction time of wild-type females by solving Kolmogorov equations associated with these statistics. The results indicate how the probability distribution and expectation of the extinction time are shaped by the initial conditions and the model parameters.

AB Under the new form of economic development in our country, with the growth of dynamic and the complexity of internal and external environment of enterprise, various kinds of uncertain events have emerged in an endless so that the risks faced by enterprises are increasing, how to effectively identify and control dynamic risks for managers are key elements for the sustainable development of enterprises. Biological immune system is a complex adaptive system, can quickly identify and resist the risk, draw lessons from this principle, the biological immune provides a new idea and method to identify dynamic risk effectively for the enterprise. Combing with the literatures, we found that there is a certain progress about the current research of enterprise dynamic risk identification under biological immune perspective, but there is not a set of relatively mature method system. Therefore, this article makes reference to the ideas of the biological immune, on the basis of immune identification mechanism, from two aspects of dynamic risk definition and ascension of identification accuracy to implement extensions of dynamic risk identification of biological immune mechanism, build a set of DRI biological immune system extension method contains dynamic memory automatic identification and variable fuzzy automatic identification system, and carry out the simulation experiment of multi-agent on Netlogo simulation platform to verify the effectiveness of this method. This study extend and expand the enterprise dynamic risk identification theory, enrich the literature of biological immune mechanism of enterprise dynamic risk identification, provide application guide on the problem of dynamic risk identification in other areas.

SO AQUATIC INVASIONS
AB This paper is the first attempt to compile a list of the non-indigenous aquatic invertebrate species currently known to occur in the Ebro River basin (Northeast Spain). A total of 23 exotic aquatic species have been recorded in this area, and one more (the branchiobdellida Xironogiton victoriensis) may also be present in this Iberian basin. Due to the negative impacts that biological invasions cause to ecosystems and to human activities, it is important to state the introduction pathways and prevent the spread of already introduced species. In order to fight against biological alien species invasions, development of national strategies on invasive alien species and international cooperation are considered essential.

TI Reimagining large-scale open-water fisheries governance through adaptive
   comanagement in hilsa shad sanctuaries
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB Almost a half million fishers in Bangladesh are predominantly reliant on the hilsa shad (Tenualosa ilisha) fishery in the Meghna River and estuarine ecosystem. This paper adopts a broadened concept of social-ecological traps to frame the complex dynamics that emerge from social and ecological interactions in this highly natural resource-dependent social-ecological system (SES). We analyze how endogenous self-reinforcing processes in the system and poor initial conditions, particularly debt and lack of livelihood options outside fisheries, keep fishing households in poverty. We identify a policy decision in favor of incentive-based fisheries management as a critical juncture that influenced a trajectory of recovery in hilsa shad stocks in this complex adaptive system. Normative assessment of stakeholder perceptions indicates that fishers perceive a nominal improvement in well-being as a result of this policy. Compensation in return for compliance with a seasonal fishing ban in sanctuary areas does not, however, disrupt trap dynamics perpetuating the cycle of poverty, social exclusion, and political disempowerment in which fishing households are entrenched. Poverty and lack of alternative livelihood opportunities remain significant reasons for noncompliance with the ban as long as fishers do not have any meaningful representation in resource management and decision making. A secured tenure system through adaptive comanagement involving fishers in monitoring and enforcement of compliance with fishing bans, supported by sustainable finance for livelihood improvements outside of natural resource exploitation and predicated on responsive and accountable institutions for and by people who depend on the fishery, can form the foundation for local stewardship in a unique demonstration of contemporary large-scale open-water fisheries governance in this complex SES.

TI Invasive species in grassland habitat: an ecological threat to the
   greater one-horned rhino (Rhinoceros unicornis)
SO PACHYDERM
AB The successes achieved in Assam towards conservation and management of greater one-horned rhinos (Rhinoceros unicornis) are often overshadowed by a few poaching incidences. Rhino conservation efforts made by the Assam Forest Department, assisted by communities and civil society organizations, have made it possible to downgrade the status of greater one-horned rhinos from Endangered to Vulnerable on IUCN's 2008 Red Lists of Threatened Species. One of the major threats besides poaching is the slow and steady intrusion of invasive species in grassland habitats, which directly reduces suitable flora for rhinos and other herbivores. This matter has not yet been highlighted to attract conservation intervention and support. The increasing invasion of weeds that has been observed in Nepal and India's grassland habitats in the past decade needs scientific intervention to ensure the long-term conservation of rhino habitats. Based on available information, we portray the threats posed by invasive species towards the survival of greater one-horned rhinos in India and Nepal.

TI Harnessing Insights from Social-Ecological Systems Research for
   Monitoring Sustainable Development
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The United Nations' Agenda 2030 marks significant progress towards sustainable development by making explicit the intention to integrate previously separate social, economic and environmental agendas. Despite this intention, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which were adopted to implement the agenda, are fragmented in their formulation and largely sectoral. We contend that while the design of the SDG monitoring is based on a systems approach, it still misses most of the dynamics and complexity relevant to sustainability outcomes. We propose that insights from the study of social-ecological systems offer a more integrated approach to the implementation of Agenda 2030, particularly the monitoring of progress towards sustainable development outcomes. Using five key features highlighted by the study of social-ecological systems (SESs) relevant to sustainable development: (1) social-ecological feedbacks, (2) resilience, (3) heterogeneity, (4) nonlinearity, and (5) cross-scale dynamics. We analyze the current set of SDG indicators based on these features to explore current progress in making them operational. Our analysis finds that 59% of the indicators account for heterogeneity, 33% for cross-scale dynamics, 23% for nonlinearities, and 18% and 17%, respectively, for social-ecological feedbacks and resilience. Our findings suggest limited use of complex SES science in the current design of SDG monitoring, but combining our findings with recent studies of methods to operationalize SES features suggests future directions for sustainable development monitoring for the current as well as post 2030 set of indicators.

AB Populations live in habitats whose quality varies spatially and temporally. Understanding how populations deal with these variable habitats can aid our understanding of theoretical issues, and practical issues of biological invasions and biodiversity conservation. I investigate these issues by superimposing simple models of population growth and dispersal on spatiotemporally fractal landscapes, and examining the properties of the landscapes, and of the populations inhabiting them. The properties of the simulated landscape sequences are comparable to those of real habitats. The simulated populations exhibit a range of dynamic behaviors; these behaviors are strongly influenced by the fractal parameters of the landscapes. The results may help explain several important phenomena seen in reintroductions of threatened and endangered species, introductions of biological control agents, and biological invasions. These phenomena include frequently observed lags between population introduction and initial population growth and spread, and the observed high frequency of failure of introductions.

SO SCIENTIFIC DATA
AB The Country Compendium of the Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (GRIIS) is a collation of data across 196 individual country checklists of alien species, along with a designation of those species with evidence of impact at a country level. The Compendium provides a baseline for monitoring the distribution and invasion status of all major taxonomic groups, and can be used for the purpose of global analyses of introduced (alien, non-native, exotic) and invasive species (invasive alien species), including regional, single and multi-species taxon assessments and comparisons. It enables exploration of gaps and inferred absences of species across countries, and also provides one means for updating individual GRIIS Checklists. The Country Compendium is, for example, instrumental, along with data on first records of introduction, for assessing and reporting on invasive alien species targets, including for the Convention on Biological Diversity and Sustainable Development Goals. The GRIIS Country Compendium provides a baseline and mechanism for tracking the spread of introduced and invasive alien species across countries globally.

TI EU adopts innovative legislation on invasive species: a step towards a
   global response to biological invasions?
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB Europe has adopted innovative legislation on invasive species that could signal a step-change in the global response to biological invasion threats. The discussion that took place within EU institutions-EU Parliament, European Commission, and the Member States-permitted significant improvement on the initial proposal presented by the European Commission, including removing the initial 50 species cap, explicitly allowing national authorities to take stringent measures on invasive species of national concern, and encouraging coordinated approaches to invasive species in boundary areas. An independent "Scientific Forum" to inform implementation has been introduced, and the EU Regulation will permit only limited licensing for specific activities using invasive alien species. However, the real strength of the legislation will largely depend on the decisions of a committee of representatives of the Member States, with the risk that the real enforcement will be limited by political and economic, rather than scientific, considerations. In this regard it will be crucial to set up a framework of roles and responsibilities among the different bodies that ensure transparent and objective decision processes. Also, it will be essential that adequate resources be secured for implementing the provisions of the legislation. Finally, the regulatory approach introduced by the Regulation will have only a limited impact unless European citizens raise their awareness of this threat and adopt more responsible behaviours.

TI The Sphere of Tourism Resilience
SO TOURISM RECREATION RESEARCH
AB The concept of resilience offers a coherent interpretation of linked human and environmental processes, and is increasingly accepted as a framework for understanding world systems. Resilience theory was developed in the early 1970s to model fluctuations in ecological systems, and was later applied to linked social-ecological systems. It has been explored in a range of anthropogenic contexts, including recent applications to tourism. Resilience is related to vulnerability approaches, popular amongst development practitioners, and has roots in complexity science. Tourism is a good example of a complex adaptive system and, as Farrell and Twining-Ward (2004) remarked, lends itself to the integrative, interdisciplinary and non-linear approach to interpreting the world which is fundamental to resilience. Applied to tourism systems, resilience explains the deeper forces underlying Butler's 'Tourism Area Life-Cycle', proposed in 1980 when tourism destination development was thought to progress in a linear fashion. Later versions of the model proposed a 'rejuvenation' stage, but the resilience concept goes further in explaining the cyclical and complex nature of systems, based on recovery from perturbation and the accumulation of various forms of capital which allow faster renewal and stronger structures. This paper explains the cycle and applies it to tourism in Asia, drawing on research into World Heritage Sites, community-based tourism and recovery from the Asian tsunami. Although resilience and complexity science are inherently anti-reductionist, factors underlying resilient systems are identified in order to link the conceptual discussion to a real world realm and formed into a model termed 'the Sphere of Tourism Resilience'.

TI Advancing climate resilient development pathways since the IPCC's fifth
   assessment report
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB Development processes and action on climate change are closely interlinked. This is recognised by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its fifth assessment report, which reports on climate-resilient pathways, understood as development trajectories towards sustainable development which include adaptation and mitigation. The upcoming sixth assessment report dedicates a chapter to climate resilient development pathways. In this context, this paper asks what conceptual and empirical advances on climate resilient development pathways were made since the fifth assessment report. Through a literature review, this paper analyses goals and approaches for climate resilient development pathways, and discusses what conceptual advances have and could still be made. We find little evidence of dedicated concept development. Rather, we observe conceptual ambiguity. Literature showed four non-exclusive clusters of approaches: (a) climate action oriented, (b) social-learning and co-creation oriented, (c) mainstreaming oriented and (d) transformation oriented. We recommend operationalising climate resilient development pathways as the process of consolidating climate action and development decisions towards long-term sustainable development. This process requires explicit engagement with aspirations of actors, and connecting past developments with future aspirations and understandings of risk. Working with multiple pathways allows us to embed flexibility, anticipation and learning in planning. A greater focus is needed on issues linked to justice and equity as climate resilient development pathways will inevitably involve trade-offs. Substantiating the concept of climate resilient development pathways has the potential to bridge climate and development perspectives, which may otherwise remain separated in development and climate policy, practice and science.

TI Visibility from Roads Predict the Distribution of Invasive Fishes in
   Agricultural Ponds
SO PLOS ONE
AB Propagule pressure and habitat characteristics are important factors used to predict the distribution of invasive alien species. For species exhibiting strong propagule pressure because of human-mediated introduction of species, indicators of introduction potential must represent the behavioral characteristics of humans. This study examined 64 agricultural ponds to assess the visibility of ponds from surrounding roads and its value as a surrogate of propagule pressure to explain the presence and absence of two invasive fish species. A three-dimensional viewshed analysis using a geographic information system quantified the visual exposure of respective ponds to humans. Binary classification trees were developed as a function of their visibility from roads, as well as five environmental factors: river density, connectivity with upstream dam reservoirs, pond area, chlorophyll a concentration, and pond drainage. Traditional indicators of human-mediated introduction (road density and proportion of urban land-use area) were alternatively included for comparison instead of visual exposure. The presence of Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) was predicted by the ponds' higher visibility from roads and pond connection with upstream dam reservoirs. Results suggest that fish stocking into ponds and their dispersal from upstream sources facilitated species establishment. Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) distribution was constrained by chlorophyll a concentration, suggesting their lower adaptability to various environments than that of Bluegill. Based on misclassifications from classification trees for Bluegill, pond visual exposure to roads showed greater predictive capability than traditional indicators of human-mediated introduction. Pond visibility is an effective predictor of invasive species distribution. Its wider use might improve management and mitigate further invasion. The visual exposure of recipient ecosystems to humans is important for many invasive species that spread with frequent instances of human-mediated introduction.

TI Legal hunting for conservation of highly threatened species: The case of
   African rhinos
SO CONSERVATION LETTERS
AB Legal hunting of threatened species-and especially the recreational practice of "trophy hunting"-is controversial with ethical objections being increasingly voiced. Less public attention has been paid to how hunting (even of threatened species) can be useful as a conservation tool, and likely outcomes if this was stopped. As case studies, we examine the regulated legal hunting of two African rhino species in South Africa and Namibia over the last half-century. Counter-intuitively, removing a small number of specific males can enhance population demography and genetic diversity, encourage range expansion, and generate meaningful socioeconomic benefits to help fund effective conservation (facilitated by appropriate local institutional arrangements). Legal hunting of African rhinos has been sustainable, with very small proportions of populations hunted each year, and greater numbers of both species today in these countries than when controlled recreational hunting began. Terminating this management option and significant funding source could have negative consequences at a time when rhinos are being increasingly viewed as liabilities and revenue generation for wildlife areas is being significantly impacted by COVID-19. Provided that there is appropriate governance, conservation of certain highly threatened species can be supported by cautiously selective and limited legal hunting.

TI A trait-based approach to the conservation of threatened plant species
SO ORYX
AB Traditionally the vulnerability of threatened species to extinction has been assessed by studying their environment, genetics and population dynamics. A more comprehensive understanding of the factors promoting or limiting the long-term persistence of threatened species could be achieved by conducting an analysis of their functional responses to changing environments, their ecological interactions, and their role in ecosystem functioning. These less traditional research areas can be unified in a trait-based approach, a recent methodological advance in ecology that is being used to link individual-level functions to species, community and ecosystem processes to provide mechanistic explanations of observed patterns, particularly in changing environments. We illustrate how trait-based information can be translated into well-defined conservation strategies, using the example of Dioon sonorense, an Endangered cycad endemic to north-western Mexico. Scientific information yielded by trait-based research, coupled with existing knowledge derived from well-established traditional approaches, could facilitate the development of more integrative conservation strategies to promote the long-term persistence of individual threatened species. A comprehensive database of functional traits of threatened species would be of value in assisting the implementation of the trait-based approach.

TI Adaptiveness to Enhance the Sustainability of Farming Systems
SO SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE, VOL 2
AB During the last decade the context in which farmers must manage their farm has changed rapidly, and often with little warning. Dramatic price swings for agricultural commodities, more stringent quality requirements, new environmental regulations, the debates surrounding genetically modified crops, extreme climatic events, the demand for energy crops, the revision of the Common Agricultural Policy and the consequences of the financial crisis all create uncertainty regarding future threats and potentials. During such turbulent times, a one-sided focus on efficient production is no longer enough. Farmers also need to be able to cope with unexpected events and to adapt to new developments. Based on a literature review, we identify three strategies that strengthen the adaptive capacity of a farm: learning through experimenting and monitoring its outcomes, ensuring a flexible farm organisation to increase the options for new activities by the farm family, and diversifying to spread risks and create buffers. Implementing these strategies enlarges the farmer's room to manoeuvre and allows identifying transition options. These options do not depend only on the farm itself, but also on the farmer's ability to mobilise external resources and to engage in collective action. Change is then no longer seen as a disturbance, but as a trigger for the reorganisation of resources, and for the renewal of the farm organisation and activities. Implementing these strategies comes at a cost, so that farmers need to tackle the inevitable trade-offs between efficiency and adaptability. However, unless farmers master this challenge they may not be able to ensure the sustainability of their farms.

TI The Social Dimensions of Biological Invasions in South Africa
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS IN SOUTH AFRICA
SE Invading Nature-Springer Series in Invasion Ecology
AB This chapter examines current knowledge relating to the human and social dimensions of biological invasions in South Africa. We do so by advancing 12 propositions and examining the evidence for or against each using South African literature. The propositions cover four broad issues: how people cause invasions; how they conceptualise them; effects of invasive species on people; and peoples' responses to them. The propositions we assess include: (1) intentional introductions were and continue to reflect the social ethos of the time; (2) people go to great lengths to ensure that newly introduced species establish themselves; (3) human-mediated modifications help invasive species to establish; (4) how people think about and study invasive species is strongly shaped by social-ecological contexts; (5) knowledge and awareness of invasive species is low amongst the general public; (6) personal values are the primary factor affecting perceptions of invasive alien species and their control; (7) specific social-ecological contexts mediate how invasive species affect people; (8) research on social effects of invasive species primarily focuses on negative impacts; (9) the negative social impacts of invasive species on local livelihoods are of more concern to people than impacts on biodiversity; (10) people are less willing to manage species regarded as 'charismatic'; (11) social heterogeneity increases conflicts around the management of biological invasions; and (12) engagement with society is key to successful management. By advancing and questioning propositions, we were able to determine what is known, provide evidence for where gaps lie, and thus identify areas for future research.

TI Quantifying socio-economic novelty in fisheries social-ecological
   systems
SO FISH AND FISHERIES
AB Socio-economic development has shaped fisheries social-ecological systems (SES) worldwide across different scales. No work has yet undertaken how this development led to novel, not experienced before, systems structure in marine SES. Here, we quantify socio-economic novelty as the degree of dissimilarity relative to a specific spatiotemporal baseline in the Baltic Sea fisheries SES between 1975 and 2015. We used catch by "gears," catch by "commercial groups" and trade ("import" and "export") as respective indicators of novelty at national, regional and international governance levels. We found that socio-economic novelty increased over time nonlinearly in relation to the 1975-1979 baseline. The contribution to total novelty shifted from the dominance of "gears" and "commercial groups" in the late 1990s and early 2000s to "import" and "export" after the mid-2000s, i.e. from national and regional levels to the international level. The fastest increase in novelty occurred with the trade dominance shift, primarily related to monetary value rather than quantity. Spatially, novelty emerged with a large difference across countries, and a major contribution by Sweden, Denmark and Poland. We identified the influence of different management interventions and governance actions on the emergence of novelty in the Baltic SES. The decreasing socio-economic novelty at national and regional levels could indicate reduced variability due to management intervention in recent years which might decrease SES resilience to shocks. Calculating socio-economic novelty and studying its drivers at different scales could provide a better understanding of SES complexity and inform urgently needed adaptation and transformation towards sustainable future pathways.

TI Economic costs of protecting islands from invasive alien species
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB Biological invasions represent a key threat to insular systems and have pronounced impacts across environments and economies. The ecological impacts have received substantial focus, but the socioeconomic impacts are poorly synthesized across spatial and temporal scales. We used the InvaCost database, the most comprehensive assessment of published economic costs of invasive species, to assess economic impacts on islands worldwide. We analyzed socioeconomic costs across differing expenditure types and examined temporal trends across islands that differ in their political geography-island nation states, overseas territories, and islands of continental countries. Over US$36 billion in total costs (including damages and management) has occurred on islands from 1965 to 2020 due to invasive species' impacts. Nation states incurred the greatest total and management costs, and islands of continental countries incurred costs of similar magnitude, both far higher than those in overseas territories. Damage-loss costs were significantly lower, but with qualitatively similar patterns across differing political geographies. The predominance of management spending differs from the pattern found for most countries examined and suggests important knowledge gaps in the extent of many damage-related socioeconomic impacts. Nation states spent the greatest proportion of their gross domestic products countering these costs, at least 1 order of magnitude higher than other locations. Most costs were borne by authorities and stakeholders, demonstrating the key role of governmental and nongovernmental bodies in addressing island invasions. Temporal trends revealed cost increases across all island types, potentially reflecting efforts to tackle invasive species at larger, more socially complex scales. Nevertheless, the already high total economic costs of island invasions substantiate the role of biosecurity in reducing and preventing invasive species arrivals to reduce strains on limited financial resources and avoid threats to sustainable development goals.

TI Disentangling the effects of multiple anthropogenic drivers on the
   decline of two tropical dry forest trees
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB 1. Tropical plant populations are often subject to multiple types of anthropogenic disturbance. Effective management requires disentangling the effects of these disturbances and prioritizing interventions for the driver(s) most responsible for population decline. However, the effects of multiple drivers on plant population dynamics are rarely examined. 2. We assessed the independent and combined effects of common anthropogenic disturbances on the transient and long-term population dynamics of two economically important, declining tree species in an Indian dry forest. Specifically, we drew on 10 years of demographic monitoring to assess the effects of non-timber forest product (NTFP) harvest and two invasive species (an understorey shrub Lantana camara and a mistletoe Taxillus tomentosus) on amla (Phyllanthus emblica and Phyllanthus indofischeri) populations. 3. Although fruit harvest has been blamed for declining amla populations, the current policy and management strategies implemented to restrict it have little effect on long-term stochastic growth rates (?s) of amla both with and without invasive species. In contrast, mistletoes significantly decreased ?s of both species. 4. Lantana had both direct and indirect effects on P.similar to emblica, causing a regeneration bottleneck. Lantana had a direct negative effect on seeding and sapling growth, whereas populations without lantana experienced higher levels of grazing by wild animals. Over 10 years, P.similar to emblica populations dropped to 16% of their original size in areas with invasive species. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results illustrate that mistletoe and lantana, not fruit harvest, are the main drivers of amla decline, and these species are likely to be driving the decline of other Indian dry forest tree species. Management directed only at limiting fruit harvest will be ineffective. Instead, control of both invasive species combined with temporary protection from grazing is urgently needed. The ban on fruit harvest in Indian protected areas is not an effective conservation policy for these species. Harvest is not necessarily the main cause of decline for NTFP species. Management plans for NTFP and other at-risk species must consider the relative effects of different drivers of decline, including direct and indirect effects of invasive species.

TI Assessing the historical adaptive cycles of an urban social-ecological
   system and its potential future resilience: the case of Xochimilco,
   Mexico City
SO REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB As the bulk of the world's population becomes urban, maintaining urban ecosystem services for environmental and social well-being in cities is crucial. According to resilience theory, maintaining such services requires for a complex adaptive systems perspective that helps in identifying key elements and dynamics behind cross-scale social-ecological interactions. In this context, the objective of this article is to use a resilience "lens" to problematize the imminent loss of an urban wetland using the adaptive cycle model as a heuristic tool. Our case study focuses on the Xochimilco wetland, located in the southern periphery of Mexico City. Xochimilco is characterized by the presence of a complex system of raised bed wetland agriculture (the chinampa system), which was established over 1000 years ago; currently, despite having a recognized cultural and environmental value, it is threatened by increasing urban sprawl, over-exploitation of the aquifer, and water contamination. By conducting a historical analysis of the Xochimilco social-ecological system, we assess how it has gone through phases of the adaptive cycle. As a result, we identify critical elements of the system's historically maintained resilience and main drivers of system change. From such findings, we present some insights on the possibilities of maintaining the system's resilience and guidance for future management strategies for the Xochimilco wetland. Lastly, we reflect on the scope and limitations of using a resilience-based approach and an adaptive cycle analysis for addressing urban sustainability problems, especially in cities in the Global South.

AB The research identifies, investigates and analyses taxa of conservation significance in Mala Planina and the negative influence of invasive species in the area as a major threat to biodiversity. The study follows UN's Sustainable Development Goal 15.
   Cameral research, including exploration of the Red Data Book of the Republic of Bulgaria has been done. Remote methods are represented. ArcGIS maps examining the localities of the species are provided. Several terrain expeditions add value to the study. The territory is home to 21 plant, 4 fungal species and 30 animal species included in the Red Data Book. Some of them cannot be found anywhere else in the country. This impressive richness is in contradiction with the fact that 24 invasive species are a part of the flora and some of them are included in the List of "Worst invasive alien species threatening biodiversity in Europe". Although some invasive species are dispersed through the area, there are many species of conservation importance that also thrive there. The study can be used as a base for further investigation, as well as an example for other studies, concerning sustainable development.

AB Rocinha, located in the city of Rio de Janeiro, is one the largest favela of Latin-America. Founded in the early 1930's it is now home of more than 160000 inhabitants, and it is characterized by low water quality, poor housing, lack of drainage and sanitation systems, and of green and public spaces. This paper presents the preliminary results of a joint research project between the Politecnico di Milano and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) for the improvement of the urban quality, health, livability and inclusiveness of Rocinha, that moves from an upgrading process of the environmental performance of the existing built environment. The project, in the frame the social responsibility program of Politecnico di Milano (Polisocial), is based on a multidisciplinary and integrated design methodology named IMM (Integrated Modification Methodology). The research aims to demonstrate that in a planet where the informal settlements are exponentially growing, strategies to improve the quality of life of their inhabitants are possible, and preliminary results, mostly achieved in the diagnostic phase of the process, are presented. Rocinha is seen as a complex system that has been investigated in its own morphological structure and the related environmental performance, focusing on: climate and energy, ecosystem services, waste management and their relation with urban morphology. This phase opens up to the next phases, specifically the intervention and retrofitting, that intend to select intervention areas and priorities and then to objectively size the implementation in Rocinha.

Through a comparative analysis of the data on introduction, with the information on the impact of alien mammals on native and threatened species of Europe, the present study also provides an objective assessment of the overall impact of mammal introductions on European biodiversity, including information on impact mechanisms. The results of this assessment confirm the constant increase of mammal invasions in Europe, with no indication of a reduction of the rate of introduction. The study also confirms the severe impact of alien mammals, which directly threaten a significant number of native species, including many highly threatened species. The results could help to prioritize species for response, as required by international conventions and obligations.

TI Karyotypic study of Callicebus coimbrai: a rare and threatened primate
   species from Brazil
SO CARYOLOGIA
AB The genus Callicebus comprises 28 species distributed in the Amazonia and Atlantic forest biomes. This paper describes the karyotype of C. coimbrai, a rare and threatened species and compares it with related species (C. personatus and C. nigrifrons). The karyotype was characterized by G-, C-sequential and NOR banding. C. coimbrai presented 2n=44 chromosomes, with G-banding pattern similar to that observed in C. personatus (2n=44) and C. nigrifrons (2n=42). The karyotypic divergence between C. coimbrai and C. nigrifrons is explained by a single rearrangement of centric fusion/fission. The chromosomal data obtained suggest a closer association between C. coimbrai and C. personatus than with C. nigrifrons.

TI Predator recognition and responses in the endangered Macquarie perch
   (Macquaria australasica)
SO MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
AB Macquarie perch, Macquaria austalasica, is an endangered species endemic to southern Australia whose distribution is highly fragmented and continues to decline. Key threatening processes include habitat destruction, dams and weirs, overfishing and interactions with introduced species. Here, we examined the responses of small and large Macquarie perch to two native predators and to the introduced redfin perch, Perca fluviatilis. Our results showed that Macquarie perch generally avoided large-bodied native predators but was attracted to small-bodied native predators. Responses to large and small redfin perch lay between these two extremes, suggesting that the Macquarie perch does treat these foreign fish as potential threats. Macquarie perch relied on both visual and chemical cues to identify predators, although its response tended to be stronger when exposed to visual cues. The results suggest that Macquarie perch has the capacity to recognise and respond to invasive species in a threat-sensitive manner, which has positive implications for the conservation management of the species.

TI Traditional cultural landscape in Vinales, Cuba
SO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB The Vinales Valley has a wide range of biological and cultural values thanks to both its landscape diversity and the use of low-impact agricultural practices. The area was recognized as one of the key biodiversity hotspots on the planet where it is possible to find ammonite fossils, as well as remains of the land dinosaur Diplodocus. The Valley is also renowned for its hills such as alturas de pizarras formed by the oldest rocks in Cuba and the Sierra de los Organos mogotes, which are extraordinarily unique geomorphological limestone formations on the planet. The flora of the region is characterized by its endemism and wealth where the cork palm (Microcycas calocoma) is the most popular, dating back to the carboniferous period of the Palaeozoic, it is the only variety declared as National Natural Monument in Cuba. The pictographs in several caves betray the presence of aboriginal inhabitants and the bohio, which outlived the first settlers and went on to become the typical tobacco-curing barn that spread throughout the Valley from the 17th century to the present day. It is precisely the tobacco-related works such as the art of cultivating the plant, rolling and smoking the cigar, learned by Spanish conquerors directly from the indigenous population, that today stand as a symbol of genuine cultural heritage. The Vinales landscape shows a high degree of diversity and cultural variety resulting from specific management systems and a strong social and environmental involvement. This study reviews the essential features of the globally important agricultural heritage system as a complex, adaptive system, to improve the existing set of criteria for sustainable agro-ecological management contributing to the preservation of biodiversity.

TI Policy experimentation and innovation as a response to complexity in
   China's management of health reforms
SO GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH
AB There are increasing criticisms of dominant models for scaling up health systems in developing countries and a recognition that approaches are needed that better take into account the complexity of health interventions. Since Reform and Opening in the late 1970s, Chinese government has managed complex, rapid and intersecting reforms across many policy areas. As with reforms in other policy areas, reform of the health system has been through a process of trial and error. There is increasing understanding of the importance of policy experimentation and innovation in many of China's reforms; this article argues that these processes have been important in rebuilding China's health system. While China's current system still has many problems, progress is being made in developing a functioning system able to ensure broad population access. The article analyses Chinese thinking on policy experimentation and innovation and their use in management of complex reforms. It argues that China's management of reform allows space for policy tailoring and innovation by sub-national governments under a broad agreement over the ends of reform, and that shared understandings of policy innovation, alongside informational infrastructures for the systemic propagation and codification of useful practices, provide a framework for managing change in complex environments and under conditions of uncertainty in which 'what works' is not knowable in advance. The article situates China's use of experimentation and innovation in management of health system reform in relation to recent literature which applies complex systems thinking to global health, and concludes that there are lessons to be learnt from China's approaches to managing complexity in development of health systems for the benefit of the poor.

AB Imperiled plants are sometimes protected as endangered or threatened species at state and national levels. However, politically based geographic units fall short for conservation purposes. For example, only 19 percent of plant species considered imperiled in the San Juan region of Colorado and New Mexico appeared on recent state or federal endangered species lists. Conservation of imperiled plants by ecological area is proposed. This would help (a) safeguard plant populations of evolutionary significance; (b) maintain the integrity of biotic communities; (c) draw attention to imperiled regional endemics, which often fail to make government endangered species lists; and (d) preserve wild plant populations locally for conservation education and for medicinal, aesthetic, scientific, and other cultural reasons. A focus on ecological areas would broaden modem conservation practice, making it better able to protect and restore the natural world.

TI Anticipating endangerment
SO BIOSOCIETIES
AB The last two decades have witnessed an explosion of national and global lists of threatened and endangered species. This article draws on interviews with prominent list managers and observations of their assessments to explore the scientific practices of list-making in the context of species conservation. Delving into the complex calculations of risk and threat that take place in the process of ranking non-human species based on their probability of extinction, the article explores the threatened species list as a biopolitical technology of catastrophe governance. My focus on two prominent lists-the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and NatureServe's assessment system-illuminates various characteristics of futuristic governance through the threatened species list, including its properties as a list-database hybrid and as a barometer of life. I also explore the biopolitical regime of ranking life and its focus on species, its governing of direct ( human) threats and the nature-culture binary that this promotes, its status as scientific and apolitical and its aspiration for global reach, and the "species experts'' versus "threat experts'' divide that underpins its operations. The article concludes with a discussion on the effects of the lists' increasing automation and algorithmization, as seen from the perspective of the lists' managers. The lists' "threat calculator'' in particular quantifies and projects present and future threats to non-human species, using fuzzy numbers, ordinal scales, and open standards to anticipate and prevent the forthcoming Sixth Extinction.

TI WHO LOVES RATS? A RENEWED PLEA FOR THE MANAGED RELOCATIONS OF ENDANGERED
   SPECIES
SO ETHICS AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB The focus of this paper is on managed relocations and endangered wild species. The main argument is that managed relocations should be a viable policy option in the toolbox of conservation management despite any ecological risks. This argument is defended on the basis of recent research that demonstrates that not all alien species are invasive species, and that not all invasive species have negative ecological impacts. In other words, a nuanced case-by-case approach is needed. This argument is presented within the context of the Bramble Cay Melomys, a rat-like creature and the first mammal to become extinct as a result of anthropogenic climate change. A secondary objective of this paper is to explore some of the future economic and policy challenges likely to face managed relocations.

TI Multi-tier sustainable supply chain management: a case study of a global
   food retailer
SO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB PurposeImplementing sustainable practices in multi-tier supply chains (MTSCs) is a difficult task. This study aims to investigate why such endeavours fail and how MTSC partners can address them. Design/methodology/approachA single-case study of a global food retail company was used in this study. Semi-structured interviews with the case firm and its first- and second-tier suppliers were used to collect data, which were then qualitatively analysed using thematic analysis. FindingsMajor barriers impeding the implementation of sustainability in multi-tier food supply chains were revealed such as the cost of sustainability, knowledge gap, lack of infrastructure and supply chain complexity. Furthermore, the findings reveal five possible solutions such as multi-tier collaboration and partnership, diffusion of innovation along the chain, supply chain mapping, sustainability performance measurement and capacity building, all of which can aid in the improvement of sustainability practices. Research limitations/implicationsFuture research should investigate how specific barriers and drivers affect specific aspects of sustainability, pointing practitioners to specific links between the variables that can aid in tailoring sustainability oriented investment. Practical implicationsThis research supports managerial comprehension of MTSC sustainability, pointing out ways to improve sustainability performance despite the complex multi-tier system of food supply chains. Originality/valueThe research on MTSC sustainability is still growing, and this research contributes to the debate about how MTSCs can become more sustainable from the perspective of the triple bottom line, particularly food supply chains which face significant sustainability challenges.

AB The Mount Kilimanjaro guereza colobus monkey is endemic to northern Tanzania and southern Kenya, occurring on and near Mount Kilimanjaro/Mount Meru. Currently referred to as "Colobus guereza caudatus Thomas 1885", this monkey is geographically very isolated, and phenotypically distinct from all other taxa of guereza monkeys. As such, application of the "Phylogenetic Species Concept" resurrects the Mount Kilimanjaro guereza to specific rank as Colobus caudatus. The geographic range of C. caudatus is small (ca. 4030 km(2)) and in decline, as is the number of individuals and area of habitat. Colobus caudatus qualifies as an IUCN Red List globally "Endangered" species, as a nationally "Endangered" species in Tanzania, and as a nationally "Critically Endangered" species in Kenya. Colobus caudatus is Kenya's most threatened species of primate. Recommendations for research and conservation actions are provided.

TI Fuzzy set theory for predicting the potential distribution and
   cost-effective monitoring of invasive species
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB The presence of invasive species has been predicted using species distribution models (SDMs) and presence-only data to assist environmental management. However, SDMs include substantial uncertainty and the lack of absence data hampers the use of probabilistic predictions. A non-statistical theoretical basis able to deal with uncertainty on which to model invasive species distributions with presence-only data is thus needed. Fuzzy set theory satisfies these two requirements but has been little used. This paper proposes a fuzzy modelling approach for predicting invasive species potential distributions using presence-only data and SDMs to support the design of cost-effective monitoring schemes. The invasion of Gunnera tinctoria (Molina) Mirbel (Giant rhubarb) in the island of Sao Miguel (the Azores, Portugal) is used as case study. The latter involved the prediction of the potential distribution of the invader using MaxEnt and the selection of priority areas for monitoring the spread of the invader in case of scarcity of resources. In addition, MaxEnt was used within a traditional (non-fuzzy) approach, unable to quantity and report on uncertainty. The results of the fuzzy and non-fuzzy approaches are compared and their differences discussed, thus highlighting the potential benefits of using fuzzy set theory for species distribution modelling and management.

TI Resilience management in social-ecological systems: a working hypothesis
   for a participatory approach
SO CONSERVATION ECOLOGY
AB Approaches to natural resource management are often based on a presumed ability to predict probabilistic responses to management and external drivers such as climate. They also tend to assume that the manager is outside the system being managed. However, where the objectives include long-term sustainability, linked social-ecological systems (SESs) behave as complex adaptive systems, with the managers as integral components of the system. Moreover, uncertainties are large and it may be difficult to reduce them as fast as the system changes. Sustainability involves maintaining the functionality of a system when it is perturbed, or maintaining the elements needed to renew or reorganize if a large perturbation radically alters structure and function. The ability to do this is termed "resilience." This paper presents an evolving approach to analyzing resilience in SESs, as a basis for managing resilience. We propose a framework with four steps, involving close involvement of SES stakeholders. It begins with a stakeholder-led development of a conceptual model of the system, including its historical profile (how it got to be what it is) and preliminary assessments of the drivers of the supply of key ecosystem goods and services. Step 2 deals with identifying the range of unpredictable and uncontrollable drivers, stakeholder visions for the future, and contrasting possible future policies, weaving these three factors into a limited set of future scenarios. Step 3 uses the outputs from steps 1 and 2 to explore the SES for resilience in an iterative way. It generally includes the development of simple models of the system's dynamics for exploring attributes that affect resilience. Step 4 is a stakeholder evaluation of the process and outcomes in terms of policy and management implications. This approach to resilience analysis is illustrated using two stylized examples.

TI Complex Cities and Complexity in Planning
SO PLANLAMA-PLANNING
AB It is becoming ever more clear that cities in the future will not be a continuation of the twentieth century's ones. The interdependence of economies, cultures and institutions at both global and local scales; assemblages of infinite numbers of objects and structures; interactions of agents and stakeholders in that physical environment; and information transmissions equally and pervasively through networks show how cities will change and evolve differently. Under this complexity cities could not be explained only by basic production and consumption relations as well as urban planning could not keep pace with planners' desire only by long-term, static and similar land-use decisions. This brings about a new approach towards cities and urban planning. According to this approach cities are assumed to be complex systems, which are dynamic, non-linear, open and evolutionary, adaptive with emerging properties and self-organizing. Since the 1990s research and model studies based on the complexity theory have been accumulated to understand how cities evolve rather than formulating them. With the technological advents in computers and informatics it is possible to identify agents in a city and their relational behaviors while developing scenarios for the future after specifying phase-transitions and bifurcations in the process. By this way complexity in natural sciences could be adapted to social sciences. In this article, we compile prominent computational and mathematical modeling studies such as fractal cities and cellular automata cities in the complexity literature and critical and narrative studies that highlight strategic spatial planning and policy making issues to open new urban planning approach up for discussion.

TI A meta-analysis of trait differences between invasive and non-invasive
   plant species
SO ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB A major aim in ecology is identifying determinants of invasiveness. We performed a meta-analysis of 117 field or experimental-garden studies that measured pair-wise trait differences of a total of 125 invasive and 196 non-invasive plant species in the invasive range of the invasive species. We tested whether invasiveness is associated with performance-related traits (physiology, leaf-area allocation, shoot allocation, growth rate, size and fitness), and whether such associations depend on type of study and on biogeographical or biological factors. Overall, invasive species had significantly higher values than non-invasive species for all six trait categories. More trait differences were significant for invasive vs. native comparisons than for invasive vs. non-invasive alien comparisons. Moreover, for comparisons between invasive species and native species that themselves are invasive elsewhere, no trait differences were significant. Differences in physiology and growth rate were larger in tropical regions than in temperate regions. Trait differences did not depend on whether the invasive alien species originates from Europe, nor did they depend on the test environment. We conclude that invasive alien species had higher values for those traits related to performance than non-invasive species. This suggests that it might become possible to predict future plant invasions from species traits.

TI Incorporating climate change into invasive species management: insights
   from managers
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB Invasive alien species are likely to interact with climate change, thus necessitating management that proactively addresses both global changes. However, invasive species managers' concerns about the effects of climate change, the degree to which they incorporate climate change into their management, and what stops them from doing so remain unknown. Therefore, we surveyed natural resource managers addressing invasive species across the U.S. about their priorities, concerns, and management strategies in a changing climate. Of the 211 managers we surveyed, most were very concerned about the influence of climate change on invasive species management, but their organizations were significantly less so. Managers reported that lack of funding and personnel limited their ability to effectively manage invasive species, while lack of information limited their consideration of climate change in decision-making. Additionally, managers prioritized research that identifies range-shifting invasive species and native communities resilient to invasions and climate change. Managers also reported that this information would be most effectively communicated through conversations, research summaries, and meetings/symposia. Despite the need for more information, 65% of managers incorporate climate change into their invasive species management through strategic planning, preventative management, changing treatment and control, and increasing education and outreach. These results show the potential for incorporating climate change into management, but also highlight a clear and pressing need for more targeted research, accessible science communication, and two-way dialogue between researchers and managers focused on invasive species and climate change.

In the CPE, the individual properties or attributes of single entities will be dynamically combined to achieve an emergent desired behavior of the ecosystem. It is extremely hard - if not impossible - to control large scale CPE by building a global logic 'top-down' system able to rapidly adapt to changes by instructing each element what to do at each step. Using the latest knowledge of complexity science, we aim to develop a methodological framework for designing large scale CPE capable of generating resilient and scalable structure from the 'bottom-up' by evolving self-organized basic architectural component 'cells.' These cells will be adaptively crafted through dynamic protocols enabling service composition into novel architectural components. The statistical properties displayed by the underlying network structure of the complex distributed system reveals the appropriate parameters on which efficient reliable operation depends. The parameters will be tuned using the dynamical network model of the CPE co-evolved with an 'eNetwork middleware' embedded into the complex system's fabric similar to how DNA molds the fundamental cells in natural systems such that they can evolve to accommodate gradual or abrupt change in the environment or internal operating conditions. Validation on the state-of-the-art testbed recently deployed in the Adaptive Risk Management Lab at UNB enable proof of concept opening the door to applications that will revolutionize several areas of crucial importance, including: blackout-free electricity generation and distribution, optimization of energy consumption, disaster response through deployment of holistic security ecosystems, pandemic mitigation, networked transportation and manufacturing, and environmental monitoring and sustainability assessment.

TI EXPLORING MEASURES OF WHOLE PERSON WELLNESS: INTEGRATIVE WELL-BEING AND
   PSYCHOLOGICAL FLOURISHING
SO EXPLORE-THE JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND HEALING
AB Objectives: Whole systems of complementary and alternative medicine (WSCAM) emphasize positive emergent outcomes for the patient, for example, a sense of well-being. This paper presents a questionnaire-based study in healthy young adults for the purpose of exploring individual differences that contribute to the sense of well-being and to identify characteristics of flourishing versus nonflourishing individuals in terms of nonlinear dynamical systems concepts.
   Methods: Young adult college students (N = 856) completed questionnaires assessing global well-being (Arizona Integrative Outcomes Scale [AIOS]), global physical health, positive and negative mood (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule [PANAS]), resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale), and repressive defensiveness. Next, subjects were divided into flourisher/languisher groups by a previously determined ratio of positive/negative scores established by a study using complex systems methods.
   Results: Positive-to-negative affect (P:N) ratio accounted for more variance in AIDS (R-2 = 0.19; P < .001) than did separate positive or negative PANAS scores or physical health. Flourishers (14.5% of the sample) were significantly higher than languishers in defensiveness and resilience.
   Conclusions: Positive-to-negative affect explains a substantial portion of the variance in well-being of healthy young adults. The low percentage of flourishers in this nonclinical sample is consistent with previous population-based studies and suggests that flourishers are a minority, even in nonclinical settings. Positive-to-negative affect may be a useful variable for subsequent prospective studies of applied WSCAM treatments and in well and clinical populations. The well-being measure used in this study is easy to complete, sensitive, and may be a useful clinical measure to track change with treatment over time.

TI An evaluation of threatened species categorization systems used on the
   American continent
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB Endangered species lists are important tools in conservation. It is essential that these lists be prepared using categorization systems that objectively assess species extinction risk. To determine which threatened species categorization system is the most appropriate and the virtues and limitations of systems used on the American continent, we evaluated 25 categorization systems from 20 countries. These systems included examples of international lists, most national systems used on the American continent, and some systems independently proposed by academics. We based our assessment on 15 characteristics that categorization systems should have, in terms of categories, criteria, and other relevant issues, in order to evaluate species conservation status objectively. Of all evaluated systems, the current World Conservation Union system is the most suitable, for assessing species extinction risk. Most categorization systems, but particularly national systems, have serious deficiencies and need to be improved substantially. We recommend governments use three types of lists: (1) threatened species lists constructed following a sound categorization system, (2) lists of species of conservation priority, and (3) lists that serve as normative tools (e.g., Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). Additionally, the information used to categorize species should be explicit and available to the public. To make the most of threatened species lists in conservation, it is imperative that all countries use the same categorization system.

TI Prioritizing species, pathways, and sites to achieve conservation
   targets for biological invasion
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB Prioritization is indispensable for the management of biological invasions, as recognized by the Convention on Biological Diversity, its current strategic plan, and specifically Aichi Target 9 that concerns invasive alien species. Here we provide an overview of the process, approaches and the data needs for prioritization for invasion policy and management, with the intention of informing and guiding efforts to address this target. Many prioritization schemes quantify impact and risk, from the pragmatic and action-focused to the data-demanding and science-based. Effective prioritization must consider not only invasive species and pathways (as mentioned in Aichi Target 9), but also which sites are most sensitive and susceptible to invasion (not made explicit in Aichi Target 9). Integrated prioritization across these foci may lead to future efficiencies in resource allocation for invasion management. Many countries face the challenge of prioritizing with little capacity and poor baseline data. We recommend a consultative, science-based process for prioritizing impacts based on species, pathways and sites, and outline the information needed by countries to achieve this. This should be integrated into a national process that incorporates a broad suite of social and economic criteria. Such a process is likely to be feasible for most countries.

TI Towards a comprehensive framework for modeling urban spatial dynamics
SO LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB The increasing availability of spatial micro data offers new potential for understanding the micro foundations of urban spatial dynamics. However, because urban systems are complex, induction alone is insufficient. Nonlinearities and path dependence imply that qualitatively new dynamics can emerge due to stochastic shocks or threshold effects. Given the policy needs for managing urban growth and decline and the growing desire for sustainable urban forms, models must be able not only to explain empirical regularities, but also characterize system-level dynamics and assess the plausible range of outcomes under alternative scenarios. Towards this end, we discuss a comprehensive modeling approach that is comprised of bottom-up and top-down models in which both inductive and deductive approaches are used to describe and explain urban spatial dynamics. We propose that this comprehensive modeling approach consists of three iterative tasks: (1) identify empirical regularities in the spatial pattern dynamics of key meso and macro variables; (2) explain these regularities with process-based micro models that link individual behavior to the emergence of meso and macro dynamics; and (3) determine the systems dynamical equations that characterize the relationships between micro processes and meso and macro pattern dynamics. Along the way, we also clarify types of complexity (input and output) and discuss dimensions of complexity (spatial, temporal, and behavioral). While no one to date has achieved this kind of comprehensive modeling, meaningful progress has been made in characterizing and explaining urban spatial dynamics. We highlight examples of this work from the recent literature and conclude with a discussion of key challenges.

TI Nitrogen Pollution is Linked to US Listed Species Declines
SO BIOSCIENCE
AB Nitrogen (N) pollution is increasingly recognized as a threat to biodiversity. However, our understanding of how N is affecting vulnerable species across taxa and broad spatial scales is limited. We surveyed approximately 1400 species in the continental United States listed as candidate,. threatened, or endangered under the US Endangered Species Act (ESA) to assess the extent of recognized N-pollution effects on biodiversity in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. We found 78 federally listed species recognized as affected by N pollution. To illustrate the complexity of tracing N impacts on listed species, we describe an interdisciplinary case study that addressed the threat of N pollution to California Bay Area serpentine grasslands. We demonstrate that N pollution has affected threatened species via multiple pathways and argue that existing legal and policy regulations can be applied to address the biodiversity consequences of N pollution in conjunction with scientific evidence tracing N impact pathways.

TI Regional climate model downscaling may improve the prediction of alien
   plant species distributions
SO FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
AB Distributions of invasive species are commonly predicted with species distribution models that build upon the statistical relationships between observed species presence data and climate data. We used field observations, climate station data, and Maximum Entropy species distribution models for 13 invasive plant species in the United States, and then compared the models with inputs from a General Circulation Model (hereafter GCM-based models) and a downscaled Regional Climate Model (hereafter, RCM-based models).We also compared species distributions based on either GCM-based or RCM-based models for the present (1990-1999) to the future (2046-2055).
   RCM-based species distribution models replicated observed distributions remarkably better than GCM-based models for all invasive species under the current climate. This was shown for the presence locations of the species, and by using four common statistical metrics to compare modeled distributions. For two widespread invasive taxa (Bromus tectorum or cheatgrass, and Tamarix spp. or tamarisk), GCM-based models failed miserably to reproduce observed species distributions. In contrast, RCM-based species distribution models closely matched observations. Future species distributions may be significantly affected by using GCM-based inputs. Because invasive plants species often show high resilience and low rates of local extinction, RCM-based species distribution models may perform better than GCM-based species distribution models for planning containment programs for invasive species.

TI Taxonomic Uncertainty and Its Conservation Implications in Management, a
   Case from Pyrus hopeiensis (Rosaceae)
SO DIVERSITY-BASEL
AB Improved taxonomies and phylogenies are essential for understanding the evolution of organisms, the development of conservation plans, and the allocation of funds and resources, especially for threatened species with uncertain identities. Pears are an economically and nutritionally important fruit, and wild pear species are highly valued and protected because of their utility for the development of cultivars. Pyrus hopeiensis is an endangered species endemic to North China, which is sympatric with and difficult to distinguish from the widely distributed and morphologically similar species P. ussuriensis. To clarify its taxonomic identity, principal coordinate analysis was performed using 14 quantitative and qualitative characters from P. hopeiensis, P. ussuriensis, and P. phaeocarpa, and phylogenomic analysis was performed based on whole-genome resequencing and whole plastome data. Pyrus hopeiensis was synonymized with P. ussuriensis based on morphological and phylogenetic evidence, as well as our long-term field studies. Pyrus hopeiensis is proposed to be excluded from the list of local key protected wild plants. Given that the holotype of P. ussuriensis was not designated, a lectotype was designated in this work. Integrative evidence-based taxonomic study including museomics is suggested for organisms with uncertain identities, which will contribute to biodiversity conservation.

TI Indirect effects of invasive species removal devastate World Heritage
   Island
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB 1. Owing to the detrimental impacts of invasive alien species, their control is often a priority for conservation management. Whereas the potential for unforeseen consequences of management is recognized, their associated complexity and costs are less widely appreciated.
   2. We demonstrate that theoretically plausible trophic cascades associated with invasive species removal not only take place in reality, but can also result in rapid and drastic landscape-wide changes to ecosystems.
   3. Using a combination of population data from of an invasive herbivore, plot-scale vegetation analyses, and satellite imagery, we show how a management intervention to eradicate a mesopredator has inadvertently and rapidly precipitated landscape-wide change on sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island. This happened despite the eradication being positioned within an integrated pest management framework. Following eradication of cats Felis catus in 2001, rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus numbers increased substantially although a control action was in place (Myxoma virus), resulting in island-wide ecosystem effects.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight an important lesson for conservation agencies working to eradicate invasive species globally; that is, risk assessment of management interventions must explicitly consider and plan for their indirect effects, or face substantial subsequent costs. On Macquarie Island, the cost of further conservation action will exceed AU$24 million.

TI Extreme deep learning in biosecurity: the case of machine hearing for
   marine species identification
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION AND TELECOMMUNICATION
AB Biosafety is defined as a set of preventive measures aimed at reducing the risk of infectious diseases' spread to crops and animals, by providing quarantine pesticides. Prolonged and sustained overheating of the sea, creates significant habitat losses, resulting in the proliferation and spread of invasive species, which invade foreign areas typically seeking colder climate. This is one of the most important modern threats to marine biosafety. The research effort presented herein, proposes an innovative approach for Marine Species Identification, by employing an advanced intelligent Machine Hearing Framework (MHF). The final target is the identification of invasive alien species (IAS) based on the sounds they produce. This classification attempt, can provide significant aid towards the protection of biodiversity, and can achieve overall regional biosecurity. Hearing recognition is performed by using the Online Sequential Multilayer Graph Regularized Extreme Learning Machine Autoencoder (MIGRATE_ELM). The MIGRATE_ELM uses an innovative Deep Learning algorithm (DELE) that is applied for the first time for the above purpose. The assignment of the corresponding class 'native' or 'invasive' in its locality, is carried out by an equally innovative approach entitled 'Geo Location Country Based Service' that has been proposed by our research team.

TI Anishnaabe Aki: an indigenous perspective on the global threat of
   invasive species
SO SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
AB Conservation discourses tend to portray invasive species as biological entities temporally connected to colonial timelines, using terms such as alien, colonizing, colonial, and native. This focus on a colonial timeline emerges from scientific publications within conservation biology and invasion ecology and is enacted through invasive species management by state and NGO actors. Colonialism is influential for indigenous nations in myriad ways, but in what ways do indigenous understandings of invasive species engage with colonialism? We conducted ethnographic research with indigenous Anishnaabe communities to learn about the ways Anishnaabe people conceptualize invasive species as a phenomenon in the world and were gifted with three primary insights. First, Anishnaabe regard plants, like all beings, as persons that assemble into nations more so than species. The arrival of new plant nations is viewed by some Anishnaabe as a natural form of migration. The second insight highlights the importance of actively discovering the purpose of new species, sometimes with the assistance of animal teachers. Lastly, while Anishnaabe describe invasive species as phenomenologically entangled with colonialism, the multiple ways Anishnaabe people think about invasive species provide alternatives to native-non-native binaries that dominate much of the scientific discourse.

TI Urban land growth in eastern China: a general analytical framework based
   on the role of urban micro-agents' adaptive behavior
SO REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB As one of the world regions with the most rapid economic growth and urbanization, eastern China faces many challenges during its urbanization process. The growth is characterized by the broad-scale loss of agricultural land, and by complex and unplanned urban growth, both of which threaten the future sustainability of the regional economy. The goal of this research is to investigate the changes within the driving forces behind the urban growth and to explore an analytical framework that explains the process. In particular, we discuss the role of the behavior of individuals in driving urban growth from a micro-perspective and formalize a framework for understanding and modeling the mechanisms of urban growth in eastern China. We start with an analysis of the changes in the macro-environment and how they have affected the autonomy of individuals, followed by an examination of the role of adaptive behavior in driving urban growth. We then propose a general analytical framework composed of an agent system, an environment system, and a policy and planning system. We present a layout for these subsystems and discuss the interactions within and among the subsystems. Furthermore, we summarize the common elements of urban micro-agents' adaptive behavior into three stages: agent learning, agent decision-making, and agent action. We enrich the urban micro-agents' learning process by importing learning from past self-experience and from shared experiences. The results may be helpful in the further modeling of urban micro-agents' adaptive behavior for simulating urban growth in support of scientific urban planning.

TI Data exchange gaps in knowledge of biodiversity: implications for the
   management and conservation of Biosphere Reserves
SO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB The knowledge of species occurrence within an area is crucial to develop proper conservation strategies to protect species diversity. Biosphere Reserves (BRs), established to preserve biodiversity and sustainably use their resources, should therefore have precise information of its biodiversity. We compared and evaluated information on threatened and non-threatened vertebrate species available for Spanish BRs from three sources: management documents (MDs), the Global Biodiversity Information Facility index (GBIF), and atlases and red books. Our results suggest that information from any one source was rather partial, to a degree that depended on which vertebrate group was considered. Management documents did list a high percentage of threatened species found in BRs, reaching up to the total number of species of birds and mammals. Species lists overlap between all three sources ranged from 59 % for fish to 84 % for mammals. In addition, there is an inconsistency between national and international threatened species categories and it should thus call for revisions. Even though the information of non-threatened and threatened species occurrence in MDs of Spanish BRs is good, it is necessary to pay attention to amphibian and fish species which are less recorded.

TI An agent based environmental impact assessment of building demolition
   waste management: Conventional versus green management
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Waste materials generated from building demolition have become a great challenge to sustainable urban development due to its consumption of the limited landfill spaces, water pollution, energy consumption and harmful gas emissions. Proper management of demolition waste (DW) is a complex process and requires systematic thinking and analysis. Many methods have been proposed to study the environmental impact assessment of demolition waste management (DWM). However, it is found that the currently available studies pay little attention from the perspective of complex adaptive system (CAS) to consider the attitude and interaction of the heterogeneous stakeholders as well as the importance of green DWM which has a great influence on the effectiveness of DW management. The aim of this research is to simulate and explore how the change of attitude and the dynamic interaction among heterogeneous stakeholders can influence the environmental performance of DWM. To achieve this aim, a model for evaluating the environmental impact of DWM was developed by using an agent-based modeling (ABM) approach. The main factors considered in the model are the ratio of green deconstruction (i.e., building deconstruction) managers vs. conventional demolition (i.e. building destruction) managers, the ratio of green design managers (i.e. design for deconstruction) vs. conventional design managers, and the interaction behavior of heterogeneous stakeholders following the herd theory. In the model, the environmental impact assessment was quantified into four categories i.e. land resources, water resources, air resource and energy resources. The proposed model is demonstrated by using the data drawn from the Chinese construction industry. The results reveal that if the deconstruction method and the deconstruction oriented design are widely adopted by architects and engineers, the negative environmental impacts generated by DW can be reduced by at least 50%. Furthermore, the results provide valuable information for government departments to make decisions on how to improve environmental performance of DWM. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Evolutionary Macroeconomics: A Research Agenda
SO CATCHING UP, SPILLOVERS AND INNOVATION NETWORKS IN A SCHUMPETERIAN
   PERSPECTIVE
AB In this article, the goal is to offer a new research agenda for evolutionary macroeconomics. The article commences with a broad review of the main ideas in the history of thought concerning the determinants of economic growth and an introduction to the evolutionary perspective. This followed by a selective review of recent evolutionary approaches to macroeconomics. These approaches are found to be somewhat disconnected. It is argued that the 'micro-meso-macro' approach to economic evolution is capable of resolving this problem by offering an analytical framework in which macroeconomics can be built upon 'meso-foundations', not micro-foundations, as asserted in the mainstream. It is also stressed that the economic system and its components are complex adaptive systems and that this complexity must not be assumed away through the imposition of simplistic assumptions made for analytical convenience. It is explained that complex economic systems are, at base, energetic in character but differ from biological complex systems in the way that they collect, store and apply knowledge. It is argued that a focus upon stocks and flows of energy and knowledge in complex economic systems can yield an appropriate analytical framework for macroeconomics. It is explained how such a framework can be connected with key insights of both Schumpeter and Keynes that have been eliminated in modern macroeconomics. A macroeconomic framework that cannot be operationalized empirically is of limited usefulness so, in the last part of the article, an appropriate methodology for evolutionary macroeconomics is discussed.

TI Evaluating the Contribution of North American Zoos and Aquariums to
   Endangered Species Recovery
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The challenge of recovering threatened species necessitates collaboration among diverse conservation partners. Zoos and aquariums have long partnered with other conservation organizations and government agencies to help recover species through a range of in situ and ex situ conservation projects. These efforts tend to be conducted by individual facilities and for individual species, and thus the scope and magnitude of these actions at the national level are not well understood. Here we evaluate the means and extent to which North American zoos and aquariums contribute to the recovery of species listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA), by synthesizing data from federal recovery plans for listed species and from annual surveys conducted by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. We found that in addition to managing ex situ assurance populations, zoos frequently conduct conservation research and field-based population monitoring and assessments. Cooperatively managed populations in zoos tend to focus on species that are not listed on the ESA or on foreign listings, and thus it may be beneficial for zoos to manage more native threatened species. Our results highlight the existing contributions, but also identify additional opportunities for the zoo community to help recover threatened species.

TI Understanding Canadian Health Technology Assessment through a systems
   lens
SO HEALTH POLICY
AB Objective: Governments around the world face challenges in maintaining sustainable, high-quality healthcare systems. Health Technology Assessment (HTA) is widely used as a method to assist in funding decisions. However, the scope and influence of HTA is still limited. We examined how policymakers can improve the usefulness of HTA.
   Methods: We used Systems Thinking as a theoretical framework to examine HTA as a system. We purposely sampled stakeholders involved in Canadian HTA at a national or provincial level. We conducted 22 semi-structured interviews in September-December 2016. Data were analysed using NVivo10 and findings are presented as a concept map with explanatory text.
   Findings: The HTA system is influenced by stakeholder interactions. Such interactions are, in turn, affected by stakeholders' worldviews and environmental factors. Stakeholders' worldviews includes individual's or groups' values and affect the exchange of information, and interpretation of events. External factors, such as changes to government structures, also affect the system.
   Conclusion: Most stakeholder groups are supportive of the system. However, participants identified a need for change, though the exact changes being recommended differed. Some interactions were praised (formal, inclusive collaborations to provide government with policy guidance on both broad and technology-specific matters), while other interactions were criticised (two-party alliances formed around purposes other than the common good, and lacklustre patient and industry engagement on the part of provincial government).

TI It is a small world, or is it? A look into two decades of tourism system
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB By adopting network science and Leiper (1979)'s tourism system conceptualization and by utilizing the UNWTO's outbound tourism database, a portray of Global Tourism System (GTS) was constructed for the years between 1995 and 2018. GTS was then studied by using the measures of degree distribution, shortest geodesic distance, transitivity, and modularity analysis. Our results showed that GTS is a dense system (approximate to 30%) which becomes denser with an average increase of 0.8% per year. Also while the system is on track to becoming resilient to economic crises, it is becoming vulnerable to other perturbations such as health crises. Furthermore, although GTS's degree centrality is on the rise, its degree centralization is on a continuous decline. This continuous decline coupled with GTS's disassortative nature are the indications of system's decentralization. The findings of this study support the proposed hypothesis that GTS is best represented with Watts-Strogatz small-world network model. Nevertheless, the system's in-degree and out-degree centrality measures follow two separate evolution regimes. From an out-degree perspective, we witness GTS's transformation from a broad-scale small-world network to a single-scale one, while from an in-degree perspective, the system strictly follows a broad-scale small-world network. This means that although the small-world network is the best fitting model to GTS, the degree-preserved rewiring process is widely violated and therefore should be considered when modeling GTS. The disassortative nature of GTS and the lack of degree-preserved rewiring process have resulted in an obscure modularity structure which in turn generates a dynamic alternating pattern. Therefore, while, GTS demonstrates a static behavior with a fixed number of modules at all times, it has a dynamic destination membership in modules and destinations' memberships constantly shift between modules.

TI District health planning at a time of transition: a critical review and
   lessons learnt from the implementation of regional planning in Uganda
SO INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
AB A quarter of a century after the Harare Declaration on Strengthening District Health Systems Based on Primary Health Care (1987) was conceived, district health teams (DHTs) are facing a markedly changed situation. Rapid population growth, urbanization, a rapidly developing private sector, and the increasing role of vertical programs and global initiatives have marginalized the planning process and weakened the entire district health system (DHS). The Ugandan Ministry of Health (MoH) responded to these challenges by beginning a review of district planning: a key action point of the Harare Declaration. The first step was a critical review of relevant literature, then central and district health staff were engaged with to provide their input in developing the new strategy. Through a field experiment started in 2012-13, and still underway, the MoH is developing an innovative regional approach to health planning, which aims to encompass the complexity of the new context of health care provision and coordinate all new actors (private health providers, projects and local government staff from other sectors) operating in the health sector. A strategic revision of the planning process represents an opportunity to develop an appropriate 'Theory of Change', intended as a broader approach of thinking about the entire DHS and the relative role and functions of the DHT. Leadership and stewardship capacities of MoH staff, at central and peripheral level, must be strengthened and supported to achieve the expected changes and results.

TI Spatio-temporal patterns of an invasive species Mimosa bimucronata (DC.)
   Kuntze under different climate scenarios in China
SO FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB Invasive alien plants pose a serious threat to native ecosystems and their biodiversity. To control their spread and damage, it is critical to clarify the potential distribution patterns of the invaders at the regional scale and their response to climate change. Mimosa bimucronata (DC.) Kuntze, a shrub extremely tolerant of stressful habitat conditions, is used as firewood and hedgerow in the tropics. Since its introduction to China in the 1950s, it has established a sustainable population and become an aggressive invasive species. Due to serious ecological threats in South China, it has been listed as a Key Management Invasive Alien Species. To understand its invasibility in China, two species distribution models (SDMs), BIOCLIM and DOMAIN, were employed to evaluate the main environmental factors regulating its geographical distribution under the current climate and a future climate change scenario with double CO2 concentration. We found an extensive spread of current suitability habitats in South China, concentrated mainly in the tropical-subtropical provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, and Fujian. The complex interplay of local bioclimatic factors shaped the species distribution. Under the current climate, the predicted range was somewhat larger than the current one. Under the climate change scenario, suitable habitats for Mimosa bimucronata would remain similar to the current one. However, its invasiveness in the current biogeographical range would be more serious. The suitability habitats would expand and shift to the Southeastern coastal and Northern parts of South China under future climate change. We suggest adopting early monitoring and eradication measures in potential invasion areas and practical measures to contain its spread. The results could provide a conceptual basis to formulate prevention and control strategies to improve future containment of its invasion.

TI Amplifying plant disease risk through assisted migration
SO CONSERVATION LETTERS
AB Translocation of species, populations, or genotypes beyond their historic ranges (i.e., assisted migration [AM]) is an oft-debated climate adaptation strategy. Well-intentioned AM actions could alter disease dynamics for target species and recipient sites, resulting in unanticipated detrimental economic and ecological impacts. Although disease risks are occasionally mentioned in AM debates, current regulations or best practices that reduce or mitigate these complex risks are generally lacking in North America. We use the "Disease Triangle", a foundational framework in pathology, to illustrate pathways through which AM may impact disease emergence, to identify knowledge gaps, and to suggest best practices to reduce disease risks. We highlight empirical examples in which altering pathogen distributions, host communities, and environment have historically resulted in costly and ecologically damaging diseases in plants. Although guidelines to reduce disease risks in AM are generally lacking, policies governing endangered species, invasive species, and disease management can provide starting points for a more comprehensive policy. We use examples from the United States to identify key strengths and weaknesses that can inform regulations to reduce disease risks associated with AM. We argue that consideration of disease motivates policy development that incorporates improved risk assessments, agency coordination, and accountability mechanisms.

TI The physics of governance networks: critical transitions in contagion
   dynamics on multilayer adaptive networks with application to the
   sustainable use of renewable resources
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS
AB Adaptive networks are a versatile approach to model phenomena such as contagion and spreading dynamics, critical transitions and structure formation that emerge from the dynamic coevolution of complex network structure and node states. Adaptive networks have been successfully applied to study and understand phenomena ranging from epidemic spreading, infrastructure, swarm dynamics and opinion formation to the sustainable use of renewable resources. Here, we study critical transitions in contagion dynamics on multilayer adaptive networks with dynamic node states and present an application to the governance of sustainable resource use. We focus on a three-layer adaptive network model, where a polycentric governance network interacts with a social network of resource users which in turn interacts with an ecological network of renewable resources. We uncover that sustainability is favored for slow interaction timescales, large homophilic network adaptation rate (as long it is below the fragmentation threshold) and high taxation rates. Interestingly, we also observe a trade-off between an eco-dictatorship (reduced model with a single governance actor that always taxes unsustainable resource use) and the polycentric governance network of multiple actors. In the latter setup, sustainability is enhanced for low but hindered for high tax rates compared to the eco-dictatorship case. These results highlight mechanisms generating emergent critical transitions in contagion dynamics on multilayer adaptive networks and show how these can be understood and approximated analytically, relevant for understanding complex adaptive systems from various disciplines ranging from physics and epidemiology to sociology and global sustainability science. The paper also provides insights into potential critical intervention points for policy in the form of taxes in the governance of sustainable renewable resource use that can inform more process-detailed social-ecological modeling.

TI Role of systems science in preventing and controlling emerging
   infectious diseases: protocol for a scoping review
SO BMJ OPEN
AB Introduction In recent history, many new infectious diseases have affected humans for the first time or have appeared in previously unaffected areas of the world; these diseases are known as emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). Examples of EIDs include COVID-19, Middle East respiratory syndrome and Ebola virus disease. EIDs are known for their complexity. Multiple factors play a role in their spread, including increases in human population, conflicts, urbanisation, air travel, global trade and inequalities in wealth distribution and access to healthcare. In order to gain a better understanding of such complexity, we aim to explore the role of systems science, which allows us to view EIDs in the context of complex adaptive systems rather than simple causes and effects. The objectives of this scoping review are to explore and map the theoretical concepts and key characteristics of studies that use systems methods in controlling EIDs, to identify the gaps in knowledge and disseminate the results. Methods We will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute guidance for this scoping review, comprising the following stages: formulating the research question and subquestions, scanning the literature for available data, selecting relevant publications, charting the data by two independent reviewers, aggregating the findings, reporting, summarising and disseminating the results. We will review peer-reviewed articles, preprints and grey literature available in all languages. Discussion We intend that this scoping review will contribute to a better understanding of the use of systems methods to inform policymakers about how to prevent and control EIDs. Ethics and dissemination Research ethics approval is not required for a scoping review because it is based on reviewing and collecting data from publicly available sources. To disseminate the findings, results will be shared through academic publications, seminars and conferences.

TI Modeling resource basis for social and economic development strategies:
   Water resource case
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB The article substantiates that the effectiveness of implementing socio-economic development strategies is to a large extent determined by the adequate provision of basic resources. The key role of water resources in economic strategic development is empirically illustrated. The article demonstrates the practicability of strategic management of water resources based on the principle of a combination of river basin management approaches and the consideration of regional development strategies. The Game Theory technique was used to develop economic and mathematical tools for supporting decision making in meeting the needs of regional consumers under water balance deficit conditions. The choice of methods was determined from two positions: the methods should allow for the possibility of multi variant solutions for the selection of optimal options for the distribution of limited water resources between different consumers; the methods should be orientated on the maximum possible harmonization of multidirectional and multi-scale interests of the subjects in the water management system of the different regions (including the state) in order to achieve a balance, The approbation of developing a toolkit for the example of the regions located in the Don and Kuban river basins resulted in the appropriate selection of priority regions for the allocation of water resources in terms of strategic management as well as the determination of measures of ensuring the sustainable use of the river basins under consideration. The proposed tools can be used for coordinating decisions on the water supply of regional economic systems with actual and projected indicators of socio-economic development of the respective regions for a strategic perspective.

TI Relative Abundance Differences of Two Invasive Toad Species on
   Minami-daito and Kita-daito Islands, Japan
SO CURRENT HERPETOLOGY
AB Biological invasions are major threats to global biodiversity, and island ecosystems are especially vulnerable. Many previous studies have reported the presence of invasive species on islands, but relatively few studies have quantified the population status of such species. Furthermore, multiple invasive species are often introduced to the same region or island. In such case, quantifying the relative abundance of each species would provide us with significant insight into their population dynamics and potential species interactions. Rhinella marina and Bufo gargarizans miyakonis were introduced to both Minami-daito and Kita-daito Islands before 1945. Although some studies have reported their invasion and establishment, few studies have quantified their relative abundance. To reveal their relative abundance, we set 5 km line transects and counted the number of each species from 11 to 31 July 2019. We applied generalized linear models to examine the relationship between the number of individuals observed with species and environmental factors. We also applied these models to examine the relationship between the number of individuals observed with island and environmental factors. We found the relative abundance of R. marina was significantly higher than that of B. g. miyakonis on Minami-daito Island. This is the opposite pattern of 30 years ago, suggesting the population dynamics of these invasive toads is unstable on Minami-daito Island. Although B. g. miyakonis was found on both islands, no individual of R. marina was found on Kita-daito Island. The population dynamics may depend on environmental differences between islands and ecological differences between species. Future studies are needed to reveal the potential factors determining the differences in relative abundance between islands and between species.

Moreover, we argue that, in many cases, it leads to intuitively more appropriate classifications.

TI Conservation of endangered species through somatic cell nuclear transfer
   (SCNT)
SO CONSERVATION GENETICS RESOURCES
AB Currently, the conservation of biodiversity is a pressing issue due to the extinction and endangerment of many species. There are multiple reasons for the extinction or endangerment of species including anthropogenic (poaching, hunting, and deforestation) and natural causes (forest fire, invasion of non-local species, climate change, and global warming). The somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is an emerging tactic, which requires the nucleus from a donor somatic cell, which is transferred to the enucleated oocyte in vitro, for the conservation of biodiversity, especially related to the wildlife which is gradually decreasing with the fear of extinction. Somatic cell nuclear transfer has a broad spectrum of potential applications, including the rescue of endangered species, the resurrection of extinct species, the production of transgenic animals, drug production, and regenerative medicine. Reproductive cloning of animals by SCNT can also offer permanent gene editing, genetic modification, and gene derives for the production of species adaptive to their native habitats and the destruction of unwanted invasive species. The overall potential of this technique has not been explored yet, probably due to its limitations. In this review, we discussed cloning through SCNT, the preservation of endangered species through SCNT, and the use of modern genetical concepts in SCNT for the preservation of biodiversity.

TI Invasive Species Impacts on Human Well-being Using the Life Satisfaction
   Index
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB Invasive alien species are known to be disruptive to the natural environment and can lead to sharp reductions in environmental quality, thereby affecting social welfare. However, little is known about how subjective wellbeing, in particular, is impacted by invasive species. This is troubling because it precludes credible empirical considerations of the full-range of social externalities when setting invasive species management policy. To address this knowledge gap, this paper provides the first estimates of invasive species impacts on subjective well-being using the life satisfaction ("happiness") index. The approach is applied to the invasive emerald ash borer (EAB), a particularly virulent ash tree attacking pest in North America. Using a repeated cross-sectional fixed effects design, the impact of EAB detection on life satisfaction (LS) is estimated for individuals living in 189 counties in 15 US states over 2005-2011. Results suggest that after EAB detection, LS is reduced by 0.127 on a 4-point scale [95% CI: -0.002, -0.252]. The magnitude of impacts are greatest after a 5-year lag and are largest among young adults (18-24 years). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Regenerative tourism: transforming mindsets, systems and practices
SO JOURNAL OF TOURISM FUTURES
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the mindset shift, systems change and boundary spanning practices needed to transition to a regenerative approach in tourism. The paper seeks to deliver concrete ways to shift thinking and transition to a regenerative paradigm. Design/methodology/approach This viewpoint paper defines regenerative tourism, explores its principles and the levers for driving transformational change in tourism. It outlines what a conscious approach to regenerative tourism entails and outlines working principles for regenerative tourism. The paper concludes by identifying five key areas for reflection that seek to challenge established thinking and practice. Findings The reinvention of tourism requires work in three key areas: systems change, mindset shift and practice. Three findings are summarised as: (1) Regenerative tourism requires a shift in social-ecological consciousness and depends on our capacity to evolve our thinking from "me" to "we" and to develop compassion, empathy and collaborative action. (2) Scientific management is inconsistent with the transition to regeneration. Tourism must be managed as a complex adaptive system and overcome the challenges of individualism, reductionism, separation and marketisation associated with scientific thinking. (3) Regenerative tourism requires a deeply engaged bottom-up approach that is place-based, community-centred and environment-focused. Originality/value This paper shares the reflections, working principles and recommendations of The Tourism CoLab and is based on 30 years of experience as a consultant, policy analyst, educator, researcher, professor and now as founder of two tourism social enterprises. With the luxury of reflection and the distance from higher education that many do not have, the author shares her approach to shifting mindsets and driving transformative change.

AB This paper approaches the microgrid concept from a systemic and cybernetics viewpoint, as a viable sustainable energy system (SES) for supplying electricity and heat to small, rural communities in Chile. As such the microgrid may be viewed as a complex adaptive system (CAS) when connected to the grid and operating without energy storage, only with the grid as back-up power source. From an exergy and homeostatic control (HC) standpoint, one may analyze the microgrid as a socio-technical CAS when it is coupled with a set of homes and also connected to the grid; capable of supplying close to 80% of the daily residential consumer needs on average. Thus, under these conditions homes may draw inexpensive renewable electricity and heat from the microgrid if they are thrifty and efficient in their energy consumption; and they may also consume from the utility grid, yet at an expensive price. Based on this, an exergy and HC approach is proposed to develop such SES for rural and remote communities in Chile and South America, aiming to enhance energy efficiency (EE) and energy sustainability (ES). Under this scheme, renewable power (RP) being a scarce, limited resource that must be managed efficiently is supplied only to homes which comply with a specific criterion in an effort to curtail demand to ensure ES overtime. Simulation shows as expected that indeed certain criteria produce much better results than others in incentivizing thrifty, efficient energy consumption for small-size communities, without the need for expensive and sometimes polluting and forbidden energy storage systems.

TI Adaptiveness to enhance the sustainability of farming systems. A review
SO AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB During the last decade the context in which farmers must manage their farm has changed rapidly, and often with little warning. Dramatic price swings for agricultural commodities, more stringent quality requirements, new environmental regulations, the debates surrounding genetically modified crops, extreme climatic events, the demand for energy crops, the revision of the Common Agricultural Policy and the consequences of the financial crisis all create uncertainty regarding future threats and potentials. During such turbulent times, a one-sided focus on efficient production is no longer enough. Farmers also need to be able to cope with unexpected events and to adapt to new developments. Based on a literature review, we identify three strategies that strengthen the adaptive capacity of a farm: learning through experimenting and monitoring its outcomes, ensuring a flexible farm organisation to increase the options for new activities by the farm family, and diversifying to spread risks and create buffers. Implementing these strategies enlarges the farmer's room to manoeuvre and allows identifying transition options. These options do not depend only on the farm itself, but also on the farmer's ability to mobilise external resources and to engage in collective action. Change is then no longer seen as a disturbance, but as a trigger for the reorganisation of resources, and for the renewal of the farm organisation and activities. Implementing these strategies comes at a cost, so that farmers need to tackle the inevitable trade-offs between efficiency and adaptability. However, unless farmers master this challenge they cannot ensure the sustainability of their farms.

TI Assessing the assessments: evaluation of four impact assessment
   protocols for invasive alien species
SO DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
AB Aim Effective policy and management responses to the multiple threats posed by invasive alien species (IAS) rely on the ability to assess their impacts before conclusive empirical evidence is available. A plethora of different IAS risk and/or impact assessment protocols have been proposed, but it remains unclear whether, how and why the outcomes of such assessment protocols may differ.
   Location Europe.
   Methods Here, we present an in-depth evaluation and informed assessment of the consistency of four prominent protocols for assessing IAS impacts (EICAT, GISS, Harmonia(+) and NNRA), using two non-native parrots in Europe: the widespread ring-necked parakeet (Psittacula krameri) and the rapidly spreading monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus).
   Results Our findings show that the procedures used to assess impacts may influence assessment outcomes. We find that robust IAS prioritization can be obtained by assessing species based on their most severe documented impacts, as all protocols yield consistent outcomes across impact categories. Additive impact scoring offers complementary, more subtle information that may be especially relevant for guiding management decisions regarding already established invasive alien species. Such management decisions will also strongly benefit from consensus approaches that reduce disagreement between experts, fostering the uptake of scientific advice into policy-making decisions.
   Main conclusions Invasive alien species assessments should take advantage of the capacity of consensus assessments to consolidate discussion and agreement between experts. Our results suggest that decision-makers could use the assessment protocol most fit for their purpose, on the condition they apply a precautionary approach by considering the most severe impacts only. We also recommend that screening for high-impact IAS should be performed on a more robust basis than current ad hoc practices, at least using the easiest assessment protocols and reporting confidence scores.

TI A conservation appraisal of the rare and endemic vascular plants of
   Pitcairn Island
SO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB The flora of the Pitcairn Islands consists of 81 species, of which 10 are endemic. IUCN Red List threat categories show that over 60% of the indigenous flora is threatened within the island, and over 20% is threatened globally. To provide a more objective regional assessment that could prioritise conservation management, a system of threat scores was applied to each taxon based on potential threat due to habitat damage or exploitation. The main threats affecting the flora and vegetation are posed by habitat clearance, spread of invasive species, small population sizes or restricted distributions, erosion, lack of a frugivorous bird and exploitation. Addressing these threats by means of a system of nature reserves, species-specific recovery plans and control of invasive species, erosion and exploitation, will start to combat these problems. However, any conservation activities must be implemented in conjunction with the interests of the local community, and in consultation with them, in order to ensure success.

TI Effects of periodic liming on the bryophyte layer in Norway spruce
   (Picea abies) stands in the Erzgebirge (Ore Mountains)
SO HERZOGIA
AB Severe changes in forest soil conditions, tree health and growth as well as plant species composition have been observed as a consequence of atmospheric acid deposition. The most important measure to counteract soil acidification is forest liming. The long-term effects of repeated liming on the bryophyte layer of forests, however, have rarely been analysed. We used a stratified design to sample the bryophyte layer of spruce stands located in the Erzgebirge (Ore Mountains, eastern Germany). Study sites were unlimed or limed at different intensities between one and five times since 1988. We found a significant effect of liming intensity on the composition and diversity of the bryophyte layer. The liming gradient is reflected by numerous indicator species, by indicator values for pH and nitrogen, and the by alpha and beta diversity of the species present. Liming strongly reduces the cover of many acidophytes typical for the habitat. By contrast, indicator species of disturbance and some rare, nutrient-demanding species appear to benefit from liming. These effects increase with liming intensity. Our results suggest that larger liming exclusion zones should be created to protect the typical bryophyte species composition.

TI Do Invasive Mammal Eradications from Islands Support Climate Change
   Adaptation and Mitigation?
SO CLIMATE
AB Climate change represents a planetary emergency that is exacerbating the loss of native biodiversity. In response, efforts promoting climate change adaptation strategies that improve ecosystem resilience and/or mitigate climate impacts are paramount. Invasive Alien Species are a key threat to islands globally, where strategies such as preventing establishment (biosecurity), and eradication, especially invasive mammals, have proven effective for reducing native biodiversity loss and can also advance ecosystem resilience and create refugia for native species at risk from climate change. Furthermore, there is growing evidence that successful eradications may also contribute to mitigating climate change. Given the cross-sector potential for eradications to reduce climate impacts alongside native biodiversity conservation, we sought to understand when conservation managers and funders explicitly sought to use or fund the eradication of invasive mammals from islands to achieve positive climate outcomes. To provide context, we first summarized available literature of the synergistic relationship between invasive species and climate change, including case studies where invasive mammal eradications served to meet climate adaptation or mitigation solutions. Second, we conducted a systematic review of the literature and eradication-related conference proceedings to identify when these synergistic effects of climate and invasive species were explicitly addressed through eradication practices. Third, we reviewed projects from four large funding entities known to support climate change solutions and/or native biodiversity conservation efforts and identified when eradications were funded in a climate change context. The combined results of our case study summary paired with systematic reviews found that, although eradicating invasive mammals from islands is an effective climate adaptation strategy, island eradications are poorly represented within the climate change adaptation and mitigation funding framework. We believe this is a lost opportunity and encourage eradication practitioners and funders of climate change adaptation to leverage this extremely effective nature-based tool into positive conservation and climate resilience solutions.

TI Managing forests in a changing world: the need for a systemic approach.
   A review
SO FOREST SYSTEMS
AB Aim of study: The paper is a scientific commented discussion with the aim of defining a framework which allows both a comprehensive vision of forest dynamics, as well as an adaptive management approach and policy procedures more suited to a changing and inherently unpredictable world.
   Main results: We identify the main challenges facing forestry in relation to recent developments in forestry thinking, i.e. the paradox of aiming at sustainability in a changing environment, a shifting perception of the relationship between ecological and social systems, the recognition of forest ecosystems as complex adaptive systems, the need for integrating the social and ecological dimensions of forestry into a single framework, and the growing awareness of the importance of the ethical approach to the forest. We propose the concept of "systemic forestry" as a paradigm for better understanding forest dynamics and for guiding management and public actions at various levels. We compare the systemic approach with different silvicultural and forest management approaches which have been proposed in the last decades.
   Research highlights: Our analysis shows that a systemic approach to forestry has five main consequences: 1. forestry is viewed as a part of landscape dynamics through a multi-sectoral coordination, 2. the logic of action changes from norm to process, 3. conservation is a dynamic search for resilience, 4. multi-functionality is achieved through a multi-entries approach integrating ecological, social and economic components of sustainability, 5. forestry institutions are reframed to address the issue of changing interactions among actors, 6. a change in the ethical approach to the forest is needed.

TI How to organize for local resource generation
SO LEARNING ORGANIZATION
AB Purpose - The generation of resources is a central issue for the sustainability of companies. The purpose of this paper is to deal with two research questions: " Is decentralized generation of resources a possible way to reach sustainability in modern work life?" and " What prerequisites must be formed by organizations and managers to reach decentralized generation of resources?"
   Design/methodology/approach - The theoretical basis for this discussion is the complex adaptive systems theory. Three requirements for sustainable decentralized resource production are deduced: worker's autonomy, worker's integration in the organization, and demands on increased fitness. The empirical basis for answering these questions is the study of four different pharmacy-districts, each with a different organizational solution. Three sources of data are used: interviews with the four pharmacy-districtmanagers; a questionnaire to all employees, and the balance scorecard of the company.
   Findings -Two of the districts may have reached an unbalance on the system level between autonomy and integration. The other two districts have similar scores of medium for both autonomy and feeling of integration. One of the balanced districts has also a manager focusing bottom-up change processes. This district has both the strongest resource generation and a leading position in increasing efficiency and customer satisfaction and, thus, sustainability.
   Originality/value - A simple model is formulated based on complex systems theory and tested in real life: decentralized resource generation is one way of obtaining sustainability; co-existence of both autonomy and integration of employees, combined with a leadership of transformative character, all encourage this. The paper may inspire researchers, managers, consultants and workers to use this new perspective on organizations and sustainability.

TI Freshwater fishes of China: species richness, endemism, threatened
   species and conservation
SO DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
AB Aim To compile an inventory of freshwater fish species in China, and to investigate these data to determine spatial patterns in species richness, endemism and threatened species for the purpose of facilitating conservation.
   Location China
   Methods Literature, databases and fish collections were examined to create an inventory database of freshwater fishes of China. This list was analysed to determine species richness, endemism and threatened species. SPSS and ORIGIN software were used to determine relationships between these three parameters across the area and length of river basins. Coefficients of fish diversity for each major river were calculated using the Gleason Index.
   Results Chinese freshwater fish fauna is comprised of 1323 species; the majority of species belong to Cypriniformes and Cyprinidae. Of 877 species endemic to China, 161 of 199 threatened species are endemic, with most classified as 'endangered' (85 species) or 'vulnerable' (70). Species endemism and the number of threatened species correlate positively with species richness. River basin area and length have no direct bearing on either species richness or endemism. The Pearl River was identified as the most species-rich system. It also has the most endemic and threatened fish species.
   Main conclusions China's vast size, variable geography and climate influence patterns in species diversity and endemism. Its freshwater fish fauna is rich and largely endemic and a significant number of these endemic species are threatened. Dam construction, water pollution, overfishing and invasive species pose threats to native biodiversity. National assessment of threatened species is urgently needed. The Yangtze, Yellow and Pearl rivers require prioritized national protection. Environmental effects of development require serious consideration and, potentially, proactive conservation efforts and mitigation. Development on international rivers needs to consider environmental policies of all countries owning spans of the systems, particularly the wishes and concerns of nations with lower spans of a system.

TI Are adaptations self-organized, autonomous, and harmonious? Assessing
   the social-ecological resilience literature
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB The paper analyzes how adaptability (adaptive capacity and adaptations) is constructed in the literature on resilience of social-ecological systems (SES). According to some critics, this literature views adaptability as the capacity of SES to self-organize in an autonomous harmonious consensus-building process, ignoring strategies, conflicting goals, and power issues. We assessed 183 papers, coding two dimensions of adaptability: autonomous vs. intentional and descriptive vs. normative. We found a plurality of framings, where 51% of the papers perceived adaptability as autonomous, but one-third constructed adaptability as intentional processes driven by stakeholders; where social learning and networking are often used as strategies for changing power structures and achieving sustainability transformations. For the other dimension, adaptability was used normatively in 59% of the assessed papers, but one-third used descriptive framings. We found no evidence that the SES literature in general assumes a priori that adaptations are harmonious consensus-building processes. It is, rather, conflicts that are assumed, not spelled out, and assertions of "desirable" that are often not clarified by reference to policy documents or explicit normative frameworks. We discuss alternative definitions of adaptability and transformability to clarify or avoid the notion of desirability. Complex adaptive systems framing often precludes analysis of agency, but lately self-organization and emergence have been used to study actors with intentions, strategies, and conflicting interests. Transformations and power structures are increasingly being addressed in the SES literature. We conclude that ontological clashes between social science and SES research have resulted in multiple constructive pathways.

TI The worth of wildlife: A meta-analysis of global non-market values of
   threatened species
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB Clustered robust meta-regression analysis is applied to 109 willingness to pay (WTP) estimates for threatened species from 47 stated-preference studies in 19 countries. Our study updates previous meta-analyses on the topic and tests the effect of important variables not previously considered-species' threat status, use of coloured photographs of species in a survey, and a country's development status, on WTP. We also compared model results obtained from weighting observations by the inverse standard error of WTP and inverse sample size values. Inverse-standard error-weighted model results were more aligned with published research and economic theory and had a better fit than inverse-sample size-weighted model results. Average total present value of WTP was $414/household,(1 )but variation in reported values was large owing to the survey context. WTP was significantly higher for charismatic and threatened species. Using coloured photographs, or a country's development status did not significantly affect WTP. Average absolute within-sample and out-of-sample transfer errors were estimated to be 17% and 48%, respectively. One-fourth out-of-sample transfers had an error of 10% or less. We discuss limitations and issues in current literature and propose recommendations that will allow future studies to be used in meta-analyses and benefit transfer.

TI The debate on behavior in conservation: New Zealand integrates theory
   with practice
SO BIOSCIENCE
AB Behavioral research is increasingly apart of species conservation, yet the debate over its relevance to conservation continues. We use New Zealand - a world leader in conservation management-as a case study to illustrate the integration of behavior and. conservation. Advanced through adaptive management, conceptual behavioral research has been critical to the recovery of many threatened New Zealand species, and the percentage of published research addressing behavioral questions while being applied to conservation has grown considerably in the last 16 years. Much of this research has been incorporated directly into recovery plans for threatened species. Examples range from the cross-fostering of endangered native birds to behavioral plasticity of native fauna in the face of invasive rodents, to mating systems and potential control measures for invasive species. Our case studies not only address major themes in behavior but also provide reason for optimism about the future of the fledgling field of conservation behavior.

TI Near term climate projections for invasive species distributions
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB Climate change and invasive species pose important conservation issues separately, and should be examined together. We used existing long term climate datasets for the US to project potential climate change into the future at a finer spatial and temporal resolution than the climate change scenarios generally available. These fine scale projections, along with new species distribution modeling techniques to forecast the potential extent of invasive species, can provide useful information to aide conservation and invasive species management efforts. We created habitat suitability maps for Pueraria montana (kudzu) under current climatic conditions and potential average conditions up to 30 years in the future. We examined how the potential distribution of this species will be affected by changing climate, and the management implications associated with these changes. Our models indicated that P. montana may increase its distribution particularly in the Northeast with climate change and may decrease in other areas.

TI Radio transmitters did not affect daily nest and chick survival of
   Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus)
SO WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY
AB Biologists interested in using radio telemetry to track the movements of birds should concurrently conduct studies to assess potential impacts on study organisms, particularly when monitoring threatened or endangered species. We investigated the effects of traditional and digital very high frequency (VHF) radio transmitters on daily nest survival and chick survival rates of Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) along the Atlantic Coast in 2012, 2013, and 2015. We attached 1.0-1.2 g transmitters to 110 plovers and monitored their 160 nest attempts. We also monitored 221 nest attempts by 161 control pairs with no transmitters. There was no evidence that nest or chick survival differed between tagged and control pairs. Transmitters did not seem to adversely impact Piping Plover daily nest and chick survival and are a valuable tool to monitor movements of this threatened species.

TI GROWTH PATTERN OF PINUS ROXBURGHII UNDER DIFFERENT REGIMES OF INVASIVE
   SPECIES IN PANCHASE, NEPAL HIMALAYAS
SO PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB Invasive alien species have taken attention as one of the significant threats to biodiversity worldwide. The ongoing climate change is likely to exacerbate the problem by opening up favorable environments for invasion, putting the ecological, environmental and socio-economic state into stake. The assessment of potential impacts of invasive species on native species is crucial for prevention and mitigation measures. Thus, the current study aimed to assess the impact of invasive species (i.e., Ageratina adenophora Sprengel) on the growth of ecologically important native tree species (i.e., Pinus roxburghii Sargent) in Panchase, Nepal Himalaya Furthermore, it explored the dendroecological approach of Pinus roxburghii to assess the potential impacts of invasive species on its growth. The growth pattern was focused on regeneration, tree radial growth and inter-nodal growth rate of saplings and seedlings of Pinus roxburghii under two different classes of invasion i.e., low and high-density. The study revealed that the density and inter-nodal growth rate of seedlings of Pinus roxburghii declined significantly whereas no significant decline occurred in its saplings with the increase in invasion. However, the saplings showed significant increment in its inter-nodal growth rate with the increase in invasion. In the case of its tree, no such significant impact in the radial growth rate was observed. The novel study using dendroecological approach revealed that the invasive species have differential impacts on the growth of nearby native tree species with higher impacts during the seedling stage compared to the saplings and tree stage.

TI Invasive alien species disrupt spatial and temporal ecology and threaten
   extinction in an insular, small mammal community
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB The impact of invasive bank vole (Myodes glareolus) and greater white-toothed shrew (Crocidura russula) on indigenous Irish small mammals, varies with season and habitat. We caught bank voles in deciduous woodland, young coniferous plantations and open habitats such as rank grass. The greater white-toothed shrew was absent from deciduous woods and plantations but did use open habitats with low level cover in addition to field margins. Numbers of both invasive species in field margins during summer were higher than in the previous spring. The indigenous wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) and pygmy shrew (Sorex minutus), differed in degrees of negative response to invasive species. Wood mice with bank voles in hedgerows had reduced recruitment and lower peak abundance. This effect was less extreme where both invasive species were present. Wood mice numbers along field margins and open habitats were significantly depressed by the presence of the bank vole with no such effect in deciduous woodland or coniferous plantations. Summer recruitment in pygmy shrews was reduced in hedgerows with bank voles. Where greater white-toothed shrew was present, the pygmy shrew was entirely absent from field margins. Species replacement due to invasive small mammals is occurring in their major habitat i.e. field margins and open habitats where there is good ground cover. Pygmy shrew will probably disappear from these habitats throughout Ireland. Wood mice and possibly pygmy shrew may survive in deciduous woodland and conifer plantations. Mitigation of impacts of invasive species should include expansion of woodland in which native species can survive.

TI Labor and environment in global value chains: an evolutionary policy
   study with a three-sector and two-region agent-based macroeconomic model
SO JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY ECONOMICS
AB The world economy crucially depends on multi-layered value chains with high degrees of sector-related specialization. Its final products are of international character and serve the needs and wants of the global citizen. However, many production processes are causing severe damage to the environment and moreover create health hazard for workers and local populations. This research article focuses on the increasing global unequal economic- and ecological exchange, fundamentally embedded in international trade. Resource extraction and labor conditions in the Global South as well as the implications for climate change originating from industry emissions in the North are investigated with an agent-based model. The model serves as a testbed for simulation experiments with evolutionary political economic policies. An international institution is introduced sanctioning the polluting extractivist sector in the Global South as well as the emitting industrial capital good producers in the North with the aim of subsidizing innovation reducing environmental and social impacts. Both regions are modelled as macroeconomic complex adaptive systems where international trade is restricted to a three-sector value chain, originating from mining resources in the South that are traded to capital good producers in the North crafting machinery which is eventually traded to consumer good firms, both in the North and South. The main outcome of the study is that sanctions alone are not effective in countering unequal exchange. They only make a difference in combination with subsidies for innovation activities, which are protecting labor and reducing local pollution in mines as well as reducing carbon-emissions in capital good production.

TI Fashion supply chain transparency: do as I say not as I do
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose Fashion brands are under heavy criticism for often exhibiting poor working conditions and producing environmental damage. Pressure comes from initiatives such as Fashion Transparency Index (FTI) by Fashion Revolution to assess fashion brands' transparency based on information publicly disclosed. But an understanding of how such movements reflect in a Global South country characterised by institutional voids is still absent. Design/methodology/approach While the FTI ranks individual brands, in this study the authors have analysed 305 documents extracted from the websites of 20 Brazilian fashion brands to unpack practices and re-bundle them according to three archetypes - opaque, translucent and transparent - that display a maturity curve. Findings The authors show that advancement is heterogeneous, and we complement previous research exposing the limits of an NGO in driving transparency by investigating a context embedded in institutional voids. The authors show that most fashion brands restrict transparency to tier-1 suppliers. Moreover, although fashion brands increasingly demand disclosure from their suppliers, they do not clarify their own purchasing practices such as cancellation and payment policies. On the positive note, the authors show that maturity for transparent brands can include the actionability concept by engaging with consumer via surveys and educative content. Originality/value The authors contribute to theory by offering a maturity curve of fashion supply chain transparency. The authors contribute to practice by offering the three archetypes - opaque, translucent and transparent. This study unveils heterogeneity and asymmetry between the levels of transparency that buying firms demand from their suppliers against what they provide about their own practices.

TI ORGANIZING FOR SUSTAINABLE EFFECTIVENESS: TAKING STOCK AND MOVING
   FORWARD
SO ORGANIZING FOR SUSTAINABILITY
SE Organizing for Sustainable Effectiveness
AB The large number of publications about sustainability and sustainable development that have been published during the past decade has dealt largely with the science of sustainability, the content of sustainability initiatives, and increasingly with the need to more closely link the economic, environmental, and social purposes and operating logic of the firm. Recent literature stresses the inherent social nature of the challenges to aggressively moving to more sustainable ways of operating for the well-being of our planet, society, economy, organizations, and humans. Despite rich case examples, guidance on how to organize to achieve the triple bottom line is limited. We take stock of the current state of knowledge, using an adaptive complex system perspective to articulate the challenges of organizing for sustainable effectiveness. Most of the global economy and the knowledge upon which it is predicated carry a logic of resource abundance even in the face of increasing competition for scarce resources, and a singular focus on economic outcomes. We argue that the development of new capabilities to address triple bottom line sustainability requires a change in that logic and requires new rules of interaction, new organizational and interorganizational designs, and new ways of learning. The premise is that systems can build on their inherent capabilities to learn and to act collectively in order to adapt. We argue that by working together to collaboratively explore how to organize for sustainability, academics and practitioners can accelerate knowledge generation and progress. This chapter provides the theoretical framing context for the chapters to come.

TI The Multiple Lenses on the Community Health System: Implications for
   Policy, Practice and Research
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT
AB Community health systems (CHSs) have historically been approached from multiple perspectives, with different purposes and methodological and disciplinary orientations. The terrain is, on the one hand, vast and diverse. On the other hand, under the banner of universal health coverage (UHC) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a streamlined version of 'community health' is increasingly being consolidated in global health and donor communities. With the view to informing debate and practice, this paper seeks to synthesise approaches to the CHS into a set of 'lenses,' drawing on the collective and multi-disciplinary knowledge (both formal and experiential) of the authors, a collaborative network of 23 researchers from seven institutions across six countries (spanning low, middle and high income). With a common view of the CHS as a complex adaptive system, we propose four key lenses, referred to as programmatic, relational, collective action and critical lenses. The lenses represent different positionalities in community health, encompassing macro-level policy-maker, front-line and community vantage points, and purposes ranging from social justice to instrumental goals. We define and describe the main elements of each lens and their implications for thinking about policy, practice and research. Distilling a set of key lenses offers a way to make sense of a complex terrain, but also counters what may emerge as a dominant, single narrative on the CHS in global health. By making explicit and bringing together different lenses on the CHS, the limits and possibilities of each may be better appreciated, while promoting integrative, systems thinking in policy, practice and research.

TI Bringing Modeling to the Masses: A Web Based System to Predict Potential
   Species Distributions
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB Predicting current and potential species distributions and abundance is critical for managing invasive species, preserving threatened and endangered species, and conserving native species and habitats. Accurate predictive models are needed at local, regional, and national scales to guide field surveys, improve monitoring, and set priorities for conservation and restoration. Modeling capabilities, however, are often limited by access to software and environmental data required for predictions. To address these needs, we built a comprehensive web-based system that: (1) maintains a large database of field data; (2) provides access to field data and a wealth of environmental data; (3) accesses values in rasters representing environmental characteristics; (4) runs statistical spatial models; and (5) creates maps that predict the potential species distribution. The system is available online at www.niiss.org, and provides web-based tools for stakeholders to create potential species distribution models and maps under current and future climate scenarios.

TI Review of grid-tie micro-generation systems without energy storage:
   Towards a new approach to sustainable hybrid energy systems linked to
   energy efficiency
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB This paper reviews the literature on the subject albeit approaching hybrid micro-generation power systems from a systems thinking (ST) and cybernetics standpoint, viewing them as dynamically complex adaptive systems (CAS) coupled with and supplying to a set of homes termed a sustainable block in a rural setting. Here homeostatic regulation (HR) and control play a vital role in reaching efficient equilibrium towards reconciling power supply and demand response management. Unlike most of the work reviewed in the literature, the focus here is on supervisory control of grid-connected microgeneration systems without energy storage, aiming towards building energy efficiency, thriftiness and sustainability in energy consumption. Building on homeostatic control (HC) principles first introduced by Schweppe in 1979, the paper explores the concepts of sustainability and sustainable hybrid energy systems (SHES) applied to micro-generation, focusing on operational aspects rather than on socio-economic, environmental or regulatory ones. A concrete theoretical model for building a SHES is presented for a proposed grid-connected renewable microgrid. The model seeks to reconcile power supply and demand towards efficient equilibrium (homeostasis) proposing reward-based criteria for controlling renewable electricity supply and consumption in rural communities in Chile. Discussion and recommendations are also offered stating that energy sustainability (ES), is essentially a systems issue, and one where ES is first and foremost a structural, organizational and operational property which is in the very nature of the system itself - it is built into it - rather than explained by exogenous factors.

AB The present study deals with invasive alien plants of Uttarakhand Himalaya. A total of 163 invasive alien species under 105 genera, belonging to 46 families have been recorded based on field observations, herbarium and literature consultations. Distribution of invasive species based on habitat shows that the maximum number of species are found in wastelands (48 %), followed by cultivated fields (20 %), along road sides (14 %) and forests (8 %). Among these invasive species, 84 species are being used by local inhabitants for medicinal purposes. A better planning is needed for early detection to control and report the infestations of spread of new and naturalized weeds to be monitored.

TI A Robust Optimization Model for an Invasive Species Management Problem
SO ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT
AB Invasive species pose a significant threat to global biodiversity. Managing invasive species often involves modeling the species' spread pattern, estimating control costs and damage costs due to the invasion, designing control efforts, and accounting for uncertainties in model parameters. Dealing with uncertainty is arguably the most important part of the process, since biological, environmental, and economic factors can cause parameter values to vary greatly. Managers need decision tools that are robust to such limited or variable information. Here, we present a robust spatial optimization model to select treatment sites in a way that maximally reduces the size of an invasive population, given a constraint on financial resources. We develop an integer programming model that includes population dynamics and management costs over space and time. The model incorporates uncertainty in the available budget and the invasive spread rate as sets of discrete scenarios to determine a robust, cost-effective management plan in a novel way.

TI Shaping innovation and coordination of healthcare delivery across
   boundaries and borders A comparative case study
SO JOURNAL OF HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose Using a complexity-informed approach, we aim to understand why introduction of a mobile service delivery model for osteoporosis across diverse organisational and country contexts in the UK National Health Service (NHS) met with variable success. Design/methodology/approach Six comparative case studies; three prospectively in Scotland using an action research-informed approach; and three retrospectively in England with variable degrees of success. The Non-adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread and Sustainability framework explored interactions between multi-level contextual factors and their influence on efforts to introduce and sustain services. Findings Cross-boundary service development was a continuous process of adaptation and evolution in rapidly shifting healthcare context. Whilst the outer healthcare policy context differed significantly across cases, inner contextual features predominated in shaping the success or otherwise of service innovations. Technical and logistical issues, organisational resources, patient and staff actions combined in unpredictable ways to shape the lifecycle of service change. Patient and staff thoughts about place and access to services actively shaped service development. The use of tacit "soft intelligence" and a sense of "chronic unease" emerged as important in successfully navigating around awkward people and places. Originality/value This study has uniquely traced the fortunes of a single service innovation across diverse organisational and country contexts. Novel application of the NASSS framework enabled comparative analysis across real-time service change and historical failures. This study also adds to theories of context and complexity by surfacing the neglected role of patients in shaping healthcare context.

TI Integrating biogeography, threat and evolutionary data to explore
   extinction crisis in the taxonomic group of cycads
SO ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB Will the ongoing extinction crisis cause a severe loss of evolutionary information accumulated over millions of years on the tree of life? This question has been largely explored, particularly for vertebrates and angiosperms. However, no equivalent effort has been devoted to gymnosperms. Here, we address this question focusing on cycads, the gymnosperm group exhibiting the highest proportion of threatened species in the plant kingdom. We assembled the first complete phylogeny of cycads and assessed how species loss under three scenarios would impact the cycad tree of life. These scenarios are as follows: (1) All top 50% of evolutionarily distinct (ED) species are lost; (2) all threatened species are lost; and (3) only all threatened species in each IUCN category are lost. Finally, we analyzed the biogeographical pattern of cycad diversity hotspots and tested for gaps in the current global conservation network. First, we showed that threatened species are not significantly clustered on the cycad tree of life. Second, we showed that the loss of all vulnerable or endangered species does not depart significantly from random loss. In contrast, the loss of all top 50% ED, all threatened or all critically endangered species, would result in a greater loss of PD (Phylogenetic Diversity) than expected. To inform conservation decisions, we defined five hotpots of diversity, and depending on the diversity metric used, these hotspots are located in Southern Africa, Australia, Indo-Pacific, and Mexico and all are found within protected areas. We conclude that the phylogenetic diversity accumulated over millions of years in the cycad tree of life would not survive the current extinction crisis. As such, prioritizing efforts based on ED and concentrating efforts on critically endangered species particularly in southern Africa, Australia, Indo-Pacific, and Mexico are required to safeguarding the evolutionary diversity in the cycad tree of life.

TI The argument against a reductionist approach for measuring sustainable
   development performance and the need for methodological pluralism
SO ACCOUNTING FORUM
AB Both sustainability and sustainable development continue to remain elusive concepts even now, 20 years after the Brundtland Commission report that brought them into prominence. This situation most likely stems from the fact that sustainability science encompasses the need to address a wide set of issues over different time and spatial scales and thus inevitably accommodates opinions from diverse branches of knowledge and expertise. However, despite this multitude of perspectives, progress towards sustainability is usually assessed through the development and utilisation of single sustainability metrics such as monetary tools, composite sustainability indices and biophysical metrics including emergy, exergy and the ecological footprint. But is it really justifiable to assess the progress towards sustainability by using single metrics? This paper argues that such a choice seems increasingly unjustifiable not least due to these metrics' methodological imperfections and limits. Additionally, our recent awareness of economies, societies and ecosystems as complex adaptive systems that cannot be fully captured through a single perspective further adds to the argument. Failure to describe these systems in a holistic manner through the synthesis of their different non-reducible and perfectly legitimate perspectives amounts to reductionism. An implication of the above is the fact that not a single sustainability metric at the moment can claim to comprehensively assess sustainability. In the light of these findings this paper proposes that the further elaboration and refinement of current metrics is unlikely to produce a framework for assessing the progress towards sustainability with a single metric. Adoption of a diverse set of metrics seems more likely to be the key for more robust sustainability assessments. This methodological pluralism coupled with stakeholder involvement seems to offer a better chance of improving the outcome of the decision making process. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Improving predictions of range expansion for invasive species using
   joint species distribution models and surrogate co-occurring species
SO JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB Aims Species distribution models (SDMs) are often used to forecast potential distributions of important invasive or rare species. However, situations where models could be the most valuable ecologically or economically, such as for predicting invasion risk, often pose the greatest challenges to SDM building. These challenges include non-equilibrium range expansion, low or uneven prevalence, and interest in projecting distributions into environments that are non-analogous to the environments used for model building.
   Location Minnesota, USA.
   Taxon Cardamine impatiens (Narrowleaf Bittercress), Celastrus orbiculatus (Oriental Bittersweet), and Humulus japonicus (Japanese Hops).
   Methods We took a novel approach to build robust species distribution models of invasive species using occurrence-environment correlations between invasive species and co-occurring native community members. The correlations were obtained from a joint species distribution model (JSDM) of a densely sampled database of 10,336 MN plant communities from across the state of Minnesota, USA. Positively and negatively associated native species were incorporated into the model as surrogate presences and pseudoabsences (weighted by their environmental correlations) along with invasive species occurrences records (surrogate SDMs).
   Results Surrogate models performed better than traditional SDMs in predicting occurrences along the northern invasion margin (outside the training area). Both types of models had similarly high cross-validation metrics in the area of training. Surrogate models also predicted greater range expansion beyond the current geographic range.
   Main conclusions These results demonstrate that modelers can take advantage of detailed community data to develop SDMs that leverage surrogate native species as phytometers of environments beyond the current area of occupancy. The additional information in surrogate models generates highly effective predictions of invasive species along expanding range margins.

SO LAND ECONOMICS
AB We develop a bioeconomic model to identify the cost-effective control of an invasive species (rainbow trout) to achieve a population viability goal for an endangered species (humpback chub) in the Grand Canyon of the U.S. Southwest. Solving the population viability problem is difficult since avoiding a threshold with a given confidence imposes a probabilistic restriction on joint outcomes (survival) over many periods. We develop a novel dynamic programming solution approach that is fast and forgoes the simulation method requirement of imposing structure on the policy function. We also investigate an adaptive management model that incorporates learning about uncertain biological dynamics.

TI Learning from endangered and threatened species recovery programs: A
   case study using US Endangered Species Act recovery scores
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB Threatened and endangered species recovery programs consume increasing resources. Even so, there is increased concern about actual and projected biodiversity losses and in the success of recovery programs in reversing these trends. In this paper, we use a panel data set and ordered probit econometric methods to statistically examine the determinants of the 1990-2002 biennial U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) recovery scores for up to 225 vertebrate species listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act. We find that species-specific spending is a significant determinant of species' recovery scores and that increased spending reduces the probability that FWS will classify a species as extinct or declining. The evidence does not support the hypothesis that increased spending increases the probability that a species is stable or improving. Other FWS' actions have significant and substantive influences on improved recovery scores. These include progress on or completion of a recovery plan and achievement of stated recovery objectives. We find evidence that species achieve better recovery scores if FWS considers them to have high recovery potential and that species whose recovery is judged by FWS to be in conflict with economic activity are more likely to be classified as extinct. Our evidence does not support the conclusion that critical habitat designation promotes species' recoveries or prevents species' declines. We also report a new finding that recovery success varies across FWS administrative regions. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Mangrove-associated bivalves in Southeast Asia: A review
SO REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB Mangroves are plants with high tolerance to salinity, tidal variation, temperature and moisture which grow in the intertidal zone. The high productivity of mangroves creates a suitable living habitat for aquatic and terrestrial organisms, including bivalves. Several bivalve species are collected as food for humans. Despite the insufficient information regarding the interaction between mangroves and bivalves, this aspect is essential for resource and habitat management. Furthermore, the total number of identified bivalve species living in mangroves is still unknown. Therefore, this article presents a review of the diversity and interaction between bivalves and mangroves in the Southeast Asia region. Published data on distribution of bivalve species in mangroves were listed and checked using online databases and datasets from international organisations. This review will serve as baseline information on the biodiversity of bivalves in Southeast Asia for future studies, although some of the species listed require further validation from taxonomists. A total of 175 species from 34 families, 87 genera and 4 unidentified species of bivalves were recorded in Southeast Asia. The highest number of species was found in Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines, which surround the South China Sea, whereas no data for Laos could be obtained. Six species were listed as invasive alien species by the Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species (GRIIS) and the Global Invasive Species Database (GISD) but not recorded as invasive in Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, six species were classified as Least Concern, 71 were categorised as Not Evaluated, and the remaining 98 were not included in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species. These statuses indicate that the current use of bivalves in the Southeast Asia region is still sustainable. Nevertheless, continuous monitoring should be conducted to provide appropriate data for proper management. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Optimal allocation of conservation effort among subpopulations of a
   threatened species: How important is patch quality?
SO ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB Money is often a limiting factor in conservation, and attempting to conserve endangered species can be costly. Consequently, a framework for optimizing fiscally constrained conservation decisions for a single species is needed. In this paper we find the optimal budget allocation among isolated subpopulations of a threatened species to minimize local extinction probability. We solve the problem using stochastic dynamic programming, derive a useful and simple alternative guideline for allocating funds, and test its performance using forward simulation. The model considers subpopulations that persist in habitat patches of differing quality, which in our model is reflected in different relationships between money invested and extinction risk. We discover that, in most eases, subpopulations that are less efficient to manage should receive more money than those that are more efficient to manage, due to higher investment needed to reduce extinction risk. Our simple investment guideline performs almost as well as the exact optimal strategy. We illustrate our approach with a case study of the management of the Sumatran tiger, Panthera tigris sumatrae, in Kerinei Seblat National Park (KSNP), Indonesia. We find that different budgets should be allocated to the separate tiger subpopulations in KSNP. The subpopulation that is not at risk of extinction does not require any management investment. Based on the combination of risks of extinction and habitat quality, the optimal allocation for these particular tiger subpopulations is an unusual case: subpopulations that occur in higher-quality habitat (more efficient to manage) should receive more funds than the remaining subpopulation that is in lower-quality habitat. Because the yearly budget allocated to the KSNP for tiger conservation is small, to guarantee the persistence of all the subpopulations that are currently under threat we need to prioritize those that are easier to save. When allocating resources among subpopulations of a threatened species, the combined effects of differences in habitat quality, cost of action, and current subpopulation probability of extinction need to be integrated. We provide a useful guideline for allocating resources among isolated subpopulations of any threatened species.

AB The moderate temperature increase of 0.74 degrees C in the 20(th) century has caused latitudinal and altitudinal range shifts in many species including mammals. Therefore, given the more dramatic temperature increase predicted for the 21(st) century, we can therefore expect even stronger range shifts as well. However, European mammals are already faced with other anthropogenic pressures, notably habitat loss, pollution, overexploitation, and invasive species, and will have to face the combined challenge posed by climate change in a landscape highly influenced by human activities. As an example of the possible consequences of land use, invasive species, and climate change for the regional-scale mammal species composition, we here focus on the potential 21(st) century changes to the mammal fauna of Denmark. Supported by species distribution modelling, we present a discussion of the possible changes to the Danish mammal fauna: Which species are likely to become locally extinct? Which new species are most likely to immigrate? And, what is the potential threat from invasive species? We find that future climate change is likely to cause a general enrichment of the Danish mammal fauna by the potential immigration of seventeen new species. Only the northern birch mouse (Sicista betulina) is at risk of extinction from climate change predicted. The European native mammals are not anticipated to contribute to the invasive-species problem as they coexist with most Danish species in other parts of Europe. However, non-European invasive species are also likely to enter the Danish fauna and may negatively impact the native species.

TI A Clear Past and a Murky Future: Life in the Anthropocene on the Pampana

SO LAND
AB The impacts of human activities on ecosystems are significantly increasing the rate of environmental change in the earth system, reshaping the global landscape. The rapid rate of environmental change is disrupting the ability of millions of people around the globe to live their everyday lives and maintain their human niche. Evidence suggests that we have entered (or created) a new epoch, the Anthropocene, which is defined as the period in which humans and human activities are the primary drivers of planetary change. The Anthropocene denotes a global shift, but it is the collective of local processes. This is our frame for investigating local accounts of human-caused disruptive environmental change in the Pampana River in Tonkolili District, Northern Province, Sierra Leone. Since the end of the Sierra Leonean civil war in 2002, the country has experienced a rapid increase in extractive industries, namely mining. We explored the effects of this development by working with communities along the Pampana River in Tonkolili, with a specific focus given to engaging local fishermen through ethnographic interviews (N = 21 fishermen and 33 non-fishermen), focus group discussions (N = 21 fishermen), and participant observation. We deployed theoretical and methodological frameworks from human niche construction theory, complex adaptive systems, and ethnography to track disruptive environmental change in and on the Pampana from upstream activities and the concomitant shifts in the local human niche. We highlight the value of integrating ethnographic methods with human evolutionary theory, produce important insights about local human coping processes with disruptive environmental change, and help to further account for and understand the ongoing global process of human modification of the earth system in the Anthropocene.

TI "You'll come in and dose even in a global pandemic": A qualitative study
   of adaptive opioid agonist treatment provision during the COVID-19
   pandemic
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY
AB Background: Opioid agonist treatment (OAT) improves multiple health and social outcomes, yet requirements to attend for supervised dosing can be burdensome and stigmatising. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions threatened continuity of care and the wellbeing of people receiving OAT, risking a parallel health crisis. This study sought to understand how adaptations in the complex system of OAT provision impacted and responded to risk environments of people receiving OAT during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: The analysis draws on semi-structured interviews with 40 people receiving and 29 people providing OAT located across Australia. The study considered the risk environments that produce COVID-19 transmission, treatment (non-)adherence, and adverse events for people receiving OAT. Drawing on theories of risk environments and complex adaptive systems, data were coded and analysed to understand how adaptations to the typically rigid system of OAT provision impacted and responded to risk environments during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Results: During COVID-19, the complex system of OAT provision demonstrated possibilities for responsive adaptation to the entangled features of risk environments of people receiving OAT. Structural stigma was evident in the services which stayed rigid during the pandemic, requiring people to attend for daily supervised dosing and risking fracturing therapeutic relationships. In parallel, there were several examples of services developing enabling environments by offering flexible care through increased takeaways, treatment subsidies, and home delivery.
   Conclusions: Rigidity in the delivery of OAT has been an impediment to achieving health and wellbeing over past decades. To sustain health-promoting environments for people receiving OAT, the wider impacts of the complex system should be acknowledged beyond narrowly defined outcomes relating solely to the medication. Centring people receiving OAT in their own care plans will ensure adaptations in the complex system of OAT provision are responsive to the individual's risk environment.

TI An assessment of monitoring efforts in endangered species recovery plans
SO ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB Recovery efforts for threatened and endangered species often must be initiated with incomplete data. The outcomes of such efforts are difficult to predict, which makes monitoring the progress of recovery efforts an integral part of the recovery process. We evaluated the role of monitoring in recovery plans for 181 species listed as threatened and endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. We considered both the extent to which monitoring tasks were proposed as part of the recovery effort and the extent to which the tasks proposed were actually implemented. In general, tasks devoted to tracking the species' population trend were more likely to be proposed and implemented than were other monitoring activities (e.g., those devoted to the species' demographic, its habitat requirements, or the impact of predators, competitors, and exotics). We found that the extent and nature of the monitoring proposed and implemented appeared to reflect taxonomic biases that exist throughout the recovery process and were little influenced either by the level of understanding of the species' biology or by the recovery priority assigned to the species. In particular, monitoring efforts did not adequately address the specific threats affecting species. Proposals for, and implementation of, monitoring progress toward recovery goals were independent of the type of criteria defined in the plans (e.g., population level and habitat extent), although population-related criteria were disproportionately common. Based on these findings, we caution against an overemphasis on focal species monitoring, especially when such an emphasis leads to the reduction or exclusion of other types of monitoring. We also recommend that species-specific attributes factor more prominently in the development of monitoring to avoid monitoring action that is otherwise unnecessary.

TI Managing invasive species in cities: a decision support framework
   applied to Cape Town
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
CT Workshop on Non-Native Species in Urban Environments - Patterns,
   Processes, Impacts and Challenges
CY NOV, 2016
CL DST NRF Ctr Excellence Invas Biol, Stellenbosch, SOUTH AFRICA
HO DST NRF Ctr Excellence Invas Biol
AB It has been suggested that existing frameworks for guiding management of invasive species in rural areas and protected areas are inadequate for dealing with invasions in urban settings. A framework for selecting appropriate goals for managing invasive species in urban areas was developed by Gaertner et al. (Landsc Urban Plan 151:1-9, 2016). This framework groups species into three management approaches (control priority, active engagement, and tolerance) depending on their real or perceived benefits and their potential to generate negative impacts. This study tests the practical application of the framework using the example of Cape Town. We assess the suitability of the framework to support decision-making for managing invasive species in urban ecosystems using a questionnaire-based survey of members of the public, and an e-mail-based survey and a workshop with invasion biology researchers and managers. Specifically, we (1) determine the differences in perceptions regarding the benefits and impacts of invasive species between the public, managers and researchers; (2) investigate how consistently managers and researchers group invasive species into the three management categories; and (3) identify, with the help of managers and researchers, issues linked to the framework and give suggestions to overcome the identified issues. We found no clear pattern in the perceptions of the public, managers and researchers regarding perceived benefits and negative impacts of invasive species. Instead, the answers were widely scattered among all groups for most of the species that were considered. However, using the framework leads to a higher consistency among managers in placing the species into management categories, compared to invasive species grouping without guidance of the framework. We conclude that decision-support frameworks can assist managers in placing invasive species into management categories. However, even more specific guidelines on the use of invasive species management frameworks in urban areas are needed.

TI The emerging scientific water paradigm: Precursors, hallmarks, and
   trajectories
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER
AB Increasing scholarship has focused on a shift in scientific water paradigm in the 21st century from an understanding of water systems as stationary, predictable and command-and-control as appropriate governance to an understanding of them as complex, dynamic, and uncertain. This shift has been characterized in several ways. We focused on two prominent characterizations: as a "new water paradigm" and as "water resilience." We identified the defining hallmarks of each, the "precursor" scholarship upon which these Defining Works build, and how the Defining Works have been advanced with "Subsequent Works" that cite them. We used bibliometric data to analyze the three bodies of literature and inductive coding to identify the hallmarks of the new water paradigm and water resilience from Defining Works. Four categories of hallmarks were identified that describe the emerging scientific water paradigm: complex adaptive systems orientation; governance and management configurations, which are inclusive, integrative, adaptive; governance and management actions that emphasize linkages between social and ecological systems and imperative of sustainability; and, attributes of diversity, redundancy and openness. There was insufficient evidence in fields of research, author country, and publishing journals to confirm that the emerging scientific water paradigm has been conceptualized in two distinct ways. Despite the degree of similarity between the two conceptualizations, the literature is strongly oriented toward one or the other. We suggest consilience between these two conceptualizations and scholars working with them to advance collective understanding of governance and management in light of our current understanding of water systems.

TI Invasive Species Removal Promotes Habitat Restoration but Does Not
   Immediately Improve the Condition of a Threatened Plant Subspecies
SO JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT
AB Impacts of invasive species on rare species are relevant to conservation. We studied the response of Leedy's roseroot Rhodiola integrifolia subsp. leedyi, a subspecies listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, to removal of the invasive species Japanese knotweed Fallopia japonica. Japanese knotweed has invaded the largest known population of Leedy's roseroot, affecting about 10% of all Leedy's roseroot in the world. Japanese knotweed shaded Leedy's roseroot, but the two did not share belowground resources because of their position on cliffs. To study this interaction and, ultimately, to restore Leedy's roseroot habitat to an open, high-light condition, we removed Japanese knotweed in a three-treatment block design. We measured Leedy's roseroot abundance, growth, and reproduction in treatment blocks and in uninvaded areas before and after treatment. Compared with uninvaded areas, Japanese knotweed invasion negatively affected Leedy's roseroot abundance, growth, and reproduction. Light interception by Japanese knotweed degraded the habitat for Leedy's roseroot. Herbicide removal of Japanese knotweed resulted in increased light and temperature compared with untreated invaded plots but did not affect Leedy's roseroot abundance, growth, or reproduction over the 2 y of our study. These results show that invasive species removal is conducive to restoring Leedy's roseroot habitat, but recovery in the subspecies may lag behind restoration of the habitat, suggesting that additional action or time may be required to restore preinvasion performance of Leedy's roseroot. Results of this study may inform restoration efforts for other systems and contribute to the literature on interspecific interactions.

TI Threats to seabirds: A global assessment
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB We present the first objective quantitative assessment of the threats to all 359 species of seabirds, identify the main challenges facing them, and outline priority actions for their conservation. We applied the standardised Threats Classification Scheme developed for the IUCN Red List to objectively assess threats to each species and analysed the data according to global IUCN threat status, taxonomic group, and primary foraging habitat (coastal or pelagic). The top three threats to seabirds in terms of number of species affected and average impact are: invasive alien species, affecting 165 species across all the most threatened groups; bycatch in fisheries, affecting fewer species (100) but with the greatest average impact; and climate change/severe weather, affecting 96 species. Overfishing, hunting/trapping and disturbance were also identified as major threats to seabirds. Reversing the top three threats alone would benefit two-thirds of all species and c. 380 million individual seabirds (c. 45% of the total global seabird population). Most seabirds (c. 70%), especially globally threatened species, face multiple threats. For albatrosses, petrels and penguins in particular (the three most threatened groups of seabirds), it is essential to tackle both terrestrial and marine threats to reverse declines. As the negative effects of climate change are harder to mitigate, it is vital to compensate by addressing other major threats that often affect the same species, such as invasive alien species, bycatch and overfishing, for which proven solutions exist.

TI Towards local-parallel scenarios for climate change impacts, adaptation
   and vulnerability
SO CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT
AB Scenarios are used in climate change research to explore potential impacts, assess vulnerability, and identify adaptation options. In developing scenarios, however, there is a challenge in moving between global, national, and local scales in a way that connects complex adaptive systems in meaningful ways for stakeholders. Some emulate the global parallel scenario framework of Representative Concentration Pathways, Shared Socio-economic Pathways, and Shared Policy Assumptions, collecting and refining expert data and projections into relatively complex scenarios for specific regions. However, such approaches can be expensive, time-consuming, and privilege expert biophysical knowledge. Others use participatory approaches, working with local people to co-create scenarios based on experiential knowledge, risk perception, and community aspirations. While useful, these highly localized scenarios are often unable to account for linkages and feedbacks between national and international processes. Here we seek to overcome some of these challenges through a combination of elements from the global scenario architecture, and locally specific data that bridge a range of social issues, including political debates, land use, and socioeconomic inequalities. We illustrate the approach through a case study of the West Coast, New Zealand, which shows that meaningful climate change scenarios that are credible, legitimate, and relevant can be used to open up material discussions. Our methodology provides a robust process that connects international best practice to local contexts and communicates climate change scenarios through accessible textual and visual boundary objects. The results provide a basis for further process refinement and application elsewhere, highlighting key methodological challenges and opportunities.

TI Not Black Not even White Definitively Grey Economic Systems
SO JOURNAL OF GREY SYSTEM
AB To better explain why the economic systems are grey, it is necessarily to study their components and to effectively look into their pasts or predict their future. In most of the cases, when predicting their future, the uncertainty arises. First of all, the human component plays an important role due to its usually unpredicted and sometimes irrational behaviour, a situation strictly related to the way the humans are thinking and acting. From here, it is easily be demonstrated that when analysing a system we are facing with grey knowledge. This kind of knowledge exists and it represents that small piece of puzzle that succeed in filling the gap that separate the explicit knowledge form the tacit one, also conducting to incertitude. Second, it often happens that the abnormal situations or crises that may arise in the economic systems to depend on various, mostly unknown or unpredicted, environmental conditions, including here turbulences. Moreover, when focusing specifically on firms as parts of the economic systems, this grey situation becomes even more noticeable. Firms - complex adaptive systems by nature - possess one of the most important sources of uncertainty that derives directly from their highly adaptive capacity. That is why, when analysing the economic systems, in general, or their sub-systems, in particular, the applying of the grey systems theory methods becomes a very good alternative to the already consecrated methods. To support this idea, some of the most well-known and well-used methods in the economic systems "treatment" (including grey systems theory) are presented along with their main advantages and disadvantages. Also, a case study is illustrated, showing how we can combine these theories in order to achieve better results.

TI Intraspecific morphological and genetic variation of common species
   predicts ranges of threatened ones
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Predicting where threatened species occur is useful for making informed conservation decisions. However, because they are usually rare, surveying threatened species is often expensive and time intensive. Here, we show how regions where common species exhibit high genetic and morphological divergence among populations can be used to predict the occurrence of species of conservation concern. Intraspecific variation of common species of birds, bats and frogs from Ecuador were found to be a significantly better predictor for the occurrence of threatened species than suites of environmental variables or the occurrence of amphibians and birds. Fully 93 per cent of the threatened species analysed had their range adequately represented by the geographical distribution of the morphological and genetic variation found in seven common species. Both higher numbers of threatened species and greater genetic and morphological variation of common species occurred along elevation gradients. Higher levels of intraspecific divergence may be the result of disruptive selection and/or introgression along gradients. We suggest that collecting data on genetic and morphological variation in common species can be a cost effective tool for conservation planning, and that future biodiversity inventories include surveying genetic and morphological data of common species whenever feasible.

TI Spatial similarity in the distribution of invasive alien plants and
   animals in China
SO NATURAL HAZARDS
AB With ongoing development of global economy and increasing trade between countries, China faces increasingly serious invasions by alien species, causing great harm and potential disasters to agriculture, forestry and natural environment. According to a national survey of invasive alien species in China, there are 265 species of invasive alien plants and 171 species of invasive alien animals in China, most of which are widely distributed. In general, there are more invasive species, either plants or animals, in the south than in the north, and more in coastal areas than in interior areas. The distribution of first detection locations of invasive alien plants and animals shows a similar pattern. The cluster analyses showed that the distribution of invasive alien plants and animals was significantly influenced by geographical region, and the alien species of invasive plants and animals were similar in the same geographical region. Thus, the overall distribution of invasive alien plants and animals are spatially similar in China. The results remind us an ongoing invasion pressure from other countries to China and from the provinces with more invasive species to the provinces with less invasive species. Considering different biological and ecological characteristics of plants and animals, common social-economic factors and environmental conditions in each province lead to such similar spatial patterns, supporting the distribution prediction of establishment possibility based on the invasive pest assemblages.

TI Scientific literature on invasive alien species in a megadiverse
   country: advances and challenges in Mexico
SO NEOBIOTA
AB Interest in invasive species has increased around the world over the last several decades. In Mexico, studies on invasive species date as early as 1939 and the number of publications has increased considerably in recent decades. However, to our knowledge, the analysis of information gaps and research priorities is lacking. Therefore, it is necessary to identify gaps in the knowledge of invasive species in order to define future research priorities and focus conservation efforts. We assessed the current state of knowledge of biological invasions in Mexico based on the existing literature. Our aim was to identify in which areas information is absent or insufficient and which areas should be prioritised. We identified a total of 869 references. The number of references increased over time and the topics were strongly biased towards two areas: 1) natural history and geographical distribution patterns and 2) effects on native biota and ecosystems. The remaining topics were only moderately or poorly studied. Most studies focused on vascular plants (n = 280) and fishes (n = 174). Notably, a large portion of the references (n = 215) focused on only eight invasive alien species, including their ecological and socioeconomic impacts. Only 95 references examined the effects of alien species on biodiversity; these studies were mainly carried out on islands (n = 41) or in terrestrial or freshwater ecosystems in protected natural areas (n = 165). The findings of the present review can guide future studies in filling in the existing research gaps on biological invasions. Additionally, future studies should aim to define national priorities of the impacts of biological invasions and to promote the prevention and control of alien species by considering the distinct vectors and pathways of introduction and movement.

TI The influence of the academic conservation biology literature on
   endangered species recovery planning
SO CONSERVATION ECOLOGY
AB Despite the volume of the academic conservation biology literature, there is little evidence as to what effect this work is having on endangered species recovery efforts. Using data collected from a national review of 136 endangered and threatened species recovery plans, we evaluated whether recovery plans were changing in response to publication trends in four areas of the academic conservation biology literature: metapopulation dynamics, population viability analysis, conservation corridors, and conservation genetics. We detected several changes in recovery plans in apparent response to publication trends in these areas (e.g., the number of tasks designed to promote the recovery of an endangered species shifted, although these tasks were rarely assigned a high priority). Our results indicate that, although the content of endangered species recovery plans changes in response to the literature, results are not uniform across all topics. We suggest that academic conservation biologists need to address the relative importance of each topic for conservation practice in different settings.

This invasive species has been captured in the estuaries of the Fluvia, Muga and Ter rivers and has become established in the Fluvia River in only nine months since the first individual was detected. These reports show how rapid expansion of C. sapidus can be and that this may be preceded by the presence of isolated individuals.

TI Should tourists care more about invasive species? International and
   domestic visitors' perceptions of invasive plants and their control in
   New Zealand
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB Tourism has been implicated in the spread of invasive species, not only through physical means but through invasive species being perpetuated in destinations as part of the tourism landscape. This study reports on a survey of 238 domestic and international tourists visiting the south of New Zealand, with a focus on their knowledge of and attitudes to the management of two invasive plants: wild conifers and Russell lupins. Both plants have profound ecological, economic and environmental impacts but are also increasingly a part of the tourist landscapes in the study region. The survey found significant differences between domestic and international visitors in their levels of ecological knowledge about the invasive plants, with domestic visitors having greater awareness. However, there were also significant differences between international visitors according to origin and ethnicity, with Asian visitors showing lower awareness and also lower willingness to support eradication of the invasives, even after being provided information on the ecological impact of the species. Participants also responded differently to the two species, being less willing to support eradication of the attractive Russell lupin, compared to wild conifers. There are implications for management in terms of the messaging that may be required for different visitor groups around invasive species control. The study also points to the challenge of developing support for the management of charismatic plant species such as Russell lupin that are now firmly located within the tourism domain.

TI Reclaiming the commons for urban transformation
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB This paper investigates how public space can leverage disruptive changes in urban environments which compel sustainable urban transformation. We draw on three recent cases in New York City (Times Square in Manhattan, Jackson Heights in Queens and 596 Acres in Brooklyn), where activation of public space radically changed the function and identify of apparently stable urban systems by giving rise to nascent 'urban commons'. As healthy commons are indicative of cultural and institutional practices aligned with sustainability, we examine how innovative social and institutional practices can form in urban environments, and compel more sustainable ways of living. Drawing on resilience theory as a framework, our analysis focuses on the contextual conditions and mechanisms that enabled new public spaces to form; the processes by which 'commons practices' developed; and the way these urban commons influence urban systems more widely. We find that rigid urban systems can be 'loosened' by iteratively prototyping urban interventions (such as temporary street closures). These actions create fertile, low-risk, experimental conditions in which stakeholders can cultivate and consolidate shared resources and custodial commons practices. The formation of these 'communities of practice' is essential for the advocacy and protection of new commons as they begin to scale and challenge dominant urban system configurations. We conclude by describing how urban commons must scale vertically and horizontally within wider urban systems to support transformation towards sustainability. Upon identifying a range of challenges to this process, we suggest that the distributed replication of small public space interventions may offer the most pragmatic path towards promoting and normalising commons practices, as it can seed a groundswell of grassroots social innovation. In turn, these activities may lay the cultural foundations for traditional institutional stakeholders and urban authorities to play a more progressive and enabling role in urban transformation.

TI Adaptive invasive species distribution models: a framework for modeling
   incipient invasions
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB The utilization of species distribution model(s) (SDM) for approximating, explaining, and predicting changes in species' geographic locations is increasingly promoted for proactive ecological management. Although frameworks for modeling non-invasive species distributions are relatively well developed, their counterparts for invasive species-which may not be at equilibrium within recipient environments and often exhibit rapid transformations-are lacking. Additionally, adaptive ecological management strategies address the causes and effects of biological invasions and other complex issues in social-ecological systems. We conducted a review of biological invasions, species distribution models, and adaptive practices in ecological management, and developed a framework for adaptive, niche-based, invasive species distribution model (iSDM) development and utilization. This iterative, 10-step framework promotes consistency and transparency in iSDM development, allows for changes in invasive drivers and filters, integrates mechanistic and correlative modeling techniques, balances the avoidance of type 1 and type 2 errors in predictions, encourages the linking of monitoring and management actions, and facilitates incremental improvements in models and management across space, time, and institutional boundaries. These improvements are useful for advancing coordinated invasive species modeling, management and monitoring from local scales to the regional, continental and global scales at which biological invasions occur and harm native ecosystems and economies, as well as for anticipating and responding to biological invasions under continuing global change.

TI The role of scientists in statutory interpretation of the US Endangered
   Species Act
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB Like many federal statutes, the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) contains vague or ambiguous language. The meaning imparted to the ESA's unclear language can profoundly impact the fates of endangered and threatened species. Hence, conservation scientists should contribute to the interpretation of the ESA when vague or ambiguous language contains scientific words or refers to scientific concepts. Scientists need to know at least these 2 facts about statutory interpretation: statutory interpretation is subjective and the potential influence of normative values results in different expectations for the parties involved. With the possible exception of judges, all conventional participants in statutory interpretation are serving their own interests, advocating for their preferred policies, or biased. Hence, scientists can play a unique role by informing the interpretative process with objective, policy-neutral information. Conversely, scientists may act as advocates for their preferred interpretation of unclear statutory language. The different roles scientists might play in statutory interpretation raise the issues of advocacy and competency. Advocating for a preferred statutory interpretation is legitimate political behavior by scientists, but statutory interpretation can be strongly influenced by normative values. Therefore, scientists must be careful not to commit stealth policy advocacy. Most conservation scientists lack demonstrable competence in statutory interpretation and therefore should consult or collaborate with lawyers when interpreting statutes. Professional scientific societies are widely perceived by the public as unbiased sources of objective information. Therefore, professional scientific societies should remain policy neutral and present all interpretations of unclear statutory language; explain the semantics and science both supporting and contradicting each interpretation; and describe the potential consequences of implementing each interpretation. A review of scientists' interpretations of the phrase significant portion of its range in the ESA is used to critique the role of scientists and professional societies in statutory interpretation.

TI INVASIVE SPECIES AND THE LOS OF BETA DIVERSITY
SO ETHICS AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB Why should we avoid introducing invasive species? In this paper I argue that in addition to the more ordinary and visible types of harm that invasive species cause, they also cause a reduction in a particular kind of biodiversity-that of beta diversity. Rather than simply measuring the number of species found in a particular region, beta diversity measures the differences in the species found between regions. This difference between regions can be measured by comparing neighboring regions (local beta diversity) or by comparing distant regions (global beta diversity). Both types of beta diversity are reduced by the introduction of invasive species. I further argue that beta diversity is an important part of our concept of biodiversity and of what we value about the natural world. Thus the tendency of invasive species to reduce beta diversity gives us a substantial reason to avoid introducing them.

TI Short-term recovery of native vegetation and threatened species after
   restoration of a remnant forest in a small oceanic island of the South
   Pacific
SO PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY
AB Background: Invasive alien species have transformed many natural ecosystems, especially on islands where endemic species are critically endangered, and where habitat restoration is a challenge. Aims: We set up an experimental protocol to aid the restoration of a native remnant forest by excluding feral ungulates and suppressing an invasive tree. Methods: Sixteen plots of 144 m(2) were delimited in a dry-mesic forest located on the small oceanic island of Rapa Iti (South Pacific) and half of them were fenced. The invasive tree Psidium cattleianum was manually cut in four fenced and four unfenced plots. We monitored understorey species diversity and abundance every 6 months for a period of 30 months in twenty-four 4-m(2) quadrats randomly selected in each plot. Results: A significant increase of native species richness occurred in the fenced plots where the invasive tree was suppressed, and a decrease of alien species diversity in the fenced plots. The abundance of native and alien species was significantly reduced in the fenced plots, where recruitment of endemic threatened species was observed. Conclusion: Rapid vegetation change occurred in 30 months. The understorey plant community response to ungulate exclusion and invasive tree removal strongly differed between native and alien species, with the recovery of native vegetation.

TI Adaptive social networks promote the wisdom of crowds
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Social networks continuously change as new ties are created and existing ones fade. It is widely acknowledged that our social embedding has a substantial impact on what information we receive and how we form beliefs and make decisions. However, most empirical studies on the role of social networks in collective intelligence have overlooked the dynamic nature of social networks and its role in fostering adaptive collective intelligence. Therefore, little is known about how groups of individuals dynamically modify their local connections and, accordingly, the topology of the network of interactions to respond to changing environmental conditions. In this paper, we address this question through a series of behavioral experiments and supporting simulations. Our results reveal that, in the presence of plasticity and feedback, social networks can adapt to biased and changing information environments and produce collective estimates that are more accurate than their best-performing member. To explain these results, we explore two mechanisms: 1) a global-adaptation mechanism where the structural connectivity of the network itself changes such that it amplifies the estimates of high-performing members within the group (i.e., the network "edges" encode the computation); and 2) a local-adaptation mechanism where accurate individuals are more resistant to social influence (i.e., adjustments to the attributes of the "node" in the network); therefore, their initial belief is dispro-portionately weighted in the collective estimate. Our findings substantiate the role of social-network plasticity and feedback as key adaptive mechanisms for refining individual and collective judgments.

TI On the RIP: using Relative Impact Potential to assess the ecological
   impacts of invasive alien species
SO NEOBIOTA
AB Invasive alien species continue to arrive in new locations with no abatement in rate, and thus greater predictive powers surrounding their ecological impacts are required. In particular, we need improved means of quantifying the ecological impacts of new invasive species under different contexts. Here, we develop a suite of metrics based upon the novel Relative Impact Potential (RIP) metric, combining the functional response (consumer per capita effect), with proxies for the numerical response (consumer population response), providing quantification of invasive species ecological impact. These metrics are comparative in relation to the eco-evolutionary baseline of trophically analogous natives, as well as other invasive species and across multiple populations. Crucially, the metrics also reveal how impacts of invasive species change under abiotic and biotic contexts. While studies focused solely on functional responses have been successful in predictive invasion ecology, RIP retains these advantages while adding vital other predictive elements, principally consumer abundance. RIP can also be combined with propagule pressure to quantify overall invasion risk. By highlighting functional response and numerical response proxies, we outline a user-friendly method for assessing the impacts of invaders of all trophic levels and taxonomic groups. We apply the metric to impact assessment in the face of climate change by taking account of both changing predator consumption rates and prey reproduction rates. We proceed to outline the application of RIP to assess biotic resistance against incoming invasive species, the effect of evolution on invasive species impacts, application to interspecific competition, changing spatio-temporal patterns of invasion, and how RIP can inform biological control. We propose that RIP provides scientists and practitioners with a user-friendly, customisable and, crucially, powerful technique to inform invasive species policy and management.

TI Friends or foe? Invasive species and public green space in Toronto
SO GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW
AB Environmentalists and ecologists typically regard invasive species as ecologically detrimental and undesirable. Although the ecological impacts of invasive species are well documented, less attention has been devoted to the sociocultural contexts guiding responses to species invasion. In this study the roles of invasive species are reconsidered through three prominent green spaces in Toronto, Canada: the Don Valley Brick Works, High Park, and the Leslie Street Spit. The case studies challenge popular negative assumptions about invasive species and suggest that they can serve important functions both for local ecosystems and for human communities. The case studies also provide lessons on the tension between and within different environmental imaginaries informing invasive species management. Invasives are often compatible with recreational interests, whereas naturalization efforts are ecologically sensitive and costly. Invasives can help restore human-made wastelands, and naturalization efforts often benefit wealthy rather than poor neighborhoods.

TI Expansion of Vertebrate Pest Exclusion Fencing and Its Potential
   Benefits for Threatened Fauna Recovery in Australia
SO ANIMALS
AB Simple Summary
   Globally, there is a need to preserve threatened species before they disappear. The management of these species is often aided, particularly in Australia, by the addition of exclusion fences that prevent the movement of invasive or pest predators and competitors into the conservation area. Widespread use of conservation fences is limited by the availability of suitable conservation land and the relatively high costs of such fencing. Here, we discuss the potential conservation benefit of pest exclusion fences erected on agricultural land. We assess the spatial overlap of existing agricultural exclusion fences (known as "cluster fences") with the potential habitat of listed threatened species and consider whether or not identified threats to these species are potentially alleviated within cluster fences. We find that there are several species that face threats which may be alleviated with cluster fences and propose that active recovery of threatened species on fenced agricultural land be seriously considered.
   The global effort to conserve threatened species relies heavily on our ability to separate these species from the processes that threaten them, and a common tool used for this purpose is exclusion fencing. In Australia, pest animal exclusion fencing has been repeatedly used on conservation land on a small scale to successfully exclude introduced predators and competitors from threatened native fauna populations. However, in recent years, "cluster fencing" on agricultural land has re-emerged on a large scale and is used by livestock producers seeking to reduce predation losses by dingoes (Canis familiaris) and manage total grazing pressure from native and introduced herbivores, including red kangaroos (Osphranter rufus). Given that the primary threats to at-risk native fauna are also predation and overgrazing, there may be potential for cluster fencing on livestock land to achieve additional fauna conservation benefits. Understanding the amount, location and potential conservation value of cluster fenced livestock land is critical for determining how these areas might contribute to broader threatened fauna recovery goals. Drawing from publicly available databases maintained by the Australian Government, we assessed the spatial overlap of threatened species' distributions with 105 cluster fences erected in Queensland since 2013, which cover 65,901 km(2) of land. These cluster fenced areas represent 18 biogeographic subregions and may contain 28 extant threatened mammals, birds and reptiles including 18 vulnerable species, 7 endangered species and 3 critically endangered species. An average of nine threatened species or their habitats were identified per cluster, and over three quarters (78.6%) of these species face at least one threat that is being mitigated within clusters. The true status of threatened and pest species within clusters is largely unknown or unrecorded in most cases, but some examples of pest eradication and threatened species recovery are already emerging. Given the vast size of the cluster fenced estate, the many different biomes and species that it represents and the nature of the threats being removed within these fenced areas, we contend that agricultural cluster fencing may offer an unprecedented opportunity to advance threatened fauna conservation goals for some species at scales previously thought impossible and should be a research priority for threatened species managers.

TI Genomic data is missing for many highly invasive species, restricting
   our preparedness for escalating incursion rates
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Biological invasions drive environmental change, potentially threatening native biodiversity, human health, and global economies. Population genomics is an increasingly popular tool in invasion biology, improving accuracy and providing new insights into the genetic factors that underpin invasion success compared to research based on a small number of genetic loci. We examine the extent to which population genomic resources, including reference genomes, have been used or are available for invasive species research. We find that 82% of species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature "100 Worst Invasive Alien Species" list have been studied using some form of population genetic data, but just 32% of these species have been studied using population genomic data. Further, 55% of the list's species lack a reference genome. With incursion rates escalating globally, understanding how genome-driven processes facilitate invasion is critical, but despite a promising trend of increasing uptake, "invasion genomics" is still in its infancy. We discuss how population genomic data can enhance our understanding of biological invasion and inform proactive detection and management of invasive species, and we call for more research that specifically targets this area.

TI Invasive fountain grass (Pennisetum setaceum(Forssk.) Chiov.) increases
   its potential area of distribution in Tenerife island under future
   climatic scenarios
SO PLANT ECOLOGY
AB Mapping the distribution of invasive species under current and future climate conditions is crucial to implement sustainable and effective conservation strategies. Several studies showed how invasive species may benefit from climate change fostering their invasion rate and, consequently, affecting the native species community. In the Canary Islands and on Tenerife in particular, previous research mostly focused on climate change impacts on the native communities, whereas less attention has been paid on alien species distribution under climate change scenarios. In this study, we modelled the habitat distribution ofPennisetum setaceum, one of the most invasive alien species on Tenerife. In addition, we described the species' potential distribution shift in the light of two climate change scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP8.5), highlighting the areas that should be prioritized during management and eradication programs.P. setaceum's suitable areas are located in the coastal area, with higher habitat suitability near cities and below 800 m asl. In both future climate change scenarios, the geographic distribution ofP. setaceumsuitable areas is characterized by an elevational shift, which is more pronounced in the RCP8.5 scenario. Despite being drought resistant, water supply is crucial for the species' seed germination, thus supporting future species' shift to higher elevation and in the north-north-west part of the island, where it could benefit from the combined effect of orographic precipitations and humidity carried by trade winds.

TI Practice jazz: Understanding variation in family practices using
   complexity science
SO JOURNAL OF FAMILY PRACTICE
AB Much variation exists in family practices. There is also much that is constant and deeply resistant to change. In this paper we present the current state of an ongoing 4-year process of applying the concepts of complexity science to help interpret the results of 3 studies of the content and process of family practice. We use 2 case studies from these data sets to illustrate the application of complexity science to understanding Variation and the process of change in generalist practice.
   Our emerging understanding conceptualizes family practices as local professional complex adaptive systems. These systems exist for the purpose of seeing patients for everyday health concerns and assisting them in getting on with their daily lives. Each family practice is unique because of history and initial conditions, particular agents (eg, physicians, staff, patients, systems), nonlinear interactions among agents, the local ecology, and regional and global influences. How all these factors manifest in a particular practice can be understood using 3 complexity science properties: self-organization, emergence, and co-evolution. The concepts of sense-making and improvisation can he used to understand how practices deal with variation.
   We conclude that complexity science concepts can provide a useful framework for understanding variation and change in family practices. The challenge is to differentiate error from relational variation and to improve practices' sense-making and improvisational skills. Future efforts to improve practice should focus on optimizing a practice's care as a whole and enhancing reflective practice and relationship-centered care.

TI Tidal and seasonal effects on survival rates of the endangered
   California clapper rail: does invasive Spartina facilitate greater
   survival in a dynamic environment?
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB Invasive species frequently degrade habitats, disturb ecosystem processes, and can increase the likelihood of extinction of imperiled populations. However, novel or enhanced functions provided by invading species may reduce the impact of processes that limit populations. It is important to recognize how invasive species benefit endangered species to determine overall effects on sensitive ecosystems. For example, since the 1990s, hybrid Spartina (Spartina foliosa x alterniflora) has expanded throughout South San Francisco Bay, USA, supplanting native vegetation and invading mudflats. The endangered California clapper rail (Rallus longirostris obsoletus) uses the tall, dense hybrid Spartina for cover and nesting, but the effects of hybrid Spartina on clapper rail survival was unknown. We estimated survival rates of 108 radio-marked California clapper rails in South San Francisco Bay from January 2007 to March 2010, a period of extensive hybrid Spartina eradication, with Kaplan-Meier product limit estimators. Clapper rail survival patterns were consistent with hybrid Spartina providing increased refuge cover from predators during tidal extremes which flood native vegetation, particularly during the winter when the vegetation senesces. Model averaged annual survival rates within hybrid Spartina dominated marshes before eradication (Ae = 0.466) were greater than the same marshes posttreatment (Ae = 0.275) and a marsh dominated by native vegetation (Ae = 0.272). However, models with and without marsh treatment as explanatory factor for survival rates had nearly equivalent support in the observed data, lending ambiguity as to whether hybrid Spartina facilitated greater survival rates than native marshland. Conservation actions to aid in recovery of this endangered species should recognize the importance of available of high tide refugia, particularly in light of invasive species eradication programs and projections of future sea-level rise.

TI Assessing biological invasions in protected areas after 30 years:
   Revisiting nature reserves targeted by the 1980s SCOPE programme
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB Invasive alien species pose a major threat to biodiversity and natural ecosystems globally and negatively affect conservation efforts in protected areas. They can negatively alter biodiversity and ecological regimes and are a financial burden. Because of their negative impacts, it is important to better understand the threat and management of invasive alien species in protected areas (PAs) globally, and to know how these factors have changed over time. We give an update and compare how the threat and management of invasive species has changed in 21 PAs that were analysed as part of the international SCOPE programme on biological invasions in the mid-1980s. Of all the taxa analysed, invasive plants pose the greatest continued threat, and their numbers have increased in 31% of the PAs. Conversely, mammal invasions now represent less of a threat due to effective management in many PAs; 43% of PAs show a decrease in listed invasive alien mammal taxa. Invasions of amphibians, reptiles, and fish have remained stable over the three decades; around half of the PAs show no change for these taxa. Managers of most PAs consider the threat of invasions to be increasing, despite many (55%) PAs having sustained long-term management programmes and 45% having implemented additional ad hoc approaches. We draw on lessons from this analysis to support the future management of biological invasions in conservation areas. In particular, better monitoring and collation of data is needed, followed by increased preventative measures and the promotion of biological control for widespread species.

TI Threatened species legislation: Just one act in the play
SO THREATENED SPECIES LEGISLATION: IS IT JUST AN ACT?
CT Royal-Zoological-Society-of-New-South-Wales Forum Threatened Species
   Legislation
CY OCT 25, 2003
CL Mosman, AUSTRALIA
SP Royal Zoolog Soc New S Wales
AB Governments in Australia and elsewhere in the world use legislation to conserve species and other elements of biodiversity that are threatened by human activities. This forum examined to what extent relying on the legislative process is justified and, in particular, considered the effectiveness of legislation in achieving broad conservation goals.A synthesis of the papers presented at the one day forum run by the Royal Zoological Society of NSW is presented in this final paper.These papers display considerable insight into how threatened species legislation works, from the decision to list a species, to the consequences of listing for government departments, local councils, community groups and consultants. While the papers concentrated on the NSW Acts, they were compared with Commonwealth and other States' legislation as well as overseas examples. For many contributors to this forum, threatened species legislation is deficient in that it focuses on conspicuous, iconic and well-known taxa, and does little to conserve small, cryptic organisms, common but declining taxa, or ecological processes. In addition, threatened entities must often be identified using imprecise criteria that can be interpreted differently, and uncertain or incomplete information, while recovery planning for ever-expanding lists of threatened taxa is difficult and expensive. Scarce resources could be made to go further by allocating them to priority taxa, but criteria for ranking priorities are themselves highly contentious. Given these difficulties, an efficient way forward would be to identify common threats that afflict suites of populations, species and ecological communities and to target these for management.This is possible, but has been given insufficient priority under some existing legislation such as the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Other priorities for achieving broad conservation goals are the familiar yet critical requirements for sustaining research, education and funding, but added to these is the need for more public debate, engagement of the whole community, and informed inspiration to show that solutions are possible.We conclude that threatened species legislation is important, but just one act in the biodiversity play.

SO PHYTOTAXA
AB Invasive plants had raised lots of concern about the environment and biodiversity. Many members of Asteraceae are notorious invasive alien species across the world. In Taiwan, Emilia (Asteraceae) contains one native and two naturalized species. Recently, we found some morphologically intermediate individuals between the native E. sonchifolia var. javanica and the alien E. praetermissa from northern Taiwan where the latter two grow sympatrically. Based on morphological comparisons, pollen viability and flow cytometry information, we confirmed the fact of natural hybridization. Herein, we describe a new hybrid Emilia xlatens J.-Y Wang & J.-C. Wang and provide a key to Emilia species in Taiwan.

AB Invasive species are species that cause economic and ecological harm and/or harm to human health. One challenge to managing invasive species is the lack of awareness about these species and the threats they pose. To mitigate this problem, the University of Florida Center for Aquatic and Invasive Plants developed a classroom board game for children to learn about trade-offs in managing invasive species. The game is effective in increasing knowledge about invasive species and promoting collaborative discussions. However, this board game is only accessible within the classroom. We created a mobile digital game that expands on the goals of the board game. In this paper, we discuss the design of the board and digital versions of the game, and provide some guidelines for designing digital learning games that address real-world problems that have no optimal solution, like the management of invasive species. Future work will evaluate the effectiveness of the digital game in enhancing children's knowledge about invasive species.

TI Agent-based model for simulation of the sustainability revolution in
   eco-industrial parks
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB Eco-industrial parks (EIPs) are of increasing importance for implementing industrial ecology strategies and are facing increasing challenges in terms of environmental pollution and resource scarcity. As a complex adaptive system, an EIP involves multiple sectors and faces various disturbances that influence its evolutionary trajectories. This study adopts an agent-based model to simulate the material flows and industrial symbiosis process in the EIP, considering the initiative of each company and the ever-changing environment. The proposed EIP model emphasises the heterogeneity of companies and attempts to reflect multiple and dynamic factors that have received less attention in previous studies. This model contains two types of agents, companies and the external environment. A company agent makes decisions and interacts with other agents following its own behaviour rules, while the external environment agent functions to coordinate the material flows and exert influence on the companies. The model has been verified and validated by simulating a 20-year-period development of an empirical EIP in China. The simulation results are assessed by three indicators: eco-connectance, eco-efficiency, and industrial symbiosis indicator. Results showed that during the growing phase, the eco-connectance increased from 0.02 to 0.1 for the non-disturbance situation. The eco-efficiency and industrial symbiosis indicator also realised 78.5% and 74.8% of their total increments. The outcome of this research provides insights for the design of the strategies to improve the industrial symbiosis performance and is of high potential to facilitate EIPs in promoting eco-transformation and sustainable development.

TI A transformative translational change programme to introduce genomics
   into healthcare: a complexity and implementation science study protocol
SO BMJ OPEN
AB Introduction Translating scientific advances in genomic medicine into evidence-based clinical practice is challenging. Studying the natural translation of genomics into 'early-adopting' health system sectors is essential. We will (a) examine 29 health systems (Australian and Melbourne Genomics Health Alliance flagships) integrating genomics into practice and (b) combine this learning to co-design and test an evidence-based generalisable toolkit for translating genomics into healthcare.
   Methods and analysis Twenty-nine flagships integrating genomics into clinical settings are studied as complex adaptive systems to understand emergent and self-organising behaviours among inter-related actors and processes. The Effectiveness-Implementation Hybrid approach is applied to gather information on the delivery and potential for real-world implementation. Stages '1' and '2a' (representing hybrid model 1) are the focus of this protocol. The Translation Science to Population Impact (TSci Impact) framework is used to study policy decisions and service provision, and the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) is used to understand individual level behavioural change; both frameworks are applied across stages 1 and 2a. Stage 1 synthesises interview data from 32 participants involved in developing the genomics clinical practice systems and approaches across five 'demonstration-phase' (early adopter) flagships. In stage 2a, stakeholders are providing quantitative and qualitative data on process mapping, clinical audits, uptake and sustainability (TSci Impact), and psychosocial and environmental determinants of change (TDF). Findings will be synthesised before codesigning an intervention toolkit to facilitate implementation of genomic testing. Study methods to simultaneously test the comparative effectiveness of genomic testing and the implementation toolkit (stage 2b), and the refined implementation toolkit while simply observing the genomics intervention (stage 3) are summarised.
   Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been granted. The results will be disseminated in academic forums and used to refine interventions to translate genomics evidence into healthcare. Non-traditional academic dissemination methods (eg, change in guidelines or government policy) will also be employed.

TI Leaf and root trait variability of alien and native species along
   Adriatic coastal dunes (Italy)
SO PLANT BIOSYSTEMS
AB This study regards the analysis of leaf and root trait variability of the most invasive alien species and some common native species developing along central-southern Adriatic sand dunes in Italy. The results highlight that large leaf area, the reproductive period in late summer, a biennial/annual life cycle and thick, long roots are useful traits for the successful colonisation of the most invasive species Oenothera biennis, Erigeron canadensis and Xanthium orientale subsp. italicum along the mobile coastal dunes. These alien plants grow in spatial niches generated by eutrophication and human pressure, such as waste deposits on the beach and inter-dune gaps, flattened and altered by human trampling. We suggest that exotic species in the study area are currently occupying temporal and spatial niches that are not being exploited by native species and, therefore, they are not competing directly for the same resources.

TI Conservation of Brazilian amphibians
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB Brazil is the world leader in amphibian diversity, with 765 species, most of which have been described in the last 40 years. The Brazilian Official List of Threatened Species and the results of a workshop for the Global Amphibian Assessment indicate that 26 species are threatened. The majority of these occur in the Atlantic Forest, one of the world's biodiversity hotspots. The main threat to amphibians is the destruction of their habitats through deforestation, conversion into agricultural land, mining, wildfires, and infrastructure development and urbanization. In Brazil little is known about other causes of amphibian decline observed worldwide, such as pesticides, infectious diseases, climate change, invasive species, or wildlife trade. Brazilian conservation policies include such important legal instruments as the Official List of Threatened Species and the selection of priority areas for conservation measures in all of Brazil's major biomes. Although there is little information on geographic distributions and the natural history and ecology of the large majority of the currently recognized species, a. number of important regional studies for amphibian conservation are under way. Net; species are discovered each year.

TI Species review of amphibian extinction risks in Madagascar: Conclusions
   from the global amphibian assessment
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB We assessed the extinction risks of Malagasy amphibians by evaluating their distribution, occurrence in protected areas, population trends, habitat quality and prevalence in commercial trade. We estimated and mapped the distribution of each of the 220 described Malagasy species and applied, for the first time, the IUCN Red List categories and criteria to all species described at the time of the assessment, Nine species were categorized as critically endangered, 21 as endangered, and 25 as vulnerable. The most threatened species occur on the High Plateau and/or have been subjected to overcollection for the pet trade, bill restricted extent of occurrence and ongoing habitat destruction were identified as the most important factors influencing extinction threats. The two areas with the majority of threatened species were the northern Tsaratanana-Marojejy-Masoala highlands and the southeastern A nosy Mountains. The current system of Protected areas includes 82% of the threatened amphibian species. Of the critically endangered species, 6 did not occur in any protected area. For conservation of these species we recommend the creation of a reserve for the species of the Mantella aurantiaca group, the inclusion of two Scaphiophryne species in the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species Appendix II and the suspension of commercial collecting for Mantella cowani. Field surveys during the last 15 years reveal no pervasive extinction of Malagasy amphibians resulting from disease or other agents, as has been reported in some other areas of the world.

TI The role of enemy release, tolerance and resistance in plant invasions:
   linking damage to performance
SO ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB P>An explanation for successful invasion is that invasive alien species sustain less pressure from natural enemies than co-occurring native species. Using meta-analysis, we examined whether invasive species: (1) incur less damage, (2) exhibit better performance in the presence of enemies, and (3) tolerate damage more than native species. Invasive alien species did not incur less damage than native species overall. The performance of invasive alien species was reduced compared to natives in the presence of enemies, indicating the invasive alien species were less tolerant to damage than native species. However, there was no overall difference in performance of invasive alien and native species with enemies present. The damage and degree of reduction in performance of invasive alien relative to native species did not depend on relatedness to natives. Our results suggest aliens may not always experience enemy release, and enemy release may not always result in greater plant performance.

TI The susceptibility of rare and threatened NSW species to the root-rot
   pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi: 1. Initial testing and identification
   of key research questions
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB In Australia disease caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi can have devastating impacts on native vegetation, especially on plant species with restricted distributions. The identification of susceptible threatened species is a crucial first step in understanding disease aetiology and selecting appropriate management. In a glasshouse trial, plants of 16 rare and threatened New South Wales native species from 10 families were inoculated with the pathogen. Phebalium squamulosum spp. alpinum was included as a susceptible control. We found that three species are highly susceptible to the pathogen (Nematolepis rhytidophylla (Albr. & N.G.Walsh) Paul G.Wilson, Prostanthera marifolia R.Br., Pultenaea sp. `Genowlan Point'); four others (Hibbertia spanantha Toelken & A.F.Rob, Phebalium bifidum P.H.Weston & M.J.Turton, Plinthanthesis rodwayi (C.E.Hubb.) S.T.Blake, Pomaderris delicata N.G.Walsh & Coates) are likely to be susceptible based on symptoms. The remaining species had few or no plant deaths and no pathogen recovery from the roots. All of the species regarded as highly susceptible are known from single populations. Following these results, subsequent research will assess the efficacy of prophylactic treatment on highly susceptible threatened species, and test whether glasshouse tests are indicative of field responses. Other threatened species will also be tested for susceptibility.

TI Contribution of small isolated habitats in creating refuges from
   biological invasions along a geomorphological gradient of floodplain
   waterbodies
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB Habitat fragmentation, which involves habitat size reduction and isolation, is a major cause of biodiversity decline. However, interest in small isolated habitats has increased among ecosystem managers because these fragments can serve as remnant refuges for unique and/or endangered species in human-altered landscapes. In a fragmented floodplain of northern Japan, we demonstrate how habitat fragmentation and habitat quality shape the refuges for a unique endangered minnow Rhynchocypris percnurus sachalinensis from biological invasions. We focused on two invasive minnows, topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva and rosy bitterling Rhodeus ocellatus ocellatus, which are the dominant invasive species. By using a graph theoretical approach and structural equation modelling, we elucidated the relationships among habitat fragmentation, habitat quality and the abundance of invasive minnows with the endangered swamp minnow. We found that the invasion of topmouth gudgeon, which has a high mobility and environmental tolerance, negatively affected swamp minnow populations. The invasive species may outcompete the native species in their overlapping trophic niche. Analyses indicated that habitat fragmentation (decreasing habitat size and connectivity) indirectly and positively affected the population abundance of swamp minnow by reducing the potential for invasion by topmouth gudgeon. We further found an interaction between the indirect effects of habitat fragmentation and local habitat quality: the indirect effects became more apparent in the relatively deeper habitats that were of better quality for natives. This result was likely attributed to the strong control effect of the abiotic stressor. Interspecific competition between the two minnows would be masked in shallow ponds because the native populations are primarily restricted by the abiotic factor, and its abundance is inherently limited regardless of pressure by invaders. Synthesis and applications. In fragmented landscapes, evenly conserving all small fragments within a limited budget is difficult. The change in importance of small isolated ponds across a pond-depth gradient suggests that conservation priorities for small fragments should be established by considering local habitat quality. Our findings do not justify habitat fragmentation but suggest that both landscape-scale and local-scale perspectives synergistically aid in the management of biological invasions in modified habitat networks.

TI Conserving biodiversity and Indigenous bush tucker: Practical
   application of the strategic foresight framework to invasive alien
   species management planning
SO CONSERVATION LETTERS
AB Invasive alien species are a major driver of global biodiversity loss. Constrained conservation budgets demand that threat abatement strategies take into account the heterogeneity of areas in need of protection, such as significant ecological and cultural sites, as well as the competing values, preferences, and objectives of stakeholders. We used strategic foresight to assess the threat that invasive alien grasses pose to environmental and Indigenous cultural values on the floodplains of a comanaged, World Heritage-inscribed national park. We found strategic foresight to be a useful framework to set management priorities that simultaneously conserve biological and cultural diversity. However, it required the development and application of novel ecological and participatory tools and significant time, financial, and human resources. This was the first study to apply strategic foresight to weed management planning in a realistic, culturally complex setting and our work provides an exemplar for the application of the strategic foresight framework and our tools to other contexts.

TI Daily Temperature Effect on Seedling Growth Dynamic of Three Invasive
   Alien Species
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB A greater relative growth rate (RGR) is positively correlated with a species' ability to deploy a larger leaf area either due to a greater total number of leaves (LN) in the canopy or due to an average size of individual leaves (LA). This study aimed to analyze and compare, (1) the temporal (i.e., daily) RGR, leaf production rate (LPR), and leaf area production rate (LAPR) changes during the early growth stages of three among the most invasive species in the world, namely, Ailanthus altissima, Phytolacca americana, and Robinia pseudoacacia. (2) the interspecific differences in the relationship between RGR, LPR, LAPR, and mean daily air temperature. Our results show that growth dynamics as a function of temperature differ between invasive alien species (IAS). While these differences are partly explained by differences due to the growth form of the investigated species, the three IAS have a different behavior to adjust RGR, LPR, and LAPR with air temperature changes even within the same growth form, and in agreement with species habitat requirements in their native range. In conclusion, the results help disentangle the relative role of RGR, LPR, and LAPR in defining non-native species growth responses to mean daily air temperature also in relation to a species' growth form.

TI DNA-based identification of invasive alien species in relation to
   Canadian federal policy and law, and the basis of rapid-response
   management
SO GENOME
AB Managing invasive alien species in Canada requires reliable taxonomic identification as the basis of rapid-response management. This can be challenging, especially when organisms are small and lack morphological diagnostic features. DNA-based techniques, such as DNA barcoding, offer a reliable, rapid, and inexpensive toolkit for taxonomic identification of individual or bulk samples, forensic remains, and even environmental DNA. Well suited for this requirement, they could be more broadly deployed and incorporated into the operating policy and practices of Canadian federal departments and should be authorized under these agencies' articles of law. These include Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Transport Canada, Environment Canada, Parks Canada, and Health Canada. These efforts should be harmonized with the appropriate provisions of provincial jurisdictions, for example, the Ontario Invasive Species Act. This approach necessitates that a network of accredited, certified laboratories exists, and that updated DNA reference libraries are readily accessible. Harmonizing this approach is vital among Canadian federal agencies, and between the federal and provincial levels of government. Canadian policy and law must also be harmonized with that of the USA when detecting, and responding to, invasive species in contiguous lands and waters. Creating capacity in legislation for use of DNA-based identifications brings the authority to fund, train, deploy, and certify staff, and to refine further developments in this molecular technology.

TI Maintenance of Brazilian Biodiversity by germplasm bank
SO PESQUISA VETERINARIA BRASILEIRA
AB Currently the importance of using alternative strategies for biodiversity conservation is emphasized and since the establishment of germplasm bank is an alternative to the conservation of endangered species. This is a technique of great importance for the maintenance of Brazilian fauna. Since the early70' sthere was a growing concern about the need to preserve essential genetic resources for food and agriculture, mainly for conservation of genetic material from farm animals. Thus was created the Brasilia Zoo, in July 2010, the first Germplasm Bank of Wild Animals in Latin America, as an alternative strategy for the conservation of threatened or endangered species, using both gametes and somatic cells and stem cells. Then we argue to create new banks or research networks among different regions with aimed to tissue preservation.

TI Body mass patterns predict invasions and extinctions in transforming
   landscapes
SO ECOSYSTEMS
AB Scale-specific patterns of resource distribution on landscapes entrain attributes of-resident animal communities such that species body-mass distributions are organized into distinct aggregations. Species within each aggregation respond to resources over the same range of scale. This discontinuous pattern has predictive power: invasive species and extinct or declining species in landscapes subject to human transformation tend to be located at the edge of body-mass aggregations (P < 0.01), which may be transition zones between distinct ranges of scale. Location at scale breaks affords species great opportunity, but also potential crisis.

TI WOOD-INHABITING FUNGI AND SUBSTRATUM DECLINE IN SELECTIVELY LOGGED
   BOREAL SPRUCE FORESTS
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB Eleven Norway spruce Picea abies (L.) Karst. forests in the boreal zone of Sweden were studied to investigate the effects of selective cuttings on wood-inhabiting fungi from the families Polyporaceae, Hymenochaetaceae and Corticiaceae (Basidiomycota). The II sites constitute a gradient from extensively logged to semi-natural forests. Old selective leggings that occurred about 100 years ago have significantly decreased the availability of large and highly decayed logs. Based on fruit bodies, both the total species number as well as the number of threatened species decreased with increasing degree of cutting.
   Some of the occurring wood-inhabiting fungi are commonly accepted as indicator species of forests with old-growth conditions. These species showed pronounced preferences for well decayed and large logs. They were also more frequent in the less affected sites and became rarer with increasing degree of cutting; they therefore seem to be good indicators of forests less affected by logging.

TI Reproductive biology of Australian acacias: important mediator of
   invasiveness?
SO DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
AB Aim Reproductive traits are important mediators of establishment and spread of introduced species, both directly and through interactions with other life-history traits and extrinsic factors. We identify features of the reproductive biology of Australian acacias associated with invasiveness.
   Location Global.
   Methods We reviewed the pollination biology, seed biology and alternative modes of reproduction of Australian acacias using primary literature, online searches and unpublished data. We used comparative analyses incorporating an Acacia phylogeny to test for associations between invasiveness and eight reproductive traits in a group of introduced and invasive (23) and non-invasive (129) species. We also explore the distribution of groups of trait 'syndromes' between invasive and non-invasive species.
   Results Reproductive trait data were only available for 126 of 152 introduced species in our data set, representing 23/23 invasive and 103/129 non-invasive species. These data suggest that invasives reach reproductive maturity earlier (10/13 within 2 years vs. 7/26 for non-invasives) and are more commonly able to resprout (11/21 vs. 13/54), although only time to reproductive maturity was significant when phylogenetic relationships were controlled for. Our qualitative survey of the literature suggests that invasive species in general tend to have generalist pollination systems, prolific seed production, efficient seed dispersal and the accumulation of large and persistent seed banks that often have fire-, heat- or disturbance-triggered germination cues.
   Conclusions Invasive species respond quicker to disturbance than non-invasive taxa. Traits found to be significant in our study require more in-depth analysis involving data for a broader array of species given how little is known of the reproductive biology of so many taxa in this species-rich genus. Sets of reproductive traits characteristic of invasive species and a general ability to reproduce effectively in new locations are widespread in Australian acacias. Unless there is substantial evidence to the contrary, care should be taken with all introductions.

TI Use of vaccination against foot and mouth disease in zoo animals,
   endangered species and exceptionally valuable animals
SO REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES
AB A historical review of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in non-domestic species is given and the use of FMD vaccines to protect those species is described. Several non-domestic species are susceptible to FMD. Legislation in many countries, based on the definition of FMD-free status as determined by the Office International des Epizooties (OIE: World organisation for animal health), forms an important barrier against the use of vaccines. National authorities may even feel obliged to slaughter animals of threatened species protected by international agreements during an outbreak of FMD to preserve their FMD-free status. The importance of international breeding programmes for endangered species is forcing the international community to reconsider the role that vaccination against FMD should play in animal health prevention programmes of captive populations. Much research is still required in regard to vaccine types and diagnostic procedures. Species-specific differences in susceptibility to FMD make this a challenging research topic for zoological institutions.

TI Geospatial assessment of freshwater invasive species to inform turtle
   conservation and management
SO AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
AB Identifying the ecological factors that determine the spread of invasive species is key to adequately managing endangered species in freshwater ecosystems. Invasive species are a main threat to turtles, which are targets of major conservation efforts worldwide. In freshwater ecosystems of the south-western USA, invasive bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) and crayfish species (Faxonius virilis and Procambarus clarkii) represent a major risk to the desert mud turtle (Kinosternon sonoriense sonoriense), state-listed as a Species of Greatest Conservation Need in Arizona. As a species in the early stages of population decline, the desert mud turtle is a top candidate for the development of management plans to decrease extinction risk. An invasion risk assessment tool was built from available occurrence data for K. s. sonoriense and the invasive bullfrog and crayfish species in Arizona using 5,886 de-duplicated records from public databases and reports from the Arizona Game and Fish Department. The occurrence density of K. s. sonoriense was calculated state-wide to define populations in which the level of invasion by bullfrog and crayfish was assessed. The environmental factors associated with the abundance of invasive species in populations of K. s. sonoriense were then analysed. A higher prevalence of crayfish and bullfrog was detected in turtle populations located in perennial streams. Invasive abundance was significantly higher in turtle populations at higher elevation and closer to the main river trunk for both invasive taxa. Higher bullfrog abundance was detected near human settlements, whereas crayfish were more abundant further from human settlements. These results will inform which populations of K. s. sonoriense require intensive surveying and control of invasive species to maintain the health of native desert mud turtle populations. This study provides valuable information regarding the environmental conditions associated with the abundance of invasive species threatening turtle populations, helping to develop science-based management of freshwater ecosystems.

AB The number of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and the size of their former range within the western states (USA) have declined drastically over the previous 200 years. The downward trend has continued most sharply in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, accelerated by the closing of open-pit garbage dumps in the late 1960s. The closure resulted in an estimated 50% reduction in population size. The immediate response by bears to the dump closures was significant movement into campgrounds and developed areas where many bears were captured and destroyed. Over a period of 15 years, the surviving bears moved out from aggregation centers (open-pit dumps, termed ecocenters) to exploit more fully the natural food base. The major detectable difference in resource use between pre- and post-closure periods was an especially heavy use of forbs. There was no evidence that the post-closure bear population found nutritional resources comparable to the ecocenters. Bears changed feeding habits and altered their distribution and use of space throughout the ecosystem. Recovery of a single grizzly bear population unit such as the Yellowstone population should be considered the first step in a multi-step recovery program for long-term persistence in the contiguous 48 states. Delisting of the Yellowstone population, if it occurs at all, must await population recovery throughout the Northern Rockies.

AB The Mala was once one of the most abundant and widespread macropods of central Australia but has declined to the point where it is now one of the rarest and most limited in distribution; Efforts to recover and conserve the Mala have been considerable and predate the national Endangered Species Protection Act 1992 which provides a framework for preparing and implementing recovery plans for threatened species and communities, The initial recovery plan for the Mala was developed in 1992 and focused on research and management actions related to the central Australian form of Mala. Implementation of this plan commenced in 1992 with ANCA funding to support major actions related to management and translocation of mainland populations, The formation of a recovery team in 1993 was the initial stage in the more formal review of the program. This review examined both progress towards implementing the plan and any need to refine existing actions and define new ones. Several program highlights were identified including establishment of captive colonies, implementation of translocation programs, co-operative programs with Aboriginal landholders and an enhanced understanding of the ecology of the Mala. A revised plan was finalized during 1995 providing a more national focus to the recovery effort, the critically endangered status of the Mda ensures that this effort will be ongoing. The development, implementation and revision of the Mala Recovery Plan has provided a useful insight into the potential achievements and shortcomings of the recovery process for conservation of threatened species.

Water scarcity has contributed to high levels of heterogeneity, variability and unpredictability, which together have shaped the long coadaptative process of coupling humans and nature. Land degradation and desertification in drylands are some of the largest and most far-reaching global environmental and social change problems, and thus are a daunting challenge for science and society. In this study, we merged the Drylands Development Paradigm, Holling's adaptive cycle metaphor and resilience theory to assess the challenges and opportunities for livelihood development in the Amapola dryland social-ecological system (DSES), a small isolated village in the semi-arid region of Mexico. After 450 years of local social-ecological evolution, external drivers (neoliberal policies, change in land reform legislation) have become the most dominant force in livelihood development, at the cost of loss of natural and cultural capital and an increasingly dysfunctional landscape. Local DSESs have become increasingly coupled to dynamic larger-scale drivers. Hence, cross-scale connectedness feeds back on and transforms local self-sustaining subsistence farming conditions, causing loss of livelihood resilience and diversification in a globally changing world. Effective efforts to combat desertification and improve livelihood security in DSESs need to consider their cyclical rhythms. Hence, we advocate novel dryland stewardship strategies, which foster adaptive capacity, and continuous evaluation and social learning at all levels. Finally, we call for an effective, flexible and viable policy framework that enhances local biotic and cultural diversity of drylands to transform global drylands into a resilient biome in the context of global environmental and social change.

TI A review of operations research models in invasive species management:
   state of the art, challenges, and future directions
SO ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH
AB Invasive species are a major threat to the economy, the environment, health, and thus human well-being. The international community, including the United Nations' Global Invasive Species Program (GISP), National Invasive Species Council (NISC), and Center for Invasive Species Management (CISM), has called for a rapid control of invaders in order to minimize their adverse impacts. The effective management of invasive species is a highly complex problem requiring the development of decision tools that help managers prioritize actions most efficiently by considering corresponding bio-economic costs, impacts on ecosystems, and benefits of control. Operations research methods, such as mathematical programming models, are powerful tools for evaluating different management strategies and providing optimal decisions for allocating limited resources to control invaders. In this paper, we summarize the mathematical models applied to optimize invasive species prevention, surveillance, and control. We first define key concepts in invasive species management (ISM) in a framework that characterizes biological invasions, associated economic and environmental costs, and their management. We then present a spatio-temporal optimization model that illustrates various biological and economic aspects of an ISM problem. Next, we classify the relevant literature with respect to modeling methods: optimal control, stochastic dynamic programming, linear programming, mixed-integer programming, simulation models, and others. We further classify the ISM models with respect to the solution method used, their focus and objectives, and the specific application considered. We discuss limitations of the existing research and provide several directions for further research in optimizing ISM planning. Our review highlights the fact that operations research could play a key role in ISM and environmental decision-making, in particular closing the gap between the decision-support needs of managers and the decision-making tools currently available to management.

TI Bivalves in a bottleneck: taxonomy, phylogeography and conservation of
   freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionoida) in Australasia
SO HYDROBIOLOGIA
AB The conservation biology of Australasian freshwater mussels is hindered by lack of a taxonomic framework that employs molecular data as a complement to shell characters, larval forms and internal anatomy. The fauna includes more than 32 known species (30+ Hyriidae, 2 Unionidae), but has not been revised for 55 years, despite minor amendments. The hyriids are relics of Gondwana, represented in Australia and New Guinea by the ancestral Velesunioninae and in Australia and New Zealand by the Hyriinae (Tribe Hyridellini). Many taxonomic and phylogeographic issues await resolution, including the relationships between Australasian and South American species, and between Australian and New Zealand species, and the status of species in New Guinea (including uncertain reports of Unionidae) and the Solomon Islands. Once these are clarified, it will be easier to identify threatened species and evaluate the conservation status of the fauna. At present, only seven taxa are named in the IUCN Red List or under national/state legislation, and these are not representative. Threatening processes include altered flow regimes, catchment disturbances, salinisation, pollution and invasive species. While the need for a taxonomic revision is paramount, progress in conservation may depend also upon involving the wider community.

TI THE PROTECTION STATUS OF THREATENED SPECIES AND THEIR SPREADING AREAS IN
   THE CENTRAL REGION OF THE REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOSYSTEMS AND ECOLOGY SCIENCE-IJEES
AB The paper presents a synthesis of the research results carried out over several years in the natural protected areas from the central region of the Republic of Moldova. The object of this research is 41 protected areas located in the forest fund. The focus is on the endangered species of plants and animals as well as the protected areas in which they were identified. The assessment of the protected areas was carried out during the main phenological phases of the vegetal and animal world. The register of valuable species was created, and their status of protection was recorded. There were identified 25 endangered species of plants and 16 of animals in the investigated areas. New areas of distribution were found for some species besides those mentioned in the Red Book of Moldova. The level of protection of the species demonstrates the importance of these areas for the biodiversity conservation. In order to ensure the conservation of these species in the investigated protected areas, it is necessary to strengthen the protection measures in such a way that these species are protected in their natural habitats. For an efficient management of the species and their ecosystems, we recommend developing a list with threatened species of plants and animals for each protected area that should include scientific data about abundance, vulnerability and their coordinates.

TI Equity and sustainability in the Anthropocene: a social-ecological
   systems perspective on their intertwined futures
SO GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB Non-technical summary. It is no longer possible nor desirable to address the dual challenges of equity and sustainability separately. Instead, they require new thinking and approaches which recognize their interlinkages, as well as the multiple perspectives and dimensions involved. We illustrate how equity and sustainability are intertwined, and how a complex social-ecological systems lens brings together advances from across the social and natural sciences to show how (in)equity and (un)sustainability are produced by the interactions and dynamics of coupled social-ecological systems. This should help understand which possible pathways could lead to sustainable and fair futures.
   Technical summary. There is remarkably little work on the interlinkages between sustainability and equity. This paper proposes an interdisciplinary conceptual framework addressing these twin challenges in the context of the Anthropocene. It shows that both equity and sustainability need to be understood as multi-dimensional and from diverse perspectives, with acceptable standards in all defining a desirable and acceptable life support zone. It proposes a shift in focus from individual elements and interactions, to system level dynamics and behaviour, advancing a social-ecological systems perspective through which both equity and sustainability are understood as intertwined drivers and outcomes of coupled systems dynamics. Over time, such dynamics become part of pathways which may move outside, or potentially be steered within, a desirable zone of 'equitable sustainability'. Ten sets of 'interaction dynamics', involving different dimensions of equity and sustainability, are illustrated, along with a provisional categorization of their interrelationships and potential intervention points. The paper discusses their roles in transformational pathways towards equitable sustainability, highlighting the importance of cross-scale change shaped by politics and power. Further conceptual, empirical and transdisciplinary effort is now needed to enrich this framework and address a range of implied research and practice questions critical to shaping fair and sustainable futures.

TI Incentivising use of structured language in biological descriptions:
   Author-driven phenotype data and ontology production
SO BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL
AB Phenotypes are used for a multitude of purposes such as defining species, reconstructing phylogenies, diagnosing diseases or improving crop and animal productivity, but most of this phenotypic data is published in free-text narratives that are not computable. This means that the complex relationship between the genome, the environment and phenotypes is largely inaccessible to analysis and important questions related to the evolution of organisms, their diseases or their response to climate change cannot be fully addressed. It takes great effort to manually convert free-text narratives to a computable format before they can be used in large-scale analyses. We argue that this manual curation approach is not a sustainable solution to produce computable phenotypic data for three reasons: 1) it does not scale to all of biodiversity; 2) it does not stop the publication of free-text phenotypes that will continue to need manual curation in the future and, most importantly, 3) It does not solve the problem of inter-curator variation (curators interpret/convert a phenotype differently from each other). Our empirical studies have shown that inter-curator variation is as high as 40% even within a single project. With this level of variation, it is difficult to imagine that data integrated from multiple curation projects can be of high quality. The key causes of this variation have been identified as semantic vagueness in original phenotype descriptions and difficulties in using standardised vocabularies (ontologies). We argue that the authors describing phenotypes are the key to the solution. Given the right tools and appropriate attribution, the authors should be in charge of developing a project's semantics and ontology. This will speed up ontology development and improve the semantic clarity of phenotype descriptions from the moment of publication. A proof of concept project on this idea was funded by NSF ABI in July 2017. We seek readers input or critique of the proposed approaches to help achieve community-based computable phenotype data production in the near future. Results from this project will be accessible through https://biosemantics.github.io/author-driven-production.

AB The Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) has recently been developed as a global agreement with the overall aim of ensuring the maintenance of biological diversity throughout the world. One of the main thrusts of the CBD is to prevent the transfer, by human activity, of species of plants or animals from one part of the world to another. Species that are transported (or transportable) are referred to as 'invasive alien species' and can be any type of plant or animal species that could disrupt ecosystems, habitats or species. As such, the concept of invasive species overlaps with the longestablished 'quarantine pest'. Plant quarantine services in many countries are reacting to these developments by expanding the range of organisms for which they have responsibility beyond the pests of economically important crops. The consequences for nernatology could include the need for study of nematode pests of wild plants, the ecology of non plant-parasitic nematodes and the possible effects of biocontrol nematodes on natural ecosystems.

AB Distribution pattern of 1148 indigenous tree species in Guangdong province and their relations to the environment were investigated based on the 0.5 degrees x0.5 degrees latitude-longitude grid system. The results showed that indigenous tree species richness increased with increasing latitude. Richness peaked in the middle of the study area with longitudinal gradient. Four ecological areas for indigenous tree species distribution were delimited using cluster analysis and TWINSPAN (two-way indicator species analysis). Indicator Species Analysis showed a significant difference was found in indicator species distribution across latitude gradient and the 4 ecological areas. Northern mountain areas and southern coastal areas possessed most of the indicator species (IV >= 0.7), among which Celtis philippensis, Gironniera cuspidata and Symplocos chunii were strongly indicative of the environmental characteristics. The study of distribution patterns and classification of ecological areas, which reflects different geographical and climatic characteristics, will be of significant implications for introduction of indigenous tree species from natural ecological areas.

TI Alien plant species of Haenertsburg Village, Limpopo Province, South

SO BIOINVASIONS RECORDS
AB It is generally accepted that urbanisation is changing the composition of species, mostly in urban and surrounding areas, through intentional introduction. The South African National Status Report of 2017 on biological invasions has shown that there is a dearth of knowledge about the invasion status of many invasive alien species in many parts of the country, such as the critically threatened vegetation, Woodbush Granite Grassland (WGG) in Limpopo Province. Consequently, the present study investigated the status of alien plants species in WGG. A roadside survey was carried out in Haenertsburg Village and its vicinity. Roads were used as survey units, and the dumpsite was used as a high risk area. A total of 136 species were identified, belonging to 46 botanical families. This study report the occurrence of 72 species which are regulated by the South Africa's National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (NEMBA, Act 10 of 2004). The present study found results significantly different from existing databases (chi(2) = 16.33473, p = .0001). Included in our list are alien species that need urgent eradication: Coreopsis lanceolata L., Cytisus scoparius (L.) Link, Iris pseudacorus L.. Pueraria montana (Lour.) Merr, and Rubies species as NEMBA category la species. Illegal dumping of agricultural waste was found to be one of the contributing factors to IAS in the area. Our study shows that Woodbush Granite Grassland is facing a new threat from invasive species.

SO JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY
AB A survey of lakes and reservoirs during the spring and summer of 2012 found that five species of calanoid copepods are invasive in the continental United States: Arctodiaptomus dorsalis (Marsh, 1907), Skistodiaptomus pallidus (Herrick, 1879), Eurytemora affinis (Poppe, 1880), Pseudodiaptomus forbesi (Poppe & Richard, 1890), and Sinocalanus doerri (Brehm, 1909). Two species are listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species: Skistodiaptomus carolinensis (Yeatman, 1986) and S. sinuatus (Kincaid, 1953). Sample locations for the five invasive and two rare species are reported and compared to historical distributions. Results corroborate previous reports of range expansion for the five invasive species, indicating that these species have likely become well-established in regions into which they have recently expanded. New localities for the two rare taxa suggest a possible range expansion within the USA.

TI Invasive alien species records are exponentially rising across the Earth
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB Humans are facilitating the introduction and range expansion of invasive alien species (IAS), which have negatively impacted ecological and socio-economic systems worldwide. Understanding the global diffusion of IAS is important for developing environmental policies and management strategies. We estimate the rate of increase and the doubling times of the number of new records of 178 IAS using a global dataset with c. 3.4 million records obtained over c. 100 years. Here, we show that the number of records of IAS have exponentially increased with a mean double time of c. 14 years across the Earth. For the most analysed species, the number of records increased faster in the non-native than native continents, suggesting that such IAS might be exponentially expanding their range size. We also found that each continent has a taxonomic group with a particular increase in IAS records. Governments and scientists should pay attention to these taxonomic groups to implement appropriate control or management actions. Our study provides an indication that the current local, regional and continental efforts to control invasions may be not sufficient at the global scale. This is a concerning situation given the great number of areas available for invasion worldwide.

TI Do threatened species occur in species-rich vegetation?
SO PRESLIA
AB Conservation strategies often assume that the total number of species at a specific location can be used as a proxy for other biodiversity dimensions, such as, the presence of rare and threatened species. However, the validity of this assumption remains unclear, particularly at the plot scale. Here, we used similar to 17,000 vegetation plots sampled across the Czech Republic to examine the relationship between the occurrence of threatened plant species and species richness in temperate forest and grassland communities. For each individual species, the median, range, and skewness of species richness in the plots in which it occurred were used to define its distribution along the community species richness gradient. These parameters were then compared for threatened and non-threatened species. We also compared the observed values with those obtained under a null expectation to test whether threatened species occurred at random with respect to species richness. On average, threatened species occurred in species-richer plots than non-threatened species. In addition, threatened species assembled non-randomly with respect to species richness, as they occurred more often in species-richer forests but species-poorer grasslands than expected by chance. The occurrence pattern of threatened species in relation to species richness was driven by the species-pool sizes of individual habitats. Threatened species associated with low species richness were thus found in extreme habitats, such as bogs, salt marshes, peat forests, and alpine grasslands characterized by small species pools. In contrast, threatened species associated with high species richness were often found in subcontinental semi-dry grasslands and dry thermophilous forests with large species pools. Threatened species also occurred over shorter species richness gradients and were more symmetrically distributed along these gradients than non-threatened species. These patterns may reflect a high habitat specialization of threatened species or strict requirements for habitat quality. We therefore suggest that species richness is a poor indicator of conservation value when comparing habitats and geographic regions. Targeting specific habitats and using the presence or percentage of threatened or specialized species as indicators may provide better assessment of conservation value.

TI Exploring appropriate livelihood alternatives for sustainable rangeland
   management
SO RANGELAND JOURNAL
AB Rangeland degradation and vulnerability of livelihoods are two major challenges facing pastoralists, rangeland managers and policy-makers in arid and semi-arid areas. There is a need to make holistic informed decisions in order to protect rangelands and sustain livelihoods. Through a comprehensive literature review on rangeland management policies and livelihood strategies of 'rangeland users', it is shown how such policies have affected sustainable rangeland management, how strategies to sustain livelihoods have been incomplete and how there has been a lack of a multi-disciplinary approach in acknowledging them. Accordingly, a set of appropriate livelihood alternatives is introduced and, thenceforth, a framework for their evaluation is developed. Supportive strategies for enhancing resilience are discussed as a research and policy-making gap. In this study, the keys to achieve sustainable livelihoods are acknowledged as 'livelihoods' resilience', where livelihoods need to be supported by access to capital, means of coping with the contexts of vulnerability as well as by enhancing policies, institutions and processes. The paper proposes a set of 'livestock-based livelihoods' regarding 'traditional pastoralism' as well as 'their mitigation and adaptation'. Moreover, their transformation to 'commercial pastoralism', 'resource-based livelihoods', 'alternative livelihoods' and 'migration' strategies is recognised to be employed by rangeland users as useful alternatives in different regions and under future changing conditions including climate change. These strategies embrace thinking on resilience and are supported by strategies that address social and ecological consequences of climate change consisting of mitigation, adaptation and transformation. It is argued that sustainable livelihoods and sustainable rangeland management will be achieved if they are supported by policies that build and facilitate a set of appropriate livelihood alternatives and keep them in a sustainable state rather than being limited to supporting 'vulnerable livelihoods'. Finally, future directions for analysing and policy-making in selecting the best alternative to achieve sustainable livelihoods are indicated.

TI Improving policy efficiency and effectiveness to save more species: A
   case study of the megadiverse country Australia
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB Native flora and fauna species continue to decline in the megadiverse, wealthy, economically and politically stable nation of Australia despite current efforts in policy and management. Ongoing research is examining these declines, their causes and the adequacy of current policy, but strategies for improving the outcomes for threatened species have attracted less attention. We discuss several key aspects of Australia's national threatened species management approach that potentially hinder the efficiency and effectiveness of management: the threatened species listing process is lengthy and biased; recovery plan development is resource intensive, restricted to a subset of species and often not effective; funding for threatened species management is not allocated efficiently or transparently; and management is not designed to incorporate uncertainties and adapt to changing future threats. Based on these issues we recommend four changes to current process: rationalize listing and assessment processes; develop approaches to prioritize species-based and threat-based responses cost-effectively; estimate funds required to recover species and secure longer term funding; and accommodate uncertainties and new threats into the current planning framework. Cost-effective prioritization for species and threats identifies which actions are likely to achieve the greatest benefits to species per unit cost, thereby managing more species and threats with available funds. These improvements can be made without legislative reform, additional funding or socio-economic shifts. If implemented, we believe more Australian threatened species will benefit from current efforts. Many of the challenges facing Australia are analogous to issues in other countries including the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom and these recommendations could assist in improving threatened species management.

TI Predicting current and future distribution of Hovenia dulcis Thunb.
   (Rhamnaceae) worldwide
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB Biological invasions are increasingly recognized as one of the major threats to biodiversity. The Japanese raisin tree (Hovenia dulcis) is native to East Asia, however, in southeastern South America this species has become one of the most pervasive invaders. Hovenia dulcis has many biological characteristics that favor the process of invasion and few studies have indicated changes in the structure and composition of native plant communities where this species has become invader. Given the invasiveness shown in southeastern South America, our main goal was to identify the potentially suitable habitats for this invasive species at a global scale. In this sense, we modeled the potential distribution of H. dulcis along the terrestrial areas worldwide using an ensemble forecasting approach. Additionally, the percentage of overlapping biodiversity hotspot areas with the currently suitable areas for this species was calculated. Our results revealed that the current potential H. dulcis range is equivalent to 7.88% (12,719,365 km(2)) of the terrestrial area worldwide. For the future scenarios of climate change, the potential distribution area tends to have a small reduction. However, significant suitable areas were identified for H. dulcis range in the northern limits of the boreal distribution. Currently, around 17% of biodiversity hotspot areas overlap with the suitable areas for H. dulcis occurrence. In summary, given that the prevention is well-recognized as a more effective management action against invasive alien species, it is essential to implement policies to prevent H. dulcis introduction in suitable areas worldwide, as well as local population control, especially in biodiversity hotspots.

TI Challenging the status quo in invasive species assessment using
   mechanistic physiologically based demographic modeling
SO ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB The increased incidence of invasive species introductions is a hallmark of global change, but their associated environmental and economic impacts are vastly underestimated. Assessing and managing the impact of invasive species requires understanding their weather driven dynamics as a basis for predicting their potential geographic distribution and relative abundance. Current de-facto standards for invasive species assessment are correlative approaches lacking mechanistic underpinnings, and hence fail to capture the weather driven biology limiting their explanatory and predictive capacity to forewarn policy makers of species invasiveness (i.e., its potential geographic distribution and relative abundance under extant and/or climate change weather). The idiosyncratic time-place nature of biological invasions and the inability of correlative approaches to incorporate biological information call for development of a unifying prospective approach across species. Physiologically based demographic models (PBDMs) provide a holistic basis for assessment of invasive species addressing many limitations of correlative approaches while accommodating higher level of biological complexity using a similar number of parameters. We use the South American tomato pinworm Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) as a case study in the Palearctic and compare the predictions of our PBDM model to those of three analyses based on the correlative CLIMEX model. The PBDM outperformed CLIMEX with comparable CLIMEX predictions only after the pest had reached its potential geographic distribution (i.e., post hoc), using 6-10 vs. 13 parameters, respectively. We suggest creating dedicated laboratories to gather appropriate biological data and developing generalized software to build mechanistic models for assessing invasive species of any taxa.

AB From kudzu to zebra mussels, invasive species have wreaked environmental and economic havoc by modifying ecosystems, damaging crops, threatening native species, and serving as hosts to pests and viruses. Invasive species are a clearly a problem-but are they a land use problem? This study establishes a potential nexus between land use planning and biological invasions, or bioinvasions.

TI Impacts of invasive nonnative plant species on the rare forest herb
   Scutellaria montana
SO ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB Invasive plant species and overabundant herbivore populations have the potential to significantly impact rare plant species given their increased risk for local extirpation and extinction. We used interacting invasive species removal and grazer exclusion treatments replicated across two locations in an occurrence of rare Scutellaria montane (large-flowered skullcap) in Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA, to assess: 1) competition by invasive Ligustrum sinense (Chinese privet) and Lonicera japonica (Japanese honeysuckle) and 2) the role of invasive species in mediating Oedocoilus virginianus (white-tailed deer) grazing of S. montana. Contrary to our hypothesis that invasive species presence would suppress S. montane directly via competition, S. montane individuals experienced a seasonal increase in stem height when invasive species were intact but not when invasive species were removed. Marginally significant results indicated that invasive species may afford S. montana protection from grazers, and we suggest that invasive species also could protect S. montane from smaller herbivores and/or positively influence abiotic conditions. In contrast to growth responses, S. montane individuals protected from O. virginianus exhibited a decrease in flowering between seasons relative to unprotected plants, but invasive species did not affect this variable. Although it has been suggested that invasive plant species may negatively influence S. montane growth and fecundity, our findings do not support related concerns. As such, we suggest that invasive species eradication efforts in S. montana habitat could be more detrimental than positive due to associated disturbance. However, the low level of invasion of our study site may not be representative of potential interference in more heavily infested habitat. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI Europe's other debt crisis caused by the long legacy of future
   extinctions
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Rapid economic development in the past century has translated into severe pressures on species survival as a result of increasing land-use change, environmental pollution, and the spread of invasive alien species. However, though the impact of these pressures on biodiversity is substantial, it could be seriously underestimated if population declines of plants and animals lag behind contemporary environmental degradation. Here, we test for such a delay in impact by relating numbers of threatened species appearing on national red lists to historical and contemporary levels of socioeconomic pressures. Across 22 European countries, the proportions of vascular plants, bryophytes, mammals, reptiles, dragonflies, and grasshoppers facing medium-to-high extinction risks are more closely matched to indicators of socioeconomic pressures (i.e., human population density, per capita gross domestic product, and a measure of land use intensity) from the early or mid-, rather than the late, 20th century. We conclude that, irrespective of recent conservation actions, large-scale risks to biodiversity lag considerably behind contemporary levels of socioeconomic pressures. The negative impact of human activities on current biodiversity will not become fully realized until several decades into the future. Mitigating extinction risks might be an even greater challenge if temporal delays mean many threatened species might already be destined toward extinction.

SO JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
AB Impacts of invasive species, and of attempts to control them, on the aquatic invertebrate fauna of Hawaii and French Polynesia are reviewed and discussed, as a foundation for determining conservation need. Aquatic insects are poorly documented in the region, with many species undescribed, so that practical conservation must be pursued with highly incomplete basic taxonomic knowledge. The establishment of at least one dedicated reserve for aquatic invertebrates is recommended for each high island in an archipelago, as an aid to safeguarding local endemic species, and other recommendations include increased monitoring for new alien species (particularly of fish), planning for removal of alien species from selected water bodies where alien species are less likely to recolonize, effective protection of key sites with high biodiversity value, and securing sites for future restoration and translocation or rare and endangered species.

SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB Globally, freshwater species are under threat from human mediated stressors. Therefore, there is an urgent need for methods to estimate population and species occurrences for conservation purposes. Here, we used a predictive species distribution model to determine the occurrence of three endangered species (Amietia inyangae, Chlorolestes elegans and Strongylopus rhodesianus) in Southern Africa (Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe). The study revealed that the probability of occurrences for the three species increase with an increase in elevation and annual precipitation and decrease with an increase in annual mean temperature. Our results indicated that the highest probability of occurrences for A. inyange, C. elegans and S. rhodesianus is in the Nyanga, Stapleford and Chimanimani highland areas, with some probabilities of occurrence falling outside protected areas. Our findings suggest that the areas covered by protected areas may need to be revaluated. Our findings will be useful for managing threatened species.

TI Opportunities for silviculture in management and restoration of forests
   affected by invasive species
SO BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB Despite increasing interest in managing invasive species in forests, few long-term experimental studies have been conducted that reveal the value of silvicultural practices in invasive species management. There is a growing interest in including forest management practices to control or manage invasives. Rather than adhere to traditional silvicultural practices, invasive species management approaches should be tailored to the specific circumstances, e.g. invasion intensity, long-term management goals, and role of the invasive, e.g., defoliator, direct mortality agent, host stressor. Pre-emptive silvicultural approaches correspond well with ecological principles of maintaining host vigor, both in plantations and natural forests. As invasive species dominate some ecosystems and influence ecosystem processes, the use of silviculture as a restoration tool gains importance. Restoration following invasive species damage may involve shifts in species composition (non-hosts) to maintain or create resilient forest communities. Evidence of successful use of silviculture to minimize damage from invasive species remains limited, and although dwarfed by other control efforts, such as biological control, silvicultural practices should be integrated into comprehensive management of invasive species. This paper explores a few of the limited case studies of silviculture use for managing invasive pathogens and insects, including Sirex noctilio, Lymantria dispar and Agrilus planipennis.

TI A simple metric for a complex outcome: proposing a sustainment index for
   health indicators
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB Background: Sustainability is, at least in principle, an important criterion for evaluating global health and development programs. The absence of shared metrics for success or achievements in sustainability is however critically lacking. We propose a simple metric, free of causal inference, which can be used to test different empirical models for the sustainment of health outcomes.
   Methods: We follow the suggestion of Chambers and use "sustainment" to refer to the verifiable and measured extent to which a health indicator has evolved over time. The sustainment index of a health indicator (Y) advanced by a program is based on a simple-to-calculate approximation of the derivative of Y over time (T0: baseline, T1: endline, and T2: post-project), based on the ratio of the slope of YT1-T2 over YT0-T1. SI(Y) = 1+ (YT1-T2 / YT0-T1).
   Results: This construct provides three clear benchmarks: SI = 0, when the health indicator returns to baseline value post-project (Y-T2 = Y-T0); SI = 1, when the endline-post-project trend is a plateau; and SI = 2, when the progress slope during program is uninterrupted post-program. We find strong correlation (r(2) = 0.922) between the SI and independent practitioners' rating of indicator trends. The SI shows different levels of achieved sustainment for a range of indicators in a published ex-post sustainability study. And we find that the SI can be computed for large national datasets for two types of indicators.
   Conclusions: The Sustainment Index has limitations and conditions of applicability, but it can be applied to different datasets and studies to provide a reliable dependent measure of the level of sustainment of health outcomes from one period of time to the next. The Index will need additional testing, and future evaluation research work will need to consider index performance under different situations. The Sustainment Index has the potential to provide a standard metric to build evidence through more systematic research on sustainment and sustainability.

AB Saussurea involuerata (S. involuerata), a kind of composite and perennial herbage plant, is a rare and precious alpine medicinal plants with high medicinal value, it can regulate human's body and has health care function, therefore attracts attention of many scholars. It is currently on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list of threatened species. In this study, we first assembled the complete chloroplast (cp) genome of S. involucrata by Illumina paired-end reads data. The whole genome was 152,490 bp, consisting of a pair of inverted repeats of 69,041 bp, large and small single-copy regions of 69,045bp and 18,638 bp in length, respectively. The cp genome contained 134 genes, including 90 protein-coding genes, 36 tRNA genes, and 8 rRNA genes. The overall GC content of the whole genome was 37.7%. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a close relationship between S. involuerata and Arctium lappa.

In this report we communicate two northernmost extralimital acoustic records of the species in the state of Veracruz, obtained in 2018 and 2022. The average constant frequency of echolocation calls of P. gymnonotus was 56.5 kHz in Boca Andrea and 53.88 kHz in Buena Vista. Acoustic detection surveys of the conspicuous echolocation calls of the species would help much in the detection of the species in roosts and foraging habitats.

TI Socio-ecological dynamics and challenges to the governance of Neglected
   Tropical Disease control
SO INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
AB The current global attempts to control the so-called "Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs)" have the potential to significantly reduce the morbidity suffered by some of the world's poorest communities. However, the governance of these control programmes is driven by a managerial rationality that assumes predictability of proposed interventions, and which thus primarily seeks to improve the cost-effectiveness of implementation by measuring performance in terms of pre-determined outputs. Here, we argue that this approach has reinforced the narrow normal-science model for controlling parasitic diseases, and in doing so fails to address the complex dynamics, uncertainty and socio-ecological context-specificity that invariably underlie parasite transmission. We suggest that a new governance approach is required that draws on a combination of non-equilibrium thinking about the operation of complex, adaptive, systems from the natural sciences and constructivist social science perspectives that view the accumulation of scientific knowledge as contingent on historical interests and norms, if more effective control approaches sufficiently sensitive to local disease contexts are to be devised, applied and managed. At the core of this approach is an emphasis on the need for a process that assists with the inclusion of diverse perspectives, social learning and deliberation, and a reflexive approach to addressing system complexity and incertitude, while balancing this flexibility with stability-focused structures. We derive and discuss a possible governance framework and outline an organizational structure that could be used to effectively deal with the complexity of accomplishing global NTD control. We also point to examples of complexity-based management structures that have been used in parasite control previously, which could serve as practical templates for developing similar governance structures to better manage global NTD control. Our results hold important wider implications for global health policy aiming to effectively control and eradicate parasitic diseases across the world.

TI Portrayals of Endangered Species in Advertising: Exercising
   Intertextuality to Question the Anthropocentric Lens
SO ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNICATION-A JOURNAL OF NATURE AND CULTURE
AB This paper examines recent advertisements used by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to raise awareness about the predicament of endangered, vulnerable, and threatened species. By engaging in a critical discourse analysis of a selection of advertisements, this study demonstrates how the WWF uses intertextuality as a discourse strategy to articulate its message and objectives. In this paper, I argue that by engaging in the juxtaposition of various paratexts ("layers of meaning"), the WWF produces a narrative which reveals an anthropocentric lens through which we view the world. The advertisements are found to resort to paratexts of anthropomorphism with the intent of extending the bounds of personhood to non-human animal species. In closing, I maintain that intertextuality is employed not only to question the dominant human-centric paradigm, but serve the heuristic function of encouraging a more empathetic identification with the animals in question and the creation of a more holistic worldview.

TI Distribution of invasive plants in urban environment is strongly
   spatially structured
SO LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB Urban environments create a wide range of habitats that harbour a great diversity of plant species, many of which are of alien origin. For future urban planning and management of the green areas within the city, understanding of the spatial distribution of invasive alien species is of great importance.
   Our main aim was to assess how availability of different ecosystem types within a city area, as well as several parameters describing urban structure interact in determining the cover and identity of invasive alien species.
   We studied the distribution of chosen invasive plant species in a mid-sized city in the Czech Republic, central Europe, on a gradient of equal sized cells from the city centre to its outskirts.
   A great amount of variation was explained by spatial predictors but not shared with any measured variables. The species cover of invasive species decreased with increasing proportion of urban greenery and distance from the city centre, but increased with habitat richness; road margins, ruderal sites, and railway sites were richest in invasive species. In contrast, the total number of invasive species in cells significantly decreased with increasing distance from the city centre, but increased with habitat richness.
   Our results suggest that different invasive species prefer habitats in the vicinity of the city centre and at its periphery and the spatial structure and habitat quality of the urban landscape needs to be taken into account, in efforts to manage alien plant species invasions in urban environments.

TI Exploring everyday work as a dynamic non-event and adaptations to manage
   safety in intraoperative anaesthesia care: an interview study
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB BackgroundSafety has been described as a dynamic non-event and as constantly present in professionals' work processes. Investigating management of complex everyday situations may create an opportunity to elucidate safety management. Anaesthesia has been at the frontline of enhancing patient safety - testing and implementing knowledge from other high-reliability industries, such as aviation, in the complex, adaptive system of an operating room. The aim of this study was to explore factors supporting anaesthesia nurses and anaesthesiologists in managing complex everyday situations during intraoperative anaesthesia care processes.MethodsIndividual interviews with anaesthesia nurses (n = 9) and anaesthesiologists (n = 6) using cognitive task analysis (CTA) on case scenarios from previous prospective, structured observations. The interviews were analysed using the framework method.ResultsDuring intraoperative anaesthesia care, management of everyday complex situations is sustained through preparedness, support for mindful practices, and monitoring and noticing complex situations and managing them. The prerequisites are created at the organization level. Managers should ensure adequate resources in the form of trained personnel, equipment and time, team and personnel sustainability and early planning of work. Management of complex situations benefits from high-quality teamwork and non-technical skills (NTS), such as communication, leadership and shared situational awareness.ConclusionAdequate resources, stability in team compositions and safe boundaries for practice with shared baselines for reoccurring tasks where all viewed as important prerequisites for managing complex everyday work. When and how NTS are used in a specific clinical context depends on having the right organizational prerequisites and a deep expertise of the relevant clinical processes. Methods like CTA can reveal the tacit competence of experienced staff, guide contextualized training in specific contexts and inform the design of safe perioperative work practices, ensuring adequate capacity for adaptation.

TI CRITICAL HABITAT DESIGNATIONS UNDER THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT IN AN ERA
   OF CLIMATE CRISIS
SO COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW
AB Over the coming decades, experts estimate that twenty-five percent of all plant and animal species may go extinct. Climate change directly contributes to species extinction through ecosystem shift, and accelerates other drivers of extinction such as destruction of habitat and pollution. The Endangered Species Act is the only legal tool in the United States to directly protect against the threat of species extinction, and critical habitat designations under the Endangered Species Act provide a way for the government to protect a species' habitat and preserve biodiversity. Unfortunately, the Trump Administration's recently promulgated regulations hinder, rather than bolster, federal agencies' efforts to save endangered species. By severely restricting the designation of critical habitat, the government has suppressed its own ability to respond to the effects of climate change on endangered and threatened species. This Note proposes a definition of the term "habitat" in the Endangered Species Act that comports with current scientific understandings of the term and would allow federal agencies to account for climate change when designating critical habitat. The definition reflects the dynamic and temporally variable nature of species' habitats, allowing for the designation of currently unoccupied areas that will support species' existence in the future. This definition would clarify the government's role in protecting species' habitats while also complying with the text and purpose of the Endangered Species Act.

TI Fenced sanctuaries deliver conservation benefits for most common and
   threatened native island birds in New Zealand
SO ECOSPHERE
AB Island species are disproportionately threatened with extinction, and invasive species are the primary driver of biodiversity loss. Globally, eradicating invasive mammals from small oceanic islands has led to the recovery of threatened populations, but eradicating mammals from large islands and continents is more challenging. In New Zealand, conservation organizations have established a large network of fenced sanctuaries that use predator-proof fencing to exclude invasive mammals and conserve native flora and fauna. Yet, critics question if sanctuaries meet these targets, given a lack of evidence on outcomes. We surveyed birds in three sanctuaries and three paired sites on New Zealand's North Island to investigate whether sanctuaries increase bird population densities relative to sites with minimal mammal control. Densities of nine endemic bird species were higher in sanctuaries compared to unprotected sites (0.27-9.00 more birds/ha), but we found no significant difference in mean population densities for introduced and biogeographically recent native species. These findings provide compelling evidence that fenced sanctuaries effectively conserve native island bird populations, and affirm predictions that native species are more likely to benefit from invasive mammal eradications than introduced species. New Zealand's novel approach to recovering rare species holds great promise for conserving biota at risk from invasion in other global hotspots of endemism.

TI Multi-taxon inventory and landscape characterization in an agrosystem of
   the Brazilian Midwest targeted for payment for environmental services
SO BIOTA NEOTROPICA
AB The replacement of natural landscapes by anthropic environments has led to habitat loss and consequently, to the decline and extinction of many species populations. Several strategies, such as the creation of protected areas (PAs) and payment for ecosystem services have been adopted to mitigate the consequences of this biodiversity crisis. In Rio Verde, Goias, Brazil, a Water Producer Program (WPP) was established, which provides payment for ecosystem services for the maintenance of riparian vegetation in the region of the Ribeirao Abobora, a river which supplies the city and metropolitan area. In the absence of environmental diagnostic studies in the region, this present study contributes to reducing some knowledge gaps, through the: (i) characterization of the landscape in the WPP area, (ii) characterization of species of fauna (amphibians, birds, fish, and medium and large terrestrial mammals) and woody flora that occur in this area, and (iii) comparison of species diversity (fauna and flora) found in our study area with the diversity observed in the Cerrado protected area network. Our results reveal a low native vegetation cover (similar to 21% of total area), but we recorded 300 total species: 20 species of anuran amphibians, 100 birds, 10 fish, 16 terrestrial mammals (medium and large), and 154 woody plants. Our sample comprises species considered endemic to the Cerrado (e.g.,Anuran -Batycholos terntezi and Mammal - Callithrix penicillata), threatened species (e g , Mammals - Herpailurus yagouctroundi, Mynnecophaga tridactyla and Tapirus terrestris), and exotic invasive species (Mammal - Sus scrofa). The results presented in this study are relevant and may help in the proposal of management actions within the scope of this important program of payment for environmental services.

TI Implementing invasive species control: a case study of
   multi-jurisdictional coordination at Lake Tahoe, USA
SO MANAGEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB Biological invasions are increasing in frequency and the need to mitigate or control their effects is a major challenge to natural resource managers. Failure to control invasive species has been attributed to inadequate policies, resources or scientific knowledge. Often, natural resource managers with limited funds are tasked with the development of an invasive species control program without access to key decision-support information such as whether or not an invasive species will cause damage, and what the extent of that damage may be. Once damages are realized, knowing where to allocate resources and target control efforts is not straightforward. Here we present the history of invasive species policy development and management in a large, multi-jurisdictional and multi-use aquatic ecosystem. We present a science-based decision-support tool for on-the-ground aquatic invasive species (AIS) control to support the development of a sustainable control program. Lastly, we provide a set of recommendations for managers desiring to make an AIS control implementation plan based upon our development of novel invasive species research, policy and management in Lake Tahoe (USA). We find that a sustainable invasive species control program is possible when science, coordination and outreach are integrated.

TI Threatened vascular plant species in spontaneously revegetated
   post-mining sites
SO RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB The occurrence of threatened vascular plant species has been occasionally reported from some disturbed sites. Nevertheless, almost nothing is known about the conservation potential of post-mining habitats for vascular plant species at a landscape scale. We asked how much threatened species occur in the artificial habitats, and if the participation of particular threatened species categories differ over the course of succession. We studied 10 successional series running in 321 post-mining sites across the Czech Republic, Central Europe. In total, 2,597 vegetation samples comprising 935 vascular plant species were analyzed. We found 235 threatened species (14% of the country's threatened flora). The majority of the threatened plants, namely 223, avoided plots overgrown by woody species, in which only 48 species occurred. The importance of spontaneously revegetated habitats for nature conservation differed among successional stages formed by discontinuous vegetation cover (not fully developed and still open, up to approximately 25 years since site abandonment), which harbored especially critically endangered species of open habitats, and continuous vegetation cover (fully developed and closed, over approximately 25 years), which was suitable for specialized threatened species typical of fully established vegetation. A mosaic of various successional stages comprising both categories of vegetation cover should be applied as an effective restoration solution to maintain a variety of habitats for threatened species.

TI Resilience Thinking as an Interdisciplinary Guiding Principle for Energy
   System Transitions
SO RESOURCES-BASEL
AB Resource usage and environmental consequences of most current energy systems exceed planetary boundaries. The transition to sustainable energy systems is accompanied by a multitude of research methods, as energy systems are complex structures of technical, economical, social and ecological interactions. The description of different discipline's perspectives in this paper show that a more mutual understanding between disciplines of their respective focus is necessary as they partly create internally competitive views arising from differing emphasis of connected matters. The purpose of this paper is to present a framework for interdisciplinary proceeding in a complex energy system transition process. Resilience thinking is chosen as a core concept for a more holistic view on sustainable energy system development. It is shown that it is already widely used in different disciplines connected to energy system research and is especially suitable due to its wide application across disciplines. The seven principles of resilience thinking (maintain redundancy and diversity, manage connectivity, manage slow variables and feedback, foster complex adaptive systems thinking, encourage learning, broaden participation, and promote polycentric governance systems) are chosen as the basis for a procedure that can be utilized to increase the interdisciplinary perspectives of energy system transitions. For energy transition processes based on scenario development, backcasting and pathway definition, resilience thinking principles are used to assess the resilience of the target energy system, the pathway resilience and the design of the scenario process with respect to the probability of a resilient outcome. The described procedure consisting of questions and parameters can be applied as a first attempt for a resilience assessment of energy transition processes. The perspective of resilience in sustainable energy systems strengthens the importance of diversity, redundancy and flexibility, which reduces the current dominant focus on efficiency of the overall system.

TI A conservation paradox: endangered and iconic flightless kagu

AB The kagu (Rhynochetos jubatus) is an iconic endemic flightless bird from New Caledonia, red-listed as endangered according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria. Feral cats are among the most successful and damaging invaders for island biodiversity. They have been directly responsible for the extinction of numerous birds worldwide, especially small- and medium-sized flightless species. Our study evaluates the feral cat threat to the kagu by analysing 772 cat scats from the two main sites housing major remaining populations (eight quarterly sampling sessions conducted per site over 2 years). Surprisingly, we detected no predation evidence against this endangered species (including chicks) although it falls within the cats' prey size range and exhibits life-history traits typical of island endangered naive birds. We recommend a multi-species approach to invasive mammal management to mitigate direct and indirect pressures against remaining kagu populations.

TI Interior fences can reduce cost and uncertainty when eradicating
   invasive species from large islands
SO METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB 1. The conservation of many threatened species can be advanced by the eradication of alien invasive animals from islands. However, island eradications are an expensive, difficult and uncertain undertaking. An increasingly common eradication strategy is the construction of interior fences' to partition islands into smaller, independent eradication regions that can be treated sequentially or concurrently. Proponents argue that, while interior fences incur substantial up front construction costs, they reduce overall eradication costs. However, this hypothesis lacks an explicit theoretical or empirical justification.
   2. We formulate a general theory that relates the number of interior fences to the magnitude and variation of the economic cost of island eradication. We use this theory to explore the conditions under which interior fences represent a defensible management strategy, under cost and risk minimisation objectives. We then specifically consider the forthcoming eradication of cats Felis catus from Dirk Hartog Island, Western Australia, by parameterising our general theory using published data on the cost and success of previous projects.
   3. Our results predict that under a wide range of reasonable conditions, interior fences can reduce the expected cost of a successful invasive alien animal eradication from large islands. On Dirk Hartog Island, interior fences will marginally reduce eradication costs, with two fences reducing expected costs by 3%. Interior fences have a much more substantial effect on the variability of eradication costs: two fences reduce the width of the 95% confidence bounds by more than one-third and halve the size of the average project cost overrun/underrun.
   4. Our results reveal that the construction of interior fences is a defensible management strategy for eradicating alien invasive species from islands. However, the primary benefit of interior fences will be risk management, rather than a reduction in expected project costs.

SO NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
AB Uses of long-term ecological proxies in strategies for mitigating future biodiversity loss are too limited in scope. Recent advances in geochronological dating, palaeoclimate reconstructions and molecular techniques for inferring population dynamics offer exciting new prospects for using retrospective knowledge to better forecast and manage ecological outcomes in the face of global change. Opportunities include using fossils, genes and computational models to identify ecological traits that caused species to be differentially prone to regional and range-wide extinction, test if threatened-species assessment approaches work and locate habitats that support stable ecosystems in the face of shifting climates. These long-term retrospective analyses will improve efforts to predict the likely effects of future climate and other environmental change on biodiversity, and target conservation management resources most effectively.

TI The invasive silver-cheeked toadfish, Lagocephalus sceleratus (Gmelin,
   1789) appeared in the Sea of Marmara after more than a decade: A call
   for awareness
SO SU URUNLERI DERGISI
AB This study presents a new locality record of poisonous pufferfish, Lagocephalus sceleratus (Gmelin, 1789), one of the 18 worst invader fish species identified globally by IUCN, from the Sea of Marmara caught by a commercial purse seine fishing vessel while fishing anchovy on 22 February 2021. Previously, this invasive species was first recorded at the Gelibolu peninsula in the Sea of Marmara between September 2007 and October 2008. Lagocephalus sceleratus recorded in this study is larger in size with 142 mm total length than previous records (126 mm in 2007; 95 mm in 2008) for the Sea of Marmara. The presently reported record represents the first documented occurrence of this species in the Erdek Bay of the Sea of Marmara and the third documented record for the entire Sea of Marmara.

TI Habitat Conservation Plans provide limited insight into the cost of
   complying with the Endangered Species Act
SO CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
AB The Endangered Species Act (ESA) mandates protection for listed species, prohibiting intentionally adverse "take" by both public and private activities. The requirements can be perceived as a costly regulatory burden, although minimal understanding of the costs of compliance actions may exacerbate the perceived burden. This has potential consequences for ESA effectiveness and species recovery. We developed a framework to identify when compliance costs could be incurred in a project and then analyzed projected cost data from published Habitat Conservation Plans (HCPs) using this framework. We found that across HCPs, the projected costs reported were incomplete and difficult to interpret with inconsistent reporting across documents. Within the 43 HCPs that had utilizable cost data, the majority of projected costs (77%-97%) were incurred by implementation of ESA compliance activities. Of these, 46% of expected implementation costs were for monitoring efforts for project-scale HCPs, while 81% of implementation costs for large-scale projects were for compensatory mitigation actions. Our results provide a first attempt at analyzing the cost of ESA compliance actions using HCPs. However, we found that costs reported in HCPs tended to be opaque and incomplete, underscoring the need for standardization of cost reporting to better support understanding of ESA compliance costs.

TI Assessing Pesticide Risks to Threatened and Endangered Species Using
   Population Models: Findings and Recommendations from a CropLife America
   Science Forum
SO INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
AB This brief communication reports on the main findings and recommendations from the 2014 Science Forum organized by CropLife America. The aim of the Forum was to gain a better understanding of the current status of population models and how they could be used in ecological risk assessments for threatened and endangered species potentially exposed to pesticides in the United States. The Forum panelists' recommendations are intended to assist the relevant government agencies with implementation of population modeling in future endangered species risk assessments for pesticides. The Forum included keynote presentations that provided an overview of current practices, highlighted the findings of a recent National Academy of Sciences report and its implications, reviewed the main categories of existing population models and the types of risk expressions that can be produced as model outputs, and provided examples of how population models are currently being used in different legislative contexts. The panel concluded that models developed for listed species assessments should provide quantitative risk estimates, incorporate realistic variability in environmental and demographic factors, integrate complex patterns of exposure and effects, and use baseline conditions that include present factors that have caused the species to be listed (e.g., habitat loss, invasive species) or have resulted in positive management action. Furthermore, the panel advocates for the formation of a multipartite advisory committee to provide best available knowledge and guidance related to model implementation and use, to address such needs as more systematic collection, digitization, and dissemination of data for listed species; consideration of the newest developments in good modeling practice; comprehensive review of existing population models and their applicability for listed species assessments; and development of case studies using a few well-tested models for particular species to demonstrate proof of concept. To advance our common goals, the panel recommends the following as important areas for further research and development: quantitative analysis of the causes of species listings to guide model development; systematic assessment of the relative role of toxicity versus other factors in driving pesticide risk; additional study of how interactions between density dependence and pesticides influence risk; and development of pragmatic approaches to assessing indirect effects of pesticides on listed species.

TI Variables affecting hospital length of stay: a scoping review
SO JOURNAL OF HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose - Tertiary hospitals have registered an incremental rise in expenditure mostly because of the increasing demands by ageing populations. Reducing the length of stay (LOS) of patients within tertiary hospitals is one of the strategies, which has been used in the last decades to ensure health care systems' sustainability. Furthermore, LOS is one of the key performance indicators, which is widely used to assess hospital efficiency. Hence, it is crucial that policy makers use evidence-based practices in health care to aim for optimal LOS. The purpose of this paper is to identify and summarize empirical research that brings together studies on the various variables that directly or indirectly impact on LOS within tertiary hospitals so as to develop a LOS causal systems model.
   Design/methodology/approach - This scoping review was guided by the following research question: "What is affecting the LOS of patients within tertiary-level health care?" and by the guidelines specified by Arksey and O'Malley (2005), and by Armstrong et al. (2011). Relevant current literature was retrieved by searching various electronic databases. The PRISMA model provided the process guidelines to identify and select eligible studies.
   Findings - An extensive literature search yielded a total of 30,350 references of which 46 were included in the final analysis. These articles yielded variables, which directly/indirectly are linked to LOS. These were then organized according to the Donabedian model - structure, processes and outcomes. The resultant LOS causal model reflects its complexity and confirms the consideration by scholars in the field that hospitals are complex adaptive systems, and that hospital managers must respond to LOS challenges holistically.
   Originality/value - This paper illustrates a complex LOS causal model that emerged from the scoping review and may be of value for future research. It also highlighted the complexity of the construct under study.

TI A practical tool for assessing ecosystem services enhancement and
   degradation associated with invasive alien species
SO ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB Current approaches for assessing the effects of invasive alien species (IAS) are biased toward the negative effects of these species, resulting in an incomplete picture of their real effects. This can result in an inefficient IAS management. We address this issue by describing the INvasive Species Effects Assessment Tool (INSEAT) that enables expert elicitation for rapidly assessing the ecological consequences of IAS using the ecosystem services (ES) framework. INSEAT scores the ecosystem service "gains and losses" using a scale that accounted for the magnitude and the reversibility of its effects. We tested INSEAT on 18 IAS in Great Britain. Here, we highlighted four case studies: Harmonia axyridis (Harlequin ladybird), Astacus leptodactylus (Turkish crayfish), Pacifastacus leniusculus (Signal crayfish) and Impatiens glandulifera (Himalayan balsam). The results demonstrated that a collation of different experts' opinions using INSEAT could yield valuable information on the invasive aliens' ecological and social effects. The users can identify certain IAS as ES providers and the trade-offs between the ES provision and loss associated with them. This practical tool can be useful for evidence-based policy and management decisions that consider the potential role of invasive species in delivering human well-being.

TI Analysis of the Trojan Y-Chromosome eradication strategy for an invasive
   species
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY
AB The Trojan Y-Chromosome (TYC) strategy, an autocidal genetic biocontrol method, has been proposed to eliminate invasive alien species. In this work, we analyze the dynamical system model of the TYC strategy, with the aim of studying the viability of the TYC eradication and control strategy of an invasive species. In particular, because the constant introduction of sex-reversed trojan females for all time is not possible in practice, there arises the question: What happens if this injection is stopped after some time? Can the invasive species recover? To answer that question, we perform a rigorous bifurcation analysis and study the basin of attraction of the recovery state and the extinction state in both the full model and a certain reduced model. In particular, we find a theoretical condition for the eradication strategy to work. Additionally, the consideration of an Allee effect and the possibility of a Turing instability are also studied in this work. Our results show that: (1) with the inclusion of an Allee effect, the number of the invasive females is not required to be very low when the introduction of the sex-reversed trojan females is stopped, and the remaining Trojan Y-Chromosome population is sufficient to induce extinction of the invasive females; (2) incorporating diffusive spatial spread does not produce a Turing instability, which would have suggested that the TYC eradication strategy might be only partially effective, leaving a patchy distribution of the invasive species.

TI An Embodied Predictive Processing Theory of Pain Experience
SO REVIEW OF PHILOSOPHY AND PSYCHOLOGY
AB This paper aims to provide a theoretical framework for explaining the subjective character of pain experience in terms of what we will call 'embodied predictive processing'. The predictive processing (PP) theory is a family of views that take perception, action, emotion and cognition to all work together in the service of prediction error minimisation. In this paper we propose an embodied perspective on the PP theory we call the 'embodied predictive processing (EPP) theory. The EPP theory proposes to explain pain in terms of processes distributed across the whole body. The prediction error minimising system that generates pain experience comprises the immune system, the endocrine system, and the autonomic system in continuous causal interaction with pathways spread across the whole neural axis. We will argue that these systems function in a coordinated and coherent manner as a single complex adaptive system to maintain homeostasis. This system, which we refer to as the neural-endocrine-immune (NEI) system, maintains homeostasis through the process of prediction error minimisation. We go on to propose a view of the NEI ensemble as a multiscale nesting of Markov blankets that integrates the smallest scale of the cell to the largest scale of the embodied person in pain. We set out to show how the EPP theory can make sense of how pain experience could be neurobiologically constituted. We take it to be a constraint on the adequacy of a scientific explanation of subjectivity of pain experience that it makes it intelligible how pain can simultaneously be a local sensing of the body, and, at the same time, a more global, all-encompassing attitude towards the environment. Our aim in what follows is to show how the EPP theory can meet this constraint.

TI Assessing threats of non-native species to native freshwater
   biodiversity: Conservation priorities for the United States
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB Non-native species pose one of the greatest threats to native biodiversity, and can have severe negative impacts in freshwater ecosystems. Identifying regions of spatial overlap between high freshwater biodiversity and high invasion pressure may thus better inform the prioritization of freshwater conservation efforts. We employ geospatial analysis of species distribution data to investigate the potential threat of non-native species to aquatic animal taxa across the continental United States. We mapped non-native aquatic plant and animal species richness and cumulative invasion pressure to estimate overall negative impact associated with species introductions. These distributions were compared to distributions of native aquatic animal taxa derived from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) database. To identify hotspots of native biodiversity we mapped total species richness, number of threatened and endangered species, and a community index of species rarity calculated at the watershed scale. An overall priority index allowed identification of watersheds experiencing high pressure from non-native species and also exhibiting high native biodiversity conservation value. While priority regions are roughly consistent with previously reported prioritization maps for the US, we also recognize novel priority areas characterized by moderate-to-high native diversity but extremely high invasion pressure. We further compared priority areas with existing conservation protections as well as projected future threats associated with land use change. Our findings suggest that many regions of elevated freshwater biodiversity value are compromised by high invasion pressure, and are poorly safeguarded by existing conservation mechanisms and are likely to experience significant additional stresses in the future.

Mitochondrial sequence data was analyzed from 541 individuals of a critically endangered fish, Acheilognathus typus from present-day range-wide localities to re-evaluate an in-progress restoration program around Lake Izunuma-Uchinuma, Miyagi, Japan. Acheilognathus typus showed low sequence diversity with only eight haplotypes and pi and h values of 0.59129 and 0.00118 respectively. Genetic data suggests A. typus is adapted to pulsed environments and prone to population flush and crash. Genotyping of populations in introduced localities revealed that their source is not from nearby localities.

TI The role of modeling and systems thinking in contemporary agriculture
SO SUSTAINABLE FOOD SUPPLY CHAINS: PLANNING, DESIGN, AND CONTROL THROUGH
   INTERDISCIPLINARY METHODOLOGIES
AB The images and perceived roles of agriculture in our societies have changed over the last few decades. Today agriculture is regarded as an integral part of interconnected value chains that sit at the heart of our economies, providing invaluable services to society. In response, most governments around the world are now actively developing policies to support and grow their bio-economies. This increases the expectations that society and governments have in terms of agriculture's services and performance: agriculture is not only expected to generate food for our growing populations and income for farmers, it must be part of value chains that provide raw materials that can be incorporated or converted into feed, fiber, fuel, pharmaceuticals, and other industrial products. Farmers are expected to be responsible custodians of our landscapes and their farming practices must be economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable and aligned with the broader and changing values of our societies. Often these three objectives conflict and consequently societal expectations are not met. In a world that is increasingly data rich, practicing agriculture in a way that lives up to these expectations requires tools that can help to foresee the consequences of complex interactions. Hence, this chapter explores the role of modeling and systems thinking to manage this complexity by explicitly considering three attributes of complex, adaptive systems, whereby (i) order emerges rather than being predetermined; (ii) the system's future can only be assessed probabilistically rather than deterministically predicted; and (iii) the history of the system is largely irreversible. The chapter reflects on the contemporary use of models against these three systems characteristics and concludes that scientifically based and tested algorithms (i.e., models) are already a ubiquitous and indispensable management tool for modern farming. Countless apps are already in use for short-term, tactical decision making, while more complex modeling approaches are vital for strategic scenario planning and risk assessments for farmers, policymakers, and scientists.

TI Surveillance for threatened and invasive species when uncertainty is
   severe
SO DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
AB Aim This study develops methods for efficient surveillance and monitoring systems to address a wide range of problems in biosecurity, ecology and conservation biology. It focuses especially on surveillance systems relevant for management that aims to reduce trade in threatened species and curb the spread of potential pests and diseases.
   Location Melbourne, Australia.
   Methods This paper develops different approaches to make decisions about the allocation of resources that aim to avoid unacceptable outcomes. The analysis solves for the optimal allocation of surveillance effort in each of two facilities as a function of the arrival rates of invasive species in two facilities (that is, when the arrival rates are known). However, when arrival rates are unknown, it is not possible to solve for this optimum. The analysis also provides a satisficing approach for situations in which arrival rates are unknown, in which a degree of tolerance for deviating from the optimal solution is specified.
   Results The study provides simple analytical solutions to these two problems, analogous to results developed earlier in operations research. The analysis is illustrated with an example of the inspection of quarantine facilities for pests and diseases associated with trade.
   Main conclusions The best surveillance strategy depends on the choice of an objective function and the attitude of the decision-maker to the robustness of the decision. The example application could be adapted to many other environmental surveillance scenarios.

TI How to improve threatened species management: An Australian perspective
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Targeted threatened species management is a central component of efforts to prevent species extinction. Despite the development of a range of management frameworks to improve conservation outcomes over the past decade, threatened species management is still commonly characterised as ad hoc. Although there are notable successes, many management programs are ineffective, with relatively few species experiencing improvements in their conservation status. We identify underlying factors that commonly lead to ineffective and inefficient management. Drawing attention to some of the key challenges, and suggesting ways forward, may lead to improved management effectiveness and better conservation outcomes. We highlight six key areas where improvements are needed: 1) stakeholder engagement and communication; 2) fostering strong leadership and the development of achievable long-term goals; 3) knowledge of target species' biology and threats, particularly focusing on filling knowledge gaps that impede management, while noting that in many cases there will be a need for conservation management to proceed initially despite knowledge gaps; 4) setting objectives with measurable outcomes; 5) strategic monitoring to evaluate management effectiveness; and 6) greater accountability for species declines and failure to recover species to ensure timely action and guard against complacency. We demonstrate the importance of these six key areas by providing examples of innovative approaches leading to successful species management. We also discuss overarching factors outside the realm of management influence that can help or impede conservation success. Clear recognition of factors that make species' management more straightforward - or more challenging - is important for setting realistic management objectives, outlining strategic action, and prioritising resources. We also highlight the need to more clearly demonstrate the benefit of current investment, and communicate that the risk of under-investment is species extinctions. Together, improvements in conservation practice, along with increased resource allocation and re-evaluation of the prioritisation of competing interests that threaten species, will help enhance conservation outcomes for threatened species.

TI Parrots of Oceania - a comparative study of extinction risk
SO EMU-AUSTRAL ORNITHOLOGY
AB Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, Wallacea, and the islands of the Pacific Ocean collectively possess 42% of the world's parrot species, including half of all Critically Endangered species. We used comparative methods to review the factors related to extinction risk of 167 extant and 5 extinct parrot species from this region, subsequently referred to as 'Oceania'. We tested a range of ecological and socio-economic variables as predictors of extinction risk for parrots in the region while controlling for phylogeny. Parrot species were most likely to be threatened if they had small historical ranges, large bodies, or a high dependency on forest, or if they were endemic to a single country, or native to a country with high unemployment. Our analysis identifies invasive species as an especially severe threat to the parrots of Oceania. We present maps of parrot species' diversity and draw attention to regions of conservation concern. Our comparative analysis presents an important overview of the factors contributing to the decline of parrots in Oceania, and provides a strong basis for comparison with other parts of the world.

TI A comprehensive review of Endangered Species Act recovery plans
SO ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB Endangered Species Act recovery plans have come under increased scrutiny in both political and academic arenas as species are continually added to the endangered species list but few are removed. To promote more effective recovery planning, the Society for Conservation Biology, in partnership with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, sponsored a collaborative project among 19 universities to systematically review a large representative sample of recovery plans. The primary goals of the project were to gather data about the content and characteristics of each sampled recovery plan; to analyze these data to identify important differences, patterns, and trends among the population of plan; and to use these results to inform recommendations for how the recovery planning process could be improved. We developed and used a detailed data collection Instrument to consider and characterize specific attributes of each sampled recovery plan. Topics covered by the Instrument included descriptive attributes of the plan and subject species, information about species' biology, threats to species, prescribed management actions, monitoring protocols, plan administration, public relations, and the criteria against which recovery was measured. Using a standardized data collection Instrument helped to ensure that data collection was systematic and consistent. Data were compiled into a single large database that could then be queried for quantitative, statistical analyses. We describe the methods used to sample recovery plans, develop the Instrument, calibrate data collection, and conduct recovery plan reviews. Finally, we note potential benefits and limitations of this collaborative project.

TI The Mexican Dietary and Physical Activity Guidelines: Moving Public
   Nutrition Forward in a Globalized World
SO JOURNAL OF NUTRITION
AB The objective of this article is to explain the process of the development of and to assess the Mexican food-based dietary and physical activity guidelines (FBDGs). The FBDGs were developed by an intersectoral and interdisciplinary committee of 11 national experts with input from 11 external advisors. The sectors represented were research and academic institutions, the Ministry of Health, and a nongovernmental organization. The evidence-based process included the following: literature reviews of local, national, and international evidence; review of dietary patterns of the Mexican population; key national and international recommendations; and review of FBDGs and visual icons from other countries. The guidelines' report follows the life-course socioecological model rooted in a deep understanding of the epidemiology and underlying causes of malnutrition in Mexico. The guidelines are summarized in 10 pretested main recommendations that include, and go beyond, simply promoting the consumption of a healthy and varied diet that includes fresh fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains and staying within caloric needs and staying active. The guidelines strongly emphasize healthy cooking habits, enjoyable meals with family and friends, drinking water, and avoiding the consumption of sweetened beverages, grain-based desserts, and highly processed foods. Detailed guidelines specific to different groups (on the basis of age and physiologic status) are also included. An innovative aspect of the Mexican FBDGs is the inclusion of dietary guidance of children <2 y of age. Future editions of these guidelines should consider removing their emphasis on dietary cholesterol and total dietary fat and placing more attention on the substitution of saturated and trans fats with healthy oils. The process of national agenda setting, policy articulation, and implementation of the Mexican FBDGs in the context of addressing the national obesity epidemic deserves to be initiated and formally assessed through the lens of evidence-based, public nutrition complex adaptive systems.

TI Control of invasive alien species: The Giant African snail (Lissachatina
   fulica) a difficult urban public management challenge
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB In view of the population growth trends and urbanization processes, one of the current challenges is the sur-veillance and control of invasive alien species within urban settings, particularly of those species that can serve as vectors or reservoirs of diseases with the potential to affect human health. In this regard, the present study evaluated the public management for the surveillance and control of African snails (Lissachatina fulica) in the city of Santiago de Cali in Colombia between 2016 and 2019 and proposed minimum guidelines for their surveillance and effective control in the urban settings of developing countries. The Giant African snails can be intermediate hosts of various microorganisms that have a great impact on urban public health. The latter may include parasitic, viral, bacterial, and fungal diseases, which are transported by the snail to homes or nearby areas exposing humans and animals to contagion. In the Colombian case the most important are Angiostrongylus parasites, which can cause eosinophilic meningoencephalitis, gastrointestinal disorders in humans and pulmo-nary hemorrhage in dogs. However, it is also possible that the same snails carry other nematodes such as Aleurostrogylus which can affect cats and dogs in urban areas. Comprehensive actions are required to address the problems related to urban invasive species such the African snail in Santiago de Cali as well as to develop environmental public policies and implement through municipal and state public management. We concluded that government action should be supported by reliable data to identify cases in situ, and to determine pest, environmental, and ecoepidemiological variables. Qualitative and quantitative data analyses will contribute to effective decision-making and the development of control protocols designed for each specific urban scenario.

TI Adaptive management improves decisions about where to search for
   invasive species
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB Invasive species managers must decide how best to allocate surveillance and control effort through space. Doing this requires the predicted location of the invasive species, and these predictions come with uncertainty. While optimal surveillance designs have been developed for many invasive species, few have considered uncertainty in species distribution and abundance. Adaptive management has long been recommended for managing natural systems under uncertainty, but has not yet been applied to searching for invasive species. We investigate whether an adaptive management approach can increase the number of individuals found and removed, as compared to a naive allocation of search effort or "common sense" rules of thumb. We develop a simple illustrative model where search effort must be allocated to maximise plant removals across two sites in which species abundance is unknown. We tested the performance of both passive and active adaptive strategies through simulation. There are substantial benefits to employing an adaptive strategy, although the two forms of adaptive management performed similarly. The optimal active adaptive strategy is complex to calculate, whereas the passive strategy could be calculated for a large number of sites using widely accessible spreadsheet software. We therefore recommend the passive adaptive strategy for achieving approximately the same outcome while being much more practical to implement, facilitating application to much larger and more realistic search problems in a way that is accessible to managers.

TI Pathways and approaches for scaling-up of community-based management of
   acute malnutrition programs through the lens of complex adaptive systems
   in South Sudan
SO ARCHIVES OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Background Funds for community-based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) programs are short-term in nature. CMAM programs are implemented in countries with weak policies and health systems and are primarily funded by donors. Beyond operational expansion, their institutionalisation and alignment with governments' priorities are poorly documented. The study aimed to identify pathway opportunities and approaches for horizontal and vertical scaling up of CMAM programs in South Sudan. Methods The study was conducted in South Sudan between August and September 2021 using an online qualitative survey with 31 respondents from policy and implementing organisations. The Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework guided the study's design. It was self-administered through the Qualtrics platform. We used Qualitative Content Analysis supported by the Nvivo coding process. A deductive a priori template of codes approach was complemented by a data-driven inductive approach to develop the second level of interpretive understanding. Results Findings from the study demonstrate that the emphasis of CMAM programs was horizontal scaling up, characterised by geographic distribution and coverage as well as operational expansion. Main challenges have included unsustainable funding models, the inadequacy of existing infrastructure, high operational costs, cultural beliefs, and access-related barriers. Factor impacting access to CMAM programs have been geographical terrains, safety, and security concerns. Vertical scaling up, which emphasises institutional and ownership strengthening through a sound policy, regulatory, and fiscal environment, received relatively little attention. Nutrition supplies are not part of the government's essential drug list and there is limited or no budgetary allocation for nutrition programs by the government in national budgets and fiscal strategies. Factors constraining vertical scalability have included weak government systems and capacity, a lack of advocacy and lobbying opportunities, and an apparent lack of exits strategies. Conclusion Addressing the scalability problems of CMAM programs in South Sudan demands a delicate balancing act that prioritises both horizontal and vertical scalability. Government and political leadership that harness multidisciplinary and multi-sectoral coordination are required. There is a need to increase policy commitment to malnutrition and associated budgetary allocation, emphasise local resource mobilisation, and ensure financial sustainability of integrating CMAM programs into the existing health and welfare system.

TI Revenue-sharing clubs provide economic insurance and incentives for
   sustainability in common-pool resource systems
SO JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY
AB Harvesting behaviors of natural resource users, such as farmers, fishermen and aquaculturists, are shaped by season-to-season and day-to-day variability, or in other words risk. Here, we explore how risk mitigation strategies can lead to sustainable use and improved management of common-pool natural resources. Over-exploitation of unmanaged natural resources, which lowers their long-term productivity, is a central challenge facing societies. While effective top-down management is a possible solution, it is not available if the resource is outside the jurisdictional bounds of any management entity, or if existing institutions cannot effectively impose sustainable-use rules. Under these conditions, alternative approaches to natural resource governance are required. Here, we study revenue-sharing clubs as a mechanism by which resource users can mitigate their income volatility and importantly, as a co-benefit, are also incentivized to reduce their effort, leading to reduced over-exploitation and improved resource governance. We use game theoretic analyses and agent-based modeling to determine the conditions in which revenue-sharing can be beneficial for resource management as well as resource users. We find that revenue-sharing agreements can emerge and lead to improvements in resource management when there is large variability in production/revenue and when this variability is uncorrelated across members of the revenue-sharing club. Further, we show that if members of the revenue-sharing collective can sell their product at a price premium, then the range of ecological and economic conditions under which revenue-sharing can be a tool for management greatly expands. These results have implications for the design of bottom-up management, where resource users themselves are incentivized to operate in ecologically sustainable and economically advantageous ways.

TI The Capacity of Australia's Protected-Area System to Represent
   Threatened Species
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB The acquisition or designation of new protected areas is usually based on criteria for representation of different ecosystems or land-cover classes, and it is unclear how well-threatened species are conserved within protected-area networks. Here, we assessed how Australia's terrestrial protected-area system (89 million ha, 11.6% of the continent) overlaps with the geographic distributions of threatened species and compared this overlap against a model that randomly placed protected areas across the continent and a spatially efficient model that placed protected areas across the continent to maximize threatened species' representation within the protected-area estate. We defined the minimum area needed to conserve each species on the basis of the species' range size. We found that although the current configuration of protected areas met targets for representation of a given percentage of species' ranges better than a random selection of areas, 166 (12.6%) threatened species occurred entirely outside protected areas and target levels of protection were met for only 259 (19.6%) species. Critically endangered species were among those with the least protection; 12 (21.1%) species occurred entirely outside protected areas. Reptiles and plants were the most poorly represented taxonomic groups, and amphibians the best represented. Spatial prioritization analyses revealed that an efficient protected-area system of the same size as the current protected-area system (11.6% of the area of Australia) could meet representation targets for 1272 (93.3%) threatened species. Moreover, the results of these prioritization analyses showed that by protecting 17.8% of Australia, all threatened species could reach target levels of representation, assuming all current protected areas are retained. Although this amount of area theoretically could be protected, existing land uses and the finite resources available for conservation mean land acquisition may not be possible or even effective for the recovery of threatened species. The optimal use of resources must balance acquisition of new protected areas, where processes that threaten native species are mitigated by the change in ownership or on-ground management jurisdiction, and management of threatened species inside and outside the existing protected-area system.

TI Barriers to using eHealth data for clinical performance feedback in
   Malawi: A case study
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS
AB Introduction: Sub-optimal performance of healthcare providers in low-income countries is a critical and persistent global problem. The use of electronic health information technology (eHealth) in these settings is creating large-scale opportunities to automate performance measurement and provision of feedback to individual healthcare providers, to support clinical learning and behavior change. An electronic medical record system (EMR) deployed in 66 antiretroviral therapy clinics in Malawi collects data that supervisors use to provide quarterly, clinic-level performance feedback. Understanding barriers to provision of eHealth-based performance feedback for individual healthcare providers in this setting could present a relatively low-cost opportunity to significantly improve the quality of care.
   Objective: The aims of this study were to identify and describe barriers to using EMR data for individualized audit and feedback for healthcare providers in Malawi and to consider how to design technology to overcome these barriers.
   Methods: We conducted a qualitative study using interviews, observations, and informant feedback in eight public hospitals in Malawi where an EMR system is used. We interviewed 32 healthcare providers and conducted seven hours of observation of system use.
   Results: We identified four key barriers to the use of EMR data for clinical performance feedback: provider rotations, disruptions to care processes, user acceptance of eHealth, and performance indicator lifespan. Each of these factors varied across sites and affected the quality of EMR data that could be used for the purpose of generating performance feedback for individual healthcare providers.
   Conclusion: Using routinely collected eHealth data to generate individualized performance feedback shows potential at large-scale for improving clinical performance in low-resource settings. However, technology used for this purpose must accommodate ongoing changes in barriers to eHealth data use. Understanding the clinical setting as a complex adaptive system (CAS) may enable designers of technology to effectively model change processes to mitigate these barriers.

TI Leaf litter traits of invasive species slow down decomposition compared
   to Spanish natives: a broad phylogenetic comparison
SO OECOLOGIA
AB Leaf traits related to the performance of invasive alien species can influence nutrient cycling through litter decomposition. However, there is no consensus yet about whether there are consistent differences in functional leaf traits between invasive and native species that also manifest themselves through their "after life" effects on litter decomposition. When addressing this question it is important to avoid confounding effects of other plant traits related to early phylogenetic divergences and to understand the mechanism underlying the observed results to predict which invasive species will exert larger effects on nutrient cycling. We compared initial leaf litter traits, and their effect on decomposability as tested in standardized incubations, in 19 invasive-native pairs of co-familial species from Spain. They included 12 woody and seven herbaceous alien species representative of the Spanish invasive flora. The predictive power of leaf litter decomposition rates followed the order: growth form > family > status (invasive vs. native) > leaf type. Within species pairs litter decomposition tended to be slower and more dependent on N and P in invaders than in natives. This difference was likely driven by the higher lignin content of invader leaves. Although our study has the limitation of not representing the natural conditions from each invaded community, it suggests a potential slowing down of the nutrient cycle at ecosystem scale upon invasion.

SO CURRENT SCIENCE
AB Currently available floras, which provide valuable information about the species distribution pattern, do not indicate specific locations. The preservation of threatened plants has to be based upon site-specific geographical information, knowledge of their critical habitat and distribution pattern of each threatened species in a phytosociological layout. Precise point-location data on microclimate, topography, and soil in association with geographical distribution of threatened species in the phytosociological layout will lead to the exact locality information of the concerned taxa, their population status, edaphic and climatic characters of their habitat, their niche width, potential localities to be searched, knowledge of their habitat requirements, particularly the factors limiting their distributions, the factors leading to local and biological extinction and critical habitats. In the present study, habitats of Peppara Wildlife Sanctuary were analysed by stratified random sampling techniques and locations of rare and threatened species were gathered by GPS. Satellite remote sensing data with the aid of GIS were used for site-specific mapping of each threatened species, their realized niches and the status of niches with regard to degradation. The study resulted in documenting 151 tree species belonging to 51 families with six rare and eight threatened species. The distribution of each rare and threatened species, their realized niches and status, ecological amplitude among forest types and their geographical positions in the landscape were documented and mapped.

SO AQUATIC INVASIONS
AB Predicting and averting the spread of invasive species is a core focus of resource managers in all ecosystems. Patterns of invasion are difficult to forecast, compounded by a lack of user-friendly species distribution model (SDM) tools to help managers focus control efforts. This paper presents a web-based cellular automata hybrid modeling tool developed to study the invasion pattern of lionfish (Pterois volitans/miles) in the western Atlantic and is a natural extension our previous lionfish study. Our goal is to make publically available this hybrid SDM tool and demonstrate both a test case (P. volitans/miles) and a use case (Caulerpa taxifolia). The software derived from the model, titled Invasionsoft, is unique in its ability to examine multiple default or user-defined parameters, their relation to invasion patterns, and is presented in a rich web browser-based GUI with integrated results viewer. The beta version is not species-specific and includes a default parameter set that is tailored to the marine habitat.
