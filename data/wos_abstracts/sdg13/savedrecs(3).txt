TI The Holocene climatic optimum in Korea: Evidence from wetland records
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB Three wetland sediment sections from two different locations (core CL-4 in the Chollipo area, and trenches HS and HY in the Pyeongtaek area) in west-central Korea yield crucial information on the timing and spatial pattern of century-scale climatic changes and subsequent surficial responses during the Holocene. In the Chollipo area, a lake environment developed from 7360 to 5000 calibrated years before present (cal. yr BP), the deposition of organic materials increased from 5000 to 2600 cal. yr BP, and peatland have formed since 2600 cal. yr BP. In the Pyeongtaek area, fluvial sediment was deposited prior to about 7000 cal. yr BP. From 7000 cal. yr BP onward, thick peat sequences started to develop. These two patterns of surficial responses to climate change through the Holocene are different from one another. While this might be due to the dissimilarity in geomorphic conditions, the approximate simultaneity of the environmental changes in the two areas shows that they both can be correlated with major climatic changes. Two such areas that have undergone major changes indicate that the hydrological factors including precipitation and strength of water flow were most responsible for the landscape and geomorphic evolution. The upward trend in relative sea level also played a primary role for environmental change in the coastal areas. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Comparing future climatic suitability to shoreline loss for recreational
   beach use: a case study of five Japanese beaches
SO REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB Coastal tourism is impacted by regional environmental change, including sea-level rise and climatic change. A case study at five Japanese beaches was conducted to determine the relative difference in coastal and climatic changes that are important for recreational beach tourism. Future climate conditions and projections of shoreline changes due to sea-level rise were estimated using ensembles of 14 and 21 Global Circulation Models (GCMs), respectively. The Holiday Climate Index (HCI:Beach) specific to recreational beach use was used to assess historical and future climatic suitability while beach loss area was used to quantify physical changes to beach conditions. Diminished beaches with improved climate conditions were observed at all sites except Yonehara, which had both diminished beach and climate conditions. Comparing HCI:Beach scores relative to historical conditions revealed a change of -2.4 to +10%, while beach losses were typically >60%. These results highlight that beach tourism suitability at the study sites will likely exhibit greater changes due to sea-level rise, compared to those driven by changing atmospheric conditions.

TI Phytolith and diatom evidence for rice exploitation and environmental
   changes during the early mid-Holocene in the Yangtze Delta
SO QUATERNARY RESEARCH
AB Using phytolith analysis from a well-dated and high-resolution sediment sequence in the apex of northern Yangtze Delta, we investigate environmental changes, the rise and decline of rice exploitation and possible impacts of environment on rice exploitation during the early mid-Holocene. The phytolith sequence documents a relatively warm and dry interval during ca.9000 to 8200 cal yr BP, followed by climatic amelioration before 7200 cal yr BP. Phytolith evidence indicates that rice exploitation at the apex of northern Yangtze Delta began at 8200 cal yr BP, flourished by 7700 cal yr BP and ceased after 7400 cal yr BP. The first emergence of marine diatom species approximately 7300 cal yr BP likely indicates an accelerated sea-level rise. The apparent correlation of the initiation of rice exploitation with climatic amelioration during the early mid-Holocene suggests that climatic changes may have played an important role in facilitating rice exploitation. Both the ideal climatic conditions and stable sea level enabled flourishing rice exploitation during 8200 to 7400 cal yr BP. Although the climate remained warm and wet after 7400 cal yr BP, local sea-level rise possibly led to the termination of earlier rice exploitation at this site of the northern Yangtze Delta.

TI SEA LEVEL RISE AND HUMAN ADAPTATION TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES DURING THE
   LATE PREHISTORY ALONG THE WESTERN BLACK SEA COAST
SO COMPTES RENDUS DE L ACADEMIE BULGARE DES SCIENCES
AB The, climatic changes, the sea level changes and the palaeoecological conditions of the Black Sea coastal area during the Holocene have been reconstructed and discussed from the point of view of the submerged prehistoric settlements, dating from the Eneolithic period and the Early Bronze Age. The established settlements have been analysed from their geomorphological position with the methodology of underwater archaeology. A number of submerged prehistoric settlements are known along the western coast of the Black sea. Geomorphological analysis and methodology of underwater archaeology indicates their existence from the Eneolithic period and Early Bronze Age (between 6500-4000 BP). This has also been proven by the curve of the changes of the sea level during the Holocene in the western part of the Black Sea. In the peculiar context along the western Black Sea coast numerous recent works have shown that at the beginning of the Holocene, the Black Sea was a water expanse disconnected from the Mediterranean. This connexion occurred sometime around 6700-6500 BC. This phenomenon resulted in a rapid rise of the sea level and consequently in "dramatic" changes in the coastline geometry and fluvial dynamics. These modifications probably affected the capacities of these coastlines and deltaic areas to produce and maintain biodiversity. The general worldwide sea-level rise was and still is a major source of social, geographical and environmental transformations.

TI Late Middle Ordovician environmental change and extinction: Harbinger of
   the late Ordovician or continuation of Cambrian patterns?
SO GEOLOGY
AB Positive excursions in carbon isotope compositions of carbonate (similar to 3 parts per thousand) and organic carbon (similar to 4 parts per thousand-6 parts per thousand) from the late Middle Ordovician (middle Caradocian) of the midcontinent and the eastern United States indicate widespread increases in productivity and rates of organic carbon burial that may have drawn down atmospheric pCO(2), precipitating global cooling, although not. necessarily ice-sheet formation. These climatic changes were associated with regional orogenic uplift, a relative rise in sea level, changes in epeiric sea circulation patterns, and carbonate platform destruction that led to regional extinction of marine benthos, The combination of sea-level rise, changing ocean circulation, and extinction in the middle Caradocian is similar to the suite of environmental changes described for Cambrian biomere boundaries, suggesting shared causes for these events, In contrast, middle Caradocian environmental changes are markedly different from the environmental patterns associated with the Late Ordovician mass extinction, despite the evidence for long-term cooling from the Middle to the Late Ordovician.

TI CLIMATIC AND TECTONIC SEA-LEVEL GAUGE FOR MIDCONTINENT PENNSYLVANIAN
   CYCLOTHERMS
SO GEOLOGY
AB New sedimentological determinations suggest that Pennsylvanian sea-level change ranged from as little as 40 m to as much as 160 m, depending on which model establishes the deepest water facies of a Midcontinent cyclothem. Average sedimentological estimates of sea-level change for models of Heckel and Gerhard are 96.4 m and 86.0 m, respectively. In the Midcontinent, tectonic subsidence contributed 5% to 20% of the total Pennsylvanian sea-level change in platform areas and basin depocenters. Additional change in sea level was controlled by short-term glacial eustasy (nearly 70% of sea-level change) and long-term climate change (nearly 15% of sea-level change). These findings suggest that away from orogenic belts, climatic change is the principal driving mechanism controlling sea-level change, whereas within orogenic belts, climate becomes more subordinate to tectonic processes that influenced Pennsylvanian sea-level change, even though indicators of climatic change reportedly are preserved.

TI ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AND ITS IMPACTS ON HUMAN SETTLEMENT IN THE
   CHANGJIANG RIVER DELTA IN NEOLITHIC AGE
SO CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
AB Dating data, altitude of Neolithic sites, climatic changes from sedimentary records and previous research results were collected and analyzed to detect possible connections between climatic changes and human activities in the Changjiang River Delta in the Neolithic Age. The results indicated that hydrological changes greatly impacted the human activities in the study region. Low-lying geomorphology made the floods and sea level changes become the important factors affecting human activities, especially the altitude change of human settlements. People usually moved to higher places during the periods characterized by high sea level and frequent floods to escape the negative influences from water body expansion, which resulted in cultural hiatus in certain profiles. However, some higher-altitude settlements were not the results of climatic changes but the results of social factors, such as religious ceremony and social status. Therefore, further research will be necessary for the degree and types of impacts of climatic changes on human activities in the study area at that time.

TI Holocene changes in sea level and coastal environments on Rarotonga,
   Cook Islands, South Pacific Ocean
SO HOLOCENE
AB The Holocene coastal plain of the island of Rarotonga, characterized by beach ridges and swamps, is the best developed of the Cook Islands group which lies in eastern Polynesia. Using geomorphic mapping, excavation and coring, and C-14 dating of these coastal deposits, we have reconstructed a sea-level curve and drawn maps of shoreline development for the middle to late Holocene. Our sea-level curve shows that sea level attained a position similar to that at present by 6000-6500 cal. BP, then gradually rose to a level of c. +1.5 m above present sea level by c. 4500 cal. BP. Highstands, possibly with fluctuations to lower levels, occurred during the interval c. 4500 to c. 800-500 cal. BP. Sea level has fallen to its present level since c. 800-500 cal. BP. The sea-level curve is similar to curves obtained elsewhere in Polynesia. Hydroisostatic movement may have been responsible for the relative sea-level change before c. 800-500 cal. BP, whereas the sea-level fall since then is in agreement with records from western Polynesia that attribute such a fall to climatic change. The coastal plain of Rarotonga began to emerge c. 4500 cal. BP, and prograded to the present coastline, most conspicuously on the northeastern coast. The formation of such a flat area on the coast associated with these mid- to late Holocene shoreline developments is likely to have influenced the pattern of human settlement in Rarotonga.

TI Late Pleistocene and Holocene coastal palaeoeconomies: A reconsideration
   of the molluscan evidence from northern Spain
SO GEOARCHAEOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB The worldwide increase in shell midden deposits on coastlines during the Holocene has been variously explained as the result of human population growth, economic intensification, changes in the visibility of midden deposits with changes in sea level, or climatic and environmental changes. Since coastlines are relatively unstable in geological and ecological terms, and since many archaeological sequences span periods of major climatic change, a critical issue is the ability to disentangle palaeoenvironmental from cultural and anthropogenic effects. We draw on a case study from the cave sequences of northern Spain to illustrate the problems and possibilities of palaeoeconomic and palaeoenvironmental interpretation, using studies of palaeogeographical context and analysis of abundance, taxonomic representation, ecological tolerances, size, growth structures, and other physical and chemical characteristics of the molluscs themselves. We demonstrate that the dominant, but by no means exclusive, factor in archaeologically visible long-term changes in shell-gathering behavior is environmental change rather than cultural change.

TI Cliff-Top Eolian Sedimentation Reflecting Mid- to Late-Holocene
   Environmental Changes at Anticosti Island, Gulf of St. Lawrence, Eastern
   Canada
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB The study site (Cape Sandtop) consists of a 15 m high marine terrace exposed to strong easterly winds, at the eastern end of Anticosti Island in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (Quebec, Canada), where eolian sedimentation occurred. Sections at the terrace edge exposed thick, well-humified, buried organic deposits with many wood fragments. Sedimentological and plant-macrofossil analyses were conducted from four sections to provide a chronology of eolian activity and to evaluate the causal factors for the development of treeless plant communities. Plant remains indicate that Cape Sandtop was forested between 6520 and ca. 4740 cal YBP. After ca. 4740 cal YBP, the terrace experienced a rapid change from coastal conifer forests and treed fen to marshes. Sustained erosional activity by easterly winds along the upper limestone cliff' and the terrace edge started 1560 cal YBP and caused peat burial. The key factors responsible for cliff-top eolian sedimentation were relative sea level changes, increased exposure to easterly winds associated with higher elevation (15 m asl) of the marine terrace and sediment availability. In spite of its limited extent, this coastal site appeared as a system that was sensitive to environmental changes during the Mid- to Late-Holocene.

Presently, rising concern about anthropogenic activities and their consequences on the cryosphere and environment have always overlooked changes related to future tectonic activity. Possible factors affecting an increase in the number of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are reviewed and discussed.

TI Sea-level rise, expected environmental changes, and responses of
   intertidal benthic macrofauna in the Humber estuary, UK
SO MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB In many European estuaries, extensive intertidal habitats could vanish in the future due to rising sea levels that squeeze tidal flats against established sea defences. The remaining intertidal area is likely to become steeper with coarser sediment, and saline water may intrude upstream due to increased water depth and enhanced wave energy. This paper investigates the impacts of sea-level rise on benthic macrofauna in an intertidal habitat in the Humber estuary, UK, Field surveys were conducted between 2003 and 2004 to examine spatial patterns of benthic macrofaunal biomass along the estuarine longitudinal gradient and the local beach width gradient. Multiple regression analysis revealed that >80 %, of the observed variation in biomass of the 2 dominant bivalve species Macoma balthica and Cerastoderma edule, and the total biomass of other macrobenthic species, could be explained by key environmental variables such as salinity, sediment characteristics and morphological factors. Physical data for the Humber estuary were assessed to predict the likely course of changes in these key environmental variables in response to sea-level rise. Model simulations showed that a sea-level rise of 0.3 m would result in a 63 % loss of intertidal area and 6.9 % loss of total macrobenthic biomass, and that saline intrusion could partly compensate for such loss of macrobenthic biomass. However, associated environmental changes, such as beach slope steepening and sedimentary shifts, could have overriding negative impacts with potential loss of macrobenthic biomass of up to 22.8 %, depending on the extent of environmental changes,

TI Holocene estuary development in the Algarve Region (Southern Portugal) -
   A reconstruction of sedimentological and ecological evolution
SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
AB This paper presents a reconstruction of the former coastal estuaries of the Quarteira and Carcavai estuaries in southern Portugal based on sedimentological, geochemical and palynological analyses of Holocene sediment cores. The results show that each estuary developed differently, depending on the morphology of the palaeovalley, environmental conditions and especially the influence of the sea and the formation of barrier systems. Both estuaries were flooded between 7000 and 5500 cal BP by sea level rise and were almost completely filled by sediment by the beginning of the Roman occupation (226 BC/2176 cal BP). A clear change in sedimentological processes is evident in both estuaries between 5500 and 3000 cal BP and is interpreted as an erosion phase or evidence of high-energy events such as storms or tsunamis.

TI Reef response to sea-level and environmental changes during the last
   deglaciation: Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 310, Tahiti
   Sea Level
SO GEOLOGY
AB The last deglaciation is characterized by a rapid sea-level rise and coeval abrupt environmental changes. The Barbados coral reef record suggests that this period has been punctuated by two brief intervals of accelerated melting (meltwater pulses, MWP), occurring at 14.08-13.61 ka and 11.4-11.1 ka (calendar years before present), that are superimposed on a smooth and continuous rise of sea level. Although their timing, magnitude, and even existence have been debated, those catastrophic sea-level rises are thought to have induced distinct reef drowning events. The reef response to sea-level and environmental changes during the last deglacial sea-level rise at Tahiti is reconstructed based on a chronological, sedimentological, and paleobiological study of cores drilled through the relict reef features on the modern forereef slopes during the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 310, complemented by results on previous cores drilled through the Papeete reef. Reefs accreted continuously between 16 and 10 ka, mostly through aggradational processes, at growth rates averaging 10 mm yr(-1). No cessation of reef growth, even temporary, has been evidenced during this period at Tahiti. Changes in the composition of coralgal assemblages coincide with abrupt variations in reef growth rates and characterize the response of the upward-growing reef pile to nonmonotonous sea-level rise and coeval environmental changes. The sea-level jump during MWP 1A, 16 +/- 2 m of magnitude in similar to 350 yr, induced the retrogradation of shallow-water coral assemblages, gradual deepening, and incipient reef drowning. The Tahiti reef record does not support the occurrence of an abrupt reef drowning event coinciding with a sea-level pulse of similar to 15 m, and implies an apparent rise of 40 mm yr(-1) during the time interval corresponding to MWP 1B at Barbados.

TI Climate change and coastal vulnerability assessment: scenarios for
   integrated assessment
SO SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
AB Coastal vulnerability assessments still focus mainly on sea-level rise, with less attention paid to other dimensions of climate change. The influence of non-climatic environmental change or socio-economic change is even less considered, and is often completely ignored. Given that the profound coastal changes of the twentieth century are likely to continue through the twenty-first century, this is a major omission, which may overstate the importance of climate change, and may also miss significant interactions of climate change with other non-climate drivers. To better support climate and coastal management policy development, more integrated assessments of climatic change in coastal areas are required, including the significant non-climatic changes. This paper explores the development of relevant climate and non-climate drivers, with an emphasis on the non-climate drivers. While these issues are applicable within any scenario framework, our ideas are illustrated using the widely used SRES scenarios, with both impacts and adaptation being considered. Importantly, scenario development is a process, and the assumptions that are made about future conditions concerning the coast need to be explicit, transparent and open to scientific debate concerning their realism and likelihood. These issues are generic across other sectors.

TI Relationships between Holocene sea-level variations, trophic
   development, and climatic change in Negra Lagoon, Southern Uruguay
SO JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY
AB Paleolimnological data are presented on trophic development, climatic change and sea level variations in Negra Lagoon, a 142 km(2) coastal lagoon in southern Uruguay. Using a sediment core that extended to the early Holocene, analyses of organic matter, carbonate, diatoms and opal phytoliths allowed us to track changes in trophic state and paleosalinity levels, which were closely related to Holocene sea level variation, temperature and humidity. Diatom Association Zones (DAZ) corresponding to transgressive events were dominated by marine/brackish taxa and relatively low organic matter values, while those DAZ corresponding to regressive events showed increases in brackish/freshwater diatoms and organic matter. Opal Phytoliths Association Zones (OPAZ) also were identied, temperature and humidity indices were calculated, and climatic trends were inferred. During the middle Holocene (i.e., similar to 5000 - 4000 yr BP), cool - dry climatic conditions were established. After similar to 4000 yr BP, a transition from cool to warm - humid conditions was observed, but fully warm humid conditions established only after similar to 1700 yr BP. Such climatic amelioration led to increases in trophic state.

TI Warmer or cooler late Holocene marine palaeoenvironments?: interpreting
   southeast Australian and Brazilian sea-level changes using fixed
   biological indicators and their delta O-18 composition
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB Relic inter-tidal assemblages of sessile organisms, which are referred to as fixed biological indicators (FBIs), are shown to be useful proxies for late Holocene climatic and environmental changes as well as direct indicators of short term fluctuations in sea-level. A detailed comparison of change in the inter-tidal assemblages of two Southern Hemisphere sites at comparable latitudes (Port Hacking, New South Wales, south-east Australia and the Laguna-Imbituba region of southern Brazil) indicates periods of marked similarities in the timing and nature of changes at similar to 5200, similar to 3800 cal. years BP and differences after similar to 2400 cal. years BP. There is sufficient concurrence of cooling phases and falling sea-levels to strongly suggest that in some cases global rather than regional forcing factors are at work. The value of inter-tidal organisms as indicators of changed environments is developed by identifying the past and present distributions of the common marker species: tubeworms, barnacles and mussels. The delta O-18 content of these extant specimens at Port Hacking confirmed changes in ocean water temperature and associated sea-level behaviour corresponding to invasion or extinction of temperature-sensitive species, A similar pattern is repeated, although in a less marked fashion, in the Laguna-Imbituba region of southern Brazil.

CY SEP 07-11, 2004

AB The lower Muge valley, a tributary of the lower Tagus River (Portugal), features an important archaeological record of Mesolithic shell midden sites. Archaeological research has long assumed that tidally influenced valley floor environments in the immediate locality of the sites provided a rich food resource, attracting Mesolithic settlement. To date there has been little attempt to use palaeoenvironmental records to reconstruct Holocene floodplain evolution in the Lower Tagus valley. The cultivated freshwater lower Muge floodplain is locally underlain by similar to 11 m of homogeneous fine-grained sediments and peat, comprising buried floodplain environments contemporary with Mesolithic occupation (similar to 6200-4800 cal BC). Pollen and foraminifera analyses demonstrate that fine-grained deposition, forced by sea-level rise, commenced similar to 6200 cal BC in an estuarine setting. The lower Muge floodplain experienced maximum tidal influence similar to 5800-5500 cal BC. Subsequently, sediment supply rates overtook the decreasing rate of sea-level rise and fluvial environments expanded. The pollen record may suggest regional desiccation from similar to 5000 cal BC. Estuarine environments disappeared suddenly similar to 3800 cal BC when freshwater wetlands were established. Although the initiation of Mesolithic settlement is shown to coincide with the beginning of tidal influence, site abandonment does not match with any major environmental change. Sea-level still stand (similar to 2600 cal BC) has been linked to valley floor stabilisation and soil formation. Alder floodplain woodland developed prior to similar to 230 cal BC and was cleared, probably during Roman times, for agriculture. Renewed deposition after similar to 230 cal BC may relate to internal mechanisms or to human impact upon the catchment vegetation. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Fossil coral reefs represent a unique archive of sea-level and associated environmental changes that extend far beyond instrumental records. Here, recent advances in this field are summarized, focusing on periods of Earth history typified by rapid sea-level rise and short-term climate excursions. Sea-level and reef response records from the Last Deglaciation, and periods characterized by higher sea-level stands and short-term and low-magnitude sea-level oscillations such as the Mid to Late Holocene and the Last Interglacial are synthesised. Special emphasis is given to understanding how coral reefs have responded to these changes in terms of reef development, architecture and composition. Finally, seven major challenges and future research directions are identified.

TI Near-K/T age of elastic deposits from Texas to Brazil: Impact, volcanism
   and/or sea-level lowstand?
SO TERRA NOVA
AB Near-K/T boundary elastic deposits from Texas, Mexico, Haiti, Guatemala and Brazil, often described as impact-generated tsunami deposits, are stratigraphically below well-defined K/T boundary horizons and appear not to be causally related to the K/T boundary event. Stratigraphic evidence indicates that their deposition began during the last 170-200 kyr of the Maastrichtian, coincident with a major eustatic sea-level lowstand that lowered sea level by as much as 70-100 m. Clastic deposition ended a few tens of thousands of years before the K/T boundary during a rapidly rising sea level. The presence of glass in elastic deposits in Haiti, northeastern Mexico and Yucatan suggests that the sea-level lowstand coincided with a time of major volcanism or pre-K/T boundary bolide impact.

TI Holocene sea level and climate interactions on wet dune slack evolution
   in SW Portugal: A model for future scenarios?
SO HOLOCENE
AB We examine the Holocene environmental changes in a wet dune slack of the Portuguese coast, Poco do Barbarroxa de Baixo. Lithology, organic matter, biological proxies and high-resolution chronology provide estimations of sediment accumulation rates and changes in environmental conditions in relation to sea-level change and climate variability during the Holocene. Results show that the wet dune slack was formed 7.5 cal. ka BP, contemporaneous with the last stages of the rapid sea-level rise. This depositional environment formed under frequent freshwater flooding and water ponding that allowed the development and post-mortem accumulation of abundant plant remains. The wetland evolved into mostly palustrine conditions over the next 2000 years, until a phase of stabilization in relative sea-level rise, when sedimentation rates slowed down to 0.04 mm yr(-1), between 5.3 and 2.5 cal. ka BP. Later, about 0.8 cal. ka BP, high-energy events, likely due to enhanced storminess and more frequent onshore winds, caused the collapse of the foredune above the wetlands' seaward margin. The delicate balance between hydrology (controlled by sea-level rise and climate change), sediment supply and storminess modulates the habitat's resilience and ecological stability. This underpins the relevance of integrating past records in coastal wet dune slacks management in a scenario of constant adaptation processes.

TI A Holocene pollen record of vegetation and coastal environmental changes
   in the coastal swamp forest at Batulicin, South Kalimantan, Indonesia
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
AB Pollen analysis of a coastal peat swamp core representing 9100 BP from Batulicin, South Kalimantan, Indonesia, shows that mangrove forest, with Rhizophora as its main element has been established since the early Holocene. Vegetation development in general, and particularly mangrove forest, was influenced by Holocene environmental changes. The highest value of Rhizophora at ca. 8200 BP indicates an early Holocene sea level drop and implies sea level at ca. -9 m. Subsequently mangrove forest was severely disrupted by rapid sea level rise at ca. 6400 BP prior to the Holocene Maximum. However, it quickly recovered following a lower rate of sea level rise or subsequent sea level drop at ca. 6000 BP and flourished until ca. 1000 BP. From ca. 6000 BP, the environmental setting around the site seems to have Gradually become more terrestrial and changed from mangrove forest to peat swamp forest due to higher precipitation and intensive progradation. Human influence is recognized from ca. 1600 BP. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Settlement distribution and its relationship with environmental changes
   from the Neolithic to Shang-Zhou dynasties in northern Shandong, China
SO JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
AB In this paper, the spatial and temporal distribution of the settlement sites of six periods from the Neolithic Age to the Shang and Zhou dynasties in northern Shandong was investigated using the ArcGIS program, and the relationship between settlement distribution and environmental changes was discussed, based on the proxy records of climatic and environmental change contained in the sediments from three sections at the Shuangwangcheng site and the previous work. The results show that the climate was warm and humid and the sea level was relatively high during the period of 8000-5000 a BP in the study area, and the ancient people lived in the relatively flat (slope of < 2A degrees) areas at high elevation (20-300 m above sea level), such as diluvial tableland and alluvial plain. On the other hand, few archaeological sites in the low-lying plain in the west of the study area indicate that few people lived there during that period. This might be attributed to frequent flooding in the area. After 5000 years ago, the scope of human activity extended to the area close to the sea because the relatively colder and drier climate results in sea-level fall, meanwhile the low-lying plain in the west was occupied by the ancient people. The study area of this period was characterized by the rapid development of prehistoric culture, the intensified social stratification and the emergence of early city-states. However, around 4000 a BP, the abrupt change in climate and the increase in frequency and intensity of floods severely disrupted human activities, and eventually led to the decline of the Yueshi culture. During the Shang and Zhou dynasties, the climatic conditions gradually stabilized in a mild-dry state, which promoted the redevelopment and flourish of the Bronze Culture. The previous situation, which was characteristic of sparse human settlements due to freshwater shortage and unfitted conditions for sedentary agriculture, changed during the Shang and Zhou dynasties in northern coastal wetlands. Local residents effectively adapted themselves to the tough environmental conditions by producing sea-salt, which led to the rapid growth of human activities.

TI Framework for probabilistic tsunami hazard assessment considering the
   effects of sea-level rise due to climate change
SO STRUCTURAL SAFETY
AB Sea-level rise due to climate change could significantly exacerbate tsunami disasters since the sea level is a critical parameter affecting the intensity of tsunamis. Considering the impacts of future climate change on the ocean, a method to consider the effects of sea-level rise on the tsunami hazard intensity is needed to precisely predict future tsunami disasters. This paper presents a novel framework for probabilistic tsunami hazard assessment, considering the sea-level rise and associated uncertainties. A probabilistic assessment of the sea-level rise hazard is performed using the available data and climate models considering several climate change emission scenarios. Conditional tsunami hazard curves are estimated by conducting tsunami propagation simulations given a sea-level rise while considering the uncertainties associated with fault movement (i.e., rake angles and average stress drops). Radial-basis-function-based surrogate models and quasi-Monte-Carlo simulations are employed to obtain tsunami hazard curves. Finally, the tsunami hazard curves considering the effects of sea-level rise are estimated by convolving the corresponding regional sea-level rise hazard with the conditional tsunami hazard curves based on the total probability theorem. An illustrative example is provided, in which the proposed framework is applied to several municipalities in the Mie Prefecture of Japan that would be affected by tsunamis during the anticipated Nankai-Tonankai earthquake. The effects of sea-level rise on the tsunami hazard intensities associated with the municipalities are discussed.

   TOARCIAN (JURASSIC)
SE Geological Society Special Publication
AB The study of past climate changes is pivotal for understanding the complex biogeochemical interactions through time between the geosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere, which are critical for predicting future global changes. The Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event, also known as the Jenkyns Event, was a hyperthermal episode that occurred during the early Toarcian (c. 183 Ma; Early Jurassic) and resulted in numerous collateral effects including global warming, enhanced weathering, sea-level change, carbonate crisis, marine anoxia-dysoxia and biotic crisis. The IGCP-655 project of the IUGS-UNESCO has constituted an international network of researchers with different disciplinary skills who have collaborated and shared conceptual advances on uncovering drivers of the environmental changes and ecosystem responses. This volume, Carbon Cycle and Ecosystem Response to the Jenkyns Event in the Early Toarcian (Jurassic), presents 16 works that investigate the early Toarcian environmental changes related to the global warming, sea-level rise, carbon cycle perturbation and second-order mass extinction through biostratigraphy, micropalaeontology, palaeontology, ichnology, palaeoecology, sedimentology, integrated stratigraphy, inorganic, organic and isotopic geochemistry, and cyclostratigraphy.

TI Relative sea level and abrupt mass unloading in Barbados during the
   Holocene
SO GEOMORPHOLOGY
AB Relative sea level records climatic change as well as vertical land movement. In Barbados, uplift variation is necessary to interpret one of the most complete coral reef records. Here we show that an abrupt mass unloading of 30 +/- 10 km(3) caused an uplift variation of ~0.45 +/- 0.15 mm/yr using a modelling approach. Simulations have been conducted for different volumes and elastic thicknesses. Isostatic adjustment in relation with an abrupt mass unloading explains the observed uplift rate increased from 0.34 mm/yr to 0.8 mm/yr that occurred 11.2 kyr ago. The reconstructed sea-level curve highlights a sea-level jump of 4.8 m, with a delay of 150 yr from the termination of Younger Dryas cold event and 300 yr before the abrupt mass unloading. This sea-level jump corresponds to meltwater pulse MWP-1B and is not an artefact. A stagnation of 500 yr occurred from 12 to 11.5 kyr BP. Relative sea level records are useful to detect past landslides and erosion. Accurate analysis and reconstruction of sea-level permits to determine sea-level abrupt rise caused by climate warming during the last thousand years.

SO RADIOCARBON
AB Owing to the large basin area of the Caspian Sea, fluctuations in its level reflect climatic changes in the northern hemisphere. To reconstruct these fluctuations, I collected mollusk shells, plant debris, carbonates and organic matter samples for C-14 dating from deposits of ancient salt marshes, depressions and bars formed during significant sea-level decline. I studied the impact of eolian sedimentation via parallel dating of carbonates and other materials. The data demonstrate that sea level rises during periods of cooling and falls during warming periods; this is true for both long-term (2-2.5 ka) and short-term climatic changes.

TI Allogenic and autogenic effects on mangrove dynamics from the Ceara
   Mirim River, north-eastern Brazil, during the middle and late Holocene
SO EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
AB It is possible that climate changes and sea level fluctuations (allogenic processes) are and will cause major changes in mangrove dynamics. However, other driving forces may be significantly affecting this system. Distinguishing allogenic and autogenic influence on mangroves is a challenging question, because mechanisms related to the natural dynamics of depositional environments (autogenic processes) have strong influences on the establishment and degradation of mangroves. Thus, impacts on mangroves caused by autogenic processes may be erroneously attributed to allogenic mechanisms. Therefore, it is imperative to identify the fingerprint' of global changes in modern mangrove dynamics. In order to characterize the influence of these forces on mangroves, this work has used geomorphology and vegetation maps integrated with sedimentological and palynological data, radiocarbon dating, as well as C-13, N-15 and C/N from sedimentary organic matter. The inter-proxy analyses reveal an estuarine influence with mangrove development along the Ceara Mirim River, north-eastern Brazil, since similar to 6920cal yr bp, after the post-glacial sea level rise. Relative sea level (RSL) has been stable during the middle and late Holocene. Mangrove establishment along this fluvial valley begins at about 6920cal yr bp, caused by the sea-level stabilization, an allogenic influence. However, after its establishment, wetland dynamics were mainly controlled by autogenic factors, related to channel migrations, instead of allogenic process. Some influence of sea-level and climate changes on mangrove dynamics in this estuarine channel have been weakened by more intense tidal channels activities. Therefore, the expansion and contraction of mangrove areas along the estuary of the Ceara Mirim River since 6920cal yr bp has been mainly influenced by channel dynamics that regulate the accretion and erosion of mangrove substrates.

TI LATE QUATERNARY ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGES IN EASTERN AND CENTRAL AUSTRALIA,
   AND THEIR CLIMATIC INTERPRETATION
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB The march of environmental changes in eastern Australia, from the Last Interglacial to the Holocene, is reviewed. Palynologic evidence suggests that forest composition fluctuated substantially during Oxygen Isotope (OI) Substages 5a to 5e, but physical evidence for this period is as yet poorly defined. During OI Stage 3 and possibly part of 4, inland lakes were larger and the hydrologic balance was wetter than at any time since. Conditions were coldest, and dune activity was maximal throughout the continent, during OI Stage 2, but driest conditions as judged from lake levels occurred at the termination of the Pleistocene, when temperatures were rising rapidly. Lags between changes of boundary conditions and responses of natural systems are clearly seen in Holocene behaviour of coasts and reefs, and the effects of extreme events rather than climatic changes are seen in some sedimentary sequences. Establishment of the chronology of deposits older than about 35 ka, and forging links between the terrestrial and deep-sea records, are major challenges for future research.

TI Holocene coastal stratigraphy and the sedimentary development of the Hai
   Phong area of the Bac Bo Plain (Red River Delta), Vietnam
SO AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHER
AB We report a study of the Holocene coastal sediments of the Hai Phong area of the Bac Bo Plain (also known as the Red River Delta) in northern Vietnam. This is the first attempt to interpret the region's coastal depositional environments in the light of a geological model of Holocene environmental change recognising the interacting roles of Holocene sea-level change, alluvial responses to sea-level fluctuation, and tidal environment sedimentation. The coastal sediments overlie a Pleistocene land surface, and represent the Holocene marine transgression and regression. Prior to c .6000 bp , the sea rose to around or above its present elevation, converting the Pleistocene terrestrial landscape to a Holocene tidal landscape of tidal flat, channel and mangrove environments. Sea-level lowering by c .4000 bp triggered a switch in dominant sedimentary processes, allowing floodplain sediments to be deposited increasingly seawards.

TI Quaternary reef response to sea-level and environmental change in the
   western Atlantic
SO SEDIMENTOLOGY
AB The tropical-subtropical western Atlantic realm harbours abundant fringing reefs, two major barrier reefs (Belize, Florida), several atolls and large reef-fringed carbonate platforms (Bahamas). Data from Belize and south Florida indicate that major barrier reefs were established during the high sea-levels of the long and warm marine isotope stage 11. Reefs formed during Pleistocene sea-level highstands, whereas erosion, non-deposition and the formation of subaerial exposure surfaces prevailed during lowstands of sea-level (Florida, Bahamas); exposed reefs and platforms with siliciclastic hinterlands were characterized by deposition of clays and sands on fluvial plains (Belize). Elevated terraces and outcrops of reefs of the last interglacial of marine isotope stage 5e are evidence of higher than present sea-level and temperature that sustained large reef-fringed carbonate platforms and ramps in the Florida-Bahamas region and Central America (Belize, Mexico), including ooid deposition in warm and shallow waters. During the highstands of marine isotope stages 5c and 5a, at sea-levels several metres lower than today, fringing reefs developed in parts of the Caribbean, for example, in south Florida (outlier reefs'). Data from the island of Barbados support the contention that the postglacial sea-level rise from about -120m was rapid and punctuated by two meltwater pulses Ia and Ib, which bracket the beginning and end of the Younger Dryas, respectively. After reflooding of shelves in the early Holocene, reefs developed preferentially on highs of the underlying karstified Pleistocene limestone surface and on former river channel bars. Many reefs in the western Atlantic region kept pace with Holocene sea-level rise whereas some were drowned. Reasons for reef drowning are debated and include sea-level rise, elevation of antecedent topography, and deterioration of environmental conditions such as high nutrient input. Apart from sea-level and antecedent topography, factors such as exposure to waves and currents, storms, and sedimentation have controlled reef development. The historical decline of acroporid corals in the Caribbean realm has been attributed to cooling following the Holocene thermal optimum; however, historical die-offs of reef-building corals and other reef organisms suggest that some if not all recent declines were unprecedented during the Holocene. Rising temperatures, decreasing carbonate saturation, increased frequency of major storms, high nutrient concentrations and sedimentation, overfishing, and disease certainly played a role in decline, but systematic studies relating these environmental factors to Holocene reef-building are only in the early stages.

TI How do basin margins record long-term tectonic and climatic changes?
SO GEOLOGY
AB A long-standing goal of sedimentary geoscience is to understand how tectonic and climatic changes are reflected in basin fill. Here, we use 14 numerical models of continental-scale sedimentrouting systems spanning millions of years to investigate the responses of sediment supply and basin sedimentation to changes in uplift and precipitation in the source area. We also investigate the extent to which these signals can be altered by relative sea level (the sum of subsidence and eustasy). In cases of constant relative sea level, sediment supply and margin progradation have similar responses because nearly all of the sediment is transported beyond the coastal plain and continental shelf to the basin margin. Thus, margin progradation can be used as a proxy for sediment supply. However, changes in uplift and precipitation result in different erosional patterns in the source area and different basin-margin depositional patterns. Changes in uplift result in gradual (over several million years) adjustment to new steady states of source-area erosion and margin progradation, whereas changes in precipitation result in abrupt changes in erosion and progradation followed by a return to the initial steady states. In cases of changing relative sea level, sediment storage on the shelf attenuates signals of uplift, but signals of precipitation change can be interpreted in the basin-margin record because climate-induced sediment supply changes are large enough to influence margin progradation. Understanding the relationship between sediment supply and basin-margin progradation, and their linked responses to forcings, improves our ability to interpret signals of environmental change in the stratigraphic record.

TI LATE PLEISTOCENE SEA-LEVEL CHANGE IN THE BAHAMAS FROM MASS-SPECTROMETRIC
   U-SERIES DATING OF SUBMERGED SPELEOTHEM
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB The dating of sea level events by a method independent of orbital tuning techniques and the marine foraminiferal isotopic record provides a test of both the dating of the marine record and the strength and nature of the relationship between climatic change, sea level change and Milankovitch cycles. Dating of fossil corals and submerged speleothem provides such independent information.
   Results of thermal ionization mass spectrometric U-series dating on layers of flowstone speleothem from Lucayan Caverns, Grand Bahama Island indicate that multiple sea level events have passed through a depth of -10 to -15 m below modern sea level during the last 300,000 years. These data are used to constrain the magnitude and timing of sea-level fluctuations during the late Pleistocene. The new sea level curve constructed from these data correlates closely with the marine isotopic record: sea level peaks occurred at around 233, 215, 125 and 100 ka BP. There is no evidence at the depth from which this speleothem was retrieved of any high sea stands at 195 or 80 ka corresponding to the foraminiferal 7a and 5a oxygen isotope peaks. There is also no evidence of a double rise around the 125 ka (5e) peak, although such an oscillation could have occurred above -10 m leaving no record in the Lucayan Caverns speleothem.

AB This paper presents a diatom history for Korea and reviews some recent diatom analyses to reconstruct past environmental changes from terrestrial, coastal, and marine sediments around the Korean peninsula. Since they were first reported by Skvortzov in 1936, fossil diatom studies in Korea have been conducted mainly from the Neogene and Quateranary strata of the Pohang and Gampo regions of Gyeongsang-bukdo, and the Chulwon and Bukpyeong areas of Gangwon-do on the eastern coast of the Korean peninsula, as well as from Holocene strata of the Ilsan area of the Han River estuary, tidal sediments off Mankyung-Dongjin, Namyang, and Hampyeong Bay, and the Cheollipo area on the western coast of the Korean peninsula. Most of the coastal diatoms provided further information on sea level trends, climatic changes, and coastal evolution for much of the Holocene in the Yellow Sea. Recent studies of fossil diatoms from the Ulleung Basin, East/Japan Sea, also indicate fluctuations in sea surface temperatures, in the influx and circulation of the Tsushima Warm Current, and in sea levels during the Late Quaternary.

TI AN INDEX TO ASSESS SOUTH-AFRICA VULNERABILITY TO SEA-LEVEL RISE
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
AB The so-called greenhouse effect, global warning and associated sea-level rise are becoming accepted as probable scenarios of future climatic change.  Planning authorities are therefore in need of methods of determining what the socio-economic and environmental impacts of climatic changes will be.  This article reviews a proposed coastal vulnerability index (CVI) designed to assess the impacts of sea-level rise on the coastal environment worldwide, and develops a new risk-analysis procedure, on a smaller scale, using an economic hierarchy.  It identifies high- and low-risk locations, high- and low-risk infrastructure in those locations, and those processes most likely to be detrimental to that infrastructure.  The CVI and the risk-analysis procedure are applied to the developed areas of the southern Cape coast and show the most vulnerable areas to be those surrounding estuaries and lagoons.  The greatest hazards overall are from extreme storm and flood events and the most vulnerable infrastructure is that of private housing.  This suggests that the initial costs of the impacts of sea-level rise on this section of the coast will be borne by the private individual and not the nation as a whole.  Suggestions for further studies are given which could help refine existing predictions of the detrimental effects of rising sea levels on the South African coastal environment.

TI Can long-term variability in the Gulf Stream transport be inferred from
   sea level?
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Recent studies by Sturges and collaborators suggest a simple, but powerful, technique to estimate climatic changes in the transport of the Gulf Stream from the difference between the oceanic sea level calculated with a simple wind-driven Rossby wave model and the observed coastal sea level. The hypothesis behind this technique is tested, using 40 years of data (1950 to 1989) obtained from a three-dimensional Atlantic Ocean model forced by observed surface data. The analysis shows that variations in sea level difference between the ocean and the coast are indeed coherent with variations of the Gulf Stream transport for periods shorter than 1 year or longer than 4-5 years. The results obtained from the three-dimensional model confirm the findings of the simple Rossby wave model that decadal climatic changes in the Gulf Stream transport vary considerably with latitude.

TI Estuarine-fluvial floodplain formation in the Holocene Lower Tagus
   valley (Central Portugal) and implications for Quaternary fluvial system
   evolution
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB We present a brief synthesis of the Quaternary fluvial record in the Lower Tagus Basin (central Portugal), concentrating on factors controlling infill and incision. The Holocene part of the record forms the focus of this paper and guides the questioning of the basic assumptions of the established Quaternary fluvial evolution model, in particular the link between sea-level change and fluvial incision-deposition. We suggest that several incision-aggradation phases may have occurred during glacial periods. Major aggradation events may overlap with cold episodes, while incision appears to concentrate on the warming limb of climate transitions. The complex stratigraphy of the Quaternary record in the Lower Tagus valley is influenced by repeated base-level and climate changes.
   This paper submits the first chronostratigraphic framework for valley fill deposits in the Lower Tagus area. Sea-level rise forced aggradation and controlled deposition of the fine-grained sedimentary wedge underlying the low-gradient Lower Tagus floodplain. Investigations have focused on the lower Muge tributary, where rapidly aggrading estuarine and fluvial environments were abruptly established (similar to 8150 cal BP) as sea level rose. Base level at the valley mouth controlled the upstream extent of the fine-grained backfill. Tidal environments disappeared abruptly (similar to 5800 cal BP) when the open estuary at the Muge confluence was infilled by the Tagus River. The decrease and final still stand of sea-level rise led to floodplain stabilisation with peat (similar to 6400-5200 cal BP) and soil formation (similar to 5200-2200 cal BP). Localised renewed sedimentation (similar to 2200-200 cal BP) is linked to human activity. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Sr-87/Sr-86 anomalies in Late Cretaceous-Early Tertiary strata of the

   environmental changes across K-T boundary
SO JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
AB The Ariyalur-Pondicherry sub-basin of the Cauvery basin comprises a near complete stratigraphic record of Upper Cretaceous-Lower Tertiary periods. Earlier studies have documented variations of clay mineral assemblages, change in microtexture of siliciclasts and many geochemical and stable isotopic anomalies far below the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (KTB) in these strata. This paper documents the occurrences of two positive Sr-87/Sr-86 anomalies preceding K-T boundary in this basin and discusses plausible causes. Analysis of trace elemental and stable isotopic profiles, sedimentation history, petrography and mineralogy of the rocks reveal that while both the anomalies may be due to increased detrital influx caused by sea level and climatic changes, the second anomaly might have been influenced by Deccan volcanism which in turn predated KTB. Record of such anomalies preceding K-T boundary supports the view of multi-causal step-wise extinction of biota across KTB.

The wave caracteristics properties and the sea level time series of the referenced storm were increased of about 5, 10 and 20% in order to define the dune erosion. We evidenced that the wave height displays more influence on the dune erosion than the sea level. Moreover the storm duration, over 4 days, does not play an important role on the dune erosion. However there is no proportional relationships between a weak storm energy increase and/or duration, and dune erosion. A small increase of storm will have a large impact on dune erosion in the future.

TI Landscape evolution during the late Quaternary at the Doce River mouth,
   Espirito Santo State, Southeastern Brazil
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB The sedimentary deposits of the deltaic plain of the Doce and Barra Seca rivers, Southeastern Brazil, were studied by facies analysis, pollen records, delta C-13, C/N analysis and AMS C-14-dating. Today, this deltaic plain is dominated by beach ridges and sandy terraces occupied by arboreal and herbaceous vegetation. Between similar to 47,500 and similar to 29,400 cal yr B.P., a deltaic system was developed in response mainly to eustatic sea-level fall. Although the studied stratigraphic succession is compatible with the trend of global sea-level fall, the earlier sea-level suggested by the topographic position of these deltaic deposits was above the one expected during the MIS3 stage. A tectonic uplift likely occurred during the late Quaternary and raised these deposits. The post-glacial sea-level rise caused a marine incursion with invasion of embayments and broad valleys, and it favored the evolution of an estuary with wide tidal mud flats occupied by mangroves between similar to 7400 and similar to 5100 cal yr B.P. The high river sand supply and/or the relative sea-level fall in the late Holocene led to seaward and downward translation of the shoreline during normal/forced regression, producing progradational deposits with shrinkage of mangrove stands and expansion of marshes colonized by herbaceous vegetation. Therefore, the stratigraphic architecture and evolution of the Doce River deltaic plain suggest that fluvial sediment supply and relative sea-level fluctuations related to Quaternary global climatic changes and local tectonism exerted major controls on sedimentation through the variation of accommodation space and base-level changes.

TI Sea levels stands and evolution of prehistoric cultures according to
   climatic changes. The cave sites Rabat-Temara area example
SO ANTHROPOLOGIE
AB Based on the global data on climate change since the isotopic stage 5, it is possible to correlate the sea levels variations with the occupation phases of the Rabat-Temara caves by prehistoric men. High sea levels occur during warm climate phases and then the level of the ocean is comparable to the current level: The caves are therefore a few hundred meters from the Atlantic shoreline. Low sea levels occur during cool climate phases. In the region of Rabat-Temara, the bathymetry data indicates that an ocean level drop of 120 m recedes the shoreline more than 20 km to the West. During these phases, the caves were much farther from the ocean than today. This leads us to question the influence that these climatic and very important landscape variations have had on the prehistoric men behaviors and cultures. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI IMPACT OF SEA LEVEL RISE TO COASTAL ECOLOGY: A CASE STUDY ON THE
   NORTHERN PART OF JAVA ISLAND, INDONESIA
SO QUAESTIONES GEOGRAPHICAE
AB The coastline of Indonesia, which borders almost 17,500 islands and the sea and extends for more than 80,000 km, is vulnerable to sea level rise. This paper aims to investigate the impact of sea level rise on coastal ecology in Indonesia focusing on coastal area of Jakarta, Pekalongan, Semarang and Demak in the northern part of Java Island. Geo-spatial data, i.e. satellite images and maps were used to monitor the environmental changes and primary data were obtained through field survey and observation on the specified area. In Jakarta, sea level rise has been predicted to bring great damages to infrastructure in coastal area. Multiple impacts of sea level rise towards mangrove, agriculture, and aquaculture ecosystem occurs in Pekalongan. Semarang coastal area also suffers from the widening spread of health problems as the coastal inundation increases. At the same time, Demak experiences major losses on mangrove and aquaculture ecosystem due to sea level rise.

TI Sedimentary environmental change induced from late Quaternary sea-level
   change in the Bonaparte Gulf, northwestern Australia
SO GEOSCIENCE LETTERS
AB Low-latitude continental shelves, mixed siliciclastic carbonate sedimentary systems, provide an understanding of sedimentary environments driven by paleoclimatological processes. The Bonaparte Gulf, northwestern Australian continental shelf, is among the widest in the world, ranging to 500 km, with shallow carbonate terraces and platforms that were exposed during periods of lower sea level. The dominant sediments type switches between carbonate and siliciclastic over a sea-level cycle. However, the mechanism of sedimentary environmental change in the Bonaparte Gulf is not clearly understood. Here, we present a record of sedimentary environmental change from ca. 24 to 35 ka that is related to sea-level variability and exposure of carbonate terraces and platforms. Multi-proxy data from a marine sediment core show a sea-level change induced switch in sedimentary environment from siliciclastic to carbonate-dominated sedimentation during the last glaciation. Radiocarbon ages constrain the timing of this switch to ca. 26 ka, associated with a local sea-level fall of -90 m.

TI Mollusk collecting and environmental change during the Prehistoric
   Period in the Mariana Islands
SO CORAL REEFS
AB Archaeological research in the Mariana Islands has revealed changes in mollusk collecting during the Prehistoric Period (approximately 1500 BC to AD 1521). The earliest people at Tumon Bay, Guam and Chalan Piao, Saipan collected mostly bivalves, especially the arc clam Anadara antiquata. After several hundred years, they no longer collected A. antiquata, but collected smaller bivalves instead. By AD 1000, they collected mostly gastropods, primarily the coral reef species Strombus gibberulus gibbosus. One possible explanation is that the people preferred the large arc clam but overharvested it until they were forced to eat the smaller bivalves and then the snails. However, recent evidence in the form of mangrove wood and mangrove pollen supports another explanation, one of non-anthropogenic environmental change. In this case, the relative sea-level decline, which took place in the Marianas within the last 4,000 years, caused the demise of mangrove habitats and of the arc clam at Tumon Bay, Guam and Chalan Piao, Saipan. As mangrove habitats were diminished by sea-level decline, collecting effort shifted to coral reefs, and S. gibberulus gibbosus was harvested throughout the remainder of the Prehistoric Period and into the Historic Period. Southern Guam is the only area in the Marianas in which A. antiquata increased in abundance during the Prehistoric Period. The same types of evidence, mangrove wood and mangrove pollen, indicate that, in contrast to the situation at Tumon Bay and Chalan Piao, mangroves increased in abundance in southern Guam.

TI Coastal squeeze on rocky shores in northern Scotland and some possible
   ecological impacts
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY
AB Britain's long and varied coast supports numerous habitats and diverse assemblages of species. These provide vital ecosystem services in addition to economic and amenity value. Alterations to our coastlines associated with rising sea levels will have major implications for humans, wildlife and habitats. We need to predict how our coastline will evolve with climatic change and understand what the environmental and ecological consequences of change to our coasts will be. Much effort is devoted to modelling and predicting changes to inundation or erosion of sedimentary shores, which are already increasing in steepness and decreasing in area ('coastal squeeze') in response to rising sea levels, increasing prevalence of artificial structures and rising and stormier seas. In contrast, virtually no attention has been given to hard rocky coasts that, where the back of the shore is steep, will also show coastal squeeze with rising sea levels. Rock platforms backed by cliffs constitute about 80% of oceanic coastlines globally and in Britain, 42% of the coastline is hard rock, with many areas having cliffs behind the shore. Some of these have shallowly sloping rock above the intertidal zone before the cliff starts, but many others have cliffs close to high water. Predicted increases in relative sea level by 2100 range between 0.30 and 1.90 m. Thus, topographic changes to hard shorelines are unlikely to be trivial, even over this timescale. To understand some potential changes to our coastlines, we estimated present-day extents and slopes of the intertidal zone on hard rocky shores from existing topographical data. Slopes of intertidal area were calculated at fine spatial resolution using a digital elevation model. Actual intertidal extent was calculated from slope, size and numbers of cells in a raster image between high and low tide levels. Tidal levels were then elevated according to two predictions of sea-level rise, allowing calculation of future areas and slopes of the shore. With a rise in sea level of 0.30 m, intertidal extents of three areas of rocky shore in Scotland, each 10s of kms long, will decrease by 10-27%, mean slopes will increase by 0-3 degrees and areas of sloping shoreline >= 45 degrees will increase minimally. With greater rises (1.90 m), areas will decrease by 26-50%, slopes will increase by 1-3 degrees and areas of sloping shoreline >= 45 degrees will at least double in extent. Changes in the physical characteristics of shorelines can influence availability of habitats, with possible impacts on abundance, composition and diversity of assemblages and on behaviour of intertidal organisms. Using examples from the literature about how important intertidal organisms respond to physical conditions, we describe a variety of possible consequences for intertidal ecology.

TI Dryland belt of Northern Eurasia: contemporary environmental changes and
   their consequences
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB The dryland belt (DLB) in Northern Eurasia is the largest contiguous dryland on Earth. During the last century, changes here have included land use change (e.g. expansion of croplands and cities), resource extraction (e.g. coal, ores, oil, and gas), rapid institutional shifts (e.g. collapse of the Soviet Union), climatic changes, and natural disturbances (e.g. wildfires, floods, and dust storms). These factors intertwine, overlap, and sometimes mitigate, but can sometimes feedback upon each other to exacerbate their synergistic and cumulative effects. Thus, it is important to properly document each of these external and internal factors and to characterize the structural relationships among them in order to develop better approaches to alleviating negative consequences of these regional environmental changes. This paper addresses the climatic changes observed over the DLB in recent decades and outlines possible links of these changes (both impacts and feedback) with other external and internal factors of contemporary regional environmental changes and human activities within the DLB.

TI Don't get too attached: Property-place relations on contested coastlines
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF BRITISH GEOGRAPHERS
AB Societies are now squarely facing the risks of environmental and climatic change, and developed coastlines are ground zero. Climate change will cause damage to, or loss of, coastal property - property that, in most Western societies, is considered a high net value asset. This paper examines cultural ideas about private property and the complexities of using land use planning law as an enabler of climate change adaptation. It reports the findings of qualitative research that explores how residents living in coastal Australia respond to the risks to their property and to the places they live that are posed by sea level rise and other coastal climate change-related risks. By reporting how residents experience their material coastal environment, and how they relate with and to ideas of "property" in a coastal environmental change context, this paper contributes to both coastal policy and to legal geography scholarship.

TI Human responses to environmental change on the southern coastal plain of
   the Caspian Sea during the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB This paper presents results of a multidisciplinary research initiative examining human responses to environmental change at the intersection of the southern coastal plain of the Caspian Sea and the foothills of the Alborz Mountains during the terminal Pleistocene and early Holocene. Our palaeo-environmental analysis of two sedimentary cores obtained from a lagoon in close proximity to four caves, occupied by human groups during the transition from hunting and gathering to food-producing ways of life in this region, confirms Charles McBurney's 1968 hypothesis that when Caspian Sea levels were high, Mesolithic hunters were reliant on seal and deer, but as water levels receded and a wide coastal plain emerged, hunters consumed a different range of herbivorous mammalian species.
   Palynological evidence obtained from these two cores also demonstrates that the cool and dry climatic conditions often associated with the Younger Dryas stadial do not appear to have been extreme in this region. Thus, increasingly sedentary hunting and gathering groups could have drawn on plant and animal resources from multiple ecological niches without suffering significant resource stress or reduced population levels that may have been encountered in neighbouring regions. Our analyses of botanical, faunal and archaeological remains from a recently-discovered open-air Mesolithic and aceramic Neolithic site also shows an early process of Neolithization in the southern Caspian basin, which was a very gradual, low-cost adaptation to new ways of life, with neither the abandonment of hunting and gathering, nor a climatic trigger event for the emergence of a low-level, food-producing society.

TI A FRACTAL ANALYSIS OF QUATERNARY, CENOZOIC-MESOZOIC, AND LATE
   PENNSYLVANIAN SEA-LEVEL CHANGES
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
AB Sea level changes are related to both climatic variations and tectonic movements. The fractal dimensions of several sea level curves were compared to a modem climatic fractal dimension of 1.26 established for annual precipitation records. A similar fractal dimension (1.22) based on delta(O-18/O-16) in deep-sea sediments has been suggested to characterize climatic change during the past 2 m.y. Our analysis indicates that sea level changes over the past 150,000 to 250,000 years also exhibit comparable fractal dimensions. Sea level changes for periods longer than about 30 m.y. are found to produce fractal dimensions closer to unity and Missourian (Late Pennsylvanian) sea level changes yield a fractal dimension of 1.41. The fact that these sea level curves all possess fractal dimensions less than 1.5 indicates that sea level changes exhibit nonperiodic, long-run persistence. The different fractal dimensions calculated for the various time periods could be the result of a characteristic overprinting of the sediment record by prevailing processes during deposition. For example, during the Quaternary, glacio-eustatic sea level changes correlate well with the present climatic signature. During the Missourian, however, mechanisms such as plate reorganization may have dominated, resulting in a significantly different fractal dimension.

TI Early Pliocene climatic optimum, cooling and early glaciation deduced by
   terrestrial and marine environmental changes in SW Spain
SO GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
AB The Pliocene is a key period in Earth's climate evolution, as it records the transition from warm and stable conditions to the colder and more variable glaciated climate of the Pleistocene. Simultaneously, climate became more seasonal in the Mediterranean area, and Mediterranean-type seasonal precipitation rhythm with summer drought established. These climatic changes presumably had significant impacts on terrestrial environments. However, the response of terrestrial environments to such climate changes is still not fully understood due to the lack of detailed studies dealing with this period of time. In this study, multiproxy analyses of continuous core sampling from La Matilla (SW Spain) shows detailed and continuous record of pollen, sand content and abundance of benthic foraminifer Bolivina spathulata to describe paleoenvironmental and paleoclimate trends during the early Pliocene. This record shows warmest, most humid climate conditions and highest riverine nutrient supply at similar to 4.35 Ma, coinciding with the Pliocene climatic optimum and high global sea level. A climate cooling and aridity trend occurred subsequently and a significant glaciation occurred at similar to 4.1-4.0 Ma, during a period known by very little terrestrial evidence of glaciation. Our multiproxy data thus indicate that terrestrial and marine environments were significantly variable during the early Pliocene and that major glaciation-like cooling occurred before the intensification of northern hemisphere glaciation at the beginning of the Pleistocene (similar to 2.7 Ma). This major climate cooling and aridity maxima between 4.1 and 4.0 Ma is independently validated by a coeval sea-level drop (third order Za2 sequence boundary). This sea level drawdown is supported by enhanced coarse sedimentation and minima in riverine nutrient supply, showing paired vegetation and sea-level changes and thus a strong land-ocean relationship. This study also shows that long-term climatic trends were interrupted by orbital-scale cyclic climatic variability, with eccentricity, obliquity and precession acting as the main triggers controlling climate and environmental change in the area.

TI Modeling fluvial erosion and deposition on continental shelves during
   sea level cycles
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
AB [ 1] A numerical model has been developed to predict the evolution and degree of incision and deposition by fluvial channels on the continental shelf during sea level cycles. Rainfall-runoff, mass wasting processes, and fluvial sediment entrainment and transport are simulated using the detachment-limited model of Howard [ 1994] on a grid that represents the morphology of the continental shelf and corresponding coastal plain. The model is coupled with a deltaic module for sediment deposition in the ocean and a fluctuating sea level that mimics climatic changes on a -10(4) year timescale. The model indicates that the detailed structure of sea level oscillations has a strong influence upon sediment redistribution and channel development on the shelf. In particular, high-frequency sea level oscillations increase fluvial incision in the terminal reaches of the rivers due to rapid downcutting during the low stands of the oscillation. It is shown that the increment of incision at the river mouth is directly proportional to the oscillation amplitude. Furthermore, simulations indicate that an increase in river sediment load driven by climatic change favors channel avulsion with the formation of new fluvial incisions on the shelf. Results also show the strong influence of shelf morphology on establishing channel networks during sea level low stands.

TI Holocene coastal lowland evolution: reconstruction of land-sea
   transitions in response to sea-level changes (Jade Bay, southern North
   Sea, Germany)
SO ZEITSCHRIFT DER DEUTSCHEN GESELLSCHAFT FUR GEOWISSENSCHAFTEN
AB The climatic changes in the Late Quaternary have led to a series of environmental changes in the coastal area of the southern North Sea. The Pleistocene landscape around the Jade Bay was gradually inundated and covered with Holocene coastal deposits during sea-level rise after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). In this context, a data base of 827 core logs and 8 piston cores was interpreted with regard to lithological indicators of environmental changes south of the modern Jade Bay. By the sedimentological and stratigraphical analysis of ancient extended salt marsh belts, silting-up zones and tidal flat / tidal channel complexes, the position, internal structure and extension of the land-sea interface was reconstructed in detail giving insight into principle processes and interactions taking place in this highly sensitive zone during sea-level changes.
   The Holocene coastal sediment sequence in the Jade area consists of four distinct lithological units representing semiterrestrial, brackish-lagoonal and shallow marine sub-environments. With regard to small scale sea-level fluctuations in the latest phase of the Holocene transgression, distinct periods of stagnation or even regression occurred. In contrast to the typical internal composition of the Holocene deposits of the backbarrier coast with a multiple alternation of landward and seaward facies shifts, indicating repeated shoreline displacements, the Holocene sequence of the Jade Bay is characterised by only one landward-seaward facies shift. However, the sedimentary record is displayed in complex sequences of clastic deposits of tidal flat and brackish environments and intercalated beds of autochthonous fen and raised bog peat.
   From 11th century, onward increasing human activity has significantly influenced the development of the coastal landscape by dike construction, dewatering and land reclamation along the entire coastline. Consequently, the former swamptype characteristic of the extended lower supratidal zone has significantly changed into a narrow belt of salt marshes restricted by an artificially fixed coastline and the decoupling of marine-terrestrial processes. In the light of recent regional sea-level curve discussions, the presence of sea-level index points is critically discussed, due to the widespread existence of thick peat beds.

TI Relationships between trophic state, paleosalinity and climatic changes
   during the first holocene marine transgression in Rocha Lagoon, southern
   Uruguay
SO JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY
AB Paleolimnological data are presented on trophic development, climatic change and sea level variations in Rocha Lagoon, a 72 km(2) coastal lagoon in southern Uruguay. Using a sediment core that extended from 7000 to about 3700 yr BP, analyses of organic matter, carbonate, diatoms and chrysophyte cysts were used to track the early Holocene paleolimnological conditions of Rocha Lagoon. Opal phytoliths were also counted and identified, both temperature and humidity indices were calculated, and Opal Phytolith Association Zones (OPAZ) were identified by performing Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCO). Diatom Association Zones (DAZ) corresponding to marine/brackish and brackish/freshwater episodes were closely related to changes in trophic state. Those DAZ representing marine/brackish stages exhibited a lower trophic state than those DAZ dominated by brackish and freshwater diatoms. This highlights that during the first Holocene marine transgression, Rocha Lagoon did not continuously exhibit marine/brackish conditions as reported in previous papers. Instead, three brackish/freshwater episodes related to sea level variation and changes in humidity were identified. The first episode, by similar to 6000 yr BP, was related to sea level change as no significant changes in either temperature or humidity indices were observed. The second episode, between 5000 and 4400 yr BP, was related to both a sea level decrease and an increase in humidity, as a transition from humid to very humid climate was inferred. Concomitant decreases in salinity and increases in trophic state were also observed. The third episode, after similar to 4000 yr BP, was related to the end of the first Holocene regressive phase when sea level was slightly below present levels. Further decreases in salinity and increases in trophic state were detected. The paleoclimatic trends inferred in this study were in close agreement with other regional studies on climatic change, as cool temperatures were inferred. However, major changes in humidity were also detected. A humid to very humid climate was inferred for similar to 7000-4500 yr BP, but the occurrence of a semiarid/arid climate was inferred for similar to 4500-3700 yr BP. Our data suggest that during transgressive and regressive events there might be higher frequency and lower amplitude sea level oscillations that might lead to changes in salinity and trophic state of coastal aquatic systems. Such oscillations could only be tracked by high resolution analyses of sedimentary records and could be best interpreted with complementary data on paleoclimate. In addition, microfossils such as diatoms and opal phytoliths were shown to be very sensitive to such paleoenvironmental changes.

TI Sea level change due to oscillations in seafloor spreading rate
SO PHYSICS OF THE EARTH AND PLANETARY INTERIORS
AB We present a theory for divergent seafloor spreading which predicts that transient surges in spreading rate would cause geodynamic sea level rise rates approximately equal to the transient surge velocity at the ridge crest multiplied by the aspect ratio of the spreading plate, i.e., a surge velocity of 3 cm/yr, acting on a plate thickness 100 km, and width 3000 km would produce a geodynamic sea level rise rate of 1 mm/yr. This rate is geologically significant, and it is suggested that the calving of ice by flotation due to geodynamic sea level rise may feedback positively on a thermal sea level rise, and provide a mechanism whereby plate tectonics can actually drive climatic change. The theory depends on the assumption that plate motion is governed by thermally driven ridge push forces balanced by frictional drag at the base of the plate. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB New sedimentological determinations of the water depth and associated sea-level change of Midcontinent Pennsylvanian cyclothems shows that they accumulated in water depths ranging from as low as 32 m to as high as 160 m, depending on which model is used to establish the deepest water facies. These depth determinations also indicate that regardless of model, depth variations existed for different cyclothems both laterally and in time. Average water depth determinations and sea-level change for models of Heckel and Gerhard are 96.4 and 86.0 m, respectively.
   Analysis of tectonic subsidence permits calculation of the magnitude of tectonic processes and associated climatic effects, which controlled changes in sea level during deposition of Pennsylvanian cyclothems. Far-field tectonic effects in response to regional orogenic movements partially influenced Pennsylvanian sea-level change in the Midcontinent. Organization of Virgilian and Missourian mid-coninent cyclothems into four- to five-fold bundles suggests that sea-level changes in Midcontinent platform areas were influenced both by Milankovitch orbital parameters and longer-term climate change, whereas Desmoinesian sea-level change apparently was influenced more strongly by tectonic subsidence controlled by foreland-basin tectonism.
   Sea-level change associated with cyclothems in the Illinois basin, Central Appalachian basin, and the Asturias basin of Spain were controlled mostly by foreland basin subsidence and later strike-slip faulting. Sea-level change in the southeast Netherlands coal field was influenced primarily by strike-slip movements within the Hercynian tectonic orogenic zone.
   The magnitude of tectonically contributed change in sea level varied laterally. In the Midcontinent, tectonic subsidence accounts for approximately 5-20% of the total sea-level change in platform areas, and perhaps as much as 20% in basin depocenters, whereas in the Illinois basin, tectonic subsidence accounts for 90% of estimated sea-level change. The remaining change in sea level is controlled by both short-term glacial eustasy (Milankovitch orbital forcing; approximately up to 70% of sea-level change in the Midcontinent) and long-term climate change (approximately 15% of sea-level change in the Midcontinent). These findings suggest that away from orogenic belts, climatic change is the principal driving mechanism controlling sea level change, whereas within orogenic belts, climate becomes somewhat more subordinate as a driving mechanism for Pennsylvanian sea level change even though indicators of climatic change itself are preserved.
   Methods developed herein permit estimating magnitudes of both tectonic and glacio-eustatic components of sea-level change influencing Pennsylvanian cyclothem deposition, and may be applicable to other cyclic sequences.

SO ARABIAN ARCHAEOLOGY AND EPIGRAPHY
AB New results from fieldwork carried out on Failaka island testify to relative sea-level fluctuations during Late Pleistocene and Holocene. This study is based on analysing, sampling and dating geomorphological sea-level indicators, including beach ridges or beachrocks. The results have been compared and harmonised with recalibrated data from pre-existing literature to reconstruct the relative sea-level local chronology. The vertical displacement identified may have induced coastline mobility and significant environmental changes and impacted the human occupation in Failaka and along the coastal areas of Kuwait. Eventually, the results highlight the impact of large-scale crustal deformations on regional relative sea-level variations.

TI CYCLIC SEDIMENTATION AND CLIMATICALLY CAUSED SEA-LEVEL CHANGES IN THE
   LATE PALEOZOIC OF CENTRAL-EUROPE
SO GEOLOGISCHE RUNDSCHAU
AB Significant short-term fluctuations are characteristic of geological history since Precambrian times. Only the younger Quaternary climatic fluctuations are known in more detail as a result of a high grade time resolution. Climatic change can also be postulated with respect to older, cold periods during which polar inland ice sheets developed. From a discussion of endogene and exogene interpretations it is shown that global climatic changes, and the sea-level changes induced by them, as well as changes in the position and extent of climatic zones throughout the world provide a control mechanism for sedimentation which is consistent with cyclic sedimentation in Late Palaeozoic times, and also if the basin subsides non-cyclically. The model allows an explanation of the development of the Permo-Carboniferous sedimentary cycles without numerous short-term vertical oscillations of the earth's crust. In reality, exogene and endogene controls on sedimentation act together in great variety of combinations.

AB Studies estimate a sea level rise range of 0.5 to greater than 2 meters by the year 2100. A rise of this magnitude will significantly impact the socio-economic dimensions of coastal communities, which contain approximately 40 percent of the U.S. population and account for close to 50 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product. Data visualizations represent a useful tool for communities preparing for this environmental change. The singular capabilities of GIS for assimilating data allow users to link science to society in a geographic context. The results provide valuable insight for community planning efforts. Increasing the data visualizations from two dimensional (2D) to three dimensional (3D) will help communities better understand the impacts of sea level rise. Charleston, South Carolina is uniquely situated for a case study of this approach due to its location at the confluence of environmental change and cultural, historic, and economic influence. Predicted levels of sea level rise will disrupt this community and result in wide ranging impacts to the region's economic, employment, and infrastructure sectors. In this study data visualizations and 3D mapping are used to get a holistic understanding of the nexus of a changing climate and its effect on Charleston. The lessons learned here are transferable to other coastal cities and to government officials and planners interested in using exploratory visualizations to address sea level rise impacts. The results of this case study indicate that despite limitations in display and analysis, visualizations and 3D mapping are an engaging medium for shaping interdisciplinary spatial planning and revealing important connections between the environment and the community.

SO JOURNAL OF FIELD ARCHAEOLOGY
AB Holocene stratigraphy on southern Ambergris Caye, Belize, records a sea-level rise over the last 6100 years, accompanied by major environmental changes and coastal reconfiguration that affected habitation at the Marco Gonzalez Maya site. At the time of initial occupation of the site at about 2100 B. P., sea level was about 30 cm below present stand, and the area was a relatively large, hospitable island surrounded by shallow lagoons open to the sea. Sea level reached present stand at about 1000 B.P., and by about 750-500 B.P. shoaling sedimentation and extensive colonization by mangroves bad transformed the area into a dense swamp. Archaeological evidence suggests that population and construction decline, and virtual abandonment of the site by about the time of Spanish arrival in Belize about 1544 A. C., coincided with these adverse environmental changes. We suggest that sea-level rise and attendant environmental deterioration made the Marco Gonzalez site progressively more unsuitable for habitation, and forced the Maya to resettle to more favorable areas on Ambergris Caye.

AB Sea level is an important variable to study environmental change. GPS-IR has been proven to be an effective technique to estimate sea levels. As a main error source of the GPS-IR-derived sea levels, the tropospheric delay has rarely been studied. In this paper, using 10-day SNR observations recorded by a coastal GPS site SC02, we assessed the performances of two tropospheric models (i.e. the Bennett model and WN model) with different refraction assumptions. Our results show that the GPS-IR-derived sea levels have an RMSE of 16.9 cm compared with the tide gauge observations. Both models significantly reduced the error of estimated sea levels by similar to 30%, while the Bennett model performed slightly better than the WN model by similar to 5 mm. Moreover, the tropospheric height biases estimated by both models were proportional to the estimated height of the GPS receiver above the sea surface.

TI Late Quaternary climatic events and sea-level changes recorded by
   turbidite activity, Dakar Canyon, NW Africa
SO QUATERNARY RESEARCH
AB The relationship of sea-level changes and short-term climatic changes with turbidite deposition is poorly documented, although the mechanisms of gravity-driven sediment transport in Submarine canyons during sea-level changes have been reported from many regions. This Study focuses on the activity of the Dakar Canyon off southern Senegal in response to major glacial/interglacial sea-level shifts and variability in the NW-African continental climate. The sedimentary record front the canyon allows us to determine the timing of turbidite events and, on the basis of XRF-scanning element data, we have identified the climate signal at a sub-millennial time scale from the surrounding hemipelagic sediments. Over the late Quaternary the highest frequency in turbidite activity in the Dakar Canyon is confined to major climatic terminations when remobilisation of sediments from the shelf was triggered by the eustatic sea-level rise. However, episodic turbidite events coincide with the timing of Heinrich events in the North Atlantic. During these times continental climate has changed rapidly, with evidence for higher dust supply over NW Africa which has fed turbidity currents. Increased aridity and enhanced wind strength in the southern Saharan-Sahelian zone may have provided a source for this dust. (C) 2009 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Illustrative Analysis of Probabilistic Sea Level Rise Hazard
SO JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
AB Sea level rise results from several contributing physical processes, including ocean thermal expansion and glacier and ice sheet mass loss. Future projections of sea level remain highly uncertain due to several sources of aleatory and epistemic uncertainty. Quantifying different sources of sea level rise involves considering possible pathways of future radiative forcing and integrating models of different sea level rise processes. The probabilistic hazard analysis strategy has been proposed for combining sea level rise prediction models and climate forcing scenarios to examine sea level rise prediction uncertainty and the sources of this uncertainty. In this study we carry out an illustrative probabilistic sea level rise hazard analysis using ensembles of sea level rise predictions and emissions scenarios from the literature. This illustrative analysis allows us to estimate the probability that sea level rise will exceed a specified threshold at a given location and time and highlights how sea level rise uncertainty is sensitive to scenario inputs and sea level rise projection modeling choices. Probabilistic hazard is depicted for Earth using sea level rise hazard maps. We also demonstrate how hazard deaggregation can help us quantify the relative contributions of sea level rise sources, prediction models, and climate forcing scenarios to sea level rise hazard. The ice sheet contribution to sea level rise has a large impact on probabilistic projection of sea level rise due to the disagreements between current ice sheet models related to differences in modeling ice sheet instability.

Six episodes of reef growth are documented (Burdigalian to Messinian) in Neogene basins of the Betic Cordillera, which were located close to the margin of the global reef belt. The reefs are characterized by various zooxanthellate corals which decrease in diversity with time, and Halimeda; the youngest reefs of the latest Messinian are characterized by the dominance of the genus Porites. Late Miocene coral reefs and reef-rimmed platforms alternate over time with non-reefal carbonate ramps characterized by skeletal calcirudites or with gypsum such as that formed during the Messinian salinity crisis. The calcirudites lack reef corals, calcified green algae and extensive marine cement, but exhibit skeletal components described from both modern and fossil nontropical carbonates. These include bryozoans, mollusks, foraminifers, echinoderms and minor balanids, as well as coralline algae of a bryomol association. The presence of some larger foraminifers indicates high temperatures, close to the lower temperature threshold of the reef assemblage. Sea level lowstands and highstands are documented by wedges of bryomol carbonate and chlorozoan patch reefs or prograding platforms. Thus, temperate climate depositional modes correspond to relatively low sea levels, and warm-water modes to high sea levels. The Neogene infill of the Agua Amarga and Sorbas basins documents two of these cycles. Other climate/sea-level cycles (including Messinian gypsum in the cool water depositional mode) are well established in adjacent Neogene basins in southern Spain. This type of composite sequence seems to occur only along the margin of the global reef belt and indicates an oscillatory latitudinal movement of the margin, which is associated with global climatic change. The analysis of turnover in neritic depositional carbonate systems may therefore be considered a sensitive tool for reconstructing climatic change from the fossil record. However, warm-water modes and temperate-water modes of carbonate sedimentation and diagenesis differ significantly. For this reason the interpretation of composite system sequences by sequence stratigraphy requires an extended concept. The particular type of mixed bryomol-chlorozoan depositional sequence also bears some potential for drowning, because sea level rise may be faster than the net production rate of temperate carbonate systems.

AB Trace elements and stable isotopes in bulk rocks and foraminifera, bulk rock and clay mineral compositions, are used as palaeoproxies to evaluate sea level fluctuations, climatic changes and variations in primary productivity across the K-T transition at Elles 11 in Tunisia from I m (similar to 33 kyr) below to I m (similar to 70 kyr) above the K-T boundary. Results on clay minerals, major and trace elements, stable isotopes in bulk rock samples (e.g. Ca, Cu, Zn, Rb, Sr, Zr, Ba, delta(13)C and delta(18)O), and in foraminifera (Sr/Ca, delta(13)C, delta(18)O) indicate that the latest Maastrichtian (last similar to 33 kyr) in Tunisia was marked by a relatively warm, but humid climate and a rising sea level. The transgressive surface is marked by deposition of a foraminiferal packstone just below the K-T boundary followed by maximum flooding across the K-T boundary (red layer and black clay layer). Humid warm conditions accompanied the maximum flooding, along with increased total organic carbon values and rapidly decreasing primary productivity. At the K-T boundary, an impact event (Ir anomaly, Ni-rich spinels, spherules) exacerbated already stressed environmental conditions leading to the mass extinction of tropical planktic foraminifera. Increasingly more humid conditions prevailed within the lowermost Danian Zone PO (similar to 50 kyr) culminating in a sea level lowstand near the top of PO. A slow recovery of the ecosystem in Zone P1a coincided with arising sea level and gradually less humid climatic conditions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Holocene sea level fluctuations and coastal evolution in the central
   Algarve (southern Portugal)
SO MARINE GEOLOGY
AB In Armacao de Pera Bay, southern Portugal, environmental changes during the Holocene can be interpreted based on the morphological and sedimentological similarities between older geomorphic features (cemented beach and dune rocks) and present coastal features. Using knowledge of the present beach and dune processes, we propose a two-step model for the evolution of Armacao de Pera Bay. First, during the rapid sea level rise between about 8 800 and 6 600 yr cal BP, the bay changed from a positive to a negative budget littoral cell and transgressive dunes formed, favoured by drought conditions. At about 5 000 yr cal BP, during a sea level maximum, beach width was less than the critical fetch and dunes stabilized and under-went cementation during the wetter Atlantic climatic event. The second phase of dune accumulation started at about 3 200 yr cal BP, due to a regression of sea level during which the bay changed back to a positive budget littoral cell in which beach width was greater than the critical fetch. Currently, the beach width is less than the critical fetch, dunes are inactive, and the sedimentary budget is negative due to sediment storage in local river systems. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI Regional, Holocene records of the human dimension of global change:
   Sea-level and land-use change in prehistoric Mexico
SO GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
AB Regional, Holocene records hold particular relevance for understanding the reciprocal nature of global environmental change and one of its major human dimensions: ''sustainable agriculture'', i.e., food production strategies which entail fewer causes of and are less susceptible to environmental change. In an epoch of accelerating anthropogenic transformation, those records reveal the protracted regional causes and consequences of change (often agricultural) in the global system as well as informing models of prehistoric, intensive agriculture which, because of long tenures and high productivities, suggest strategies for sustainable agricultural in the present. This study employs physiographic analysis and the palynological, geochemical record from cores of basin fill to understand the reciprocal relation between environmental and land-use change in the Gulf of Mexico tropical lowland, focusing on a coastal basin sensitive to sea-level change and containing vestiges of prehistoric settlement and wetland agriculture. Fossil pollen reveals that the debut of maize cultivation in the Laguna Catarina watershed dates to ca. 4100 BC, predating the earliest evidence for that cultivar anywhere else in the lowlands of Middle America. Such an early date for a cultivar so central to Neotropical agroecology and environmental change, suggests the urgency of further research in the study region. Moreover, the longest period of continuous agriculture in the basin lasted nearly three millennia (ca. 2400 BC-AD 550) despite eustatic sea-level rise. Geochemical fluxes reveal the reciprocity between land-use and environmental change: slope destabilization, basin aggradation, and eutrophication. The consequent theoretical implications pertain to both applied and basic research. Redeploying ancient agroecologies in dynamic environments necessitates reconstructing the changing operational contexts of putative high productivity and sustainability. Adjusting land use in the face of global warming and eustatic sea-level rise necessitates understanding sediment influxes to coastal basins which, in turn, depend on vegetation, climate, and land use in watersheds.

TI Understanding the demographic implications of climate change: estimates
   of localized population predictions under future scenarios of sea-level
   rise
SO POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Significant advances have been made to understand the interrelationship between humans and the environment in recent years, yet research has not produced useful localized estimates that link population forecasts to environmental change. Coarse, static population estimates that have little information on projected growth or spatial variability mask substantial impacts of environmental change on especially vulnerable populations. We estimate that 20 million people in the United States will be affected by sea-level rise by 2030 in selected regions that represent a range of sociodemographic characteristics and corresponding risks of vulnerability. Our results show that the impact of sea-level rise extends beyond the directly impacted counties due to migration networks that link inland and coastal areas and their populations. Substantial rates of population growth and migration are serious considerations for developing mitigation, adaptation, and planning strategies, and for future research on the social, demographic, and political dimensions of climate change.

TI Stepped Holocene sea-level rise and its influence on sedimentation in a
   large marine embayment: Maputo Bay, Mozambique
SO ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
AB The sedimentary record in large marine embayments holds important information on Holocene environmental and sea-level changes. This paper investigates the evolution of a large subtropical marine embayment, Maputo Bay, in southern Mozambique. Using a combination of sediment cores, stable isotope data, seismic reflection profiling and C-14 dating, we show complex back-barrier changes during the Holocene and link these to stepped rises in sea level. Our data reveal a sea-level "slowstand" followed by an abrupt rise that we correlate with the 8.2 ka global rise in sea level. Sedimentological, isotope and seismic evidence point to a subsequent slowstand interspersed by two punctuated rises in sea level that formed clear tidal ravinement surfaces. Sedimentary changes in the embayment are primarily forced by sea-level change, whereby tidal ravinement surfaces sandwich normal regressive packages formed via marginal progradation and shallowing of the system during "slow-" or still-stands. Large marine embayment systems hold great potential in unravelling relative sea-level change. Axiomatically, this reduces their utility as archives of climate-change. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
AB Particle size, organic content, loss on ignition (LOI), geochemistry, radiocarbon and Cs-137 analyses were carried out on paired cores taken from Wainui, Totaranui and Awaroa Inlets, Abel Tasman National Park. A 1700 year record of long- and short-term environmental changes was produced representing a sedimentary and geochemical sequence from tidal Bat to mature salt marsh. The sequence is punctuated by a series of short-term environmental changes, namely tsunami, establishment of salt marsh, and European settlement. Long-term environmental changes include fluctuating accretion rates and relative sea level rise. Tsunami "signatures" include: (i) a peak in fines, (ii) contemporaneous or "delayed" peak in organic content and/or LOI, (iii) contemporaneous peaks in Fe and/or S, (iv) dilution of anthropogenic contaminants, and (v) visible change in the sediments. Ruptures of the Wellington and West Wairarapa Faults are considered to be the tsunamigenic sources. Pre-European sediment accretion rates in Abel Tasman National Park range from 0.5 to 1.7 mm/a, with post-European settlement rates increasing to 1.6-2.7 mm/a. In the past 30 years, rates have increased to 2.3-3.3 mm/a. The component of relative sea level rise is estimated to be about 1.3-2.2 mm/a which compares favourably with the nearest tidal records from Wellington. (C) 1999 INQUA/Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Pollen Analysis at Loc. Seonggeon and Paleo-environmental Changes on the
   Royal District in Gyeongju
SO JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF KOREA
AB Paleo-environmental changes during the approximately 4,000 yr BP to present on the Royal District in Gyeongju are examined using the geomorphic characteristics and results of pollen analysis. The Gyeongju alluvial fans had provided the stable living spaces to the prehistoric and ancient people. At 4,000-3,000 yr BP, the Alnus forest had flourished at the toe areas of Gyeongju alluvial fans met Hyeongsan-River due to very wet conditions. At approximately 3,500 yr BP, Gramineae and Artemisia had increased, and Ulmus/Zelkova and Rhus might be planted in the lower reach of Nam-River. The increases of non-arboreal pollen (NAP) such as Gramineae, Artemisia and Humulus are also thought as the influences of human. At 3,000-2,000 yr BP, due to the lowering of water table by falling of the sea level, the wetlands in the fans had emerged rapidly and then the toe areas might have become the stable spaces with less risks of flooding. Also, the agricultural activities had begun regularly and the most Alnus forest had cut down for the natural and artificial environmental changes. Moreover, because the Inyoingsaji areas in the lower reach of Nam-River show the dominances of Ulmus/Zelkova and Rhus through the whole periods, and the NAP such as Gramineae,\ Artemisia, Humulus, and Chenopodiaceae indicate the high appearance rates, the human activities including agricultures are well reflected in the vegetation compositions. After approximately 2,000 yr BP, the deforestation and lowland had been emerged intensified with the dominances of Pinus and dramatic decreases of Alnus, Quercus and Ulmus/Zelkova. And more active agricultures are recognized in the vegetation compositions.

   Northland: Implications for Holocene sea level
SO JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF NEW ZEALAND
AB An infilled wetland located behind coastal dunes in north-east Northland is used to reconstruct a local history of environmental change spanning early Holocene (c. 7000 yr BP) to modem time. Proxy indicators (sediment texture, diatoms and pollen) provide evidence for a transition from marginal marine- to brackish- to freshwater-conditions in the wetland. Radiocarbon ages constrain the chronology of this succession to 7880-7430 cal. yr BP for the early period of marine conditions, 3570-3210 cal. yr BP for the latter brackish phase and 1060-800 cal. yr BP for the change to freshwater conditions. Within this succession, the diatom record preserves a strong brackish signal at core depths above the limit of the modem tidal range. This is presented as preliminary evidence for a mid-Holocene sea level highstand for northern New Zealand of approximately 1.2 m above present mean sea level.

TI Coastal wetlands reveal a non-synchronous island response to sea-level
   change and a palaeostorm record from 5.5 kyr to present
SO HOLOCENE
AB Here, we describe environmental change on Lord Howe Island (LHI; 31 degrees 30'S, 159 degrees 05'E) over the last 5500 cal. BP, derived from the analysis of the accumulating sediments in four coastal wetlands. Grain-size analyses, loss on ignition (LOI) and micrometre-resolution x-ray fluorescence (XRF) geochemical data were combined with 10 accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C-14 dates to determine a chronology of environmental change. Sedimentary coastal features were initiated on the drowned LHI basalt coastline after similar to 4500 cal. BP, which was followed by gradual development of wetland environments from 4200 cal. BP to present. Within this period, a series of high-intensity storm events are recorded, perhaps related to low-pressure systems, including cyclones and East Coast Low (ECL) events. A lack of synchronicity between the studied sites resulted from their position in the landscape relative to the coast, features within the lagoon and greater sediment availability after 2800 cal. BP as sediment filled sinks in the lagoon floor. Increasing westerly wind strength from 600 cal. BP also combined with late-Holocene falling sea levels and lagoon infilling to facilitate the rapid growth of the coastal plain at similar to 500 cal. BP. The coastal wetlands of LHI preserve a record of rapid changes superimposed over more gradual environmental change since the mid-Holocene. The findings of this study further the understanding of the development of this 'World Heritage Area' as well as provide an increased understanding of how small oceanic islands respond to rising sea levels.

TI Paleoenvironmental reconstruction of Holocene coastal deposits from the
   Southeastern Buenos Aires Province, Argentina
SO JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY
AB An estuarine sequence outcropping at La Ballenera Creek (Buenos Aires Province), dated between 6,800 and 4,100 C-14 years BP, was investigated for diatoms and molluscs. The sea level history along the Buenos Aires coastline has been reconstructed from discrete beach ridge sequences along low-lying plains. The La Ballenera profile is located on a cliff coast where a sequence recorded environmental changes. Fifty-eight diatom species were grouped based on their salinity and life form characteristics. Cluster analysis allowed the division of the sequence into three diatom zones. Mollusc tolerances were also used to discern the environmental changes induced by sea-level fluctuations. The base of the sequence recorded the initiation of the marine influence about 6,790-6,200 years ago. Diatom assemblages consist of brackish-freshwater tychoplankton accompanied by brackish benthic diatoms. Among the molluscs, the freshwater-brackish species Heleobia parchappii dominates. Between 6,200 and ca. 4,800 C-14 years BP, an estuarine lagoon environment is indicated by benthic and epiphytic marine-brackish diatoms, as well as by the estuarine snail Heleobia australis. After 4,800 14C years BP, the diatom assemblages and the relative abundance of freshwater molluscs indicate a marshy environment with lower salinity content. The La Ballenera records the salinity changes that affect an estuary that infilled during the 2,700 years after the maximum sea level reached in mid-latitudes of South America.

SO ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB We investigated the population dynamics of a highly clonal marine angiosperm, Cymodocea nodosa, in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, to identify the historical dynamics, demography, and connectivity of the species in the area. Eighteen microsatellite loci were used in conjunction with coalescent methods to investigate the genetic structure and demographic history of C. nodosa meadows. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) modeling was used to examine the pattern of divergence over time in the context of environmental change over the course of the Quaternary period. ABC analysis revealed an initial split of the C. nodosa populations between the north-western, northern, and north-eastern Aegean Sea during the Pleistocene epoch, followed by a more recent divergence of the north-western population and the central-western part of the Aegean Sea. According to the results, the most parsimonious historical scenario is that of a pervasive genetic signature of the effects of the drop in sea level during the Pleistocene epoch. This scenario supports the isolation of the north-western, north, and north-eastern area, and the subsequent recolonization after post-glaciation sea level rise that may explain the north-western differentiation as well present-day detected dispersion of C. nodosa.

TI High-Resolution Multiproxy Record of Environmental Changes and
   Anthropogenic Activities at Unguja Ukuu, Zanzibar, Tanzania during the
   Last 5000 Years
SO QUATERNARY
AB A high-resolution multiproxy sedimentary record comprising pollen, charcoal, trace element, stratigraphy and particle size data is used to reveal environmental changes from the mangrove ecosystem at Unguja Ukuu, Zanzibar, Tanzania, over the last 5000 years. Historical human-environment interactions over the last millennia are explored by a comparison of the stratigraphic and archaeological data. The area was characterised by a mixture of mangrove forest and beaches, indicating a low level of tidal inundation to at least 3300 BCE. From 2750 BCE, mangrove forest expanded as the area experienced sea-level rise. Further sea-level rise is recorded between 600 and 1100 CE, indicated by the pollen record, particle size analysis and the presence of shell fragments. After 1100 CE, mangrove forest decreased with back mangrove species increasing, indicating a falling sea level. Cocos nucifera decreased after 1900 CE, which reflects a recent sea-level rise and possibly a phase of exploitation. Cereal pollen shows a high presence at around 1500 CE, which coincided with the arrival of the Portuguese on Zanzibar and the transition to Omani colonisation. The sedimentation rate in the core top indicates that mangroves in Unguja Ukuu cannot keep pace with the current rate of sea-level rise.

TI Coral Reef Island Initiation and Development Under Higher Than Present
   Sea Levels
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Coral reef islands are considered to be among the most vulnerable environments to future sea level rise. However, emerging data suggest that different island types, in contrasting locations, have formed under different conditions in relation to past sea level. Uniform assumptions about reef island futures under sea level rise may thus be inappropriate. Using chronostratigraphic analysis from atoll rim islands (sand- and gravel-based) in the southern Maldives, we show that while island building initiated at different times around the atoll (similar to 2,800 and similar to 4,200 calibrated years before present at windward and leeward rim sites, respectively), higher than present sea levels and associated high-energy wave events were actually critical to island initiation. Findings thus suggest that projected sea level rise and increases in the magnitude of distal high-energy wave events could reactivate this process regime, which, if there is an appropriate sediment supply, may facilitate further vertical reef island building.
   Plain Language Summary The habitability of reef island nations under climate change is a debated and controversial subject. Improving understanding of reef island responses to past environmental change provides important insights into how islands may respond to future environmental change. It is typically assumed that all reef islands will respond to environmental change in the same manner, but such assumptions fail to acknowledge that reef islands are diverse landforms that have formed under different sea level histories and across a range of settings. Here we reconstruct reef island evolution in two contrasting settings (in terms of exposure to open ocean swell) in the southern Maldives. Important differences in island development are evident between these settings in the timings, sedimentology, and modes of island building, even at local scales. This implies that island responses to climate change may be equally diverse and site-specific. We present evidence that island initiation was associated with higher than present sea levels and high-energy wave events. Projected increases in sea level and the magnitude of such high-energy wave events could therefore recreate the environmental conditions under which island formation occurred. If there is a suitable sediment supply, this could result in vertical island-building, which may enhance reef island future resilience.

TI Human adaptation to changing coastal landscapes in the Eastern Adriatic:
   Evidence from Vela Spila cave, Croatia
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB In this paper new palaeogeographic and archaeological data from the prehistoric cave Vela Spila on the island of Korcula in Croatia are combined with new realizations of two glacial isostatic adjustment models in order to present relative sea-level change scenarios confronting the inhabitants of the cave at different time slices and to show how they experienced and adapted to sea-level and climate change from the Late Pleistocene through the Holocene. Our results show that from the Late Upper Palaeolithic until the Mesolithic, humans in the study area would have experienced tens of metres of sea-level rise, at rates in some cases up to 12 mm per year, and, owing to the relatively flat morphology of the now submerged plains, hundreds of meters of horizontal coastline change in the plains to the north and south of the island. This evidence supports the hypothesis that the rapid loss of these plains likely contributed to the human abandonment of the cave after the Palaeolithic for about five thousand years, followed by significant changes in lifestyle and diet in the Mesolithic. Our results have important implications for the study of how past human groups, especially in vulnerable coastal areas, were affected by sea level, climate, and other environmental changes. Vela Spila represents a case study of how changing environment and rising seas can force significant alterations in human societies, even when there is no risk of inundation to settlement sites.

TI System responses to Holocene relative sea-level rise and sediment supply
   in a macrotidal estuary
SO HOLOCENE
AB Estuaries are at the interface of marine and terrestrial systems and as such, are subject to environmental change arising from multiple driving mechanisms, with the interplay between the dominant controls varying spatially and temporally. Relative sea-level (RSL) change and sediment supply can play a significant role in driving environmental change. This study examines the relative influence of these drivers during the Holocene. Biostratigraphic records and RSL data are presented from two locations in the inner portion and upper reaches of the macrotidal Humber Estuary, eastern England. The results provide a new terrestrial limiting point and six sea-level index points, two of which at c. 1500 cal years BP provide the youngest sea-level index points for the inner estuary. An early-mid Holocene tidal lagoon system, that lacks modern equivalent, is recorded at one site. The results indicate a shift in the dominance of RSL rise driving the early Holocene creation of wetlands, to sediment supply dominating changes in the mid-late Holocene against the backdrop of a reduced rate of RSL rise, with a submergence of wetlands evident after c. 4000 cal years BP. The persistence of fen carr evident between c. 6800 and 5500 cal years BP suggests stability and resilience of the peatland system to continuing RSL rise. As rates of contemporary RSL rise increase, combined with climate and human impacts on the landscape, the drivers of change in these type of estuary systems will shift, with the records providing analogues of potential system responses that can help inform coastal management strategies.

TI A 33,000-year paleohydrological record from Sanamere Lagoon,
   north-eastern tropical savannas of Australia
SO QUATERNARY RESEARCH
AB There are very few records of past terrestrial environmental change of any time period for the Australian tropical savannas. Here we document the hydrological development of Sanamere Lagoon, north Queensland, from a 1.72 m sediment sequence with a basal age of ca. 33 ka. We measure a variety of proxies reflecting environmental change within and around the lagoon, including grain size, elemental and diatom abundance, and carbon and nitrogen isotope composition. By integrating the interpretation of multiple proxies, we show that regional climatic events, such as the reactivation of the monsoon at 15 ka and sea-level rise ending at 7 ka, are reflected in local ecosystem change and a diversity of biogeochemical responses in Sanamere Lagoon. This record makes a significant contribution to the development of records of environmental change from an under-studied region in tropical Australia through the Holocene to the LGM and beyond-a step towards enabling a more detailed understanding of regional monsoon (paleo)dynamics. In particular, this study highlights nuances in the effect of Indonesian-Australian Summer monsoon dynamics in a region less affected by sea level and continental shelf drowning complexities.

TI Complex eco-evolutionary responses of a foundational coastal marsh plant
   to global change
SO NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB Predicting the fate of coastal marshes requires understanding how plants respond to rapid environmental change. Environmental change can elicit shifts in trait variation attributable to phenotypic plasticity and act as selective agents to shift trait means, resulting in rapid evolution. Comparably, less is known about the potential for responses to reflect the evolution of trait plasticity.Here, we assessed the relative magnitude of eco-evolutionary responses to interacting global change factors using a multifactorial experiment. We exposed replicates of 32 Schoenoplectus americanus genotypes 'resurrected' from century-long, soil-stored seed banks to ambient or elevated CO2, varying levels of inundation, and the presence of a competing marsh grass, across two sites with different salinities.Comparisons of responses to global change factors among age cohorts and across provenances indicated that plasticity has evolved in five of the seven traits measured. Accounting for evolutionary factors (i.e. evolution and sources of heritable variation) in statistical models explained an additional 9-31% of trait variation.Our findings indicate that evolutionary factors mediate ecological responses to environmental change. The magnitude of evolutionary change in plant traits over the last century suggests that evolution could play a role in pacing future ecosystem response to environmental change.

AB The study of the diversification shallow-sea benthos as well as its coupled relationship to changes in sea level is important for revealing the effect of global environmental changes on biological evolution and for discovering the coevolution of life and environment during geological time. This paper makes a detailed analysis of the diversification of fusulinid fauna from the Dian-qian-gui Basin during the early to middle Permian. It also compares the diversification of fusulinids with relative sea-level changes over that interval. The results show that during the Asselian to Sakmarian stages of the early Permian, when relative sea level in the Dian-qian-gui district slowly rose, the number of fusulinid species increased rapidly. In contrast, during the Wordian Stage when sea level changed frequently, the number of fusulinid genera increased rapidly.

TI Holocene environmental change and its impacts on human settlement in the
   Shanghai Area, East China
SO CATENA
AB Archaeological excavations and environmental archaeological studies over many years in the Shanghai Area have provided a wealth of information for Holocene environmental changes, growth and decline of human settlements and man-land interaction. Distribution of archaeological sites between 7000 and 3000 cal. yr BP indicates a regression process and a southward advance of the coastline in the study area. Temporal and spatial analyses of C-14 dates for archaeological sites, shell ridges, buried trees, and peat suggest that Holocene environmental changes may well have been a major cause of the rise and fall of human settlements and their civilization. A relative sea-level curve of the Shanghai Area was derived from dated shell ridges and peat, and correlates well with the reconstructed sea-level curves of the Yangtze Delta and East China. The development of human settlements was interrupted at least four times in the Shanghai Area, matching four periods of high sea-level, peat accumulation, and increase in shell ridges, after which Neolithic communities moved onto the plain and reclaimed their lowlands for rice cultivation. The Chenier Ridges played an important role in sheltering the Neolithic settlers. The collapse of Liangzhu Culture about 4000 cal. yr BP was followed by the less-developed Maqiao Culture. These studies suggest that extreme environmental and hydrological conditions such as terrestrial inundation caused by sea-level rise and heavy rainfall, contributed to the cessation of paddy exploitation and to the social stress that led to the Liangzhu Culture demise.

TI Simulation of Environmental Changes Consdering Sea-level Rise Near a
   Mega-scale Coastal Dike (Saemangeum [SMG] Dike, Korea)
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB The construction of one of the biggest coastal dikes in Korea, the 33-km long Saemangeum (SMG) dike, was completed in 2006. Coastal environmental changes resulted in tidal asymmetry in the near field (i.e., adjacent to the dike) and the far field (i.e., up to opposite part of the Yellow Sea). Coastal hydrodynamic variations and engineering developments for gate operations (to maintain inner reservoir water quality (WQ) standards) rapidly alter coastal environments. The sea level is expected to rise by 80 cm by the end of this century, and an additional 21.4 cm of seasonal local summer sea level jump will serve as a reversing factor of WQ. This study applied the ADCIRC and EFDC models to simulate regional and local hydrodynamic and WQ changes. The far-field impacts of the SMG will occur continuously till year 2100 along the Chinese coast with M-2 mordulation. The target water management level was set to elevation with respect to mean sea level (EL) as -1.5 m, which is very limited in terms of free discharge time for gate operation. According to the tidal excursion and residence time simulations, only 14% of gate operations in a month will be possible compared to the existing all-year-round condition, and only 4% will be exchangeable in summer. It is found that SMG yields alteration of tidal hydrodynamics showing overall de-amplification of similar to 10 cm in the Yellow Sea (YS), especially along the west coast of Korea (WCK), as well as a slight amplification of similar to 10 cm on the eastern coast of China. In addition, reducing the time for inner discharge because of the rising outer sea level directly influences WQ both in the areas near the gates and the inner water due to the increased residence time. Intensive study including long-term variations in tidal asymmetry and associated morphologies is needed to manage the hydrodynamic and/or WQ changes associated with such mega-scale coastal constructions.

SP IUGG
AB In order to infer past climatic change in central Japan, we measured temperatures in a borehole at the Karasuma site, on the southeastern coast of Lake Biwa, and reconstructed sediment surface temperature history during the last 3000 years. The reconstructed temperature history shows apparent Medieval Warm Period, Little Ice Age, and contemporary temperature warming, However, the large amplitude of the temperature changes up to 4-5 K cannot be explained by past climatic change only, suggesting that there was some other cause of the larger amplitude temperature changes. The onsets of temperature decrease in the late 12th century A.D. and temperature increase in the mid 17th century A.D. appear to coincide with occurrences of two destructive earthquakes (1185 and 1662 A.D.) that caused water level changes of Lake Biwa. It suggests that the reconstructed sediment surface temperature history reflects the environmental change due to tectonically induced water level changes of the lake. If the annual mean of the ground surface temperature was higher than that of the bottom water temperature in a shallow part of the lake, which is consistent with the present-day data, the large amplitude of the sediment surface temperature change may be attributed to a combined effect of past climatic and environmental changes. Thus, we suggest that the borehole temperature at the Karasuma site preserves information not only on past climate changes but also on environmental changes due to tectonically induced water level changes.

TI Is sea level rise accelerating in the Chesapeake Bay? A demonstration of
   a novel new approach for analyzing sea level data
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Sea level data from the Chesapeake Bay are used to test a novel new analysis method for studies of sea level rise (SLR). The method, based on Empirical Mode Decomposition and Hilbert-Huang Transformation, separates the sea level trend from other oscillating modes and reveals how the mean sea level changes over time. Bootstrap calculations test the robustness of the method and provide confidence levels. The analysis shows that rates of SLR have increased from similar to 1-3 mm y(-1) in the 1930s to similar to 4-10 mm y(-1) in 2011, an acceleration of similar to 0.05-0.10 mm y(-2) that is larger than most previous studies, but comparable to recent findings by Sallenger and collaborators. While land subsidence increases SLR rates in the bay relative to global SLR, the acceleration results support Sallenger et al.'s proposition that an additional contribution to SLR from climatic changes in ocean circulation is affecting the region.

TI Probabilistic Sea Level Rise Hazard Analysis Based on the Current
   Generation of Data and Protocols
SO JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING
AB Sea level rise, as a result of climate change, is expected to drive coastal hazards that could bring significant damages to coastal regions in the future. However, high uncertainties remain in the projections of sea level rise from different climate scenarios and sea level rise prediction models. Quantification and integration of these uncertainties are essential to better inform coastal planning and decision making for climate adaptation, critical for infrastructure sustainability and resilience. This paper advances knowledge cross-cutting structural engineering and climate change in the face of multihazards via a novel framework termed the Probabilistic Sea Level Rise Hazard Analysis (PSLRHA). This study uses the current generation of models and protocols from the climate science research community to better portray the future climate and project sea level rise. The aggregation process produces the probability of exceeding a specific sea level rise threshold at a certain location and facilitates the creation of the global sea level rise hazard map. The relative importance of each climate scenario and sea level rise contributing models are demonstrated via the deaggregation process. We identify the models that have most contribution to extreme sea level rise thresholds, with large fluctuations in the high thresholds among ice sheet models. Finally, we show the practical implementation of PSLRHA results via compound flooding analyses using Houston as an illustrative example.

TI On the geophysical processes impacting palaeo-sea-level observations
SO GEOSCIENCE LETTERS
AB Past sea-level change represents the large-scale state of global climate, reflecting the waxing and waning of global ice sheets and the corresponding effect on ocean volume. Recent developments in sampling and analytical methods enable us to more precisely reconstruct past sea-level changes using geological indicators dated by radiometric methods. However, ice-volume changes alone cannot wholly account for these observations of local, relative sea-level change because of various geophysical factors including glacio-hydro-isostatic adjustments (GIA). The mechanisms behind GIA cannot be ignored when reconstructing global ice volume, yet they remain poorly understood within the general sea-level community. In this paper, various geophysical factors affecting sea-level observations are discussed and the details and impacts of these processes on estimates of past ice volumes are introduced.

TI Climate change in the Horn of Africa: causations for violent extremism
SO BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL AGGRESSION
AB Scientific evidence suggests our planet is experiencing climatic changes: increases in regional temperatures, variations in seasonal precipitation, stronger storms, sea level rise, and decreases in water availability. Consequently, these climatic changes have resulted in elevated rates of human migration, food insecurities, increased socioeconomic inequalities, civil conflict, and acts of terrorism. The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of climate change and its relationship to reported acts of terrorism in Somalia. Using a negative binomial regression model, various variables related to climate change were evaluated from 1991 to 2019. This study identified that annual increases in charcoal production, greenhouse gas emissions, and oil consumption were associated with reported terrorism attacks. Additionally, annual decreases in mean precipitation were also shown to be related to acts of terrorism. Controlling for the gross domestic product growth rate, the population growth rate, and state weakness, this study also determined that annual decreases in state weakness as well as the gross domestic product growth rate were also associated with reported terrorism incidents. Policy implications will be discussed.

TI Predicting the effects of sea level rise on salt marsh plant
   communities: does vegetation age matter more than sea level?
SO PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
CT Annual Meeting on Plant Ecology and Evolution (AMPEE2)
CY NOV 14, 2014
CL Louvain Neuve, BELGIUM
AB Background and aims - Salt marsh plant communities will be among the first to be exposed to the predicted increase in sea level and to the associated environmental changes. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the influence of three major environmental variables (elevation above sea level, distance from the sea, vegetation age) on vegetation diversity in salt marshes and to predict vegetation changes in the year 2100 according to different scenarios of sea level rise.
   Methods - Plant communities were sampled in 1257 plots of 1 m(2) distributed along transects randomly positioned perpendicular to the shoreline in the Bay of Somme (Picardy, France). Digital elevation model data were used to determine the plot elevation and the distance between the plots and the shoreline. Three centuries of changes in the vegetation cover were reconstructed using historical maps and aerial photographs to estimate the vegetation age. We investigated the relationships between elevation above sea level, distance from the sea, vegetation age and vegetation richness and composition using mixed models. Predictive models of species richness and cover of dominant halophytes were built using the parameter estimates of the previous mixed models and the projections of the explanatory variables in 2100 according to the different sea level scenarios from +0.5 m to +2.5 m.
   Key results - Mixed models showed that species richness mainly increased with vegetation age. The halophytes exhibited contrasting patterns along elevation and age gradients. Sedimentation rates may counteract the sea level rise until the latter reaches a critical rate that drowns the marsh vegetation.
   Conclusions - Because the proportions of ancient vegetation will be higher in the bay, mean plant species richness may be higher in predicted communities in 2100 than in recently sampled communities.

TI Environmental changes related to the Holocene sea-level transgression
   and successive highstand (7-5.5 Kyr) at the NE coastal plain of Buenos
   Aires (Argentina)
SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
AB We present a high resolution multi-proxy study about environmental changes that occurred during the Holocene sea-level transgression and successive highstand (7-5.5 Kyr) in the central zone of Bahia Samborombon (similar to 35.6 degrees S), Argentina. This study, one of the first in the area that integrates geomorphological and paleontological proxy data (pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, foraminifera and mollusk shells), and focusing on a short time interval, offers the advantage of recognizing environmental and vegetation changes in a more comprehensive way. The aim of this work is to reconstruct the salt marsh vegetation history and paleoenvironmental changes; and to develop a model of the geomorphological evolution during the mid-Holocene sea-level transgressive phase. Between 6700 cal yr BP and 6500 cal yr BP, several rapid environmental changes took place. Those changes affected vegetation and microfauna, as well as the geomorphological features. During this period, middle to high salt marsh vegetation developed in an extensive and open tidal plain, where wide and long paleo tidal channels were flowing. Between 6500 and 6220 cal yr BP, the salt marsh transitioned into low salt marsh one as a response to a continued rise in sea level, resulting in the landward transgression of the coastline. The relative sea level reached the highstand between 6220 and 5500 cal yr BP and, consequently, extensive inundation of the coastal plain took place, except for the elevated areas such lunettes and ridges. After 5500 cal yr BP, seaward prograding beach and sand ridges formed in response to the onset of a regressive phase. Since then, the ancient tidal plain, extending similar to 10 km from the present coastline, has been subjected to aeolian and pedogenetic processes.

AB The human influence in geomorphology has a long history, and major contributions have, for example, been made by Shaler, McGee, Gilbert and Marsh. However, in the last two decades concern with global environmental change has brought the role of anthropogeomorphology into sharper focus. Global warming, if it occurs, will have important implications for many geomorphological processes and phenomena as a result of the direct effects of warming, as a consequence of other related climatic changes (e.g. precipitation change) and as a result of climatically moderated changes in major geomorphologically significant variables (e.g. vegetation cover). Large uncertainties exist with respect to such matters as hydrological response, the frequency of tropical cyclones, the speed and degree of permafrost degradation, the response of glaciers and ice caps, the extent of sea level rise, the reaction of beaches to rising sea levels, and the state of wetlands, deltas and coral reefs. Other human activities may serve to compound the effects of global warming on geomorphological processes. Given the uncertainties of so many of the environmental changes, there is a great need to obtain a greater understanding of the rates and mechanisms of landform response. Geomorphologists need, inter alia, to establish long-term study sites that will generate base-line data, to monitor the location and rate of change using sequential cartographic and remote sensing materials, to determine information on natural background levels and long-term trends by means of data gained from cores, to gain a more profound understanding of the operation of geomorphological systems particularly with regard to sensitivities and thresholds, and to appreciate the consequences of deliberate manipulation of environmental systems by humans.

TI Mid-Holocene climate and land-sea interaction along the southern coast
   of Saurashtra, western India
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
AB The relict mudflat from the southern Saurashtra coast of Gujarat was investigated using geochemical and palynological analyses supported by radiocarbon dating to understand whether climate fluctuations and sea-level operated in tandem during mid-Holocene. The study revealed that the Saurashtra coast experienced relatively wet climatic conditions with simultaneous occurrence of marginally high sea-level between 4710 and 2825 cal yr BP. Subsequently, a gradual onset of aridity and lowering of the sea-level was observed between 2825 and 1835 cal yr BP, and further a slight decrease in aridity is observed after 1835 cal yr BP. The present day coastal configuration was probably achieved after around 1500 cal yr BP. Considering the tectonic instability of Saurashtra coast (land level changes), the effective mid-Holocene sea-level was estimated to be similar to 1 m higher than the present. The study demonstrates that sea-level changes, climate variability and land-level changes were coupled during the mid-Holocene. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO ALCHERINGA
AB A systematic revision of the Mactracea, Tellinacea and Myacea (Mactra isabelleana, Raeta plicatella, Macoma uruguayensis, Abra aequalis, Tagelus plebeius, Corbula patagonica and Erodona mactroides) recorded from marine taphocoenoses (Las Escobas Formation; +4.5-2.5 m above m.s.l., mid-Holocene transgression, c.7,000-2,500 C-14 ybp) distributed along 400 km in the coastal area of Buenos Aires Province (Argentina) has been undertaken. This has yielded important palaeoecological and palaeobiogeographical data with respect to the palaeonvironmental reconstruction of the area in relation to sea-level changes, especially since c.7,000 ybp. These data provide new evidence of the strong influence that sea-level fluctuations and climatic change have exerted on the molluscan fauna. This fauna varied in composition and distribution primarily due to progressively decreasing salinity (due to falling sea-level trend after c.7,000-6,500 ybp) and declining temperature (caused by post-hypsithermal cooling after c.4,000 ybp) affecting the bonaerensian coastal area (Rio de La Plata and Argentine Sea in the western South Atlantic) during the Holocene.
   In the Destacamento Rio Salado Formation (below or at present day m.s.l., muddy and silty sediments, coastal lagoon environment Pleistocene-Holocene boundary) the absence of typical euhaline and estuarine species, together with very low faunal diversity, could be a consequence of the cooler 'Younger Dryas' event, recognized in other areas of the Southern Hemisphere c.10,800-10,000 ybp. On the basis of the abundance of M. isabelleana and the absence or scarcity among the remaining taxa of euhaline warm water molluscan species, the Pascua Formation (+6-10 m above m.s.l., marine sediments; Upper Pleistocene, >35,000 C-14 ybp) may represent a late Pleistocene interstadial but not the last Pleistocene transgression (Sangamon) as originally proposed.
   The data presented here support similar hypotheses by other authors for the area of study and for other localities in the Southern Hemisphere (southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand).

SE Geological Society of America Special Papers
AB Over 400 km of high-resolution seismic data and 53 sediment cores up to 30 m in length were collected from Corpus Christi Bay along the central Texas coast in order to study the impact of sea-level and climate change on coastal environments over the last 10 k.y. Although coastal environments experienced a general landward migration as relative sea level rose over the last 10 k.y., this retreat was punctuated by three, possibly four, major flooding events. These flooding events are marked by abrupt changes in lithologic and seismic facies interpreted to represent rapid landward shifts of bay environments. Such changes include the back stepping of bayhead deltas, tidal deltas, oyster reefs, and other bay environments. Flooding events occurred at 8.0, 4.8, 2.6 ka, and possibly at 9.6 ka, and lasted only a few hundred years. The 9.6 ka flooding surface represents the initial drowning of the ancestral Nueces River valley and may or may not have been rapid in nature. The flooding surface that formed around 8.0 ka is interpreted to record either an increase in the rate of relative sea-level rise or the flooding of relict fluvial terraces that formed by the Nueces River during the stepped fall in sea level since marine isotope stage (MIS) 5e (120 ka). The 4.8 ka flooding event is thought to have formed as a result of either a climatic change during the mid-Holocene, characterized by warmer and drier conditions compared to present, and/or the flooding of another fluvial terrace. The most recent flooding event (2.6 ka) is thought to have resulted from a decrease in sediment delivery to the bay associated with a return to more mesic conditions similar to those of the present climatic regime.

TI OPTICALLY STIMULATED LUMINESCENCE DATING OF COASTAL SEDIMENTS AT FUNING
   BAY, SOUTHEASTERN CHINA
SO GEOCHRONOMETRIA
AB The possible role of environmental change, especially sea level change, as a stimulus for the development of human residence and migration is poorly understood. We investigate this problem by showing a record of sea-level change and coastal transformation based on a sediment core (FN1 core) and a Neolithic site (Pingfengshan site) obtained from the Funing bay on the northeast coast of Fujian, China. The Funing bay coastal area represents a unique feature in China's Neolithic cultures, comprising a silty beach dominated by quartz-rich sand and several important sites of Huangguashan cultural period.
   Samples from FN1 core and Pingfengshan site were taken for grain size ananlyses and for optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating. The blue-light stimulated OSL signals were measured by the single aliquot regenerative dose (SAR) protocol to determine the ages of of the samples. Samples from FN1 core yield OSL ages ranging from 49.9 ka to 0.8 ka, providing the systematic geochronological evidence for the sea level change of Funing bay. The comparison of sea level change and Neolithic cultural periods presents a good relationship in coastal area of Fujian, China since about 7 ka before present. In detail, the cultural types of Keqiutou culture and Huangguashan culture all belong to coastal mountainous culture, of which flourishing periods corresponds to the higher sea level periods of mid-late Holocene. Tanshishan culture belongs to estuarine coastal culture, and most sites of this period correspond to a lower sea level located at lower altitudes.

TI A multiple knowledge approach for adaptation to environmental change:
   lessons learned from coastal Louisiana's tribal communities
SO JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECOLOGY
AB Environmental changes, such as sea level rise, are forcibly displacing communities around the world. Forced displacement, inadequate governance mechanisms to address relocation and economic-based adaptation and restoration efforts are leading to devastating social, cultural, health, and economic consequences for the people and communities affected. This article focuses on three tribal communities in coastal Louisiana that are experiencing rapid environmental change and risk of displacement due to historical discriminatory processes, oil and dam-related development projects, oil disasters, increased exposure to hurricanes, and relative sea level rise. Focusing on the political ecology of the communities' experiences of environmental change, including the impacts of displacement and decisions to stay in- place vs. relocate, this paper addresses broader issues of adaptive governance structures and policy implications. Building on Bronen's (2011) rights-based approach to adaptation and Shearer's (2012) approach to a political ecology of adaptation, I argue that governance structures should be put in place that support communities' in-situ adaptation efforts or, if the community decides its current location is no longer inhabitable, to assist community-led relocation efforts. Multiple forms of knowledge should be incorporated into and should inform the structures supporting the adaptation process. I highlight the social, political, environmental and economic context within which environmental changes are occurring in coastal Louisiana through discussion on the loss of the commons, the creation of an energy sacrifice zone, costbenefit based restoration efforts and forced displacement and relocation.

TI Cultural ecosystem services caught in a 'coastal squeeze' between sea
   level rise and urban expansion
SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB Sea level rise and urbanization exert complex synergistic pressures on the provision of ecosystem services (ES) in coastal regions. Anticipating when and where both biophysical and cultural ES will be affected by these two types of coastal environmental change is critical for sustainable land-use planning and management. Biophysical (provisioning and regulating) services can be mapped using secondary data. We demonstrate an approach to mapping cultural ES by engaging stakeholders in iterative participatory mapping of personally and communally valuable cultural ES. We identify hotspots where highly valued cultural ES and high values for biophysical ES co-occur and generate spatially-explicit projections of sea level rise and urban expansion through 2060 to quantify impacts of the 'coastal squeeze' on ES. We study Johns Island, South Carolina, USA as an example of a vulnerable community in a low-lying region experiencing both rising water levels and a rapid influx of new residents and development. Our projections of environmental change through 2060 indicate that on Johns Island, cultural ES face disproportionately greater risk of decline than biophysical ES, with almost three quarters of the island's cultural ES affected. We find that hotspots for cultural ES, such as community heritage sites and scenic vistas of oak-lined roads and marshes, rarely co-occur (only 3% area) with biophysical ES such as high values of carbon sequestration and agricultural production. This confirms the importance of engaging with local stakeholders to map cultural ES and puts them on a more level playing field with biophysical ES in decision-making contexts. Projected declines and limited overlap between biophysical and cultural ES highlight the need for tighter co-ordination between conservation and community planning, and for including locally valued cultural ES in assessments of threats posed by the 'coastal squeeze' of sea level rise and urban expansion.

TI Sedimentary evolution and sea-level fluctuation of a Paleo-Tethyan
   Permian carbonate-dominated succession from central China
SO SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY
AB The Paleo-Tethys experienced major geographic, tectonic, climatologic, and environmental changes during the Permian. A newly documented and complete Permian carbonate-dominated succession (>3 km) in the Xikou section, Zhen'an, Shaanxi, central China provides a unique opportunity to record its depositional environment evolution, sea-level fluctuation, and associated paleogeographic and paleoclimatic perturbation of the eastern Paleo-Tethys. Field observation and petrographic analysis document eighteen facies and indicate evolutional fa-cies of a carbonate ramp within the Xikou section. The vertical distribution of those facies in the Xikou section indicates a fluctuated sea-level during the Permian, which reflected the global climatic changes and was associ-ated with eastern Paleo-Tethys evolution. The relatively low sea-level accompanied by high-frequency fluctua-tions during the Asselian to Artinskian may be related to the expansion of glaciation (P1 and P2), while the followed significant rising at Kungurian may reflect the major deglaciation of the Late Paleozoic Ice Age (LPIA). The abrupt falling of sea-level at the end of the Capitanian was globally synchronous and may be relevant to mid-ocean ridge spreading and superimposed with global cooling (P4), which was in accord with the skeletal grain replacement of the fusulinaceans and dasyclads by small foraminifers and Gymnocodium, and was consid-ered as a major reason for Middle Permian Extinction. The early Wuchiapingian characterized by densely mixed sequences of carbonate and siliciclastic intervals had a highly frequent fluctuating sea-level, which may be influ-enced by high frequent short-term climatic variations. The sea-level falling after it reached its highest stand dur-ing the middle Wuchiapingian, was suggested as a far-field response to the expansion of the Permian glaciation episode P4, or as a result of a regional tectonic transition from extension to compression relevant to the eastern Paleo-Tethys evolution. In addition, the overall rising trend of the sea-level and the thick succession in the Xikou area suggest that the South Qinling belt was primarily under an extensional setting during the Late Carboniferous to Early Triassic, in response to Tethys rifting, which may imply the subduction of Mianlue Ocean was possibly beyond the Permian.

TI Coastal environmental changes in Southeast Asia: A study from Quang Nam
   Province, Central Vietnam
SO REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB Coastal environments are highly dynamic in nature and are sensitive to natural phenomena such as climate change and anthropogenic activities such as aquaculture or infrastructure development. At the same time, these areas are important in the economic development of the whole country, in which they are situated. Coastal areas in Vietnam are affected by a number of factors, such as climate change, sea level rise, aquaculture, pollution and tourism-related activities. This study investigated the coastal environmental changes in Quang Nam, which is a poorly developed province in Central Vietnam during the 31-year period between 1988 and 2019. For this, we analyzed spaceborne data such as Landsat series and Sentinel 2A, and digital elevation models. The coastal environmental variables analyzed were shoreline changes, changes in overall vegetation and mangrove forests, and the expansion of aquaculture ponds. In order to understand the variations in sea level heights, we analyzed HYCOM data for the period between 1994 and 2014. It has been noted that rapid shoreline erosion occurred along the Cua Dai Beach in recent years and the implementation of soft measures, such as sand bags, helped to reduce shoreline erosion to some extent. The current study also contributes to the global inventory of mangroves as most of the study area was missing in the previously available databases such as the world mangrove atlas.

TI Early and late Holocene paleoenvironmental reconstruction of the Pearl
   River estuary, South China Sea using foraminiferal assemblages and
   stable carbon isotopes
SO ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
AB Proxy reconstructions of estuarine evolution provide perspectives on regional to global environmental changes, including relative sea-level changes, climatic changes, and agricultural developments. Here, we present a new benthic foraminiferal record along with delta C-13 and C/N, and lithological data from a sediment core in the Pearl River estuary (Lingding Bay) adjacent to the South China Sea. The core has relatively thick Holocene sediments (> 40 m) due to its location in the paleo-valley of the Pearl River. The lithologic and foraminiferal record reveal an evolution in paleoenvironment from fluvial, inner estuary to middle estuary between 11300 and 8100 cal a BP in response to rapid sea-level rise. delta C-13 and C/N data indicate high freshwater discharge from 10500 to 8100 cal a BP driven by a strong Asian monsoon. The middle Holocene (8100 - 3300 cal a BP) sediment is absent in the core due to subaqueous erosion resulting from the unique geomorphology of the Pearl River Delta. In the late Holocene from 3300 cal a BP to the present, the lithology and foraminiferal assemblages suggest a further evolution from outer estuary, middle estuary channel, to middle estuary shoal, resulting from deltaic pro gradation under stable relative sea levels. In the last 2000 years, delta C-13 and C/N values reveal the intensive development of agriculture coupled with the reduction of freshwater input derived from a weakening Asian monsoon.

TI Mid- to late Holocene environmental and climatic changes in New
   Caledonia, southwest tropical Pacific, inferred from the littoral plain
   Gouaro-Deva
SO QUATERNARY RESEARCH
AB Multiproxy analysis of three littoral cores from western New Caledonia supports the hypothesis that the main controlling factors of environmental changes are sea-level change, ENSO variability and extra-tropical phenomena, such as the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) marked by a tendency for La Nina-like conditions in the tropical Pacific. The record starts during the late Holocene sea-level rise when the terrestrial vegetation indicated wet and cool conditions. The site was a coastal bay definitely transformed into a freshwater swamp at around 3400 cal yr BP, after the rapid drawdown of sea level to its current level. Sediments and foraminiferal assemblages indicated subsequent episodes of freshwater infillings, emersion or very highenergy conditions, likely related to climatic changes and mostly controlled by ENSO variability. Between 2750 and 2000 cal yr BP, relatively dry and cool climate prevailed, while wetter conditions predominated between ca. 1800 and 900 cal yr BP. The Rhizophoraceae peak between ca. 1080 and 750 cal yr BP, coeval with the MWP, may indicate a global phenomenon. Microcharcoal particles present throughout the record increased after 1500 cal yr BP, suggesting an anthropogenic source. From ca. 750 cal yr BP the appearance of current type of vegetation marks the human impact. (C) 2011 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Sunda Epicontinental Shelf occupies a large area between Asia and Indonesian Maritime Continent. This shallow shelf developed soon as stability of this area since Pliocene was achieved. Sedimentation and erosion started, following sea level variation of Milankovitch cycle that changed this area to, partly to entirely become a low lying open land. These changes imply a difference height of about 135 m sea level. Consequence of this changes from shallow sea during interglacial to the exposed low land during glacial period is producing different land cover that might influence to the surrounding area. As the large land surface, this area should be covered by low land tropical forest, savanna to wet coastal plain. This large low-lying land belongs an important river drainage system of South East Asia in the north (Gulf of Thailand) and another system that curved from Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Bangka-Belitung and Kalimantan, named as Palaeo Sunda River. The total area of this land is about 1 million km(2), this must bring consequences to the environmental condition. This change belongs to the global change on which the signal may be sent to a distance, then is preserved as geological formation. Being large and flat land, it has a long and winding river valley so this land influences the life of biota as fauna and flora but also human being that may live or just move on the passing through around East Asia. Global sea level changes through time which is then followed by the change of the area of land or water have indeed influenced the hydrology and carbon cycle balance. Through studying the stratigraphy and geology dynamic, based on seismic images and core samples from drilling work, one can be obtained, the better understanding the environmental change and its impact to the regional but could be global scale.

SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
AB Current reconstructions of sea-level history provide information on gross changes, but lack detail as to the exact course and timing of sea-level change. In this article, evidence is presented of minor but important sea-level fluctuations since the mid-Holocene sea-level high at the south-western Cape. These oscillations consisted of two regressive events at about 4200 BP and 3500-2800 BP, and one transgressive episode at 4000 BP. The negative oscillations were closely timed with the global climatic changes experienced in the Southern Hemisphere during neoglacial episodes. The interpretations in this article are based on the analysis of the shellfish remains and certain types of marine sediments present in the archaeological deposits of Tortoise Cave.

TI Holocene sea-level changes in the Indo-Pacific
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
AB Holocene sea-level reconstructions exist from many locations in the Indo-Pacific region. Despite being a large geographical region, the nature of Holocene sea-level change is broadly similar in all locations. Differences do exist, however, in the timing and magnitude of the Mid-Holocene High Stand (MHHS) and the nature of late Holocene sea level fall across the region. When the Indo-Pacific is subdivided into smaller regions, these discrepancies do not disappear, and in some cases the discrepancies are large within a single coastline.
   It is clear from this analysis that the fundamental criteria to produce accurate local relative sea-level curves are hardly ever met. There are serious problems associated with the correct interpretation of sea-level indicators and their relationship to mean sea level, and with the quality of age determinations. A consistent methodology throughout the Indo-Pacific for the analysis of sea level data is lacking. Future sea-level analysis from far field locations must involve the application of a consistent methodology in order to allow meaningful comparison between studies. This should help to resolve the ongoing debate about the magnitude and timing of the Mid-Holocene High Stand, and the nature of late Holocene sea-level fall across the region. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

   East Coast, the global tide gauge record, and the global altimeter data
   show different trends
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Impacts of ocean dynamics on spatial and temporal variations in sea level rise (SLR) along the U.S. East Coast are characterized by empirical mode decomposition analysis and compared with global SLR. The findings show a striking latitudinal SLR pattern. Sea level acceleration consistent with a weakening Gulf Stream is maximum just north of Cape Hatteras and decreasing northward, while SLR driven by multidecadal variations, possibly from climatic variations in subpolar regions, is maximum in the north and decreasing southward. The combined impact of sea level acceleration and multidecadal variations explains why the global mean SLR obtained from similar to 20 years of altimeter data is about twice the century-long global SLR obtained from tide gauge data. The sea level difference between Bermuda and the U.S. coast is highly correlated with the transport of the Atlantic Overturning Circulation, a result with implications for detecting past and future climatic changes using tide gauge data.

TI Diatoms as Indicators of Environmental Change in Estuaries
SO APPLICATIONS OF PALEOENVIRONMENTAL TECHNIQUES IN ESTUARINE STUDIES
SE Developments in Paleoenvironmental Research
AB Diatoms are valuable paleo-indicators of natural processes and environmental changes caused by human activities in estuaries. They have been used to study sea level change, climate variability, floods and tsunamis, problems associated with changes in salinity and nutrients due to human activities, and to assess ecosystem responses to remediation, among others. There are many challenges such as issues of sediment disturbance and frustule preservation, as well as limitations on the development of transfer functions due to a lack of analogue sites. However, the application of diatoms to paleo-studies in a range of coastal habitats has enabled reliable and informative qualitative and quantitative reconstructions of environmental change. This chapter provides an overview of diatom estuarine ecology, different applications of diatoms to estuarine paleoecological research, their potential yet often informative limitations, and challenges going forward.

TI Australian Aboriginal Traditions about Coastal Change Reconciled with
   Postglacial Sea-Level History: A First Synthesis
SO ENVIRONMENT AND HISTORY
AB Like some other oral traditions of Australian Aborigines, those that relate to widespread and enduring coastal inundation appear to be several thousand years old. The best-documented traditions, some mythologised, are presented for six sites around the Australian coast (Bathurst and Melville Islands, Northern Territory; Rottnest, Carnac and Garden Islands, Western Australia; Spencer Gulf, South Australia; Kangaroo Island, South Australia; Port Phillip Bay, Victoria; Cairns and Fitzroy Island, Queensland). The minimum depths at which each tradition would have been true is determined from local bathymetry. These depths are then compared to postglacial sea-level history and minimum ages for each tradition calculated. These range from 7,500-13,400 years Before Present and represent unique observations of postglacial sea-level rise and its effects that have significant implications for an appreciation of the longevity of such traditions in preliterate societies.

TI Amplitude and phase of glacial cycles from a conceptual model
SO EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
AB The astronomical theory of climate, in which the orbital variations of the Earth are taken to drive the climate changes, explains many features of the paleoclimatic records. Nevertheless, the precise link between insolation variations and climatic changes during the Quaternary remains mysterious in several aspects. In particular, the largest sea level changes of the past million years occurred when insolation variations were minimal, like during stage 11, and vice versa like during stage 7. Moreover, recent data from terminations 11 and III show surprising phase lead and lag between insolation and sea level variations. To explain these paradoxical amplitude and phase modulations, we suggest here that deglaciations started when a combination of insolation and ice volume was large enough. To illustrate this new idea, we present a simple conceptual model that simulates the sea level curve of the past million years with very realistic amplitude modulations, and with good phase modulations.

AB Given the evidence from past experience, the coastal city of Hong Kong would be vulnerable to a variety of hazards that could be exacerbated by climatic change, including potential increases in typhoons, landslides, floods (both storm surges and rainstorms), and droughts, as well as the threat of future sea level rise. The greatest death tolls in the past have been inflicted during typhoon-induced storm surges. During two unnamed typhoons, in 1906 and 1937, the death tolls were 10,000 and 11,000, respectively. In contrast, death tolls associated with landslides and other hazards were relatively small. Under a climatic change scenario of an increase in frequency and severity of typhoons and rainstorms, and rising sea level, the vulnerable areas of Hong Kong can be identified. The shift in development from hillslope areas to coastal land reclamations over the last 25 years is a matter of concern. Although the hillslopes are susceptible to landslides during rainstorms, virtually all landslides can be traced to some important anthropogenic causes and are preventable with appropriate measures. In the coming decades, the low-lying areas created through coastal land reclamations could be susceptible to flooding during storm surges and rainstorms and as the sea level rises. These areas are also where there is high density urban and industrial development, and the vulnerability is the greatest. High seawalls to protect the reclaimed areas from storm surge flooding and sea level rise may increase the risk of rainstorm flooding. To reduce vulnerability, a combination of better monitoring, planning, protection, maintenance, and warning is proposed for adaptation. Monitoring is needed not only to detect future sea level changes but also to identify areas with the greatest risk.

TI Lower and Middle Ordovician chitinozoans from Honghuayuan, South China:
   Biodiversity patterns and response to environmental changes
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB A complete chitinozoan succession through the uppermost Tremadocian to lower Darriwilian (Lower and Middle Ordovician) at Honghuayuan, northern Guizhou Province in South China, was systematically studied and 47 species of 14 genera were identified. Two chitinozoan biodiversity acmes were recognized, which occur in the lower part of the Acrograptus filiformis (uppermost Hunghuayuan Formation) and middle part of the Azygograptus suecicus (middle member of the Meitan Formation) graptolite biozones. In the upper Dapingian and lower Darriwilian (uppermost part of the Meitan Formation), chitinozoan diversity was relatively high after a less conspicuous peak in the upper Dapingian. Comparisons between diversity trends of chitinozoans, acritarchs and brachiopods, and the environmental changes revealed both similarities and differences. In the Floian, the chitinozoan biodiversity curve at Honghuayuan shows good correlation with sea-level changes. The group temporarily disappeared when the sea level was at the highest, then reappeared and reached a biodiversity acme when sea level was low. Furthermore, a large organic carbon isotope excursion is coincident with the absence of chitinozoans and a highstand period after the sea-level rise in the lower and middle Floian. Diversity curves show fewer connections with the sea-level and organic C-isotope undulations during the Dapingian and early Darriwilian. New data suggest that the environmental changes played a significant role in the early stage of Ordovician chitinozoan radiation, roughly corresponding to the Floian at the Honghuayuan section. In the Dapingian and early Darriwilian, the intrinsic factors seem to have played a more important role in shaping biodiversity patterns of chitinozoans in South China.

AB Variations in mean sea level are considered as an indicator for global as well as regional environmental change. The spatial distribution of sea level variations can be observed by satellite altimeters with a high precision. The sea level variations in the North Atlantic are studied in this paper by using eight years of sea level data derived from the TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter mission. The mean sea level change for this time period shows regionally remarkable differences and does agree only partly with the mean sea surface temperature change. The annual oscillation has a dominant contribution to the total sea level variability, but within the central Gulf Stream, eddy activity contributes even more strongly to the overall variability. After removing the annual and semi-annual oscillation and an alias period of the altimeter with the M-2 tide, the residuals are smoothed by a moving 90 day mean filter and examined by Principal Component Analysis. A low frequency variation with an approximate period of 6-7 years as well as an anomalous sea level change at the end of 1995 have been detected. The analysis of sea surface temperature data also shows a similar long periodic and anomalous behaviour.

TI Varved lacustrine sediments of Lake Tougou-ike, Western Japan, with
   reference to Holocene sea-level changes in Japan
SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
AB Eighteen metres of laminated sediments were recovered in a Holocene sediment core taken from Lake Tougou-ike in 1992. The lamination, evident from the alternation of light- and dark-coloured laminae, records cyclic deposition of biochemical sediments. Annual environmental changes in and around the lake caused seasonal variations in sediment flux to the lake floor, explaining these cyclic variations in sedimentary facies. AMS C-14 dating of organic remains from 40 horizons in the succession supports the interpretation of each light-to-dark couplet as an annual increment. Each laminated couplet is identified as a non-glacial varve, formed mainly by seasonal changes in diatom productivity. Varve counting and C-14 dating provide a detailed Holocene chronological framework, with time resolution on the order of individual years, within which to reconstruct paleoenvironmental changes recorded in the sediment core. Holocene relative sea-level changes at Lake Tougou-ike were estimated with +/- 10 yr precision using the variable authigenic iron mineral content of the sediment as a proxy. The results demonstrate that the relative sea level at Lake Tougou-ike rose abruptly at about 8900, 7700, 5600, 4000, 3600 and 2700 cal yr BP, and decreased gradually in the intervening intervals. These relative rises in sea level are demonstrated to be coeval with ice-sheet discharge events recorded in sediment cores from the North Atlantic Ocean. Abrupt coastal environmental changes caused by sea-level changes likely took place throughout the Japanese islands, and will probably be identified in both the Holocene and the last glacial interval, the latter being a time when Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles were clearly active in the North Atlantic region.

TI Cyclicity in the Egret Member (Kimmeridgian) oil source rock, Jeanne
   d'Arc Basin, offshore eastern Canada
SO MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY
AB The origin of the observed variability in lithology, total organic carbon and petrophysical properties of the Egret Member (source rock interval) in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin, offshore eastern Canada is examined. Detailed analyses of petrophysical logs indicate that the Egret Member is cyclic. Th ree different orders of cycles, recognizable on well logs, occur in the Eg ret Member. The large- and medium-scale cycles are correlatable among wells. The estimated cyclicities of the large- and medium-scale cycles fall into the Milankovitch-like cycle bands, suggesting that the depositional cycles are the product of orbitally forced sea-level and climatic changes and implying that Egret Member deposition lasted at least 1.65 million years. Using chronological information drawn from sedimentary cycles, both spatial and vertical (temporal) variations in sedimentation rate are examined for the member. A correlation exists between low sedimentation rates and high total organic carbon values in this basin. It is most probable that the organic-rich layers were deposited during times of high sea-level stands and warmer periods.

TI Scenarios for Coastal Vulnerability Assessment
SO TREATISE ON ESTUARINE AND COASTAL SCIENCE, VOL 12: ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
   OF ESTUARIES AND COASTS
AB Coastal vulnerability assessments tend to focus mainly on climate change and especially on sea-level rise. Assessment of the influence of nonclimatic environmental change or socioeconomic change is less well developed and these drivers are often completely ignored. Given that the most profound coastal changes of the twentieth century due to nonclimate drivers are likely to continue through the twenty-first century, this is a major omission. It may result in not only overstating the importance of climate change but also overlooking significant interactions of climate change and other drivers. To support the development of policies relating to climate change and coastal management, integrated assessments of climatic change in coastal areas are required, including the effects of all the relevant drivers. This chapter explores the development of scenarios (or 'plausible futures') of relevant climate and nonclimate drivers that can be used for coastal analysis, with an emphasis on the nonclimate drivers. It shows the importance of analyzing the impacts of climate change and sea-level rise in a broader context of coastal change and all its drivers. This will improve the analysis of impacts, key vulnerabilities, and adaptation needs and, hence, inform climate and coastal policy. Stakeholder engagement is important in the development of scenarios, and the underlying assumptions need to be explicit, transparent, and open to scientific debate concerning their uncertainties/ realism and likelihood.

TI Mitochondrial genomes reveal mid-Pleistocene population divergence, and
   post-glacial expansion, in Australasian snapper (Chrysophrys auratus)
SO HEREDITY
AB Glacial cycles play important roles in determining the phylogeographic structure of terrestrial species, however, relatively little is known about their impacts on the distribution of marine biota. This study utilised modern (n = 350) and ancient (n = 26) mitochondrial genomes from Australasian snapper (Chrysophrys auratus) sampled in New Zealand to assess their demographic and phylogeographic history. We also tested for changes in genetic diversity using the up to 750-year-old mitochondrial genomes from pre-European archaeological sites to assess the potential impacts of human exploitation. Nucleotide diversity and haplotype diversity was high (pi = 0.005, h = 0.972). There was no significant change in nucleotide diversity over the last 750 years (p = 0.343), with no detectable loss of diversity as a result of indigenous and industrial-scale fishing activity. While there was no evidence for contemporary population structure (AMOVA, p = 0.764), phylogeographic analyses identified two distinct mitochondrial clades that diverged approximately 650,000 years ago during the mid-Pleistocene, suggesting the species experienced barriers to gene flow when sea levels dropped over 120 m during previous glacial maxima. An exponential population increase was also observed around 8000 years ago consistent with a post-glacial expansion, which was likely facilitated by increased ocean temperatures and rising sea levels. This study demonstrates that glacial cycles likely played an important role in the demographic history of C. auratus and adds to our growing understanding of how dynamic climatic changes have influenced the evolution of coastal marine species.

SO CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN
AB Paleoenvironmental science has experienced a recent surge in interest and activity as concerns grow over global environmental change. Key research questions in the biotic realm of paleoenvironmental science focus on explaining climatic change at time scales of decades to centuries and understanding ecosystem responses to these changes. Biotic responses are increasingly being studied at smaller spatial scales to identify local factors that determine the sensitivity of a particular system to climatic change. These findings can then be applied to solving a variety of problems, such as setting conservation targets or testing mechanisms for observed climatic and biogeographic phenomena. Research approaches commonly used today include hypothesis testing, which has now become more sophisticated as paleoecologists and paleoclimatologists integrate with modellers. Other frameworks involve the quantitative integration of multiple proxy indicators and the use of extensive publicly available data networks to produce new datasets for paleoclimatic reconstructions and other applications.

   Cycle
CY OCT, 1999
CL SARDINIA, ITALY
AB The sensitivity of Black Sea level to variations in the global forcing is studied here using tide gauge and satellite altimeter data, as well as hydro-meteorological data for the fresh water flux components. The consistency between satellite and sea borne data is analyzed and the characteristics of variability with monthly to interannual time scales are revealed. The analysis of 6-year-long data series of TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter shows that the first EOF accounts for 85% of the total variance and is associated with the water cycle, the latter forced by the air-sea exchange, continental hydrological budgets and straits outflow. This result is a demonstration that the Black Sea level integrates the variations of global forcing over vast catchment area, thus making them quite distinguishable. The second EOF describes the seasonal variability of circulation. The third and higher EOF's describe synoptic and basin-oscillations, and the corresponding principal components are characterized by strong interannual variability. By analyzing the correlation of sea level and water balance in the last 70 years, we quantify the response to the external forcing. The mean sea level trend during 1993-1997, derived from the TOPEX/Poseidon data, of similar to 12 cm is much lower than the largest trends of this type observed in the last 120 years, which are associated with interannual-to-decadal variability and reach similar to20-30 cm. The correlation between the sea level and NAO index, starting from 1870s, is well pronounced, suggesting that future variations of sea level could be predicted using global climate indices. It is shown that the long-term changes of water balance are strong enough to substantially affect the exchange between Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea. This in turn might result in changing the conditions of water mass formation in the Aegean Sea and motivates further studies on the prediction of extreme events of deep water mass formation in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea as function of the global and regional water cycles.

TI Mid-Late Holocene coastal environmental changes in southeastern Sri
   Lanka: New evidence for sea level variations in southern Bay of Bengal
SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
AB The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami highlighted the need to better understand the dynamics of the South Asian coastlines. Very little knowledge on paleo-coastal variability hinders the development of a paleo-tsunami chronology of the western Bay of Bengal. Also, limited sea level records for the southern Bay of Bengal are remarkably different from rest of the Indian Ocean due to alternating highstands and lowstands during mid-late Holocene.
   This study was undertaken to recognize how the coastal environment in tectonically stable eastern and southeastern coasts of Sri Lanka changed during mid-late Holocene and to derive evidence of sea level variability. Sediment cores were collected from Kirinda and Panama estuaries, Okanda lagoon and Vakarai beach ridge plain, situated on the eastern and southeastern coasts of Sri Lanka. Physical and chemical variations in sediments, caused by the coastal environmental changes occurred due to fluctuating eustatic sea level, were determined using X-ray fluorescence, visible reflectance, magnetic susceptibility and grain size. Chronology of events were developed using AMS C-14 dates on bulk organic matter, wood, inorganic carbonate and mollusk shells.
   Results suggest that key periods of transition in the coastal environment in the studied area occurred between about 7300 and 3000 BP. Submergence of coastal environments by mid-Holocene transgression began around 7300 BP. Barrier development initiated at the end of the submergence phase around 4900 BP. Onset of beach ridge development in areas with high sediment supply took place around 4000 BP and continued later than 2400 BP. Marine influence ended around 3000 BP.
   These coastal environmental changes suggest that Holocene transgression, which started flooding southeastern coastal lowlands, either slowed or the sea level stabilized around 4900 BP. Sea level fell down to its present level at around 3000 BP by the subsequent slow regression. Some cores carry evidence for a possible pause in the transgression or a short lowstand that ended around 5200 BR (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

TI HOLOCENE ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE IN SOUTH GEORGIA - EVIDENCE FROM
   LAKE-SEDIMENTS
SO JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE
AB The Holocene environmental history of South Georgia is important because of the island's location in the Southern Westerlies in an oceanic zone of the world devoid of high resolution terrestrial records.  This is the first attempt to interpret a palaeoenvironmental record from lake sediments in South Georgia.  It is based on a wide variety of analyses undertaken on cores from two lakes.  Both are in the same, unglaciated, drainage basin, but one is at 80 m above sea-level and near the altitudinal limit for vegetation growth, whereas the other is at 25 m and within the zone of continuous vegetation cover.  Results from both lakes indicate shifts of vegetation boundaries, which, together with evidence for changing biotic productivity within the lakes themselves, are interpreted as indicating climatic changes.  Radiocarbon dates on the main changes identify a climatic optimum, beginning before 5620 +/- 290 C-14 yr BP, and ending at around 4815 +/- 330 C-14 yr BP, when conditions in the upper part of the catchment were more conductive to plant growth than they are today.  The record obtained from the lower lake was shorter, but indicates two periods of harsher climate relative to the present since 4000 yr BP.  This interpretation of the lake evidence agrees with other dated evidence of environmental change from peat sections, glacial stratigraphy and geomorphology in South Georgia.  Together the work allows an overall reconstruction of environmental change in the Holocene.

TI BAYESIAN METHODS FOR MODEL UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS WITH APPLICATION TO
   FUTURE SEA-LEVEL RISE
SO RISK ANALYSIS
AB This paper addresses the use of data for identifying and characterizing uncertainties in model parameters and predictions. The Bayesian Monte Carlo method is formally presented and elaborated, and applied to the analysis of the uncertainty in a predictive model for global mean sea level change. The method uses observations of output variables, made with an assumed error structure, to determine a posterior distribution of model outputs. This is used to derive a posterior distribution for the model parameters. Results demonstrate the resolution of the uncertainty that is obtained as a result of the Bayesian analysis and also indicate the key contributors to the uncertainty in the sea level rise model. While the technique is illustrated with a simple, preliminary model, the analysis provides an iterative framework for model refinement. The methodology developed in this paper provides a mechanism for the incorporation of ongoing data collection and research in decision-making for problems involving uncertain environmental change.

Between 4000 and 2500 yr BP, during a period of sea-level stabilisation, similar halophytic communities developed in the South and in the middle part of the present lagoon. Between 4500 and 3500 yr BP hydrophytic and halophytic Communities developed in Laguna Hinojales. Beginning 2500 yr BP, when sea level was nearing its present position, modern plant communities became established. Pollen records suggest that littoral evolution of the area was much more complex than previous models have described, introducing new evidence of the geomorphological evolution of Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon. The estuarine environment was delimited by a system of barrier islands instead of a linear prograding barrier, as has been proposed. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Collapses of island societies from environmental forcing: Does history
   hold lessons for the future?
SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Societies that develop on islands in oceans, distant from continental shores and one another, are unusually vulnerable to fundamental change (collapse). It is argued that a common cause of such change is the effect of external (climate-driven) environmental forcing on food resources, especially those on which coastal-dwelling island peoples invariably depend. Relative changes in sea level that were comparatively rapid are implicated in several instances of societal collapse on islands; two examples are discussed.
   The first refers to western tropical Pacific Island groups in which Early Period societies are distinctive, representing periods of human settlement beginning 3,500-2,800 years ago and undergoing major transformative change a few centuries later. The end of these Early Period societies appears to have been near-synchronous, an observation requiring an external and region-wide driver rather than local drivers. Sea-level fall, which began 4,000-3,000 years ago in this region, continued for some centuries and is considered to have dropped below a critical threshold about 2,570 years ago, abruptly reducing useful coastal bioproductivity and forcing the inhabitants of these islands to sharply reduce their dependence on coastal foods.
   Second is the effect of sea-level fall during the AD 1300 Event (approximately AD 1250-1350) that rapidly reduced coastal food availability and resulted in conflict that forced human groups throughout the higher islands of the tropical Pacific to abandon coastal settlements in favour of those in defensible locations inland, upslope and offshore. On lower islands (atolls), people made use of islands newly formed as a result of the sea-level fall during the ad 1300 Event, while some islands were abandoned by people altogether.
   External environmental change, particularly sea-level change, has demonstrated potential to force fundamental alterations to island societies and even cause their collapse. This situation remains the same in today's more globalised island world, where some islands are likely to become uninhabitable within a few decades as a result of sea-level rise, while on others deleterious impacts on coastal food systems are likely to force coastal peoples to seek new ways of feeding themselves.

TI Landscape and environmental changes along the Eastern Primorye coast
   during the middle to late Holocene and human effects
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
AB Several stages are recognizable in landscape evolution along the Eastern Primorye coast, Kit Bay and its surrounding mountains in terms of climatic changes and related sea level fluctuations during the middle-late Holocene. The last 3.8-3.5 cal ka years were marked by a notable effect of the pyrogenic factor. The sea level rise at the maximum phase of the Holocene transgression led to the formation of lagoons at stream mouths, which underwent a complicated development. At that time, the coast's principal topographic elements came into being, and the modern landscape's pattern was laid on the coastal lowlands. The authors trace the changes in the vegetation in the process of short-term warmings and coolings. Korean pine appeared in the forests surrounding Kit Bay much earlier than in other regions of the Eastern Primorye. During the considered period, warmer phases were marked by increasing importance of broadleaf species, while at the cooler phases, a proportion of the Korean pine grew in the low mountains. In the last 2.3 cal ka, at greater elevations in the middle mountains, dark coniferous forests became more widespread, particularly spruce. At the same time, larch groves existed around the coastal sphagnum bog, probably due to seasonally frozen ground persisting for the greater part of a year. Extreme events with a considerable effect on the coastal landscape evolution include floods, whose frequency has been growing for the last 1.75 cal ka. Strong tsunamis are another factor influencing coastal evolution. Finally, changes in landscapes have been recorded related to human activities in the last few decades.

TI Palaeoenvironmental evolution of the Barbate-Trafalgar coast (Cadiz)
   during the last similar to 140 ka: Climate, sea-level interactions and
   tectonics
SO GEOMORPHOLOGY
AB Coastal response to tectonic activity and eustatic-climate interactions during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene has been analyzed along the Barbate-Trafalgar shoreline. The study area consists of an uplifted platform (La Brena, similar to 140 m) bounded by two major NW-SE faults that have created two Subsiding areas: Meca in the west and Barbate in the east. The areas of subsidence have favoured the accumulation of a thick morphosedimentary Sequence consisting of (in ascending stratigraphic order) beach, alluvial, and aeolian deposits, which repeatedly underwent soil-forming processes. This study Outlines the palaeogeographical evolution of the area over the last similar to 140 ka, as deduced from geomorphological mapping associated with a range of laboratory analyses (mineralogical, geochemical, magnetic susceptibility, and soil micromorphology analyses), Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL dating), and existing U-Th dating. Special attention has been paid to tire alluvial unit, made LIP Of vertically stacked sandy sheet-flood deposits with interbedded red paleosols. OSL ages Suggest that sediment Supply to the alluvial/coastal environments took place mainly at the end of the two most recent glacial periods (Oxygen Isotopic Stage [OIS] 6 and OIS 3/OIS 2) and during the last interglacial period (end of OIS 5). This means that although alluvial sedimentation took place at times of relatively high sea level. these were not times of highstand because very high sea levels (like the present) allow marine erosion of the distal part of the fans (fan toes), cutting cliffed coasts.
   The repeated occurrence of paleosols in the alluvial sequence seems to indicate a recurrence of environmental changes that modified the feedback relationships between the catchment and the coastal areas. These changes are recorded in repeated oscillations of soil parameters, and are revealed from the results of geochemical and environmental magnetism analyses. We associate repeated pedogenesis and alluvial sedimentation with the glacial/interglacial global climatic changes due to an oscillating hurniclity/ aridity ratio rather than with cyclicity in thermal regime.

TI Modeling Human Migration Under Environmental Change: A Case Study of the
   Effect of Sea Level Rise in Bangladesh
SO EARTHS FUTURE
AB Sea level rise (SLR) could have catastrophic consequences worldwide. More than 600 million people currently living in coastal areas may see their livelihood at risk and choose to migrate in the near future. Predicting when, how, and where people could migrate under environmental change is critical to devise effective policy initiatives and improve our preparedness. Here, we propose a modeling framework to predict the effect of SLR on migration patterns from easily accessible geographic and demographic data. The framework adapts the radiation model to capture unwillingness or inability to migrate of affected residents, as well as return migration and cascading effects in migration patterns. We apply the mathematical model to study internal migration in Bangladesh, where we predict a complex and counterintuitive landscape of migration patterns between districts. Our predictions indicate that the impact of SLR on 816,000 people by 2050 will trigger cascading effects in migration patterns throughout the entire country. The population of each of the 64 districts will change, leading to a total variation of 1.3 million people. Migration from inundated regions in the center will trigger non-trivial patterns, including a reduction in the population of the district of the capital Dhaka.

AB The Holocene glacial and climatic development in Antarctica differed considerably from that in the Northern Hemisphere. Initial deglaciation of inner shelf and adjacent land areas in Antarctica dates back to between 10-8 Kya, when most Northern Hemisphere ice sheets had already disappeared or diminished considerably. The continued deglaciation of currently ice-free land in Antarctica occurred gradually between ca. 8-5 Kya. A large southern portion of the marine-based Ross Ice Sheet disintegrated during this late deglaciation phase. Some currently ice-free areas were deglaciated as late as 3 Kya. Between 8-5 Kya, global glacio-eustatically driven sea level rose by 10-17 m, with 4-8 m of this increase occurring after 7 Kya. Since the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets had practically disappeared by 8-7 Kya, we suggest that Antarctic deglaciation caused a considerable part of the global sea level rise between 8-7 Kya, and most of it between 7-5 Kya. The global mid-Holocene sea level high stand, broadly dated to between 8-4 Kya, and the Littorina-Tapes transgressions in Scandinavia and simultaneous transgressions recorded from sites e.g. in Svalbard and Greenland, dated to 7-5 Kya, probably reflect input of meltwater from the Antarctic deglaciation.

TI A multi-proxy study of Holocene environmental change recorded in
   alluvial deposits along the southern coast of the Pampa region,
   Argentina
SO JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE
AB Analyses of fossil records of molluscs, stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen, diatoms and palynomorphs from alluvial deposits at Arroyo Claromeco, in the southern Pampa region of Argentina, provide an integrated reconstruction of rapid Holocene environmental change related to marine and palaeoclimate influences. The major events recorded include: (i) disturbances produced by marine influences in close proximity to the coast before ca. 7700 cal a BP; (ii) a short-term decrease in salinity associated with freshwater influx between ca. 7700 and 7400 cal a BP in response to eustatic adjustment as sea level rose; (iii) an increasing input of marine water related to the Holocene sea-level highstand and greater evaporative conditions between 7400 and 6450 cal a BP; and (iv) evaporative processes linked to a pronounced climatic variability that triggered changes in water chemistry during the last ca. 6000 cal a BP concurrently with the late Holocene sea-level fall. A comparison of coastal and continental stable isotope records from the Pampa region reveals that evaporation and a negative precipitation/evaporation (P/E) ratio balance strongly influenced water chemistry in the coastal region, and was as important an influence as marine water during the period of maximum sea-level highstand.

SP Soc Comparative & Integrative Biol
AB TWO studies from the Pleistocene coral reef fossil record demonstrate the sensitivity of reef communities to both local environmental parameters and habitat reduction. In the first study, Pleistocene reef coral assemblages from Papua New Guinea show pronounced constancy in taxonomic composition and species diversity between 125 and 30 ka (thousand years). Spatial differences in reef coral community composition during successive high stands of sea level were greater among sites of the same age than among reefs of different ages, even though global changes in sea level, atmospheric CO2 concentration, tropical benthic habitat area, and temperature varied at each high sea level stand. Thus, local environmental variation associated with runoff from the land had greater influence on reef coral community composition than variation in global climate and sea level, Proportional sampling from a regional species pool does not explain the temporal persistence and local factors likely played a major role. Examination of coral reef response to global change should not only involve regional diversity patterns but also local ecological factors, and the interactive effects of local and global environmental change.
   In the second study, Pleistocene extinction of two widespread, strictly insular species of Caribbean reef corals, Pocillopora cf. palmata (Geister, 1975) and an organ-pipe growth form of the Montastraea "annularis" species complex, was natural and did not involve gradual decrease in range and abundance, but was sudden (thousands of years) throughout the entire range. One explanation is that sea level drop at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM-18 ka) resulted in a threshold of habitat reduction, and caused disruption of coral metapopulation structure. Threshold effects predicted by metapopulation dynamics may also explain the apparent paradox of the large amount of degraded modern reef habitat without any known modern-day reef coral extinctions, The rapid extinction of widespread Pleistocene species emphasizes the vulnerability of reef corals in the face of present rapid environmental and climatic change.

TI Coastal reconstruction of Vista Alegre, an ancient maritime Maya
   settlement
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB Past coastal reconstruction is useful for understanding archaeological coastal settlements and predicting how coastal change might affect modern populations. The ancient Maritime Maya inhabitants of Vista Alegre in the northeastern Yucatan were active seafaring peoples. However, the past coastal landscape environmental history is unknown. Previous research concentrated on the fully terrestrial component of the site, and did not approach the issue from an earth sciences, sedimentological perspective. In this study, a sediment core campaign in the shallow offshore of Vista Alegre aimed to reconstruct the coastal and environmental changes that occurred over the past 3000 years, and specifically identify the changes in sea-level. Nine cores were analyzed using a multi-proxy approach including a range of sedimentological parameters such as granulometry, micropaleontology (foraminifera), radiocarbon dating, and loss on ignition. The sediment cores provided an archive of environmental changes related to sea-level change, anthropogenic influence, and shifting microenvironments which can be associated with cultural time periods. The environmental phases and shifts show some linkage to the archaeological chronology, suggesting an association between the environmental conditions and human activities. Sea-level changes and shifting shorelines have always been, and still are, a challenge for coastal settlements, and ancient sites can be a harbinger of what to anticipate in the future. In addition to this, current natural and anthropogenic pressures on coastlines are placing archaeological sites at increasing risk and thereby threatening this important scientific and cultural archive. Therefore, efforts to identify, characterize, and record natural and anthropogenic pressures prior to destruction are increasingly important.

TI Birth of the modern Chesapeake Bay estuary between 7.4 and 8.2 ka and
   implications for global sea-level rise
SO GEO-MARINE LETTERS
AB Two major pulses of sea-level rise are thought to have taken place since the last glacial maximum meltwater pulses (mwp) 1A (12 cal ka) and 1B (9.5 cal ka). Between mwp I B and about 6 cal ka, many of the complex coastal ecosystems which ring the world's oceans began to form. Here we report data for rhenium, carbon isotopes, total organic carbon, and fossil oysters from Chesapeake Bay which span the transition from fresh to brackish water conditions in the bay in the mid-Holocene. These data constrain sea-level change and resulting environmental change in the bay. They indicate that the transition was rapid, and that it was produced by (1) a third pulse of rapid eustatic sea-level rise, or (2) a geometry of the prehistoric Chesapeake Bay basin which predisposed it to a nonlinear response to a steadily rising sea level. Similar nonlinear changes in vulnerable coastal environments are likely to take place in the future due to polar warming, regardless of the timing or rate of sea-level rise.

TI Annually laminated lake sediments and environmental changes in Bashang
   Plateau, North China
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB Angulinuo Lake is the biggest lake on the Bashang Plateau, North China, and is 47.6 km(2) in area and 2-6 m in depth. A core from the inner part of Angulinuo Lake was sliced and the sediment was observed by Scanning Electronic Microscope (SEM). Annual laminations characterized by variable color and grain size were found and interpreted as recording the cyclic deposition of lacustrine clay and aeolian dust. The results of chemical analysis of coarse grains conducted by SEM-EDAX, and grain size analysis of modem aeolian dust in the ice on Angulinuo Lake, support an aeolian origin for the light coarse layers. Image analysis technique was used to calculate the size and number of coarse grains in each layer. The coarse grains were fractionated into four classes: > 42 mu m, 14-42 mu m, 14-4.2 mu m and 1.4-4.2 mu m. In general, the abundance of the four classes shows similar temporal variation patterns. Around Angulinuo Lake, the winter monsoon is strong and transports aeolian dust into the lake. When the winter monsoon is strong, the size and amount of coarse grains are expected to increase. We infer that the winter monsoon was weaker during 8430-5440 year BP, and was unstable in the later part of this period. From 5440 year BP, the winter monsoon became stronger, and then weaker from 3250 to 2490 year BP. During 2490-1170 year BP, the winter monsoon was slightly stronger, but since 1170 year BP, it has become weaker again. The changes of the winter monsoon intensity recorded in the annual laminations in Angulinuo Lake sediments correspond well to environmental changes in North China and to changes in sea level during the same period.

TI Holocene environmental changes of the Songji lagoon, South Korea, and

AB As an important geomorphologic element of the coastal areas, lagoons receive relatively less attention than estuaries and deltas in the NW Pacific marginal sea. In this study, based on proxies of delta C-13, pollen and diatoms from a sediment core, we attempt to understand the Holocene sedimentary environment of the Songji lagoon, South Korea, and the possible mechanism for its response to global or regional sea level and climate changes. The sedimentary environment was phased in different periods: an estuary, an estuarine lagoon, an intermediate environment, and an intermediate to brackish lagoon in early Holocene to 6.7 cal kyr BP, 6.7-6.3 cal kyr BP, 6.3-4.5 cal kyr BP and 4.5-1.3 cal kyr BP, respectively. Afterward, abundant freshwater entered the lagoon from the stream. The environmental evolutions were triggered by sea level and climate changes. The fluctuation of the sedimentary environment implies that the sea level rose from 4.5 to 2.2 cal kyr BP, and declined from 2.2 to 0.8 cal kyr BP. The sedimentary environmental change is also probably connected with El Nino activity, especially in the periods 6.7-6.3 cal kyr BP, 4.5-3.6 cal kyr BP and 3.0-2.0 cal kyr BP.

TI High-frequency mangrove degradation events during the Holocene climatic
   optimum in the Maowei Sea of tropical China
SO JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH
AB Mangrove forests are ecologically and economically significant ecosystems in the (sub)tropics, and it is important to reconstruct their historical changes to understand the future of mangrove forests in the context of global warming. Although the Holocene climatic optimum (HCO) is regarded as an analogue of future climatic change, high-resolution studies of mangrove ecosystem changes during this period are rare. This study presents a highresolution sedimentary record for the HCO (7800-6900 cal. yr BP) in the Maowei Sea, northern Beibu Gulf, China. Contributions of mangrove-derived organic matter in the sediments were quantified using an end-member mixing model and a Monte Carlo simulation. The model reveals there were high-frequency degradation events (11 times) of the mangrove forests during 7800-6900 cal. yr BP. Palaeo-environmental records (e.g., sea-level, stalagmite & delta;18O values, and sediment Ti contents) from near the study area demonstrate that an intensified Asian winter monsoon (AWM), rather than sea-level changes, was the key factor responsible for the high-frequency mangrove degradation events during the HCO in this region. The results indicate that the effects of the intensified winter monsoon on tropical ecosystems may be greater than previously thought, particularly in the context of anthropogenic warming scenarios.

TI Holocene sea-level change and coastal landscape evolution in the
   southern Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia
SO HOLOCENE
AB A revised Holocene sea-level history for the southern Gulf of Carpentaria is presented based on new data from the South Wellesley Archipelago and age recalibration of previous research. Results confirm that rising sea levels during the most recent post-glacial marine transgression breached the Arafura Sill ca. 11,700 cal. yr BP. Sea levels continued to rise to ca. -30 m by 10,000 cal. yr BP, leading to full marine conditions. By 7700 cal. yr BP, sea-level reached present mean sea-level (PMSL) and continued to rise to an elevation of between 1.5 m and 2 m above PMSL. Sea level remained ca. + 1.5 between 7000 and 4000 cal. yr BP, followed by rapid regression to within +/- 0.5 m of PMSL by ca. 3500 cal. yr BP. When placed into a wider regional context results from this study show that coastal landscape evolution in the tropical north of Australia was not only dependent on sea-level change but also show a direct correlation with Holocene climate variability. Specifically, the formation and preservation of beach-rock deposits, intertidal successions, beach and chenier ridge systems hold valuable sea-level and Holocene climate proxies that can contribute to the growing research into lower latitude Holocene sea-level and climate histories.

TI Improving understanding of the spatial dimensions of biophysical change
   in atoll island countries and implications for island communities: A
   Marshall Islands' case study
SO APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB Using coarse-scale approaches, existing national assessments of vulnerability and adaptation highlight physical land instability as a major threat to atoll island nationhood. However, such evaluations are bereft of detailed, ground-truthed analyses of the physical impacts of climatic change on reef islands, treating islands as homogenous in both biophysical and social characteristics. The distinct geomorphic context of two proximate reef islands (Jeh and Jabat) in the Marshall Islands was examined through conventional land survey techniques. A template documenting the nuances in island topography was used to evaluate simple inundation scenarios, reflecting current and future sea-level changes under storm surge conditions. The variations in local scale community exposure to inundation were discernible. The study highlights the importance of treating coarse-scale assessments with caution and underscores the need for continued commitment to resolving variations in community experiences to environmental change. Notions of risk and exposure are complex and embedded in both the biophysical and social contexts of each island community. Despite a number of targeted urban vulnerability studies in the Pacific there remains a need for efforts to document localised differences in experience to better inform contemporary adaptation efforts.

TI Comparing the role of absolute sea-level rise and vertical tectonic
   motions in coastal flooding, Torres Islands (Vanuatu)
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Since the late 1990s, rising sea levels around the Torres Islands (north Vanuatu, southwest Pacific) have caused strong local and international concern. In 2002-2004, a village was displaced due to increasing sea incursions, and in 2005 a United Nations Environment Programme press release referred to the displaced village as perhaps the world's first climate change "refugees." We show here that vertical motions of the Torres Islands themselves dominate the apparent sea-level rise observed on the islands. From 1997 to 2009, the absolute sea level rose by 150 +/- 20 mm. But GPS data reveal that the islands subsided by 117 +/- 30 mm over the same time period, almost doubling the apparent gradual sea-level rise. Moreover, large earthquakes that occurred just before and after this period caused several hundreds of mm of sudden vertical motion, generating larger apparent sea-level changes than those observed during the entire intervening period. Our results show that vertical ground motions must be accounted for when evaluating sea-level change hazards in active tectonic regions. These data are needed to help communities and governments understand environmental changes and make the best decisions for their future.

TI Holocene shelf sedimentation patterns off equatorial East Africa
   constrained by climatic and sea-level changes
SO SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY
AB Equatorial East Africa experienced significant variations in paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic conditions during the Holocene. These environmental changes influenced sedimentation patterns on the continental shelf. To date, however, little is known about the sediment source, its transport to, and deposition on, the Tanzanian shelf. This paper presents a new high-resolution Holocene sedimentary record off northeast Tanzania (equatorial East Africa) and provides insights into how sedimentation patterns responded to climatic and oceanographic changes during the Holocene. Based on grain-size distribution patterns and mineral assemblages, three types of shelf sediments were identified: Type I (fine-grained terrigenous sediment) is dominated by clay minerals that originated from continental weathering; Type II (coarse-grained terrigenous sediment) is mainly composed of feldspar and quartz, derived from reworking of pre-existing deposits; and Type III (biogenic marine sediment), with low- and high-magnesium calcite, was produced by marine carbonate-secreting organisms. The high input of Type I sediment during the early Holocene (10-8 cal kyr BP) was caused by river mouth bypassing. This supply-dominated regime was controlled by intense river discharge and subsequent resuspension of mud in shelf settings, responding to the humid climate in the hinterland and sea-level rise with low rate off Tanzania. The first occurrence of Type II sediments was around 8 cal kyr BP and dominated when sedimentation rates lowered. This accommodation-dominated regime was caused by shoreface bypassing due to an arid climate and sea-level highstand. Type III sediments increased significantly from the early to late Holocene, resulting from the weakening dilution effect of the terrigenous component. The sedimentation pattern on the Tanzanian shelf shifted from allochthonous to autochthonous sedimentation constrained by climatic changes and relative sea-level fluctuations at the end of the early Holocene. Our results also suggest that, with respect to sea-level rise, high sedimentation rate on the continental shelf could be caused by high terrigenous sediment input as a result of a dynamic interplay between the shelf topography and humid climatic conditions inland.

TI Evidence of climatic changes in the Venetian Coastal Plain (Northern
   Italy) during the last 40,000 years
SO SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY
AB Borehole ARS-S1 sampled sediments down to 40 m under the coastal city of Venice with the aim of reconstructing climatic variations during the last 40,000 years. Seven sedimentary facies belonging to continental and littoral depositional systems have been identified and dated. An age-depth model gives a mean sedimentation rate of 1.6 mm yr(-1) between 40 and 22.5 cal ka BP. A general change in sedimentation rate occurred around 29 cal ka BP, indicating an increased accumulation during the Last Glacial Maximum. The main climatic changes during the last 40,000 years have been identified through pollen analyses. From the deepest core depth to -5 m the pollen sequence indicates a long glacial period characterized by open steppe vegetation with pine and low concentrations of arboreal pollen grains. Fluctuations of mountain elements and the occurrence of Quercetum elements indicate the presence of the main interstadials and interglacial phases of the Middle Weichselian-Holocene interval. This framework results from comparison with European palyno-chronostratigraphic records and Atlantic stadial and interstadial chronologies, and confirms the evolution of the Venetian Plain under global climatic pulses.

TI Late Cretaceous sea-level changes in Tunisia: a multi-disciplinary
   approach
SO JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY
AB A multi-disciplinary study of sea-level and climate proxies, including bulk rock and clay mineral compositions, carbon isotopes, total organic carbon (TOC), Sr/Ca ratios, and macro- and microfaunal associations, reveals seven major sea-level regressions in the southwestern Tethys during the last 10 million years of the Cretaceous: late Campanian (c. 74.2 Ma, 73.4-72.5 Ma and 72.2-71.7 Ma), early Maastrichtian (70.7-70.3 Ma, 69.6-69.3 Ma, and 68.9-68.3 Ma), and late Maastrichtian (65.45-65.3 Ma). Low sea levels are generally associated with increased terrigenous influx, low kaolinite/chlorite+mica ratios, high TOC and high Sr/Ca ratios, whereas high sea levels are generally associated with the reverse conditions. These sea-li:vel changes may be interpreted as eustatic as suggested by the global recognition of at least four of the seven major regressions identified (74.2 Ma, 70.7-70.3 Ma, 68.9-68.3 Ma and 65.45-65.3 Ma). Climatic changes inferred from clay mineral contents correlate with sea-level changes: warm or humid climates accompany high sea levels and cooler or arid climates generally accompany low sea levels.

AB The great diversity of terrestrial arthropods in the Arctic suggests that these organisms are especially useful to monitor environmental change there, where warming as a result of climatic change is expected to be especially pronounced and where current conditions are limiting for many organisms, Based on existing information about arctic faunas and how they differ from temperate ones, this paper suggests several elements. including ratios and other quantitative indexes, that can be used for long-term evaluations of change. These elements include composition indexes, range limits. marker species, interspecific ratios, relationship shifts, phenological and physiological indicators. and key sites. Using such elements in a planned way would exploit the diversity of arctic insects and emphasize their importance in arctic systems.

TI Climate modelling sensitivity experiments for the Messinian Salinity
   Crisis
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB The repeated isolation of the Atlantic Ocean during the Messinian led to at least the partial desiccation of the Mediterranean Sea and to the deposition of massive evaporites (Messinian Salinity Crisis). Overall, proxy data do not indicate dramatic climatic changes in the Mediterranean region for the time of the Messinian Salinity Crisis but a constant climate seems to be unrealistic at first sight. To analyse the climate response to environmental changes in the Mediterranean region during the Messinian Salinity Crisis, we perform climate modelling sensitivity experiments. As a reference base, we use a Tortonian simulation (TORT) and simulate three Messinian sensitivity scenarios: (1) the Mediterranean Sea surface 1500 m lower than the normal sea level (MSC LOWSEA); (2) the Mediterranean basin completely desiccated, the resulting land surface 1500 m lower and covered by grassland vegetation (MSC LOWGRASS): and (3) the Mediterranean Sea simply replaced by grassland vegetation (MSC GRASS). All sensitivity experiments represent extreme scenarios for analysis of general patterns of Messinian climate change. In MSC LOWSEA, mean annual temperatures in the Mediterranean basin increase by +2 degrees C, and surrounding regions get cooler by up to -3 degrees C as compared to TORT. The lowering of the Mediterranean Sea level increases the annual precipitation in the south-western part of Europe and in northwestern Africa (up to + 1000 mm/a). In MSC LOWGRASS as compared to TORT, the Mediterranean basin strongly heats up by +7 degrees C, while temperatures in the surrounding areas do not change more than +/- 2 degrees C. The precipitation in the Mediterranean basin significantly decreases (up to -600 mm/a). Precipitation in the areas surrounding the Mediterranean basin does not change substantially in MSC LOWGRASS, but rainfall in W-Africa increases up to +600 mm/a. In MSC GRASS as compared to TORT, temperatures in the Mediterranean region increase by +4 degrees C. This is twice as high as the temperature increase which resulted from lowering the Mediterranean Sea surface in MSC LOWSEA. Annual rainfall over the Mediterranean basin in MSC GRASS is -400 mm/a lower than the rainfall in TORT. Proxy-based climate reconstructions for the time of the Messinian Salinity Crisis indicate no dramatic climatic changes around the Mediterranean. In contrast to this, for eastern N-Africa and Eastern Europe climate changes are indicated. The MSC LOWSEA and MSC LOWGRASS sensitivity experiments show that the strong environmental changes in the Mediterranean realm during the MSC did not necessarily cause strong climatic changes at the margins of the Mediterranean basin. Therefore, the present modelling studies are in agreement with climate proxy data from the Mediterranean region. Additionally, our results principally agree with the climate changes inferred from the fossil record of Central and Eastern Europe. For eastern N-Africa, our modelling studies contradict proxy data. Based on our results, weak climatic changes indicated by the fossil record at the Mediterranean coastlines are realistic. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Geochemical elements in coral skeleton: potential proxies for the earth
   climatic changes and oceanic pollution
SO JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF KOREA
AB Numerous studies about global climatic changes, oceanic environmental changes and regional pollution over the past were conducted. This study focused on concentration of geochemical elements of coral skeletons, and reviewed in terms of the previous studies of Earth climatic changes and local oceanic pollution, and of possibility for developing proxies. Numerous studies for the climatic changes of the Earth and local pollution were conducted during the past two or three decades, and it is still continuously conducted to investigate the changes of sea surface temperature, precipitation using oxygen isotope and trace element concentrations of coral skeleton. Especially, coral has a distinctive annual band, and thus it can be used for high resolution study. Also it is a very useful material in studying seasonal variations of climatic changes and global environmental changes as well as local environmental changes such as pollution. Therefore, coral skeletons are one of the most confidential tools in tracking past global environmental changes and regional pollution. However, it is necessary to develop prudent pretreatment methods before analysis because geochemical contents can be easily contaminated. Further studies are necessary for the continuous development of new proxies and for the accurate evaluation of environmental changes using coral skeletons.

TI Holocene evolution of the Ombrone alluvial plain (Tuscany, Central

SO BOLLETTINO DELLA SOCIETA GEOLOGICA ITALIANA
AB The Late Holocene sedimentological and palaeoecological evolution of the Grosseto alluvial plain (Tuscany, Italy) was studied using approximatly 120 lithological borehole descriptions, palaeoecological records and five C-14 dates. During the Holocene, the Ombrone River migrated laterally, but did not avulse. New radiocarbon dates allow average sedimentation rates to be calculated in the order of -0.9 mm/yr before 2800 cal yr BP and similar to 1.4 mm/yr between 2800 cal yr BP and the present. This is considerably lower than hitherto presumed. The new C-14 ages can be related to the relative sea-level curve for the Tyrrhenian Sea.
   The results of macro- and micro-fossil analysis suggest increasing human influence since similar to 2800 cal yr BP and an environmental change from brackish-marine to freshwater conditions. Recent marine influence led to saltmarsh conditions.

AB Without adaptation, 0.2 to 4.6% of the global population may be flooded annually in 2100 with scenarios of 0.25 till 1.23 m global mean sea level rise. Therefore, it is necessary that local governments engage and educate the local community in order to adapt to the impacts of sea level rise. To this point, we developed a comprehensive four-dimensional (4D, i.e. 3D and time) flood visualisation WebGIS (Web-based Geographic Information System), as it quickly conveys strong messages, condenses complex information, engages people in issues of environmental change, and motivates personal actions. This paper describes the developed landscape visualisation of a flood model simulation for the coastal town of Ostend (West Flanders, Belgium) and presents practical considerations for future studies. This research proposes an adaptation plan with a series of practical measures to be introduced by 2050, for example, inserting gates where needed, sluices to prevent ingress of water into drains, raising floor levels in vulnerable town centre properties, and installing breakwaters. This local-scale assessment is a step towards helping the community to understand coastal flood events and how they might change with sea level rise and storm surge events.

TI Mid-late holocene sea-level variability in eastern Australia
SO TERRA NOVA
AB A re-analysis of sea-level data from eastern Australia based on 115 calibrated C-14 ages is used to constrain the origin, timing and magnitude of sea-level change over the last 7000 years. We demonstrate that the Holocene sea-level highstand of +1.0-1.5 m was reached similar to 7000 cal yr Bp and fell to its present position after 2000 yr Bp. These findings are in contrast to most previous studies that relied on smaller datasets and did not include the now common conversion of conventional C-14 ages to calendar years. During this similar to 5000 year period of high sea level, growth hiatuses in oyster beds and tubeworms and lower elevations of coral microatolls are interpreted to represent short-lived oscillations in sea-level of up to 1 m during two intervals, beginning c. 4800 and 3000 cal yr Bp. The rates of sea-level rise and fall (1-2 mm yr(-1)) during these centennial-scale oscillations are comparable with current rates of sea-level rise. The origin of the oscillations is enigmatic but most likely the result of oceanographic and climatic changes, including wind strengths, ice ablation, and melt-water contributions of both Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.

TI River incision and terrace formation in the Late Cenozoic of Europe
SO TECTONOPHYSICS
AB Late Cenozoic environmental changes which affected European rivers are reviewed, focusing especially on those of mid-Pleistocene times (c.1.2-0.8 Ma or around MIS 22) and thereafter. These involved dominating but fluctuating cold-climate (periglacial) conditions, shorter but major episodes of glaciation, and brief interglacials. There were also related sea-level and tectonic responses. The known history of European rivers in this period is individually varied, but is predominantly marked by multiple stages of episodic incision the form of which changed in style at around the 'mid-Pleistocene transition'. It is suggested that the nature of climatic oscillations, the dating of incision episodes and the processes that achieve this incision are as yet insufficiently understood.
   Fluvial process studies suggest that the onset of incision may broadly relate to changes in slope, discharge, sediment load and calibre, and bedrock erodibility, and these may all have been transformed as the direct or indirect result of mid-Pleistocene climatic changes. Common properties of basal sediments on strath terraces suggest that it was during the extended but variable cold-stage episodes that both valley deepening and lateral widening occurred, and that climatic change was the principal driver of episodic deep valley incision.

TI Implications of sea level variability on the formation and evolution of
   subtropical Rainbow Beach patterned fen complexes, Queensland, Australia
SO HOLOCENE
AB The Great Sandy National Park [K'gari (Fraser Island) and Cooloola] contains the largest subtropical patterned fen complexes in the world. These globally significant, groundwater-dependent ecosystems have been previously studied in relatively undisturbed areas on K'gari and were suggested to be resilient to changes in hydrology, sea level and wildfires. The Rainbow Beach patterned fens are under-studied systems thought to be formed in local perched aquifers. The palaeoenvironmental conditions required for the formation and continuation of these peatlands, and how they react to changes in hydroclimate, sea level and human activities are uncertain. We attempt to resolve this ambiguity using proxies for vegetation and environmental changes over the last similar to 12,770 cal yr BP from a sediment core located in the Rainbow Beach patterned fen complex. We infer the formation of an aquitard layer and Empodisma minus mire development at similar to 12,770 cal yr BP, with conditions conducive for patterning similar to 12,000-10,000 cal yr BP. Paludification occurred in the early Holocene, coincident with increased sea levels, which expanded the mire inland. Increased salt marsh taxa during this period coincides with decreased E. minus values, while further peatland development occurred similar to 4200 cal yr BP, suggesting that marine influences greatly effect these coastal peatlands. Evidence of vegetation thickening associated with post-European fire suppression was observed. Compared to those on K'gari, the Rainbow Beach complex appears to have initiated through different processes and show greater sensitivity to changes in sea levels. Therefore, subtropical patterned fens should be assessed independently to identify individual trajectories and sensitivities.

TI Lake evolution and its implication for environmental changes in China
   during 1950-2000
SO JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
AB Lakes in China have undergone considerable environmental changes during the past 50 years, e.g. lake level, water area changes, as did in the past several thousands years. The enhanced human activities, such as land reclamation, application of chemical fertilizer, land use and cover, irrigation and industrialization in the catchment etc., have played an important role on the recent decades' changes of these lakes, although constrained to a great extent by the natural impact. Comparative study on variations of lake volume (water level, depth and area) in the eastern and western lake regions of China during 1950-2000 indicated that, lake volume in the eastern region had approximately undergone a two-stage change, i.e. a dramatic decrease from the 1950s to 1970s, and a continuous increase between the 1980s and 1990s; while, in the western region, lake volume had been decreasing nearly all the time. Further studies on some typical lakes concluded that, climatic change was a primary factor for the variations of lake volume during the past 50 years, although human activities showed important effect.

TI The record of climatic change in the geological archives of shallow
   marine, coastal, and adjacent lowland areas of Northern Germany
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB The record of climatic change in shallow marine, coastal, and adjacent lowland areas has been investigated by three different approaches. A mass balance study focused on the interaction between sea-level rise and Holocene sediment accumulation in the coastal lowland area between the Ems and Weser rivers on the German North Sea coast. This region, which comprises various sedimentary environments, such as barrier islands, sheltered and open tidal flats, bay flats, and estuaries, is highly suitable for such quantitative studies, which can be used to create a model for general mass transport and accumulation processes connected with transgressions over coastal lowlands.
   An integrated geochemical and,microfacies study was made to assess the response of shallow marine, intertidal, and limnic-semiterrestrial environments to the climate-controlled Holocene sea-level rise. The factors controlling the development of various palaeoenvironments were estimated from the distribution of biomarkers, major and trace elements, diatoms, foraminifera and sedimentary structures observed at high resolution in core sections. These data complement those of conventional geological, lithostratigraphical, archaeological and geobotanical investigations.
   The extensive raised bogs which occur in the Pleistocene hinterland, adjacent to the coastal zone, provided an excellent opportunity to examine peat formation in response to climatic changes in the past. On the basis of a large number of C-14-age determinations special attention was paid to the onset and regional expansion of raised bogs in this region and to the question of whether or not the formation of raised bog peat started synchronously in one or in a series of different phases.

TI A new composite Holocene sea-level curve for the northern Gulf of Mexico
SO RESPONSE OF UPPER GULF COAST ESTUARIES TO HOLOCENE CLIMATE CHANGE AND
   SEA-LEVEL RISE
SE Geological Society of America Special Papers
AB A composite Holocene sea-level curve for the northern Gulf of Mexico coastal region was constructed using basal or bayline peat and swash-zone deposits determined from careful facies analysis. Initial work involved an assessment of published sea-level datums for the region, which show wide scatter. Reevaluation of individual data points based on sea-level-specific criteria required exclusion of most of these data from the composite curve. Additionally, variations in the age of the radiocarbon reservoir across the region were determined, and site-specific corrections were applied to the sample ages, further increasing the accuracy of the final sea-level curve, which is used in our reconstruction of the evolution of the bays of the region in companion papers herein.
   The refined regional sea-level curve indicates that site-to-site variations in relative sea-level rise across the coastal plain spanning central Texas to Alabama are minimal. The data indicate rapid and possibly episodic rise during the early Holocene, followed by slower and more continuous rise during the middle and late Holocene. In addition, the new composite regional curve unequivocally plots sea level from -10 to -3 m below present from 8000 cal B. P. to 4000 cal B. P., which precludes the occurrence of a middle Holocene highstand above present sea level in this region. Last, a comparison of our composite curve to Caribbean sea-level curves suggests that coastal subsidence within the study area over the past several thousand years has been minimal. A comparison of the late Holocene record of sea-level rise to satellite altimetry and tide-gauge records indicates that rates of rise have increased by an order of magnitude over the past century.

TI Mangrove sediment carbon stocks along an elevation gradient: Influence
   of the late Holocene marine regression (New Caledonia)
SO MARINE GEOLOGY
AB Among blue carbon ecosystems, mangroves are very efficient in storing carbon in their sediments over decadal to millennial time scales. However, this ability varies with numerous parameters, including climate and sea-level variations. In New Caledonia, mangrove ecosystems develop in semi-arid conditions with a typical zonation: Rhizophora spp. colonize the seaward side of the intertidal area, while wAvicennia marina develops at higher elevations, just below the salt-flat. Within this context, we determined both the quantity (organic carbon content and carbon stocks) and the characteristics (carbon over nitrogen ratios (C/N), stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes, radiocarbon age) of the organic matter stored beneath each mangrove stands. Carbon stocks were determined down to different limits with depth: approximate extension of the root systems, one-meter depth, and the hard substrate. Within the extension of the root systems, the sediment carbon stock was lower than 100 MgC ha(-1) regardless of the mangrove species. This low value resulted directly from the dry climate that limits mangrove productivity. At depth beneath every zone, a buried layer enriched in mangrove-derived organic matter, with C/N values around 40 and delta C-13 values around -26 parts per thousand was observed. This layer likely resulted from a sea-level high stand during the late Holocene that allowed a long period of stability of the mangrove, slowly accumulating organic matter within the sediment. In this buried layer, the carbon stock was higher than in the upper sediment and reached up to 665, 255 and 300 MgC ha(-1) in the salt-flat zone, the A. marina stand and the R. spp. stand, respectively. The highest stock, determined beneath the salt-flat, was suggested to be related to a period of sea-level stability that lasted similar to 3000 years, whereas beneath the other zones, which are at lower elevations, mangrove colonization was more recent and the sea-level was continuously decreasing till recently. Sea level variations, and, specifically current sea-level rise, may strongly influence mangrove development due to their migration along the tidal elevation gradient to maintain the biotic conditions needed for their development.

TI COMPARATIVE RESEARCH ON ENVIRONMENTAL EVOLUTION BETWEEN THE REGION OF

SO SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES B-CHEMISTRY LIFE SCIENCES & EARTH SCIENCES
AB Through comparative analysis between the environmental changes in the region of King George Island in Antarctic and the characteristics of environmental evolution in the different regions of China, the paper reveals the important similarity of the environmental evolution between the two regions.  The fine correspondence relations between the environmental changes of King George Island region in Antarctic, the glacial activities on the mountainous terrain in the western part of China, and the oscillation of the northern boundary of subtropical zone in the eastern part of China pointed out in this study serve as evidence to support the interaction between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  The uniformity of the climatic changes of the King George Island region in Antarctic with the changes of sea level of China and the world also supports the similarity of the trend of global changes in temperature since the Holocene.  One must pay attention to the macroscopic and integrated study of the whole earth in order to establish the global scientific laws.

AB The coastal area of southeastern Sicily (Italy) is undergoing weak land subsidence, heavy coastal retreat, land flooding and exposed to severe storms associated with high-waves, also in consequence of the global sea level rise, which is expected to raise even more that 1 m by 2100 AD depending on different estimates. This value will be even larger in subsiding coasts, entailing widespread environmental changes, coastal retreat, marine flooding and loss of land, which will be subtracted to human activities.
   To understand the impact of rising sea level on the coast of Maddalena Peninsula, near the town of Siracusa, we realized a very high resolution Digital Terrain Model (DTM) through aerial photogrammetric surveys, obtained by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) on which we projected the expected coastline for 2100 AD.
   Here we show a detailed marine flooding scenario for 2100, as generated from: i) high resolution DTM, ii) rate of land subsidence from GPS data and iii) predicted sea level projections from the IPCC AR5 reports (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). Our analysis estimates a maximum relative sea level rise at 0.20 m and 0.65 m for 2050 AD and 2100 AD, respectively for AR 8.5 scenario. The increased sea levels will cause relevant morphological changes to the investigated coast with a maximum beach retreat of 27 m and a loss of land of 7400 m(2), affecting building integrity and people safety.

TI Modeling Coastal Environmental Change and the Tsunami Hazard
SO FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB The hazard from earthquake-generated tsunami waves is not only determined by the earthquake's magnitude and mechanisms, and distance to the earthquake area, but also by the geomorphology of the nearshore and onshore areas, which can change over time. In coastal hazard assessments, a changing coastal environment is commonly taken into account by increasing the sea-level to projected values (static). However, sea-level changes and other climate-change impacts influence the entire coastal system causing morphological changes near- and onshore (dynamic). We compare the run-up of the same suite of earthquake-generated tsunamis to a barrier island-marsh-lagoon-marsh system for statically adjusted and dynamically adjusted sea level and bathymetry. Sea-level projections from 2000 to 2100 are considered. The dynamical adjustment is based on a morphokinetic model that incorporates sea-level along with other climate-change impacts. We employ Representative Concentration Pathways 2.6 and 8.5 without and with treatment of Antarctic Ice-sheet processes (known as K14 and K17) as different sea-level projections. It is important to note that we do not account for the occurrence probability of the earthquakes. Our results indicate that the tsunami run-up hazard for the dynamic case is approximately three times larger than for the static case. Furthermore, we show that nonlinear and complex responses of the barrier island-marsh-lagoon-marsh system to climate change profoundly impacts the tsunami hazard, and we caution that the tsunami run-up is sensitive to climate-change impacts that are less well-studied than sea-level rise.

TI Stratigraphic signatures of climatic change during the Holocene
   evolution of the Tigris-Euphrates delta, lower Mesopotamia
SO GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
AB Fluctuations in climate, sea level and sedimentation rates, in addition to the neotectonic activity, during the geological evolution of the Tigris-Euphrates delta (in the last 10,000 years) had resulted in the deposition of various sedimentary units. Previously, five main stratigraphic units, with other sub-units, have been identified by the author during the study of the Holocene deltaic successions of Lower Mesopotamia and as based upon the results of petrological, geochemical, palaeontological and radiometric analyses of his PhD dissertation. Each unit has been produced through various depositional and diagenetic processes in addition to the dominant climate. Such processes together have been clearly recorded in the forms of either the authigenic minerals occurring in each sequence, particularly the Ca-Mg carbonates, evaporites and clay minerals, the biological activities represented by shell remains of molluscs, foraminifers and ostracods, or the preservation of organic matters within organic-rich layers. This review discusses the impact climatic changes had on the accumulated sedimentary facies during the Holocene evolution of the Tigris-Euphrates delta.
   Arid climate dominated the study area in the early Holocene after a long period of the wetter conditions of Pleistocene. Such a climatic change has resulted in the formation of gypcretes rich in palygorskite and dolomite occurring within the calcareous fluvial-plain muds, similar to the modern fluvial plain deposits. However, the sediments were highly admired with coarser sandy deposits of playa and aeolian sources in the western desertic margins, and with older reworked sands of Zagros foothills to the Northeast of Lower Mesopotamia.
   During the mid-Holocene marine invasion, when the climate became wetter as well, brackish-water/marine sedimentary sub-units were deposited, overlying the previous fluvial plain deposits. The deposition starred with a transitional sub-unit flourishing over the older early Holocene gypcrete deposits signaling the marine transgression. The best preservation of organic matters occurred beneath this sub-unit. This sub-unit, which is also characterised by microcrystalline mixing zone dolomite, was followed by the deposition of another sub-unit rich in molluscs and foraminifera that collected during the transgressive period.
   After about 2000 years of maximum flooding (i.e. high stand period), a regressive tidal flat unit was deposited ending the marine/brackish-water deposition and signaling another climatic change towards a more arid setting around 4000 years ago. These climatic conditions are still continuous in the area and reflect the petrology of the modern salt-covered fluvial plain deposits of these rivers. However, marsh/lacustrine deposits and environments remained, covering some vast lowland parts the fluvial plains, but further inland to the north of the present-day northern Gulf coasts. Complex implications of neotectonic activities, sea-level fluctuations and differential sedimentation rates in addition to the climatic changes during Holocene have resulted in the formation and preservation of these unique marshlands, which are still covering most parts of the ancient Tigris-Euphrates-Karun delta.

TI SEA-LEVEL CHANGES - CONSEQUENCES FOR THE SOUTHERN-HEMISPHERE
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
AB One of the measurable symptoms of man-induced climatic change is a global rise in mean sea-level.  A review of the suggested mechanisms for sea-level rise is given, supported by a critical discussion of present predictions and predictive models.  The data base on which these predictions are based is geographically inhomogeneous and particularly sparse in the Southern Hemisphere.  Some preliminary work which has been done on the possible environmental impact of sea-level rise on coastal areas is described, but very little of this is for Southern Hemisphere countries.  It is suggested that since the Southern Hemisphere has particular observational requirements because of a higher ratio of ocean to terrestrial areas, particular attention in international monitoring programmes be given to it.  This has special relevance to sea-level measurements in hostile environments such as off Antarctica.

TI Records and causes of Holocene salinity shifts in Laguna de Bay,
   Philippines
SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
AB A 7000-year record of salinity shifts from molluscan and diatom assemblages and verified geochemical salinity proxies (C/S, S, Sr, Ca, and Sr/Ba) is reconstructed from Philippines' largest freshwater lake Laguna de Bay. The salinity shifts are interplays of millennial-scale sea level change, centennial-scale tectonic activity from the West Marikina Valley Fault (WMVF) and decadal-scale climatic changes. Currently only 1 m above mean sea level, the lake is connected to Manila Bay through the Pasig-Napindan River, which meanders across a densely populated "Paranaque Strip" partly occupied by metropolitan Manila. The controversial WMVF borders the lake on its western shore. Our 10.5 m sediment core from the western lobe reveal that the deposits are from a marine environment deposited 6600 cal BP to 4700 cal BP during a sea level still stand above present mean sea level (apmsl) in Southeast Asia and the Philippines. Episodic decreases in salinity with 260 y cycles were traced to the activity of the WMVF that would have accounted for at least 6 m of uplift of the Paranaque Strip. The vertical component of movement raised a sill and emergent landmass that started to isolate the Paleo-Laguna de Bay from Manila Bay. Subsequent episodic uplifts and sea level fall decreased depths to intertidal levels by 4700 cal BP, salinity to brackish but highly-influenced by marine waters by 4100 cal BP and to freshwater by 3100 cal BP. The latest salinity increase since mid-1960 is attributed to renewed saltwater incursion due to abnormally dry years, low lake levels, and Pasig River delta plain subsidence.

TI Combined foraminiferal and thecamoebian environmental reconstruction
   from an isolation basin in NW Scotland: Implications for sea-level
   studies
SO JOURNAL OF FORAMINIFERAL RESEARCH
AB The sedimentary sequence preserved in the isolation basin at Loch nan Corr (NW Scotland) represents a high resolution record of environmental changes over the last 9.5 ka (virtually the entire Holocene). The final isolation of the basin from the sea is recorded over a 6 m sediment sequence lasting c. 7000 years as the rock sill of the basin passes through the intertidal zone. This isolation is due to relative sea-level fall associated with isostatic rebound from the melting of the Last Glacial Maximum ice sheet. Combining faunal counts of foraminifera and thecamoebians from the same sample preparations allows an accurate reconstruction of sea-level and environmental changes at this site over the Holocene. This study shows the potential for isolation basins in mesotidal areas to provide a series of sea-level index points from a single isolation contact thus improving the ease and accuracy of sea-level reconstructions. Biostratigraphic data improve our understanding of the ecology of foraminifera in these relatively unstudied rock-enclosed lagoonal ecosystems. It seems likely that Miliammina fusca can tolerate the generally low and highly variable salinities in these lagoonal settings more readily than any other foraminiferal species.

TI THE BEGINNING OF THE ICE-AGE IN EUROPE AND ITS MAJOR SUBDIVISIONS
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB The time range of the Quaternary is discussed in terms of the view that this period is essentially the one in the Earth's history in which during certain intervals inland ice developed in the northern hemisphere. This process first became evident about 2.3 Ma BP. Since then, the Quaternary thus defined has witnessed many climatic variations. Although for practical reasons it is not feasible to assign the status of `stage' to each distinctly warm or cold phase, climatic change is nevertheless the most appropriate basis for world-wide correlation. It seems possible to use both climatic change and other correlation parameters to arrive at a practicable subdivision of the Quaternary Period into stages.
   Before about 1 Ma, vegetational succession during interglacials in western Europe differed from that seen in later times. A possible cause for this divergence is discussed. In the later part of the Quaternary (after about 1 Ma) two distinct types of warm-temperate intervals occurred: one associated with high sea-levels and an oceanic climate, the other showing lower sea-levels and a cooler and more continental climate. The difference between these two types is shown by comparison of the distribution of Abies during these time intervals.

TI Response of the Great Barrier Reef to sea-level and environmental
   changes over the past 30,000 years
SO NATURE GEOSCIENCE
AB Previous drilling through submerged fossil coral reefs has greatly improved our understanding of the general pattern of sea-level change since the Last Glacial Maximum, however, how reefs responded to these changes remains uncertain. Here we document the evolution of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), the world's largest reef system, to major, abrupt environmental changes over the past 30 thousand years based on comprehensive sedimentological, biological and geochronological records from fossil reef cores. We show that reefs migrated seaward as sea level fell to its lowest level during the most recent glaciation (similar to 20.5-20.7 thousand years ago (ka)), then landward as the shelf flooded and ocean temperatures increased during the subsequent deglacial period (similar to 20-10 ka). Growth was interrupted by five reef-death events caused by subaerial exposure or sea-level rise outpacing reef growth. Around 10 ka, the reef drowned as the sea level continued to rise, flooding more of the shelf and causing a higher sediment flux. The GBR's capacity for rapid lateral migration at rates of 0.2-1.5 m yr(-1) (and the ability to recruit locally) suggest that, as an ecosystem, the GBR has been more resilient to past sea-level and temperature fluctuations than previously thought, but it has been highly sensitive to increased sediment input over centennial-millennial timescales.

TI Sea-level rise trends in the Attico-Cycladic region (Aegean Sea) during
   the last 5000 years
SO GEOMORPHOLOGY
AB Sea-level change during the last 18,000 years is a combination of eustatic, isostatic and tectonic contributions. In an effort to minimize the tectonic contributions, our study of sea-level changes in the Aegean Sea within historical times is focused on the aseismic Attico-Cycladic geotectonic zone. On the basis of archaeological information and radiocarbon dating of coastal sedimentological formations, a sea-level curve for the Attico-Cycladic massif has been constructed for the past 5000 years and compared with existing curves. According to this curve, the rapid increase of sea level concluded prior to 5.5 ka and was followed by a slow steady rise at a rate of 0.9 mm/a up to its present stage. The latter is attributed primarily to the process of thermal expansion and secondarily to the residual melting of the glaciers and existing icecaps. By extrapolation of the curve, the sea level at the end of the 20th century is predicted to be about 9 cm higher than the present level; this value is much lower than the prediction of the last IPCC report (49 cm). If higher SLR rates are realised in the next few decades, then the excess 40 cm of the IPCC prediction can be attributed to human-induced global climatic change. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB The Oligocene-Miocene Port Vincent Limestone is one of several Tertiary units exposed along coastal cliffs on the western side of the St. Vincent Basin and can be traced off-shore via bore holes, where it reaches a maximum thickness of 125 m. The limestone has a cool-water bryozoan-dominated skeletal assemblage. It exhibits contrasting physical characteristics, with soft and friable, highly porous bryozoan limestone punctuated by several sharp and distinctive 0.5- to 1-m-thick layers of hard calcarenite. Sedimentologically, the succession is divided into three informal members. The lower member comprises two transgressive facies, a bryozoan miliolid-echinoid packstone/rudstone and a bryozoan bivalve floatstone. The middle member is the largest and comprises five, meter-scale, hardground-bounded, asymmetric, warming-upward subtidal cycles. Warming was brought about by an overall temperature rise in the environment (climatic changes and/or oceanic currents), acting in concert with a relative fall in sea level which brought the depositional surface into shallower and warmer near-shore illuminated environments. Marine cementation at the top of each cycle created a hard substrate, which dictated the type of fauna and flora above. The upper member comprises fine, highly abraded bryozoan-Eponides grainstone facies, which represents deposition on an outer middle ramp. Lateral and vertical facies analysis indicate that the Port Vincent Limestone was deposited in a transgressive cool-water carbonate ramp environment, extending from the inner ramp to an outer middle ramp. Cyclicity suggests that episodic warmer water interruptions brought about by fluctuating sea level (relative fall/rise) and climatic changes, occurred several times during deposition. Lithological and petrophysical Variations are attributed to regional environmental changes and were later accentuated by selective diagenesis.

TI Late Holocene sea-level rise in Tampa Bay: Integrated reconstruction
   using biomarkers, pollen, organic-walled dinoflagellate cysts, and
   diatoms
SO ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
AB A suite of organic geochemical, micropaleontological and palynological proxies was applied to sediments from Southwest Florida, to study the Holocene environmental changes associated with sea-level rise. Sediments were recovered from Hillsborough Bay, part of Tampa Bay, and studied using biomarkers, pollen, organic-walled dinoflagellate cysts and diatoms. Analyses show that the site flooded around 7.5 ka as a consequence of Holocene transgression, progressively turning a fresh/brackish marl-marsh into a shallow, restricted marine environment. Immediately after the marine transgression started, limited water circulation and high amounts of runoff caused stratification of the water column. A shift in dinocysts and diatom assemblages to more marine species, increasing concentrations of marine biomarkers and a shift in the Diol Index indicate increasing salinity between 7.5 ka and the present, which is likely a consequence of progressing sea-level rise. Reconstructed sea surface temperatures for the past 4 kyrs are between 25 and 26 degrees C, and indicate stable temperatures during the Late Holocene. A sharp increase in sedimentation rate in the top similar to 50 cm of the core is attributed to human impact. The results are in agreement with parallel studies from the area, but this study further refines the environmental reconstructions having the advantage of simultaneously investigating changes in the terrestrial and marine environment.

TI West Greenland's cod-to-shrimp transition: Local dimensions of climatic
   change
SO ARCTIC
AB West Greenland's transition from a cod-fishing to a shrimp-fishing economy, ca. 1960-90, provides a case study in the human dimensions of climatic change. Physical, biological, and social systems interacted in complex ways to affect coastal communities. For this integrated case study, we examine linkages between atmospheric conditions (including the North Atlantic Oscillation), ocean circulation, ecosystem conditions, fishery activities, and the livelihoods and population changes of two West Greenland towns: Sisimiut, south of Disko Bay, and Paamiut, on the southwest coast. Sisimiut prospered as a fishing center through the cod-to-shrimp transition. Paamiut, more specialized in cod fishing, declined. Their stories suggest two general propositions about the human dimensions of climatic change. First, socially important environmental changes result not simply from climatic change, but from interactions between climate, ecosystem, and resource usage. Second, environmental changes affect people differentially and through interactions with social factors. Social networks and cohesion (social capital) are important, in addition to skills (human capital), investments (physical capital), and alternative resources (natural capital): all shape how the benefits and costs are distributed.

TI Sedimentation strategies provide effective but limited mitigation of
   relative sea-level rise in the Mekong delta
SO COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
AB Improved sediment management can only partially compensate for anthropogenic-accelerated subsidence in the Mekong delta, but can buy time to mitigate and adapt to rising sea levels according to combined projections of subsidence, compaction, sea-level rise and fluvial sediment delivery.
   The Mekong delta is experiencing rapid environmental change due to anthropogenic activities causing accelerated subsidence, sea-level rise and sediment starvation. Consequentially, the delta is rapidly losing elevation relative to sea level. Designating specific areas for sedimentation is a suggested strategy to encourage elevation-building with nature in deltas. We combined projections of extraction-induced subsidence, natural compaction and global sea-level rise with new projections of fluvial sediment delivery to evaluate the potential effectiveness of sedimentation strategies in the Mekong delta to 2050. Our results reveal that with current rates of subsidence and sediment starvation, fluvial sediments alone can only preserve elevation locally, even under optimistic assumptions, and organic sedimentation could potentially assume a larger role. While sedimentation strategies alone have limited effectiveness in the present context, combined with enhanced organic matter retention and interventions reducing anthropogenic-accelerated subsidence, they can considerably delay future relative sea-level rise, buying the delta crucial time to adapt.

TI Vegetation evolution and its response to climatic change during
   3.15-0.67 Ma in deep-sea pollen record from northern South China Sea
SO CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN
AB In order to study vegetation evolution and environmental change during 3.15-0.67 Ma, a total of 608 pollen samples with an average time resolution of 4 ka has been analyzed from ODP Site 1145 (water depth 3175 m), northern South China Sea. The deep-sea sediments (213.62-91.9 m) cover from 3.15 to 0.67 Ma based on micropaleonotological stratigraphy. The characteristic features of the pollen diagram include that, pollen influx rises twice obviously around 2.58 Ma and during 2.0-1.8 Ma, in response to global climatic cooling and winter monsoon enhancement. Before 2.58 Ma, tropical and subtropical vegetation, mainly evergreen Quercus (E) and Altingia, predominated around northern SCS with much more tropical montane conifers and ferns relatively. From 2.58 Ma, temperate vegetation increased obviously, implying climatic cooling and winter monsoon enhancement. Spectral analysis shows that percentage variation in tropical and subtropical taxa has a strong 20 ka procession cycle probably due to the summer monsoon; while pollen influx has 100, 41 and 19 ka cycles, indicating the sea level and winter monsoon change response to the ice-sheet variations.

TI Stone Age archaeological sites and environmental changes during the
   Holocene in the NW region of Russia
SO GEOLOGY AND ARCHAEOLOGY: SUBMERGED LANDSCAPES OF THE CONTINENTAL SHELF
SE Geological Society Special Publication
AB The region of NW Russia connecting with the Baltic Sea presents a dynamic ecological system that was sensitive to environmental changes during the Holocene. Certain factors affected environmental changes in the region during the Holocene: deglaciation processes, that finally terminated about 9 cal ka BP; eustatic sea-level changes; and tectonic movements, which are basically considered in the region as isostatic uplift processes. Contextual remains of ancient human occupation sites can be the only evidence of surface stabilization in monotonous sediments, such as aquatic and subaquatic deposits. Prehistoric settlements also mark ancient shorelines. The latter is of great importance for studying the history of water oscillations and coastal-line displacements on the territory of NW Russia. The transgressive-regressive stages of the Baltic Sea (at c. 10.15 cal ka BP, the Ancylus transgression; at c. 7.6-7.0 cal ka BP, the Littorina transgression) have an impact on the positions of prehistorical sites. The complex investigations of the Stone Age archaeological settlements on the Karelian Isthmus and in the Dvina-Lovat' basin, and their altitudes below sea level, allowed us to reconstruct palaeoenvironmental changes during the Holocene, the chronology of cultural-historical processes and the adaptation strategy of ancient people to environmental conditions in this territory.

TI Holocene shoreline displacement on the Gungnam Plain, Buyeo, near the
   central west coast of South Korea inferred from diatom assemblages
SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
AB Diatom analyses of core GN-2 and trench Tr-1 taken from Gungnam Plain, on the lower reach of Geum River, are conducted to verify the Holocene shoreline displacement near the central west coast of South Korea. Age-controlled diatom profiles of GN-2 and Tr-1 record the history in responses of depositional environments to changes in sea level. Four diatom zones in GN-2 and two in Tr-1 were established. During Zone I (ca. 8400-6500 BP in Tr-1 and ca. 7100-6800 BP in GN-1), the depositional environment was an inner bay to a mud tidal flat. From 6800 to 4300 BP (Zone II of GN-1 and Tr-1), the former environments were replaced by brackish conditions with sediments deposited under a sea level high stand. Zone II also contains reworked sediments resulting from a temporary drop in sea level. Between 4300 BP and 400 BP (middle to upper part of Zone III of GN-1), there were stable freshwater environments with few diatoms after sea level fluctuations. Finally, during Zone IV (400 BP - Present), the depositional environments changed to freshwater marshlands. The multi-proxy data reflect the tendency of sea level variations in the Gungnam Plain from 8410 to 4330 BP. Around 8400 BP, the sea level reached an elevation of 1.14 m a.s.l. due to an early Holocene transgression. Overall, the sea level around the Gungnam Plain continued to rise from ca. 8400 to 6500 BP, although there was a temporary drop between 6800 BP and 6500 BP. At present, the spring tide has a range of 6.64 m (mean tide level 3.32 m) in Kunsan Harbor and local flood tides. The mean sea level in the Gungnam Plain about 6500 BP may have reached an elevation of 3.40 m a.s.l., corresponding to or slightly higher than the present sea level. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

TI Using GIS to unlock the interactions between biogeography, environment,
   and evolution in Middle and Late Devonian brachiopods and bivalves
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB The Late Devonian was a time of profound evolutionary and environmental change associated with the Frasnian-Famennian biodiversity crisis. One way to unravel the faunal dynamics of this complex crisis is to document the spatial and temporal patterns associated with biodiversity decline. This analysis investigates the relationship between biogeography, relative sea level, and environmental changes in Laurentian brachiopod and bivalve species during the Givetian through Famennian Stages (upper Middle to terminal Devonian). Representatives from all major brachiopod and bivalve clades and paleocommunities were examined to provide a cross-faunal comparison. Species' ranges were reconstructed both spatially and temporally (at the level of conodont zones) using GIS to understand the timing and extent of species invasions and the importance of geographic range during the crisis interval. Species' geographic ranges were linked closely with both relative sea-level change and depositional environment and expanded as relative sea-level rose. In addition, times of interbasinal species invasions corresponded closely with sea-level rises that breached tectonic barriers.
   Species with larger geographic ranges were more resistant to extinction during the Late Devonian. This relationship is reflected partly in a general trend towards increased extinction resistance in taxa that are found farther offshore in environments that potentially included more area. For example, there is an increased survival advantage for species that inhabited the middle and outer platform environments, though not for species inhabiting the open shelf. Additionally, species whose Givetian to Frasnian history includes at least one interbasinal invasion event were more likely to survive the Late Devonian biodiversity crisis than noninvasive species; this may have relevance for our understanding of the current biodiversity crisis, given the role that invasive species are playing in mediating modern extinctions.

TI Black Sea outflow response to Holocene meltwater events
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB During the Holocene, North American ice sheet collapse and rapid sea-level rise reconnected the Black Sea with the global ocean. Rapid meltwater releases into the North Atlantic and associated climate change arguably slowed the pace of Neolithisation across southeastern Europe, originally hypothesized as a catastrophic flooding that fueled culturally-widespread deluge myths. However, we currently lack an independent record linking the timing of meltwater events, sea-level rise and environmental change with the timing of Neolithisation in southeastern Europe. Here, we present a sea surface salinity record from the Northern Aegean Sea indicative of two meltwater events at similar to 8.4 and similar to 7.6 kiloyears that can be directly linked to rapid declines in the establishment of Neolithic sites in southeast Europe. The meltwater events point to an increased outflow of low salinity water from the Black Sea driven by rapid sea level rise >1.4 m following freshwater outbursts from Lake Agassiz and the final decay of the Laurentide ice sheet. Our results shed new light on the link between catastrophic sea-level rise and the Neolithisation of southeastern Europe, and present a historical example of how coastal populations could have been impacted by future rapid sea-level rise.

TI A review of some concepts involved in the sea-level rise problem
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB This paper discusses the following items affecting the comprehension and evaluation of the "sea-level rise" phenomenon and an accurate determination of real present values and trends: (1) the question of the carbon dioxide increasing production rate related to its predictable atmospheric accumulation rate; (2) the question of the incidence of this further rate in the "greenhouse effect"; (3) the question of suitably discerning its real singular impact in the present climatic change and, consequently, of accurately predicting future trends, and (4) the question of relating the "sea-level rise" trend to short and long term trends of the "climate change". It discusses the subsidence factor in sea-level changes and its time-spatial variability and the different phenomena usually included in it, as a major element of confusion; the general and local factors and the different conditions between the Mediterranean and North-Atlantic (East-North America and Northwest Continental-European, where most of the surveys have been developed and issued) coasts. The paper also considers different impacts attributed to sea-level rise on coastal and shoreline evolution, critically analyzing some conclusions on coastal engineering and management.

TI Impact of neotectonics on the record of glacier and sea level
   fluctuations, Strait of Magellan, southern Chile
SO GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
AB This paper presents evidence for a neotectonic influence on Late Pleistocene/Holocene records of environmental change in the southern Strait of Magellan. We concentrate on one site, Puerto del Hambre, a key location for reconstructing palaeoenvironmental change in southernmost South America. We report geomorphological, structural geological, seismic and topographic data that all show the site has been affected by postglacial faulting. There is also indirect evidence from the site stratigraphy that the site has been displaced. Also, recent faulting explains some of the puzzles associated with interpretation of the palaeoenvironmental record at Puerto del Hambre. The implication of this work is that neotectonic faulting had a pervasive influence in the southern part of the Strait of Magellan and southernmost Tierra del Fuego, and thus affects glacial or sea level reconstructions in the area.

TI Model of wetland development of the Amapa coast during the late Holocene
SO ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
AB The modern vegetation types, sedimentary sequences, pollen records and radiocarbon dating obtained from three sediment cores from Calcoene Coastal Plain were used to provide a palaeoecological history during the late Holocene of Amapa coastal wetland according to flood regime, sea-level and climatic changes. Based on these records, four phases of vegetation development are presented and they probably reflect the interaction between the flow energy to the sediment accumulation and the brackish/freshwater influence in the vegetation. This work suggests interchanges among time periods characterized by marine and fluvial influence. The longitudinal profile did not reveal the occurrence of mangrove in the sediment deposited around 2100 yr B. P. During the second phase, the mud progressively filled the depressions and tidal channels. The mangrove probably started its development on the channel edge, and the herbaceous field on the elevated sectors. The third phase is characterized by the interruption of mangrove development and the increase of "varzea" vegetation that may be due to the decrease in porewater salinity related to a decrease in marine water influence. The last phase is represented by the mangrove and "varzea" increase. The correlation between current patterns of geobotanical unit distribution and palaeovegetation indicates that mangrove and "varzea" forests are migrating over the herbaceous field on the topographically highest part of the studied coast, which can be related to a relative sea-level rise.

TI Holocene mass-transport activity and climate in outer Isfjorden,
   Spitsbergen: marine and subsurface evidence
SO HOLOCENE
AB The analyses of high-resolution seismic data, swath bathymetry data and sediment cores from the basin Svensksunddjupet in IsfJorden, Spitsbergen, reveal the deposits of repeated slope failures. Most of the slope failures occurred during three periods at c. 9650 cal. BP, 8350-8200 cal. BP and 3000 cal. BP. Suggested factors causing instability of the slopes include earthquake activity resulting from rapid isostatic uplift, excess pore pressure caused by relative sea-level fall and/or the presence of gas as well as climatic changes. Mass-transport deposits at the mouth of an incision at the southern slope of Svensksunddjupet are suggested to mainly relate to runoff from the land-based glacier Vardebreen. The increase of the mass-transport activity may indicate that Vardebreen either formed or increased in size at c. 7000 cal. BP.

TI Population level models for testing hunter-gatherer resilience and
   settlement response to the combined impact of abrupt climatic events and
   sea level change: A case study from the Holocene of northern Britain
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB Isolating the impacts of abrupt climatic events on Holocene hunter-gatherers from those of gradual environmental change is methodologically challenging and conflicts with the lived experience of Mesolithic communities for whom the world was in continuous flux. We explore the combined impacts of abrupt climate events (ACEs) and gradual sea level change on the Mesolithic communities of northern Britain by using a summed calibrated probability distribution (SCPD) of radiocarbon dates as a population proxy, addressing sources of potential bias, including the history of research, differential site destruction, calibration effects and changes in settlement pattern. Our study is placed into a European context by reviewing studies that have reached contrasting conclusions about the impacts of ACEs on Holocene hunter-gatherer communities. We suggest such differences arise from variation in their specific ecological settings, cultural repertoires, and social environments, concluding that Holocene hunter gatherers in northern Britain were especially vulnerable to environmental change. 0 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Long-term vegetation dynamics of a tropical megadelta: Mid-Holocene
   palaeoecology of the Orinoco Delta (NE Venezuela)
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB Coastal wetlands have been proposed as highly threatened by the ongoing and future climatic change, including projected sea-level changes as an additional forcing factor compared to more inland locations. The limited knowledge generated to date in this topic has been primarily focused on those areas attaining a high population density, and rarely deals with long-term (>50 years) dynamics. Here we present the first Holocene palaeoecological study carried in the Orinoco Delta, in NE Venezuela. The record presented here contains sediments from the last 6200 years and is located in a river-shore swamp dominated by the palm Mauritia flexuosa. Current human occupation is almost restricted to small settlements of the Warao indigenous culture, closely related to the use of M. flexuosa and other palm species present in the zone. The results show the occurrence of three well-distinguished palynological zones: (i) from 6200 to 5200 cal yr BP, characterised by mixed rainforest and other taxa related to salinity (coastallike), low (negative) values of magnetic susceptibility and magnetic grain size, absence of transported clays, and the highest macrocharcoal particles abundance; (ii) from 5200 to 2950 cal yr BP, marked by a replacement of the mangrove-like vegetation by a more inland mixed-swamp forest community with low levels of charcoal, and (iii) from 2950 cal yr BP to present-day, characterised by the establishment of the current vegetation community, dominated by M. flexuosa, and an increasing trend in the charcoal curve since the last 700 years. A combination of regional (climatic changes) and local (sediment ontogeny) has been proposed as the key drivers influencing the vegetation succession recorded. The stabilisation of the sea-level that occurred during the mid-Holocene would have favoured the transgression of the coastal line, with the migration of the coastal-like vegetation seawards. Synchronous to this event, a trend towards drier conditions has been reported in the close Cariaco record, that could have also influenced the vegetation replacement. Between 3800 and 2800 years ago, the increased ENSO variability registered in Cariaco may have played a key role in the expansion of the Mauritia palm community. It is suggested that in our location, the potential inhabiting human populations were differently influenced by these environmental changes. First, the disappearance of the coastal resources could have favoured land abandonment, whereas the increase in the abundance of the palm might be influential for the arrival of other inland cultures that were previously used to manage Mauritia. This sequence shows the importance of the ecosystem services for the location inhabitants, highlighting the abandonment of the mid-Holocene culture coeval with the disappearance of its ecosystem. These results also provide information about the sensitivity and resilience in facing external stressors of both humans and vegetation, and will be valuable tools for managing the future of this ecosystem.

TI Sea-level and climatic controls on Aptian depositional environments of
   the Eastern Russian Platform
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB On the basis of a high-resolution chronostratigraphic framework of the Eastern Russian Platform, a comparison between Late Barremian-Aptian global and regional sea-level trends was performed. The detailed evaluation of the long-term (3rd order) Aptian sea-level cycle results in the recognition of sea-level and climate as controlling factors on depositional environments in the basin. The rising part of the Aptian sea-level cycle lasted from the Des hayesites tenuicostatusis Zone to the Deshayesites deshayesi Zone, and transgression is responsible for the local development of anoxia on the Eastern Russian Platform. The Lower Aptian bituminous shales and sheeted calcite concretions associated with the Eastern Russian Platform are interpreted as being a regional manifestation of Oceanic Anoxic Event OAR la. The Late Aptian "cold snap" that occurred during the Early Cretaceous greenhouse world coincided with a simultaneous global and regional sea-level lowstand, peak shallowing of the basin, and the almost complete absence of sediments due to subaerial exposure in the studied region. The global distribution of the lowstand gives clear evidence for sea-level fluctuations, and intrinsic climate control on sequences in the study area. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI POTENTIALITIES, UNCERTAINTIES AND COMPLEXITIES IN THE RESPONSE OF
   CORAL-REEFS TO FUTURE SEA-LEVEL RISE
SO EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
AB Coral islands formed of largely unconsolidated sands only a few metres above sea level are thought to be particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise consequent upon global warming. However, scenarios which predict catastrophic flooding and loss of island area need reassessment, particularly in the light of the continued downwards revision of projected rates of future sea-level rise. Revised questions concern the interactions between reef growth and sea-level change, biophysical constraints on coral growth, and the importance to reef systems of potential changes in the magnitude, frequency and location of tropical cyclones and hurricanes. It is clear that most reefs have the growth potential to meet even the highest of future sea-level rise scenarios, but too little is known about physiological and physical constraints to reef growth to adequately evaluate the importance of these two factors in constraining this potential at the present time. Future sea-level rise in the tropical oceans, and coral reef responses, will take place against a backdrop of inter-regional differences in Holocene sea levels, resulting from the varying interaction of eustatic and hydro-isostatic processes. These differences have generated varying constraints on the development of modern reefs and varying inherited topographies upon which future sea-level changes will be superimposed. These controls are particularly important in assessing differences in vulnerability to future sea-level rise for reef islands in the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea.

TI Social, hydro-ecological and climatic change in the southwest coastal
   region of Bangladesh
SO REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB This study investigates the historical development of the southwest coastal region of Bangladesh through the lens of human-delta co-evolutionary system. The change process of social and hydro-ecological systems is described based on the drivers-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework. The multiple physical and socio-economic drivers such as climatic change, upstream development, geologic process, land use change-affected river flow, salinity, water logging and cyclones are creating adverse impacts on ecology (e.g. mangrove forest) and society (e.g. population migration). Existing management practices such as the Coastal Embankment project (CEP) also created adverse impacts on social-ecological system. In addition to the geology of this region that plays the major role in the delta development process, human interventions such as large coastal development projects have intervened the land formation processes. The trends and impacts of these changes along the coast unfold the necessity of integrated management approach such as Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) and Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM). Comprehensive understanding of social and hydro-ecological system in southwest coastal region through DPSIR approach presented in this study can provide effective solution for implementing ongoing management strategies.

TI Timing and periodicity of Phanerozoic marine biodiversity and
   environmental change
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB We examine how the history of Phanerozoic marine biodiversity relates to environmental change. Our focus is on North America, which has a relatively densely sampled history. By transforming time series into the time-frequency domain using wavelets, histories of biodiversity are shown to be similar to sea level, temperature and oceanic chemistry at multiple timescales. Fluctuations in sea level play an important role in driving Phanerozoic biodiversity at timescales > 50 Myr, and during finite intervals at shorter periods. Subsampled and transformed marine genera time series reinforce the idea that Permian-Triassic, Triassic-Jurassic, and Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinctions were geologically rapid, whereas the Ordovician-Silurian and Late Devonian 'events' were longer lived. High cross wavelet power indicates that biodiversity is most similar to environmental variables (sea level, plate fragmentation, delta O-18, delta C-13, delta S-34 and Sr-87/Sr-86) at periods > 200 Myr, when they are broadly in phase (i.e. no time lag). They are also similar at shorter periods for finite durations of time (e.g. during some mass extinctions). These results suggest that long timescale processes (e.g. plate kinematics) are the primary drivers of biodiversity, whilst processes with significant variability at shorter periods (e.g. glacioeustasy, continental uplift and erosion, volcanism, asteroid impact) play a moderating role. Wavelet transforms are a useful approach for isolating information about times and frequencies of biological activity and commonalities with environmental variables.

TI Late Holocene mangrove dynamics of Marajo Island in Amazonia, northern
   Brazil
SO VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY
AB Two sediment cores from the eastern coastal region of Marajo Island, Para State, northern Brazil have been studied by pollen analysis to reconstruct late Holocene mangrove dynamics and environmental changes. Seven AMS radiocarbon dates provide time control. Mangrove vegetation became established at the Barra Velha site at about 2750 B.P. (2880 cal B.P.) and at the Praia do Pesqueiro, site at about 650 B.P. (670 cal B.P.). Rhizophora was the dominant mangrove tree throughout the recorded period, while Avicennia and Laguncularia were rare. Existing remnants of the former coastal Amazon rain forest were replaced by mangrove in the Barra Velha area between about 2750 and 740 B.P. (2880-760 cal B.P.) and at Praia do Pesqueiro area between about 650 and 530 B.P. (670-540 cal B.P.), suggesting a rise in relative sea level or, alternatively, an increase in discharge from the river Amazon. Areas of coastal shrub and herb vegetation, the so-called restinga vegetation, also became slightly reduced during the late Holocene. The largest area of mangrove at the two sites suggests that the highest sea level was probably reached during the last 200-250 years. The only evidence of human activity at the two sites is an indication of cattle pastureland at the Barra Velha area during the last decades.

AB The Late Pleistocene-Holocene (0-30 ka BP) allochthonous sedimentation in the Herodotus Basin of the eastern Mediterranean has been controlled, in part, by a combination of regional climatic change and eustatic sea-level fluctuation. A new series of radiocarbon dates, made on planktonic foraminifers and pteropod shells taken from the pelagic and hemipelagic intervals between individual turbidite units, has given bracketing dates for each major turbidity current event that deposited sand and mud on the Herodotus Basin plain. Two partly independent cycles are evident. Climate-induced cycles have lead to an alternation of periods of turbidites sourced from the Nile delta-fan system with those from the North African shelf and Anatolian rise. These correlate with pluvial and inter-pluvial climatic periods recognized in the Nile hinterland. Sea-level cycles have tended to focus turbidite emplacement, from whatever source, at periods of sea-level fall within the latest Wisconsin and sea-level rise from the Wisconsin-Holocene period. In addition to the Herodotus Basin Megaturbidite (HBM) described previously, six other beds with volumes in excess of 25 km(3) and wide lateral extent across the basin can be termed megaturbidites. There is no simple sea-level or climate control on the timing of these events, so we must conclude that triggering and emplacement of megaturbidites is independent and variable.

TI Lagoon islets as indicators of recent environmental changes in the South
   Pacific - The New Caledonian example
SO CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
AB The question of the impacts of climate change and sea level rise on small islands is currently much discussed. The many thousands of Pacific islands in their different contexts (geodynamic, climatic, etc.) and the insufficient data available explain why it is difficult to clearly discern the specific role of climate change in the recent evolution of these islands. To address this question, we investigated the recent changes affecting 21 islets in New Caledonia's lagoon. These islets are either located on small patch-reefs inside the New Caledonia Island lagoon or lie directly on the barrier reef. Based on the studies we conducted (field surveys, reconstruction of changes in the islets over the last decades, shoreline changes) we were able to define a typology of the islets that includes 6 stages and a life expectancy index. Using the life expectancy index, we found that of the 21 islets studied, 19% are in a highly critical situation, meaning they are very likely to be endangered in the short term (within the next few years), 9.5% are in a critical situation, i.e., likely to disappear in the near future and very likely to disappear in the medium term (next few decades), 19% are evolving rapidly, which could lead to their disappearance in the medium term but not in the short term, 9.5% are not endangered in the short and medium term and 43% are not endangered at all (stable or accreting, large area, relatively higher altitude). In this context, the rise in sea level induced by climate change is an adverse factor which is likely to lower the resilience of the islets to erosion processes. Other factors like the degradation of the reef ecosystem due to variations in ocean salinity, temperature and acidity, lower sediment stocks on the beaches and foreshores, human visitors, coastal development and so on are other adverse factors that could modify the capacity for resilience of these islets. Due to their variety and sensitivity, New Caledonia's islets could thus serve as integrative indicators of environmental and climatic change for New Caledonia. (C) 2016 The Authors.

TI Geography in Vietnam
SO JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY-CHIGAKU ZASSHI
AB There have been four periods in the development of geography in modern Vietnam since 1954: 1954-1959, 1960-1974, 1975-1985, after 1986. Since 1990, faculties of geography in Vietnam have been modified to include new fields of study with a liberal policy from geography research methods and geography education under the influence of the former Soviet Union. Traditional physical geography includes soil science, geomorphology, climatology, and vegetation subjects with GIS, remote sensing, ecology, and sustainability recently added. In recent years, human geography has included rural geography, urban geography, social geography, tourism studies, and sustainable development studies. Considering global climate change and sea-level change, Vietnamese geographers are interested in studying the natural environmental and environmental change, and are aggressively promoting environmental change studies, especially on coastal areas. Vietnamese students studying in Japan are the main drivers of environmental change studies after returning to Vietnam.

TI Holocene mangrove and coastal environmental changes in the western
   Ganga-Brahmaputra Delta, India
SO VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY
AB A 50 m-long radiocarbon dated core was studied through sediment and pollen analysis to reconstruct the Holocene mangrove and environmental changes at a coastal site Pakhiralaya in the Sundarban Biosphere Reserve in the western Ganga-Brahmaputra Delta, India. This biosphere reserve harbours a diverse mangrove ecosystem and supports a large number of people living in the area. Pollen and stratigraphic data indicate the existence of a brackish water estuarine mangrove swamp forest in this area during the last 9880 cal yr B.P. The development of the mangrove forest is not shown continuously in the Holocene record. Rapid transgression of the sea (9240 cal yr B.P.) halted the development of the mangrove. After about 8420 cal yr B.P. mangrove recolonised the area and persisted until 7560 cal yr B.P. as a result of a balance between the sedimentation and sea level fluctuation. The mangrove disappeared again from the site until 4800 cal yr B.P. because of a high sedimentation rate and possible delta progradation with loss of habitats. The reappearance of mangrove at the study site occurred with a return of a brackish water estuarine environment and the site then gradually became supra tidal during the mid-late Holocene. The continuity of the mangrove development and dynamics was interrupted by the fluctuating sea levels. Climatic fluctuations were viewed as an indirect factor influencing the mangrove ecosystem.

TI Ocean Circulations, Heat Budgets, and Future Commitment to Climate
   Change
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES, VOL 36
SE Annual Review of Environment and Resources
AB Earth's surface will continue to warm for decades, and the sea level to rise for centuries, even if the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) is held fixed at current levels. This is referred to as "committed" climate change because it is essentially unavoidable. Committed climate change arises clue to the large thermal inertia of the oceans and their consequent time lag in adjusting to altered GHG concentrations. This work describes the basic heat balance of the oceans, the physical reasons for the long time lag in ocean temperature and sea-level rise, and the observational evidence for human-induced ocean warming over the past 50 years.

TI Sea-level fluctuations during the last 8600 years in the de la Plata
   river (Argentina)
SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
AB The de la Plata river, considered from the geomorphologic point of view, can be defined as a unit composed of a set of features genetically linked together which were formed as a result of the post-Last Glacial Maximum transgression. Regional stratigraphical, morphological and topographical studies carried out in the de la Plata river and surrounding areas of eastern Argentina determined that the Holocene evolution of the area was the result of processes resulting from relative sea-level fluctuations. In order to date the different stages of evolution, a curve of sea-level fluctuations was constructed after a selective choosing of samples with reliable ages supported by field geological evidence.
   The curve shows a rapid initial transgressive event and the maximum highstand of mean sea level at 6000 yr BP at a relative elevation of +6.5 in above present. The following regressive event was characterized by a discontinuous fall in sea level.
   Geomorphological evidence suggests that sea-level fall could have experienced minor changes in rate as well as moments of stability that are not shown by the curve. Short interruptions in the geological record can be explained either by the same minor changes in sea level or by a change in wave regime. Correlation of transgressive-regressive events with paleoclimatic and biogeographic information proposed that Holocene sea-level fluctuations in the de la Plata river were mainly controlled by climatic changes.

TI Holocene evolution and signature of environmental change of the Burullus
   lagoon (Nile Delta) deciphered from a long sediment record
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB This study presents high-resolution multi-proxy analyses of a well-dated sediment core (BR-1, 19.20 m long) retrieved from the Nile Delta, aiming to reconstruct the Holocene evolution of the Burullus lagoon. In particular, we focus on the morphodynamical processes, sediment provenances and related hydro-climatic changes. The Holocene strata of the lagoon coast comprise Early-Holocene marine transgressive facies and the Mid-Late Ho-locene retrogressive deltaic facies. Although BR-1 shows no river-channel facies, two peaks of magnetic sus-ceptibility (MS) at ca. 8.0-7.0 ka (also associated with a high sedimentation rate of 50 mm/yr) and 3.5-2.0 ka evoke phases of greater morphodynamic influence of palaeo-Nile branches on the lagoon's development. Both dated peat layers (ca. 13 m and 8 m below MSL) and lagoon muds intercalated in BR-1, together with previously-dated peat strata were benchmarked relatively to MSL for the reconstruction of relative Holocene sea level in the study area. Our results show considerable land lowering on the Burullus coast indicated by a sea-level elevation, ca. 4-1 m lower than the one reconstructed along adjacent coastlines where less land subsidence occurred. The lagoon system began to form after ca. 6.0 ka in response to deceleration in sea-level rise and, being a shallower water body, both macrofauna (Cerastoderma glaucum etc.) and ostracods (Cyprideis torosa) of brackish-water nature emerged. In addition, geochemical data from BR-1 provide insights into environmental change in asso-ciation with basin-wide hydro-climate fluctuations. Concomitant peaks in Fe/Al, Ti/Al and Cr/Al ratios (mafic origin), together with higher Zr/Al and Hf/Al ratios (felsic origin) before ca. 8.0 ka suggest sediment provenances derived from the White and the Blue Nile during the main African Humid Period (AHP). Since then, Ti/Al kept slightly ascending core-upwards with two pulses at 7.8-7.3 ka and 3.5-2.0 ka, which was asynchronous to Zr/Al and Hf/Al. This corroborates more sediments of basaltic origin transported to the delta coast after the main AHP due to southerly shift in the position of the ITCZ. The two periods of Ti/Al pulse are consistent with the MS peaks in BR-1, suggesting that palaeo-Nile branches remained active during 8.0-7.0 ka and 3.0-2.0 ka nearby.

TI Holocene sea-level change and the emergence of Neolithic seafaring in
   the Fuzhou Basin (Fujian, China)
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB Neolithic seafaring across the Taiwan Strait began approximately 5000 years ago and involved open-sea voyages over distances of at least 130 km. Rapid sea-level rise preceded the emergence of open-sea voyaging, but the possible role of environmental change as a stimulus for the development of seafaring is poorly understood. We investigate this problem by presenting a record of Holocene sea-level change and coastal transformation based on sediment cores obtained from the Fuzhou Basin on the coast of Fujian, China. The cores are located in direct proximity to archaeological sites of the Tanshishan Neolithic culture (5000-4300 cal BP), which is significant for its similarity to the earliest Neolithic cultures of Taiwan. Multiple lines of evidence record the early Holocene inundation of the Fuzhou Basin around 9000 cal BP, the mid-Holocene sea-level highstand, and the final Holocene marine transgression. This final transition is precisely documented, with AMS dates showing the change occurred close to 1900 cal BP. Our paleogeo-graphic reconstruction shows that a large estuary filled the Fuzhou Basin during the mid-Holocene. Tanshishan and Zhuangbianshan, two of the major Fuzhou Basin Neolithic sites, are located today on hills nearly 80 km from the modern coastline. However, when the sites were settled around 5500-5000 cal BP, the marine transgression had transformed these hills into islands in the upper estuary. We suggest that the Neolithic era estuary setting, together with the lack of land suitable for rice paddy agriculture, inhibited intensive food production but favored a maritime orientation and the development of seafaring.

TI Gradual, catastrophic and human induced environmental changes from a
   coastal lake, southern New Zealand
SO SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY
AB Cores obtained from a coastal freshwater lake (Lake Waihola, South Island, New Zealand) show a >4000 year history of environmental changes driven by significant variations in marine influence and anthropogenic modification of the catchment and minor contributions such as possible palaeotsunami inundation, all taking place against a background of sea level and landscape change. A marked shift from estuarine conditions (salinity >14 ppt) to a predominantly freshwater state occurred around the mid-Holocene. This shift is recorded as a distinct change in diatom assemblages and by the disappearance of the estuarine bivalve Austrovenus stutchburyi from the sedimentary record. More recently, a marked change in sediment characteristics and changes in the pollen record correlate with rapid anthropogenic land clearance and conversion of the catchment to intensive agriculture in the mid 1800's. The mean rate of sediment accumulation between c. 4000 yr BP and the start of major European settlement (c. AD1860) were around 0.18 +/- 0.01 mm yr(-1). From c. AD1860 onwards, this has increased markedly by about 30 fold following major land use changes in the catchment. Based on current predictions of sea level rise and sediment accumulation, various future sea level rise scenarios will more than compensate for infilling, resulting in the persistence of this aquatic system, which is expected to revert to an estuarine state.

TI Late mid-Holocene sea-level oscillation: A possible cause
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB Sea level oscillated between 5500 and 3500 years ago at Murrells Inlet, South Carolina, Chezzetcook and Bale Verte, Nova Scotia and Montmagny, Quebec. The oscillation is well constrained by foraminiferal marsh zonations in three locations and by diatoms in the fourth one. The implications are: (1) there was a eustatic sea-level oscillation of about 2-10 m in the late mid-Holocene on the southeast coast of North America (South Carolina to Quebec) that is not predicted by present geophysical models of relative sea-level change; (2) this oscillation coincides with oceanographic cooling on the east coast of Canada that we associate with melting ice; and (3) this sea- level oscillation/climatic event coincides exactly with the end of pyramid building in Egypt which is suggested to have resulted from a climate change (i.e. drought, cooling).
   This sea-level/climatic change is a prime example of feedback where climatic warming in the mid-Holocene promoted ice melt in the Arctic which subsequently caused climatic cooling by opening up Arctic channels releasing cold water into the Inner Labrador Current that continued to intensify until 4000 years ago. This sea-level event may also be the best way of measuring when the final ice melted since most estimates of the ages of the last melting are based on end moraine dates in the Arctic which may not coincide with when the last ice actually melted out, since there is no way of dating the final ice positions.

TI Sea-level rise during Termination II inferred from large benthic
   foraminifers: IODP Expedition 310, Tahiti Sea Level
SO MARINE GEOLOGY
AB The course of sea-level fluctuations during Termination II (TII; the penultimate deglaciation), which is critical for understanding ice-sheet dynamics and suborbital climate variability, has yet to be established. This is partly because most shallow-water sequences encompassing TII were eroded during sea-level lowstands of the last glacial period or were deposited below the present sea level. Here we report a new sequence recording sea-level changes during TII in the Pleistocene sequence at Hole M0005D (water depth: 59.63 m below sea level [mbsl]) off Tahiti, French Polynesia, which was drilled during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 310. Lithofacies variations and stratigraphic changes in the taxonomic composition, preservation states, and intraspecific test morphology of large benthic foraminifers indicate a deepening-upward sequence in the interval from Core 310-M0005D-26R (core depth: 134 mbsl) through -16R (core depth: 106 mbsl). Reconstruction of relative sea levels, based on paleodepth estimations using large benthic foraminifers, indicated a rise in sea level of about 90 m during this interval, suggesting its correlation with one of the terminations. Assuming that this rise in sea level corresponds to that during III, after correcting for subsidence since the time of deposition, a highstand sea-level position would be 2 +/- 15 m above present sea level (masl), which is generally consistent with highstand sea-level positions in MIS 5e (4 +/- 2 masl). If this rise in sea level corresponds to that during older terminations, the subsidence-corrected highstand sea-level positions (30 +/- 15 mast for Termination III and 54 +/- 15 masl for Termination IV) are not consistent with reported ranges of interglacial sea-level highstands (-18 to 15 mast). Therefore, the studied interval likely records the rise in sea level and associated environmental changes during TII. In particular, the intervening cored materials between the two episodes of sea-level rise found in the studied intervmight record the sea-level reversal event during TII. This conclusion is consistent with U/Th ages of around 133 ka, which were obtained from slightly diagenetically altered (i.e., <1% calcite) in situ corals in the studied interval (Core 310-M0005D-20R [core depth: 118 mbsl]). This study also suggests that our inverse approach to correlate a stratigraphic interval with an approximate time frame could be useful as an independent check on the accuracy of uranium-series dating, which has been applied extensively to fossil corals in late Quaternary sea-level studies.

TI BIOTIC EFFECTS OF SEA-LEVEL CHANGE - THE PLEISTOCENE TEST
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH AND PLANETS
AB Species diversity change, and therefore compositional changes in a biota, may be associated with changes at any of three ecological levels, involving the number of provinces within the biosphere, of communities within provinces, and of species represented within communities.  Pleistocene sea level changes did not much affect the marine biosphere at any ecological level.  An analysis of an extensive data set of Californian Pleistocene and Recent mollusks indicates a continuity of community and species composition during highstands of the last million years.  Extensive latitudinal shifts in species' geographic ranges, associated with climatic change and not with sea level itself, created the most significant biotic changes.  Extinctions were minimal, well below predicted species-area effects.  Evidently, only "perched" faunas are particularly vulnerable to sea level change.  Although sea level falls are commonly associated with a faunal hiatus, changes associated therewith can be referred to sea level change itself only in limited situations, and other paleobiologic explanations should be sought in most cases.

TI Holocene palaeoenvironmental history of the Amazonian mangrove belt
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB Wetland dynamic in the northern Brazilian Amazon region during the Holocene was reviewed using palynological, carbon and nitrogen isotopes records, and C/N ratio previously published. The integration of 72 radiocarbon dates recorded in 34 sediment cores sampled along the marine and fluvial littoral, and mainly influenced by the Amazon River, reveals that marine influence and mangrove vegetation were wider than today on the mouth of Amazon River between >8990-8690 and 2300-2230 cal yr BP, forming a continuous mangrove belt along the northern Brazilian Amazon littoral. The establishment of this mangrove strip is a direct consequence of the marine incursion caused by post-glacial sea-level rise possibly associated with tectonic subsidence during the Early and Middle Holocene. In the Late Holocene, in areas influenced by the Amazon River discharge, the mangroves were replaced by freshwater vegetation, and the coast morphology evolved from an estuarine dominated into a rectilinear coast due to coastal progradation. Nevertheless, the marine-influenced littoral, which is currently dominated by mangroves and salt-marsh vegetation, has persistently had brackish water vegetation over tidal mud flats throughout the entire Holocene. Likely, the fragmentation of this continuous mangrove line during the Late Holocene was caused by the increase of river freshwater discharge associated to the change from dry into wet climates in the Late Holocene. This caused a significant decrease of tidal water salinity in areas near the mouth of Amazon River. These changes in the Amazon discharge are probably associated with dry and wet periods in the northern Amazon region during the Holocene. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Late Quaternary Landscape Dynamics at the La Spezia Gulf (NW Italy): A
   Multi-Proxy Approach Reveals Environmental Variability within a Rocky
   Embayment
SO WATER
AB The Gulf of La Spezia (GLS) in Northwest Italy is a rocky embayment with low fluvial influence facing the Mediterranean Sea. Past landscape dynamics were investigated through a multi-proxy, facies-based analysis down to a core depth of 30 m. The integration of quantitative ostracod, foraminifera, and pollen analyses, supported by radiocarbon ages, proved to be a powerful tool to unravel the late Quaternary palaeoenvironmental evolution and its forcing factors. The complex interplay between relative sea-level (RSL), climatic changes, and geomorphological features of the embayment drove four main evolution phases. A barrier-lagoon system developed in response to the rising RSL of the Late Pleistocene (likely the Last Interglacial). The establishment of glacial conditions then promoted the development of an alluvial environment, with generalised erosion of the underlying succession and subsequent accumulation of fluvial strata. The Holocene transgression (dated ca. 9000 cal year BP) caused GLS inundation and the formation of a low-confined lagoon basin, which rapidly turned into a coastal bay from ca. 8000 cal year BP onwards. This latter environmental change occurred in response to the last Holocene stage of global sea-level acceleration, which submerged a morphological relief currently forming a drowned barrier-island complex in the embayment.

TI Middle-Holocene environmental change and archaeology in coastal
   wetlands: Further implications for our understanding of the history of
   Taxus woodland
SO HOLOCENE
AB A radiocarbon-dated multi-proxy palaeoenvironmental record from Beckton in the Lower Thames Valley, Southern England, has permitted a detailed reconstruction of human activities and environmental change during the middle-Holocene. Peat accumulation occurred over river terrace gravels from ca. 7200 to 6600 until at least 3450-3240 cal. BP, and in the later period a trackway and platform structure provide unequivocal evidence for human exploitation of the floodplain environment during the Bronze Age. The site is unique in offering the first certain evidence of the utilisation of Taxus in the construction of a wooden prehistoric platform. Across north-west Europe during the middle-Holocene, the colonisation of Taxus on peat is well documented; at Beckton, it occurred between ca. 5220-4940 and 4410-4220 cal. BP. This research provides important insights into the former distribution of Taxus, and reasons for its expansion and decline during the Holocene, which has relevance to present-day concerns over the conservation and management of Taxus woodland. Abandonment of the site occurred in response to environmental change to wetter conditions. The study employed multi-proxy analyses, including pollen, plant and wood macrofossils, and uniquely Coleoptera; Coleopteran analysis has significant potential to enhance understandings of environmental change and human-environment interactions in coastal wetland research.

TI Holocene environmental changes of the Hwajinpo Lagoon on the eastern
   coast of Korea
SO JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY
AB Lithologic and geochemical data of a core from the Hwajinpo Lagoon, located on the eastern coast of Korea, provided the evolutionary history of the lagoon related to Holocene sea- level changes of the East Sea ( Sea of Japan). Grain size analysis, water content analysis, and soft X- ray analysis of core samples were used to reconstruct sedimentary environments, as were total organic carbon, C/ N, S and C/ S chemical records. Assemblages of mollusc and diatom remains also provided paleoenvironmental information. The reconstruction of paleoenvironments from these multi- proxy data allows the establishment of an evolutionary model of the Hwajinpo Lagoon. The environmental changes of the Hwajinpo Lagoon can be divided into seven different depositional facies: ( l) Exposed basement rock; ( 2) Estuarine; ( 3) Stagnant brackish lagoon ( isolated); ( 4) Oxic condition lagoon ( organic activity); ( 5) Fresh water lake; ( 6) Oxic brackish lagoon ( recent condition); ( 7) Prograding river delta. These environmental changes can be related to sea- level change during the Holocene. The trends of sea- level change in the Hwajinpo Lagoon from this study can be compared to those of the Japanese coastal areas located on the other side of the East Sea such as Lakes Shinji and Nakaumi.

TI Sea level and climatic influences on the occupation of Qatar and the

AB Major environmental changes brought about by climatic and sea-level fluctuations dictated the nature, extent, and distribution of Qatar's population in the Holocene period. During the Hydrological Optimum from c. 7700-6000 years BP (revised from Macumber 2011: 8), the climate was wetter with 2-3 m higher sea levels. A Qatar-wide fresh groundwater lens formed with copious coastal spring outflow, enabling widespread Neolithic occupation including large areas in the south which are not habitable today. This was followed by mid- to late-Holocene phases of aridity to hyper-aridity and severe aquifer salinity, resulting in the abandonment of the south and occupation where present, restricted to northern areas underlain by remnants of the former groundwater lens. Vita-Finzi (1978: 24) and Drechsler et al. (2016: 103) note a dearth of occupation from Neolithic to early Islamic times, while more generally Uerpmann (2003) observes a 'Dark Millennium' across eastern Arabia after 5800 years BP.
   The processes responsible for the changing distribution of populations include an early to mid-Holocene westwards shift in the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and monsoonal incursion into Qatar; a 2000 year-long mid-Holocene Saline Event stemming from severe seawater intrusion into the coastal aquifer system from the then high-level coastal shoreline; and mid- to late Holocene aridity including a c.3000 year-long hyper-arid phase. The marine regression from 4000 years BP led to the flushing of intruded seawater from the aquifer onto the newly emerging coastal plain instigating the development of coastal sabkha, which thereafter captured the coastward flowing groundwater in a near-coast hyper-saline zone.
   The profound environmental changes documented in Qatar have broader implications for occupation elsewhere along the Gulf, being strongest wherever flat hinterlands occur.

TI Holocene climatic changes and environmental history of Iturup Island,
   Kurile Islands, northwestern Pacific
SO HOLOCENE
AB The study of Holocene deposits on Iturup Island is cry important for understanding palaeolandscape changes on the island. It is separated by deep straits from the neighbouring islands and was isolated during the last glacial maximum. Landscape changes over the last 40000 years and the role of refugia on vegetation development are discussed. Changes in natural processes in this region were controlled both by global climatic changes and by regional factors. Birch forests developed at the warming about 36-37 ka ago, whereas tundra-park landscape developed with the cooling of the last glacial maximum. Holocene environments reflect climatic changes and sea-level oscillations, The fluctuation of warm and cold currents influenced the landscape development, At the Holocene Optimum (about 6 ka) broadleaved forests with Quercus, Phellodendron, Carpinus, Juglans, Fagus, Fraxinus and Syringa occupied the Okhotsk side of central Iturup, Climate was warmer than present and the sum of active temperatures (Sigmat greater than or equal to 10degreesC) A as not less than 1800degreesC. The warming was coincident wit the transgression with the highest sea level up to 3.5 m above present sea level (PSL). Numerous coastal a s were formed at this time. A shallow strait occur-red on the low Vetrovoy isthmus. The sea-level drop at 4700-4500 radiocarbon years BP led to the development of large dunefields only within bays with a flat coast due to the supply of sandy material from the inshore drainage zone. At the beginning of the late Holocene about 4000 BP the vegetation changed very little due to the warm current influence. Cool-temperate forests with dominant Quercus had a wide distribution, but the diversity of broadleaved genera decreased. A minor transgression occurred about 4100-4000 BP with a sea-level rise on about 2.5 in above PSL. Active accumulation of deposits took place in the coastal zone at this time, Great vegetation changes and climatic deterioration took place in the last 2000 years BP. Coot-temperate broadleaved forests were confined to the Okhotsk side of the central island. Grasslands and swamps also developed in the coastal lowlands at this time. A minor regression led to the formation of large dunefields. Isthmuses increased and coastal wetlands with takes formed. The presence of marine diatoms in floodplain lake deposits indicates a sea-level rise at about 1060 +/- 60 BP. At this time warming was not intensive, but was well pronounced. The last phase of active aeolian accumulation took place during the 'Little Ice Age' cooling and regression.

TI Dynamic response of Permian brachiopod communities to long-term
   environmental change
SO NATURE
AB The fossil record preserves numerous natural experiments that can shed light on the response of ecological communities to environmental change. However, directly observing the community dynamics of extinct organisms is not possible. As an alternative, neutral ecological models(1-3) suggest that species abundance distributions reflect dynamical processes like migration, competition, recruitment, and extinction. Live-dead comparisons suggest that such distributions can be faithfully preserved in the rock record(4). Here we use a maximum-likelihood approach to show that brachiopod (lamp shell) abundance distributions from four temporally distinct ecological landscapes from the Glass Mountains, Texas (of the Permian period), exhibit significant differences. Further, all four are better fitted by zero-sum multinomial distributions, characteristic of Hubbell's neutral model(2), than by log-normal distributions, as predicted by the traditional ecological null hypothesis(5). Using the neutral model as a guide, we suggest that sea level fluctuations spanning about 10 Myr altered the degrees of isolation and exchange among local communities within these ecological landscapes. Neither these long-term environmental changes nor higher-frequency sea level fluctuations resulted in wholesale extinction or major innovation within evolutionary lineages.

TI Modelling the effect of environmental change on shorebirds: A case study
   on Poole Harbour, UK
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB An individuals-based model, MORPH, was used to assess the quality of Poole Harbour, UK, for five overwintering shorebirds: dunlin Calidris alpina, redshank Tringa totanus, black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa, oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus and curlew Numenius arquata. Site quality, and the effect of environmental change, was measured as predicted overwinter survival. Dunlin had the highest prey biomass densities and were the least likely to be affected by reductions in their food supply, lower temperatures or loss of terrestrial habitats Black-tailed godwits and curlew had the lowest prey biomass densities and were the most likely to be affected by reductions in their food supply, lower temperatures and loss of terrestrial habitats. All five shorebird species were seriously affected by simulated sea-level rise. Conservation issues identified for the Poole Harbour SPA were the relatively low densities of larger size classes of polychaete worms, the importance of maintaining and managing surrounding terrestrial habitats and the effect of sea-level rise on the length of time for which intertidal food supplies are available.

TI Implications of climatic change on Spanish Mediterranean low-lying
   coasts: The Ebro delta case
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB A preliminary estimate of the implications of climatic change on the Ebro delta coast (Spanish Mediterranean) is presented based on an understanding of how climate and other changes will influence the different driving factors that control the interacting formation and reduction processes acting on this low-lying coast. The formation processes are primarily of riverine origin and concern the supply of sediment and freshwater. The reduction processes considered are primarily of marine origin and include increases in inundation/flooding, decreases in storm return periods, coastal erosion, salinity intrusion, and changes in wave climate (wave height, direction, and storminess). For the most part, climatologically induced changes affecting deltaic behaviour, i.e., those of marine origin, are most important for the Ebro delta because those of riverine origin will be significantly damped by river regulation works. Hence, formation processes are suppressed whereas reduction processes will be unaffected by management policies, unless they are related to the coastal zone. Because of its morphology, relative sea-level rise (RSLR) will become the most important climate-induced potential hazard for the Ebro delta. When considering RSLR-induced inundation of deltaic areas below a given level (e.g., 0.5 m), although the deltaic surface below the projected level could be relatively large, impacts will be modulated by the "protection" offered by an active coastal zone that is able to react to the RSLR. Another direct result of sea-level rise will be a decrease in the return periods of maximum water levels, which due to the surge climate of the area will be very significant. Finally, the estimated shoreline retreat due to the RSLR was small when compared to present evolution rates. However, they must be also considered because they will act as an additional background erosion rate along the entire coast.

TI Patterns of island change and persistence offer alternate adaptation
   pathways for atoll nations
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Sea-level rise and climatic change threaten the existence of atoll nations. Inundation and erosion are expected to render islands uninhabitable over the next century, forcing human migration. Here we present analysis of shoreline change in all 101 islands in the Pacific atoll nation of Tuvalu. Using remotely sensed data, change is analysed over the past four decades, a period when local sea level has risen at twice the global average (similar to 3.90 +/- 0.4 mm. yr(-1)). Results highlight a net increase in land area in Tuvalu of 73.5 ha (2.9%), despite sea-level rise, and land area increase in eight of nine atolls. Island change has lacked uniformity with 74% increasing and 27% decreasing in size. Results challenge perceptions of island loss, showing islands are dynamic features that will persist as sites for habitation over the next century, presenting alternate opportunities for adaptation that embrace the heterogeneity of island types and their dynamics.

TI Abrupt environmental changes during the last glacial cycle in Western
   Mediterranean (Formentera Island, Balearic archipelago, Spain)
SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
AB A sedimentary sequence covering the entire last glacial cycle (period between Terminations I and II) outcrops along the south-eastern coast of Formentera Island. A detailed geomorphological, geological and sedimento-logical study, supported by geochemical, soil and soil-morphology analyses, magnetic susceptibility, phytolite content and luminescence dating (TL, OSL) allowed to reconstruct the environmental evolution of this coastal setting, and to frame it within the evolutionary pattern of the North Atlantic climate variability. Three highstands of sea level are identified in this island for MIS 5e, and a fourth one is attributed to MIS5a. MIS5 - MIS4 transition is characterized by soil development under a moist-warm climate and a descending sea level scenario. Aeolian units (72 +/- 7 ka BP) developed during MIS4 under prevailing northerly winds that persisted until the beginning of MIS3, when new aeolian dunes (54 +/- 5 ka BP) developed after a major sea-level lowstand. A sudden shift in prevailing winds occur within MIS3, when aeolian units (51 +/- 4 ka BP) grew under the influence of S-SW winds and moister climate, evidenced by a dense root bioturbation. The greater influence of northerly winds is attributed to the weakening of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Current (AMOC) in North Atlantic, and enhancement of westerlies in NW Europe during colder periods. Periods of prevailing southerly winds and moister climate correlate well with warm Greenland Interstadials, and reinforcement of AMOC. Between 50 and 40ka, alluvial/colluvial sedimentary units punctuated by soil and calcrete development, witness the climatic variability recorded along this period in the North Atlantic. A sedimentary hiatus with erosion and calcrete development characterizes the transit between MIS3 and MIS2. Finally, a reddish alluvial sedimentary unit re-cords a short span of humid and warm climate (soil development, peak in magnetic susceptibility, phytolite content) within MIS 2 (20 +/- 2 ka BP - 17 + 2.4/-2.2) that contrast with the general climatic trend recorded in Western Mediterranean during the Last Glacial Maximum.

TI Microborer ichnocoenoses in Quaternary corals from New Caledonia:
   reconstructions of paleo-water depths and reef growth strategies in
   relation to environmental changes
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB Coral reef growth and development depend on several environmental factors, including tectonic and climatic parameters and local ecological drivers. Reef growth is especially sensitive to sea-level variations. Paleo-water depth reconstructions are essential tools used to determine reef growth patterns during different periods of reef growth. Assemblages of corals and/or coralline algae have been commonly used in such paleodepth reconstructions. This study shows that using microendolith ichnocoenoses can sometimes provide better accuracy than traditional coralgal analyses, particularly in the depth-range 0-10 m where coralgal assemblages usually show broad distribution ranges. Holocene and Pleistocene cores from two barrier reef sites on the west coast of Grande Terre in New Caledonia are examined here. Holocene reef development at these sites feature examples of microendolith ichnocoenoses that document rapid environmental changes and small sea-level variations of about 2-5 m in amplitude, and record these changes with more accuracy than coral and coralline algae assemblages which are highly dependant on the hydrodynamic energy of the setting. During the Pleistocene, which was less chronologically constrained, the microendolith ichnocoenoses also reflect paleo-water depths and reef-growth patterns at different periods of reef history.

TI Bulk organic delta C-13 and C/N ratios as palaeosalinity indicators
   within a Scottish isolation basin
SO JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE
AB Microfossils in isolation basin sediments are frequently used to reconstruct sea-level change, but preservation problems and non-analogue situations can limit their usefulness. Here we investigate the potential of stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13) and C/N ratios from bulk organic matter, as an alternative proxy of salinity within isolation basin sediments from a basin in northwest Scotland. Within the Holocene sediment delta C-13 and C/N are determined largely by the mean weighted values of the predominant source of the organic material. Analysis of modern materials and comparison with the diatom record shows that the marine parts of the sequence are dominated by high delta C-13 and variable C/N. In the fresh water sequences the organic material is a mixture of both freshwater aquatic and terrestrial plant input that have relatively low delta C-13 and high C/N. The application of delta C-13 and C/N ratios in the studied basin in general follow the environmental change recorded by the diatoms and shows the potential of bulk organic matter in the investigation of salinity change in isolation basins.

AB Late Holocene environmental changes in the lower Apalachicola River region of northwest Florida appear to be a consequence of deltaic lobe-shifting and sea-level change. Sedimentological, archaeological and seismic evidence all indicate a major eastward shift in deltaic deposition approximately 6,000 years ago, when construction of the modern Apalachicola Delta began. The effect is observed in the mid-region of the modern delta as a pronounced change from estuarine to freshwater conditions during the mid- to late Holocene.
   Enclosing the modern delta and estuary is a barrier island chain which began to develop about 4,000 years ago. A change in depositional pattern over time is evident in the barriers, possibly as a response to the continuing eastward shift of the delta. Archaeological evidence from the barriers indicates a minor higher-than-present sea level during the late Holocene. The timing of the high stand is consistent with evidence from other locations in the Southeastern United States.

TI Sea-level and environmental changes since the last interglacial in the
   Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia: an overview
SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
CT Meeting on Australian Quarternary Studies, A Tribute to Jim Bowler
CY FEB, 2000
CL CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA
AB The Gulf of Carpentaria is an epicontinental sea (maximum depth 70 m) between Australia and New Guinea, bordered to the east by Torres Strait (currently 12 m deep) and to the west by the Arafura Sill (53 m below present sea level). Throughout the Quaternary, during times of low sea-level, the Gulf was separated from the open waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. forming Lake Carpentaria, an isolation basin, perched above contemporaneous sea-level with outlet channels to the Arafura Sea. A preliminary interpretation is presented of the palaeoenvironments recorded in six sediment cores collected by the IMAGES program in the Gulf of Carpentaria. The longest core (approx. 15 m) spans the past 130 ka and includes a record of sea-level/lake-level changes, with particular complexity between 80 and 40 ka when sea-level repeatedly breached and withdrew from Gulf/Lake Carpentaria. Evidence from biotic remains (foraminifers, ostracods. pollen), sedimentology and geochemistry clearly identifies a final marine transgression at about 9.7 ka (radiocarbon years). Before this transgression, Lake Carpentaria was surrounded by grassland, was near full. and may have had a surface area approaching 600 km x 300 km and a depth of about 15 m. The earlier rise in sea-level which accompanied the Marine Isotopic Stage 6/5 transgression at about 130 ka is constrained by sedimentological and biotic evidence and dated by optical- and thermoluminescence and amino acid racemisation methods.

TI Late Pleistocene Expansion of Small Murid Rodents across the Palearctic
   in Relation to the Past Environmental Changes
SO GENES
AB We investigated the evolutionary history of the striped field mouse to identify factors that initiated its past demographic changes and to shed light on the causes of its current genetic structure and trans-Eurasian distribution. We sequenced mitochondrial cyt b from 184 individuals, obtained from 35 sites in central Europe and eastern Mongolia. We compared genetic analyses with previously published historical distribution models and data on environmental and climatic changes. The past demographic changes displayed similar population trends in the case of recently expanded clades C1 and C3, with the glacial (MIS 3-4) expansion and postglacial bottleneck preceding the recent expansion initiated in the late Holocene and were related to environmental changes during the upper Pleistocene and Holocene. The past demographic trends of the eastern Asian clade C3 were correlated with changes in sea level and the formation of new land bridges formed by the exposed sea shelf during the glaciations. These data were supported by reconstructed historical distribution models. The results of our genetic analyses, supported by the reconstruction of the historical spatial distributions of the distinct clades, confirm that over time the local populations mixed as a consequence of environmental and climatic changes resulting from cyclical glaciation and the interglacial period during the Pleistocene.

TI The timing of the postglacial marine transgression in the Ria de Ferrol
   (NW Iberia): A new multiproxy approach from its sedimentary infill
SO CATENA
AB The Ria de Ferrol is a confined tide-dominated incised valley in the mesotidal passive Atlantic margin of NW Iberia. A new multidisciplinary approach enables a high-resolution reconstruction of the main environmental changes affecting this area during the Lateglacial and the Holocene. We defined the main seismic and sedimentary facies in the infill and selected different key points to be cored. A number of multiproxy analyses were performed on four sections of sediment (sedimentology, X-ray fluorescence, radiocarbon dating and palynological analyses). Physiography exerted a strong control on the evolution of the basin, as a rock-bounded narrow channel in the middle of the basin influenced the flooding of the ria during the postglacial marine transgression. Depositional environments shifted towards the east as the sea level rose and fluvial facies at the base were covered by facies from a tide-dominated estuary, which were predominant during most of the Holocene. Several layers of sediments from stagnant freshwater areas dominated by Juncus sp. were recovered at ca. -20.5 to -21, ca. -13.1 to -13.5, -12.5 to -12.8 and -12.1 to -13.5 m NMMA along the central axis of the embayment, and dated to be older than 10190-10290; 10790-10970; 7510-8220 and 7130-7830 cal yr BP. They may respectively represent a local stage of lowering sea-level dated at the end of the Lateglacial (i.e. the Younger Dryas), and different episodes of deceleration/stabilization of sea-level rise occurred during the early Holocene (i.e. the 11.4, 10.5, 9.3, 8.2 kyr Henrich events). Thus, for the first time in this region, we were able to generate a high-resolution spatial-temporal interpretation of environmental changes linked to the relative sea-level variations using subtidal sediments from the same sub-basin (and thus free of substantial/differential post-depositional deformations) that describes in detail the flooding of the ancient coastal plains of this region at the beginning of the Holocene.

TI New relative sea-level insights into the isostatic history of the
   Western Mediterranean
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB A recent suite of Relative Sea-Level (RSL) data for the past 12 ka BP has provided new insights into the sea-level histories of the western Mediterranean region. Our analysis of the chronostratigraphic context of sea-level indicators from Spain (Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and the Gulf of Valencia), France (Corsica Island) and Italy (Sardinia Island) has yielded 162 new sea-level index and limiting points. These data have considerably enhanced previous RSL compilations, in addition to improving the quality of spatio-temporal sea-level reconstructions and our capacity to estimate isostatic-related vertical motions in the western Mediterranean basin. The glacial and hydro-isostatic adjustment (GIA) pattern elucidated by the new database shows discrepancy with respect to those predicted by the available GIA models. In particular, the new results underscore a non-coherent isostatic response of the central portion of the western Mediterranean, with the Balearic Islands manifesting significant departures from the sea-level histories of Corsica, Sardinia and, more generally, along most of the western Mediterranean coast. Our results are a crucial contribution to defining both the pattern and the magnitude of the isostatic signal along the western Mediterranean coast. In fact, vertical isostatic motions represent a key to better assess any possible post-industrial acceleration in sea-level rise and to define future scenarios of coastal inundation in the context of global change.

TI DEPOSITIONAL BIAS AND ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE IMPORTANT FACTORS IN SEQUENCE
   STRATIGRAPHY
SO SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY
AB Differences among depositional systems, here called depositional bias, strongly influence sequence patterns. Siliciclastics and shallow-water carbonates, for instance, shed most of their sediment during opposite phases of a sea-level cycle (lowstand shedding and highstand shedding, respectively). Furthermore, the two systems generate their own, system-specific relief on the sea floor, disperse their sediment load along different avenues and differ in the way they are deactivated: reefs and carbonate platforms can be drowned, whereas siliciclastic deposition can be shut off and renewed at any depth. As a consequence of these differences, pronounced unconformities (drowning unconformities) develop where carbonate platforms are terminated and buried by siliciclastics (the siliciclastic-to-carbonate transition tends to be more gradual). Drowned platforms and drowning unconformities appeared world-wide in great abundance in the Miocene, Cretaceous (Valanginian-Turonian), Jurassic (Toarcian) and Devonian (Frasnian/Famennian). Examples of drowning unconformities interpreted as sequence boundaries, include those of the Early Cretaceous platforms off New Jersey and off Morocco, the mid-Cretaceous unconformity in the Gulf of Mexico and Miocene unconformities on top of reefs in the Far East.
   The eustatic cycles postulated from sequence stratigraphy are a very unlikely cause for the mass drownings of reefs and platforms: either the rates of rise are an order of magnitude lower than the growth potential of platforms, or cycle amplitudes are too small, or the cycles are too short and subsidence too slow to remove platforms permanently from the photic zone. The critical element in the mass drowning seems to be environmental stress that reduces the growth potential of carbonate systems. Thus, drowning unconformities demonstrate the importance of environmental change as a control on sequence development. Other examples of dominantly environment-controlled sequences include slope deposits shaped by shifting currents (e.g. Florida and Blake Plateau) and basin fills that were controlled by changes in sediment input related to tectonic alteration of the drainage in the hinterland (e.g. Gulf of Mexico).
   Environmental change must be considered as a third, independent factor that competes with eustatic and tectonically driven regional changes of sea-level for control of sequences. The definition of sequences and sequence boundaries should be broad enough to include the possibility of non-sea-level controls.

TI Effects of sea-level rise and climatic changes on mangroves from
   southwestern littoral of Puerto Rico during the middle and late Holocene
SO CATENA
AB We evaluated the response to sea level rise and climatic changes of the northeastern Caribbean by establishing a palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of the Flamenco Lagoon, located in the coastal side of the Guanica Dry Forest, a MAB/UNESCO reserve in the semi-arid southwestern coast of Puerto Rico (17 degrees 57'10.31"N, 66 degrees 50'39.30"W). The reconstruction was based on pollen records, sediments analysis, delta C-13, delta N-15, C/N data and AMS C-14 dating of one sediment core. The geology of the area is rocky calcareous karst with rocky outcrops and canyons, with intermittent streams that move water during periods of high run-off conditions. The present lagoon is surrounded by rocky outcrops where dry forest vegetation is present on the terrestrial sides, and sand dunes on the coastal side. We propose that the studied lagoon developed after the stabilization of sea level rise in the region following three main stages: (1) before similar to 5400 cal yr BP, sediments were accumulated according to small channels dynamics and trees, shrubs and herbs were present. The sedimentary organic matter was mainly sourced from terrestrial C-3 and C-4 plants. (2) Between similar to 5400 and similar to 4400 cal yr BP, tidal flats were established and mangroves, mainly represented by Rhizophora trees, migrated landward with sea level rise and established in the area, and the sedimentary organic matter was sourced from terrestrial C-3 plants. (3) Around 4400 cal yr BP, sea level was near the stabilization, the endorheic minibasin was closed when a coastal sand dune was established as a result of drier climatic conditions. Mangroves were eliminated from the system as a result of the closure of the area by sand dunes and increased salinity in water due to high evaporative demand of the climate. The pollen dominance of herbaceous and shrubby vegetation prevails until present Throughout the lagoon development, sedimentary organic matter was sourced from C-3 and C-4 plants, as well as phytoplankton organic matter. The closure of the lagoon and the drier conditions prevalent in the region during the late Holocene, which lasts until the present day, and increased the contribution of salinity tolerant phytoplankton that characterizes the current conditions of the Flamenco Lagoon.

TI Holocene sea-level rise and coastal aquifer interactions: Triggering
   mechanisms for environmental change and impacts on human settlement
   patterns at Dor, Israel
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB Future sea-level rise is expected to affect coastal aquifers and environments and have significant impacts on coastal communities. Here, we describe the impact of early to late Holocene sea-level variations on the coastal environment and human settlements of the Carmel Coast, Israel. One of these ancient communities, Tel Dor, was settled initially during the Late Pottery Neolithic (ca. 7 ka) on a wetland surface and then abandoned for ca. 1.5 ka before resettlement occurred on the adjacent aeolianite ridge from the Middle Bronze Age to the Crusader period (4.3e0.9 cal Ka BP). For the first time, high resolution chrono-bio-chemo-stratigraphy of sediment cores collected landward of the current shoreline at Dor are presented capturing a record of poorly sorted sand mixed with marine shells, well sorted aeolian sand and silty clay deposits. The record represents a series of brackish-freshwater wetlands formed in the coastal area of Dor between ca. 15 to 7 ka in response to relative sea-level rise and resulting rise of the coastal aquifers. After 7 ka, due to rising sea level and a transgressing shoreline, sand largely derived from the Nile Delta, reached the coast including the coastal wetland. Landward from the current shoreline, the period between ca. 7 to 4 ka is represented by alternating sand-silt facies consisting of reworked marine shells and brackish-fresh water biota. These lithological cycles reflect fluctuations between coastal and wetland environments governed by the response of the coastal aquifer to sea-level rise. Rapid sea-level rise led to a rise in the groundwater table and inundation of the area around Tel Dor, while periods with slower rates of sea-level rise resulted in coastal sand deposition. The settlement gap at Dor between 7 and 5.6 ka possibly reflects the behavioral response of the coastal settlers to sea-level fluctuation, and sediment depositional variation instigating aquifer inundation coastal marsh development and mobilization of sand bodies. This study provides a record of beach profile build-up along the Mediterranean coast of Israel and serves as an example of how sea-level rise affect unconfined coastal aquifers and the formation of wetlands due to rising water tables in low elevation coasts. Coastal inundation is a long-term risk factor for densely populated low-lying coastal regions that require a proactive approach for solving cascading impacts of sea-level rise.(c) 2022 The Authors.

SO ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
AB New results from fieldwork in the western region of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi showed meaningful differences in relative sea-level variations during Holocene and recorded unknown late marine highstands. These dynamics may have induced important environmental changes and affected human settlement. Surveys have been carried out in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi in order to construct local sea-level variations. These results rely on identifying, characterizing, and dating sea-level indicators and particularly beachrocks. Two main areas were studied: Ghagha island and Ras Khumays peninsula. Data obtained from our surveys highlight significant differences and suggest local processes that need to be understood. From an archeological perspective, this work helps to better understand human settlement dynamic through the Holocene.

TI Human impacts and changes in the coastal waters of south China
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Human impact on the environment remains at the center of the debate on global environmental change. Using the Hong Kong-Shenzhen corridor in south China as an example, we present evidence that rapid urbanization and economic development in coastal areas were the dominant factors causing rapid changes in coastal waters. From 1990 to 2012, coastal seawater temperature increased similar to 0.060 degrees C per year, sea level rose 4.4 mm per year and pH decreased from 8.2 to 7.7, much faster than global averages. In the same period, there were exponential increases in the local population, gross domestic product and land fill area. Empirical analyses suggest that the large increase in the population affected local temperature, and economic development had a major impact on local pH. Results also show that pH and temperature were significantly correlated with local sea level rise, but pH had more predictive power, suggesting it could be considered a predictor for changes in local sea level. We conclude that human activities could significantly exacerbate local environmental changes which should be considered in predictive models and future development plans in coastal areas.

TI A global empirical typology of anthropogenic drivers of environmental
   change in deltas
SO SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
AB It is broadly recognized that river delta systems around the world are under threat from a range of anthropogenic activities. These activities occur at the local delta scale, at the regional river and watershed scale, and at the global scale. Tools are needed to support generalization of results from case studies in specific deltas. Here, we present a methodology for quantitatively constructing an empirical typology of anthropogenic change in global deltas. Utilizing a database of environmental change indicators, each associated with increased relative sea-level rise and coastal wetland loss, a clustering analysis of 48 global deltas provides a quantitative assessment of systems experiencing similar or dissimilar sources and degrees of anthropogenic stress. By identifying quantitatively similar systems, we hope to improve the transferability of scientific results across systems, and increase the effectiveness of delta management best practices. Both K-Means and Affinity Propagation clustering algorithms find similar clusters, with relative stability across small changes in K-Means cluster number. High-latitude deltas appear similar, in terms of anthropogenic environmental stress, to several low-population, low-latitude systems, including the Amazon delta, despite substantially different climatic regimes. Highly urbanized deltas in Southeast Asia form a distinct cluster. By providing a quantitative boundary between groups of delta systems, this approach may also be useful for assessing future delta change and sustainability given projected population growth, urbanization, and economic development trends.

TI Late Pleistocene-Holocene fossils from Mirim Lake, southern Brazil, and
   their paleoenvironmental significance: II - Mollusks
SO JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
AB The fossil molluscan assemblages found on the shores of Mirim Lake, in southern Brazil and Uruguay, provide information about the environmental changes and geological evolution of that water body. The storm-generated shell deposits at Latinos Spit on the Brazilian shore are dominated by the estuarine bivalve Erodona mactroides, represented mostly by juveniles, and the gastropod Heleobia australis. Species previously unrecorded in this site include the marine gastropods Cylichnella bidentata, Buccinanops cochlidium and Pachycymbiola brasiliana, and the bivalves Tagelus plebeius, Ostrea puelchana, Crassostrea cf. praia, Mactra isabelleana, Anomalocardia flexuosa and Cyrtopleura costata. The two latter currently inhabit tropical areas to the north of Rio Grande do Sul, and their presence in Mirim Lake indicates average coastal water temperatures about 2-3 degrees C warmer than today. This condition promoted the precipitation of calcium carbonate from dissolved shells, thus cementing together sand and shells in the form of coquinas. The stratigraphic succession, OSL ages obtained in quartz sand from one coquina, radiocarbon dated shells, and delta C-13 and delta O-18 of five E. mactroides and five marine species indicate that Mirim Lake became a brackish lagoon around 7.6 ka ago, in response to the postglacial marine transgression (PMT), followed by fully marine conditions during the sea-level highstand of 6-5 ka BP. Marine influence was reduced after similar to 4 ka BP as the result of sea-level fall and the closure of the connection with the ocean, related to the evolution of the sandy barrier that originated the modern shoreline. The environmental changes recorded in Mirim Lake help understand how coastal lagoons and their associated ecosystems respond to sea-level oscillations, which may be relevant to address future responses of these water bodies to the ongoing climate change.

TI Late Holocene sedimentation and hydrologic development in a shallow
   coastal sinkhole on Great Abaco Island, The Bahamas
SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
AB It remains poorly understood how sea level drives environmental change and hydrographic development in coastal karst basins (underwater caves, sinkholes, blueholes, etc.) over millennial timescales. It was previously hypothesized that coastal karst basins (CKBs) transition from vadose, to littoral, then anchialine, and finally submarine environments as sea-level rise inundates coastal karst landscapes, but the initial flooding event of CKBs remains challenging to sample. Runway Sinkhole hosts a modern anchialine ecosystem located similar to 225 m from Great Abaco Island coastline in The Bahamas, and its shallow water depth (similar to 1.8 mbsl) permits an investigation into the early environmental evolution and hydrographic development in a CKBs after inundation by sea-level rise. Four sediment cores were collected from Runway Sinkhole, and late Holocene environmental change was reconstructed with benthic foraminiferal paleoecology, organic matter geochemistry (OM%, delta C-13(org), and C:N), X-radiography, and radiocarbon dating. Despite some uncertainties associated with the chronology, it appears that Holocene sea-level rise initially flooded Runway Sinkhole and created a littoral environment at least by similar to 3.9 ka, whereafter a detrital peat deposit accumulated in the sinkhole. This detrital peat had a high organic matter content (mean 88%), a delta C-13(org) value indicative of organic matter derived from C-3 plants including mangroves (-28 parts per thousand), and an unknown calcareous microfossil suggestive of a non-marine habitat in the sinkhole. A shift to carbonate sand deposition, organic matter with more marine-influenced delta C-13(org) values (-23 parts per thousand,), and expansion of euryhaline (Bolivina striatula, Elphidium poeyanum, and Triloculina bermudezi) and anchialine (Physalidia simplex and Conicospirillina exleyi) benthic foraminifera at similar to 1.2 ka marks the onset of modern anchialine environmental conditions at the sediment-water interface (similar to 1.8 mbsl). These results suggest that relative sea-level rise in the Bahamas forced environmental change in Runway sinkhole at similar to 1.2 ka, and indicate that peat deposits in coastal sinkholes must be verified as in-situ before being utilized as sea-level indicators.

TI Late Quaternary tectonics, sea-level change and lithostratigraphy along
   the northern coast of the South China Sea
SO RIVER-DOMINATED SHELF SEDIMENTS OF EAST ASIAN SEAS
SE Geological Society Special Publication
AB This paper examines the Late Quaternary evolutionary history of the northern coast of the South China Sea by reviewing geological evidence from this coast. Results show that: (1) a lithostratigraphy with two marine sequences is observed in the deltaic basins of the Song Hong, Pearl and Han rivers, and these basins are all bounded by active faults; (2) whilst the upper marine sequence belongs to the present interglacial or the past 10.5 ka, the lower or older marine sequence was most likely deposited during the high sea level of the last interglacial period, c. 126-120 ka; (3) the burial depth of the older marine sequence is recorded at 215 m below modern sea level or deeper, implying localized subsidence of varying rates between these deltaic basins because the height of sea level during the last interglacial was close to that of the present; (4) this tectonic process is probably associated with the continuous long-term subsidence of the northern South China Sea continental shelf within the tectonic framework of southward continental extension of the Eurasian Plate during the Cenozoic; (5) fault activity has enhanced the localized subsidence of these deltaic basins, which led to marine inundation during interglacial high sea levels.

TI Effect of Sea-Level Change on Deep-Sea Sedimentary Records in the
   Northeastern South China Sea over the past 42 kyr
SO GEOFLUIDS
AB We integrated multiple geochemical analysis of a 13.75 m-long core 973-4 recovered from the northeastern South China Sea (SCS) to detect the response of deep-sea sediment archives to sea-level change spanning the last 42 kyr. The age-depth model based on AMS C-14 dating, together with the sediment grain size, shows an occurrence of turbidity current at around 14 kyr, which was associated with submarine landslides caused by gas hydrate dissociation. A dominantly terrigenous sediment input was supplied from southwestern Taiwan rivers. By synthesizing environment-sensitive indexes, four distinct stages of paleoenvironmental evolutions were recognized throughout the studied interval. Well-oxygenated condition occurred during the stage I (42.4-31.8 kyr) with low sea-level stand below -80 m, accompanied by flat terrigenous input. The largest amounts of terrigenous sediment input occurred during the late phase of stage II (31.8-20.4 kyr) with the lowest sea-level stand below -120 m because of a short distance from paleo-Taiwan river estuaries to the core location. An occurrence of Ca-enriched turbidity current disturbed the original sediments during the stage III (20.4-13.9 kyr). The stepwise elevated sea-level stand resulted in an enclosed (semi-enclosed) system and contributed to a relatively low-oxygen environment in deep ocean during the stage IV (13.9 kyr-present). Temporal variations of TOC and CaCO3 display contrary pattern synchronously, indicating a decoupled relationship between organic carbon burial and carbonate productivity. Our results highlight that these sedimentary records as reflected in the paleoenvironmental changes in the northeastern SCS were mainly driven by sea-level fluctuations and later, since the mid-Holocene, the strengthening East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) overwhelmed the stable sea level in dominating the environmental changes.

TI Holocene environmental change at Laguna Saladilla, coastal north
   Hispaniola
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB We inferred environmental changes over the middle to late Holocene in coastal north Hispaniola using pollen, microscopic charcoal, mollusk shells, and diatoms in an 8.5-m sediment core from Laguna Saladilla, Dominican Republic (19 degrees 39'N, 71 degrees 42'W; similar to 2 m above sea level). Changes in Rhizophora (red mangrove) pollen percentages and in mollusk and diatom assemblages indicate major changes in salinity and water depth related to relative sea level rise and possible shifts in precipitation. Rhizophora percentages were highest at 7650 cal yr BP, when mollusk shells indicate the lake was connected to the Atlantic Ocean. Laguna Saladilla became progressively brackish ca. 3500 cal yr BP, and transitioned ca. 2500 cal yr BP to its current freshwater condition. High percentages of Amaranthaceae pollen and increased charcoal concentrations over the last ca. 2500 years signal dry climate and increased fires in coastal north Hispaniola. Geomorphological changes over time at Laguna Saladilla partially mask evidence of climate change in the proxies examined, and the record is equivocal before 2500 cal yr BP. Evidence for drier conditions since 2500 cal yr BP is consistent with late-Holocene shifts in the mean position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) that have been identified on the Caribbean side of Hispaniola. We interpret the record as indicating that ITCZ migratory dynamics may also have affected precipitation on the Atlantic edge of the Greater Antilles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Episodic, rapid sea-level rises on the central Mediterranean shelves
   after the Last Glacial Maximum: A review
SO MARINE GEOLOGY
AB Submerged palaeo-shorelines on the central Mediterranean shelves, identified from high-resolution seismic profiles and bathymetric data, mark distinct water depths at which sea level stationed fora period of time during the relative sea-level rise that followed the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The shorelines are commonly represented by palaeo-coastal cliffs and barrier-beaches that lie today at water depths between -100 m and -70 m, and between -65 m and -40 m, in most places irrespective of the different tectonic contexts, even in the presence of significant vertical rates. These morphological features are thought to have been drowned during melt-water pulses 1A and 1B, which occurred between 15 and 10 ka. The evidence presented here confirms drowned shorelines documented elsewhere at similar water depths and shows that melt-water pulses have punctuated the post-glacial relative sea-level rise with rates up to 60 mm/yr. for a few centuries. The identification of morphological features related to melt-water pulses in the central Mediterranean Sea has important implications to improve our knowledge on episodes of rapid glacio-eustatic sea-level rise. This issue is critical to be able to forecast future sea-level rises in the Mediterranean, which is characterized by densely populated coasts and important coastal infrastructures.

TI The Mekong at climatic crossroads: Lessons from the geological past
SO AMBIO
AB The wetlands of the lower Mekong River Basin are ecologically and socioeconomically significant, but they are threatened by predicted climatic change. The likely response of wetland ecosystems to altered flooding regimes and surface-water chemistry is unknown in detail and difficult to model. One way of exploring the impact of climate change on wetland ecosystems is to utilize proxy environmental data that reveal patterns of change over geological time. In recent years, the coverage and resolution of proxy climatic data have improved markedly in the region. Recent evidence of the South China Sea transgression into southern and central Cambodia and paleobotanical evidence from the Tonle Sap ("Great Lake") and elsewhere allow us to explore how periods of higher-than-present sea level and increased monsoon rainfall in the past have impacted the wetland ecology of the lower Mekong River Basin.

TI Histories of the Unprecedented: Climate Change, Environmental
   Transformations, and Displacement in the United States
SO OPEN LIBRARY OF HUMANITIES
AB While the speed of current climatic changes is unprecedented, their ramifications are not. Floods and droughts, sea-level rise, advancing glaciers, and desertification do have a history, and the same is true for the social causes and aftermaths of such extreme natural events. Therefore, history provides a fertile field for the analysis of how societies have dealt with severe environmental changes, and the analysis of past extreme natural events yields interesting lessons for the current debate on 'environmental migration', even if they were not caused by climatic changes. This article examines historical case studies of a phenomenon that is arguably one of the greatest challenges of the future: migration and displacement triggered by environmental deterioration and destruction. While a wide range of studies focuses on the present and future of 'environmental migration', little research has been devoted to the long-term causes and effects of environmentally induced displacement. In other words: what is lacking is historical depth. Only by looking at the longue duree of environmental migration and displacement can we detect patterns of vulnerability and resilience, adequately describe the course and paths of displacement and fully acknowledge the aftermath of disaster diasporas.

TI Evolution of the Sele River coastal plain (southern Italy) during the
   Late Quaternary by inland and offshore stratigraphical analyses
SO RENDICONTI LINCEI-SCIENZE FISICHE E NATURALI
AB The late Quaternary evolution of the Sele River coastal plain (Salerno Gulf, southern Italy) was investigated through integrated stratigraphical, chronological and palaeoecological analyses. The main environmental changes were ascribed to glacio-eustatic variations leading to rapid ingressions alternating with coastal progradations. The marked marine ingression of MIS 5.5 is testified by palaeoridges now cropping out 4 km inland at 11/13 m a.s.l. (Gromola palaeoridge). The eustatic minimum of MIS 2 is testified by lower shoreface deposits in the offshore core record and in the seismic profiles at 120/130 m below sea level. This prolonged sea-level fall was interrupted by at least three rapid sea-level rises, probably related to MIS 5.3, 5.1 and 3. The evidence of the first two sea level rises are represented by shoreface deposits in the inland S1 core (30 m thick, 3 m a.s.l., 1.5 km inland). The highstand of MIS 3 was identified by seismic profiles as onlapping marine deposits. The shore deposits at 100 m b.s.l were tentatively attributed to the lowstand of MIS 4. After the lowstand of MIS 2, the Sele Plain was newly flooded due to the rapid Post Glacial sea-level rise. This ingression caused the inland migration of a barrier-lagoon system and stopped at approximately 5.5 ky BP. From that moment the shoreline started prograding up to the present position probably due to the decrease in the sea-level rise rates and to the volcaniclastic supplies from the Neapolitan volcanoes, especially from the AD 79 Vesuvius eruption, also recorded in the subbottom chirp profiles.

TI Interannual changes in seagrass (Posidonia oceanica) growth and
   environmental change in the Spanish Mediterranean littoral zone
SO LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
AB The interannual changes in leaf formation and vertical growth rates and their correlation to the records available of environmental change (rainfall, mean sea level, water temperature, and transparency) were examined in 15 Posidonia oceanica meadows growing along the Spanish Mediterranean coast between 1967 and 1992. P. oceanica leaf production fluctuated interannually, but it did not exhibit any steady trend toward decline, indicative of nonhuman effects on changes in water quality in these areas. Conversely, the steady decline in vertical rhizome growth rate of P. oceanica observed in two sites suggests that shoreline erosion there could derive from human activities. In all meadows examined, interannual variability in vertical rhizome growth of P. oceanica showed clear oscillating trends, suggesting alternating episodes of sediment erosion and accretion every 7 yr and at least every 25 yr. Mean sea level and surface water temperature have been increasing for the last two decades, but water transparency has been declining. However, overall trends only accounted for 24-37% of the long-term climatic variance. Rainfall interannual changes were dominated by time scales of 8 and 28 yr, whereas water transparency, temperature, and sea level showed dominant time scales in the oscillations of 4 and 15 yr, 6 and 20 yr, and 11 and 27 yr, respectively. In addition, 33% of P. oceanica vertical growth variability in the southern Spanish Mediterranean coast derived from variability in rainfall, suggesting a rise of erosive coastal conditions during rainy years. The similarity in the interannual changes of seagrass growth over a wide spatial scale (1,000 km), together with the significant coupling between seagrass growth and climate variability, points out climate change, and not widespread deterioration derived from anthropogenic pressure, as the main source of the observed changes in the Mediterranean littoral zone.

TI Planned relocation and everyday agency in low-lying coastal villages in
   Fiji
SO GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
AB Relocation of communities is widely expected to be an adaptive response to sea-level rise, albeit a last resort after exhausting other adaptation options. It is a phenomenon, however, from which there are few examples to learn. This paper examines relocation processes underway in three low-lying coastal villages in Fiji, each affected by coastal erosion and flooding. Drawing on the concept of "everyday agency," it considers how environmental changes and planned relocation initiatives are resisted, accommodated, or shaped through daily activities and decision-making. For residents of these three villages, climate change adaptation is not only a matter of adapting to environmental changes, but a process of actively steering a way through unfolding dimensions of planned relocation. The findings respond to increasingly audible calls to recognise the agency of people living in climate-vulnerable places, and to highlight everyday responses to climate impacts and adaptation initiatives.

TI Palynological evidence for prolonged cooling along the Tunisian
   continental shelf following the K-Pg boundary impact
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB The Cretaceous-Palaeogene (K-Pg) boundary mass extinction event is related to major global environmental changes resulting from a large extraterrestrial impact. Organic-walled cyst-producing marine dinoflagellates (dinocysts) survived the K-Pg mass-extinction relatively unscathed, making them ideally suited for reconstructing these environmental changes. So far, one of the best dinocyst records available is from the K-Pg boundary Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) at El Kef (NW Tunisia). There, the dinocyst record shows major fluctuations across the boundary, likely reflecting strong responses to environmental changes. These fluctuations have so far not been confirmed by other studies. Therefore, in this study we performed a high-resolution marine palynological study on a closely spaced sample set from the Elles section, some 75 km south of El Kef, in order to generate a palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic record across the K-Pg boundary to allow verification and refinement of earlier reported environmental changes. To better constrain the reconstructions based on qualitative biotic proxies we employed the quantitative sea surface temperature proxy TEX86. Unfortunately, the TEX86 proxy record of the studied section is compromised because of post-depositional oxidation. However, the diverse dinocyst assemblages at Riles show strong fluctuations similar to the El Kef record, therefore confirming the earlier recorded signals, showing rapid, regionally consistent changes. These records imply that the latest Cretaceous was characterized by a gradual cooling trend and the onset of relative sea level fall. Within the immediate post-extinction interval, in the first thousands of years after the impact, dinocyst assemblages reveal multiple incursions of higher-latitude dinocyst species implying repeated pulses of cooling. These results signify that the earliest Danian climatic and environmental conditions were relatively unstable across the Tunisian shelf. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A model of water and sediment balance as determinants of relative sea
   level rise in contemporary and future deltas

CT 48th Annual Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium
CY OCT 13-15, 2017
CL Texas State Univ, San Marcos, TX

AB Modern deltas are dependent on human-mediated freshwater and sediment fluxes. Changes to these fluxes impact delta biogeophysical functioning and affect the long-term sustainability of these landscapes for human and for natural systems. Here we present contemporary estimates of long-term mean sediment balance and relative sea level rise across 46 global deltas. We model scenarios of contemporary and future water resource management schemes and hydropower infrastructure in upstream river basins to explore how changing sediment fluxes impact relative sea level rise in delta systems. Model results show that contemporary sediment fluxes, anthropogenic drivers of land subsidence, and sea level rise result in delta relative sea level rise rates that average 6.8 mm/y. Assessment of impacts of planned and under-construction dams on relative sea level rise rates suggests increases on the order of 1 mm/y in deltas with new upstream construction. Sediment fluxes are estimated to decrease by up to 60% in the Danube and 21% in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna if all currently planned dams are constructed. Reduced sediment retention on deltas caused by increased river channelization and management has a larger impact, increasing relative sea level rise on average by nearly 2 mm/y. Longterm delta sustainability requires a more complete understanding of how geophysical and anthropogenic change impact delta geomorphology. Local and regional strategies for sustainable delta management that focus on local and regional drivers of change, especially groundwater and hydrocarbon extraction and upstream dam construction, can be highly impactful even in the context of global climate-induced sea level rise.

TI Impacts of Climate Change on Narragansett Bay
SO NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST
AB The objective of this paper is to examine the impacts of global climate change on Rhode Island's coastal ecosystems. Average annual air temperature in Rhode Island has increased by 1.7 degrees C since 1880, water temperatures of Narragansett Bay have increased by 1.2 degrees C since 1950, precipitation increased 27% between 1895 and 1999, and sea level rose 0.13 m between 1931 and 2007. We can already see the effects of these climatic changes on the Narragansett Bay ecosystem, including ecological changes in the Bay's food web from phytoplankton and zooplankton to fish, e.g., changes in phenology of seasonal phytoplankton blooms and dominant fish species (e.g., Pseudopleuronectes umericanus [Winter Flounder]). These climatic changes have increased freshwater inputs and the concomitant pollutant loads into the Bay. Rising sea level has contributed to ongoing erosion of the coast and has put waterfront homes at increased risk. It is imperative to continue monitoring these effects.

TI Mid-Holocene coastline reconstruction from geomorphological sea level
   indicators in the Tr = ang An World Heritage Site, Northern Vietnam
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB In this paper we present a high resolution palaeo coastline model for the isolated limestone massif of Tra = ng An, Ninh B & igrave;nh province, Vietnam. The archaeological and palaeoecological record here comprise rich archives of human activity set within a landscape that was cyclically transformed between inland and archipelagic states under the influence of past sea level changes. These records have become informative proxies in the study of current sea level rise. Well-preserved notches along the vertical limestone cliffs within the study property reveal several phases of prolonged stable sea levels that likely pertain to the Mid-Holocene marine transgression 8 ka BP to 4 ka BP and allow for detailed coastline reconstructions for parts of the Red River Delta (RRD). The resulting coastline model facilitates a closer look at past human responses to landscape and environmental changes at local and individual site-level, which improves our understanding of past human adaptations to climate-change induced sea level rise. These data also stand to inform current coastal vulnerability assessments and climate change response models.

AB The Castillos Lagoon has been a research focus regarding sea level fluctuations and associated climatic changes during the Holocene due to its well-preserved record of geomorphological, stratigraphic, and geoarchaeological structures. In this paper, two series of OSL (Optically Stimulated Luminescence) datings will be presented. The first one comes from a system of cheniers situated north of the Castillos Lagoon. The data obtained show that at least during a 1,200 year period, counting from a fewyears before 2460 yr BP, therewas a process of progradation of the lagoon coast and the development of a chenier plain, consistent with a gradual drop in sea level, within a scenario of relatively stable conditions. The second series, proceeding from the first beach ridge adjacent to the lagoon coast, has allowed to determine that this stripe is current and therefore still under formation, or recently formed, permitting to obtain a direct measurement of the difference between its height and the lagoon level related to the moment of its formation that may be correlated to analogous historical records.

AB The Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) is one of the pioneer methodologies for coastal vulnerability assessment (combination of coastal system susceptibility to change and its natural ability to adapt to a changing environment) to future sea level rise associated to global climatic change. The CVI is an "index or aggregated value" of six variables (geomorphology/geology, slope, shoreline change rates, mean significant wave, relative sea level change and mean tidal range). This paper shows the results of a study intended to apply and adapt the CVI methodology to the coast of Andalusia (Spain). It is focussed on the methodological procedures, especially those linked to: (i) the use of a "geodatabase" for data management and integration; (ii) the use of GIS spatial analysis capabilities for interpolation, ranking and calculation; (iii) the exploration of mapping capabilities of Spatial Information Technologies for delivering the results (3D viewers, web mapping, etc.).

TI Holocene vegetational and coastal environmental changes from the Lago
   Crispim record in northeastern Para State, eastern Amazonia
SO REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY
AB Vegetational and coastal environmental changes have been interpreted from a 600 cm long and 7640 C-14 yr B.P, old sediment core from Lago Crispim located in the northeastern Part State in northern Brazil. The radiocarbon dated sediment core was studied by multi-element geochemistry, pollen and charcoal analysis.
   Holocene Atlantic sea-level rise caused an elevation of local water table, which allowed the formation of organic deposits in a probably former inter-dune valley. Dense, diverse and tall Amazon rain forest, and some restinga (coastal vegetation) covered the study area at the beginning of the record at 7640 C-14 yr B.P. Mangrove vegetation developed along rivers close to the core site at that time. Subsequent decrease in less mangrove vegetation near the study site indicates a sea-level regression, beginning since around 7000 C-14 yr B.P. Lower sea-levels probably favoured the formation of a local Mauritia/Mauritiella palm swamp at 6620 C-14 yr B.P. Oscillations of higher and lower sea-level stands probably changed the size of the local palm swamp area several times between 6620 and 3630 C-14 yr B.P. Sea-level transgression at around 3630 C-14 yr B.P., caused marked coastal environmental changes: the development of mangroves near the site, the replacement of the local palm swamp by a Cyperaceae swamp, the substitution of the surrounding former Amazon rain forest and some restinga vegetation mainly by salt marshes. High amount carbonised particles suggest a strong human impact by burning on the coastal ecosystems during this late Holocene period.
   Highest concentrations of NaCl and also Ca, Mg and K in the upper sediment core indicate that the Atlantic was close during the late Holocene period. The core site, which is today 500 m from the coastline and only 1-2 m above modern sea-level, was apparently never reached by marine excursions during the Holocene.
   Less representation of mangrove since ca. 1840 C-14 yr B.P., may be related due to a slightly lower sea-level or to human impact in the study region. The modern shallow lake seems to be formed recently by road construction, forming an artificial dam. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Thick temporalities of planned relocation in Fiji
SO GEOFORUM
AB This paper examines the temporalities of planned relocation in response to climatic and environmental changes in Fiji. It is based on fieldwork among seven low-lying coastal villages under threat from sea- level rise and where planned relocation has been implemented, initiated or anticipated. The paper highlights how residents of these villages make sense of different temporalities and timescale: climate impacts and adaptation are understood to disrupt personal and intergenerational histories of attachment to place; climatic and environmental changes such as sea-level rise, coastal erosion and flooding and relocation planning and implementation are central to contemporary everyday experience; and climate impacts and relocation extend into the future in uncertain ways, albeit informed by future-oriented scientific estimates and local experience and observation. This paper argues that these temporalities are experienced as 'thick time' in which the past, present and future of climate change and relocation are palpable in the everyday.

TI Sea-Level Rise in Public Science Writing: History, Science and
   Reductionism
SO ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNICATION-A JOURNAL OF NATURE AND CULTURE
AB Sea-level rise is a dramatic effect of climate change, with profound implications for societies around the world. In the past few years, a rush of literary non-fiction books have appeared that aim to explain the threat of rising seas to the public. This paper critiques how sea-level rise is framed in many of those books, on two accounts. First, anthropogenic sea-level change is frequently framed by accounts of natural variations of sea level in earth history, focusing on geological rather than societal processes. Second, single and sudden floods are often used to exemplify sea-level rise in ways that draw attention away from incremental environmental change in favour of fast-paced but de-contextualized events. The paper argues that both these frames de-politicize sea-level rise and may steer public understanding and discussion away from relevant social, cultural, and ethical considerations. As examples of climate reductionism, these depictions may obstruct rather than facilitate appropriate negotiations in response to predicted sea-level rise.

TI Terrestrial snails from archaeological sites as proxies for relative sea
   level on the Gulf Coast of Florida, USA
SO JOURNAL OF ISLAND & COASTAL ARCHAEOLOGY
AB Archaeological evidence for local environmental change is obscured by the tendency for humans to remove natural resources from places of procurement and deposit them elsewhere, sometimes at great distance. This is especially problematic for changes in relative sea level, which clearly affected the inhabitability of low-elevation coastal landforms but not necessarily the regional availability of resources of cultural or economic value. Needed are proxies for relative sea level from non-dietary taxa. One genus of terrestrial snails, Truncatella, offers good potential in this respect because of its specific niche at the interface between seawater and land. However, like food resources displaced by people, Truncatella shells are displaced by storms and redistributed landward of the coastline. Distinguishing between autochthonous and allochthonous deposits is essential to inferring relative sea level from the occurrence of this taxon alone. To this end, assemblages of Truncatella shell from stratified sites along the north Gulf Coast of Florida, USA are compared to associated archaeological snails of other taxa and to snail shells from the wrack of proximate foreshores to infer changes in relative sea level over the past four millennia. Variation in the morphology of shorelines and in the accumulation rates of archaeological midden mitigates any direct relationship between terrestrial snail frequencies and sea level, but the results of this study suggest that our approach can be applied to other non-dietary taxa occupying marginally terrestrial niches to refine estimates for sea level derived from the sedimentary records of geological cores.

TI Mangrove dynamics and environmental changes on Koh Chang, Thailand
   during the last millennium
SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
AB A 1500-year record of mangrove dynamics has been established from palaeoecological analyses on three cores from Salak Phet Bay, Koh Chang island in the eastern Gulf of Thailand. The occurrence of Rhizophora, accompanied by other mangrove species, suggested that Salak Phet Bay supported a mangrove community from at least 1500 cal yr BP. From 1500 cal yr BP the mangrove extent decreased indicating less inundation frequency, possibly in response to a sea-level fall until 1300 cal yr BP. Following this regression, sea-level rise resulted in an increased presence of mangrove taxa until 500 cal yr BP. The study documents that Salak Phet Bay was characterised by relatively low saline conditions based on the occurrence of the moist-loving species (Oncosperma) around 1500-500 cal yr BP. After 500 cal yr BP mangrove taxa gradually decreased and terrestrial herbaceous taxa, mainly grasses, increased suggesting that the frequency of marine inundation was reduced as sea level fell. Drier conditions were also recorded by an increase in terrestrial grasses and a decrease in Oncosperma after 500 cal yr BP. In the uppermost sediments the increased presence of Rhizophora is probably associated with recent global sea-level rise although changes in mangrove composition are possibly related to human activities within Koh Chang. The sedimentation rate and the mangrove migration at Koh Chang have kept pace over the past 1500 years but this may be challenged under predicted future rapid sea-level rise as accommodation space for mangroves to migrate inland is required to maintain viable mangrove forests.

AB The evolution of the outer take of Hwajinpo Lagoon in Korea has been reconstructed using environmental proxies (lithologic, geochemical, and fossil data) with a chronology established using 7 accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dates, Grain size, water content, and X-ray analyses from the core of outer coastal lakes (HJ99) were used to reconstruct sedimentary environments by using total organic carbon, C/N, S, and C/S chemical proxies. Assemblages of mollusc remains also provided paleoenvironmental information. The environmental changes of the outer lake of Hwajinpo Lagoon can be divided into 6 depositional phases. The basin of the Hwajinpo was exposed and underwent a weathering process before the Holocene period. The muddy sand layer on the weathered bedrock indicated an estuarine system about 6000 BP. The laminated layer implies that the lagoonal system was anoxic between about 5500-2800 BR The marl layer implies a relatively oxic lagoonal condition with mollusc presence about 2500 BP. The layer of very low sulfur content indicates a freshwater lake system isolated by a sand barrier about 1700 BP. Beginning about 1000 BP, the river system deposits progress progradation on the marl layer. Two erosional landforms could be related with a high standing sea level span during Holocene. These high-stands are dated at 5700 BP and 2200 BP and are supposed to have formed erosional landforms of about 1.6 amsl and 0.8 amsl, respectively. Environmental changes of the outer lake of Hwajinpo Lagoon are considered due mainly to the lake- and sea-level fluctuation during Holocene.

HO UNIV HAWAII
AB The coastal area of southern Apulia is characterised by marine deposits of Pleistocene and Holocene ages. It shows the effects of different phases of coastal morphology evolution. During the Middle and Upper Pleistocene, a number of marine terraces were shaped, In some places, they are characterised by thin beach deposits along with a dune belt and relative back dune deposits. Two important morphogenetic phases occurred during the Holocene. The former was characterised by deposition of beach deposits placed slightly above present mean sea level, and by formation of dune belts which were radiometrically aged about 6000 years BP. This event marks the end of the rapid postglacial transgression that occurred during the Holocene Climatic Optimum. During the younger phase, dated at about 2500 years BP, deposition of aeolian sands occurred. Archaeological and morphological evidences suggest that this phase should be related to a low sea-level stand followed by a slow sea-level rise up to the present position and by humid-temperate climatic conditions. The collected data about the Holocene dune belts occurring along the Apulian coastline suggest that main phases of dune development could be related to the effects of sea-level changes, climatic conditions, and in a subordinate way, to human activity.

TI Records of environmental changes during the Holocene from Isla de los
   Estados (54.4 degrees S), southeastern Tierra del Fuego
SO GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
AB Southernmost Patagonia, located at the relatively narrow passage between Antarctica and South America, is a highly sensitive region for recording meridional and zonal changes in the pattern of oceanic and atmospheric circulation. The island of Isla de los Estados, situated at 54.5 degrees S, 64 degrees W, east of Argentinean Tierra del Fuego, provides an exceptional possibility, to investigate terrestrial records of atmospheric conditions in an oceanic setting during the last deglaciation and the Holocene. Here we present geochemical and diatom analyses from 10600 to c. 1500 cal BP of one sequence (LGB) with peat, lake sediments and lagoon deposits at the northern coast of the island, and a lake sediment sequence (CAS) 3 km further inland. The data comprise TC, TN, loss on ignition analyses and continuous XRF scanning as well as age-depth modeling based on AMS-C-14 dating on both cores. Diatom analysis of the CAS record complements the geochemical proxies. During the Holocene, our two sites have been impacted by two different forcings: changes in the regional climate regime largely influenced by the varying strength and position of the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies (SHW), while relative sea-level changes affected the deposits of the coastal site. In concert with the onset of the Antarctic thermal optimum, our data suggest fairly warm conditions and the establishment of denser peat and forest vegetation on the island c. 10600 cal BP. Between 8500 and 4500 cal BP geochemistry and diatoms from the CAS record indicate stronger Westerlies at this latitude, which means higher wind speed or higher storm frequency and more precipitation, resulting in more pronounced surface run-off. After 4500 cal BP, the geochemical proxies and large changes in diatom assemblages indicate a decrease in precipitation, weaker winds and possibly cooler conditions, probably as an effect of weaker SHW and/or a latitudinal shift. The depositional environment of CAS changed from gyttja to peat around 1000 cal BP. At LGB, the onset of gyttja sedimentation around 7900 cal BP shows that the former wet land with peat accumulation had become a lake with a fairly rapid sedimentation. The chemical data from LGB imply a gradually increasing marine influence, probably as an effect of both rising sea level and increased impact of storms and maximum high tides. After a marine high-stand during the mid-Holocene, the LGB site returned into a peat bog again around 3400 cal BP. Our data suggest that since then relative sea level first dropped back below present sea level followed by a rise to present day sea level. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Sea-level fluctuations imply that the Younger Dryas ice-sheet expansion
   in western Norway commenced during the Allerod
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB After the first emergence following deglaciation, relative sea level rose by 10m in western Norway and culminated late in the Younger Dryas (YD). The relative sea-level history, reconstructed by dating deposits in isolation basins. shows a sea-level low-stand between similar to 13 640 and 13 080 cal yr BP, a 10 m sea-level rise between similar to 13 080 and 11 790 cal yr BP and a sea-level high-stand between similar to-11 790 and 11550 cal yr BP. Shortly after the YD/Holocene boundary, sea level fell abruptly by similar to 37 m. The shorelines formed during the sea-level low-stand in the mid-Allergd and during the sea-level high-stand in the YD have almost parallel tilts with a gradient of similar to 1.3 m km(-1), indicating that hardly any isostatic movement has taken place during this period of sea-level rise. We conclude that the transgression was caused by the major re-advance of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet that took place in western Norway during the Lateglacial. The extra ice load halted the isostatic uplift and elevated the geoid due to the increased gravitational attraction on the sea. Our results show that the crust responded to the increased load well before the YD (starting similar to 12 900 cal yr BP), with a sea-level low-stand at 13 640 cal yr BP and the subsequent YD transgression starting at 13 080 cal yr BP. Thus, we conclude that the so-called YD ice-sheet advance in western Norway started during the Allerod, possibly more than 600 years before the Allerod/YD transition. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Relative sea-level and climatic changes in the Amazon littoral during
   the last 500 years
SO CATENA
AB An integrated approach focused on sedimentology, geochemistry, palynology, C and N isotopes and radiocarbon dating of a sediment core from an herbaceous plain not flooded by tides of the Amapa littoral, near the Amazon River mouth, allowed identification of two phases with marine and terrestrial influences. Mangroves occurred over tidal mud flats with marine influence between >5610-5470 and 470-310 cal yr BP. The absence of mangrove vegetation since 470-310 cal yr was followed by the transition of brackish water organic matter to terrestrial C-3 plants. Also, the geochemical data indicate a decrease in sea water influence during this last time interval. Likely, the displacement of mangrove forest to lower surfaces was caused by a relative sea-level fall that may be associated with drier conditions with less rainfall during the second part of the last millennium. As suggested by this work, slight relative sea-level fluctuations caused by regional or global climatic change may affect significantly the current mangrove area. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI A LARGE-SCALE METAPOPULATION MODEL OF INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION AND
   ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB A spatially explicit model is developed for metapopulations occupying habitat patches whose quality varies over space and time and where dispersal is localized. Computer simulations of the model showed that broad-niched, good-dispersing ''generalist'' species were better able to track environmental change than ''specialist'' species. The outcome of interspecific competition also varied with landscape type (degree of fragmentation) and rate of environmental change. Under a constant environment or slow environmental change, interspecific competition involved local (within-cell) processes that favored the specialist species over the generalist. Under moderate to high rates of environmental change local population dynamics increasingly favored high immigration rates of the generalist over the local competitive ability of the specialist. With rapid environmental change and a highly fragmented patch landscape the generalist was able to limit the ability of the specialist to persist and/or track the shifting environment. Our results suggest that under environmental change communities will increasingly become dominated by generalist species. Our approach extends metapopulation models to treat patterns of continental species diversity, and other environmental change models to include a population inhabiting a landscape of interconnected patches rather than a single habitat patch.

Marine records of climatic change in Africa north of the equator during the last 5 million years show that environmental conditions became much drier causing a substantial increase of the Sahara and loss of wet forest. Examples of climate-forced and tectonism-forced environmental changes in northern South America are shown. Man-forced environmental change since at least the last 12,000 years is illustrated with examples from Australia, Guatemala, Colombia and Brazil. On the long time scale human impact on the environment appears mure difficult to identify than climate impact on the environment and even climate impact on evolution.

AB Concerning the risk of coastal flooding as a consequence of climatic change and associated sea-level rise, there is a great need to assess the vulnerability of coastal zones with special respect to land use and resource management.
   The aim of this study is to analyze the effects of climatic change and subsequent sea-level rise at the southern Baltic coast on the groundwater management of coastal aquifers, especially poldered lowlands.
   The area of investigation is located on the island Usedom at the German-Polish border. By means of a high-resolution finite-element computer code (FeFlow, Wasy) a fully three-dimensional groundwater flow model is established which simulates today's flow condition and future scenarios. Socio-economic and environmental consequences are derived from the model output. It is shown that at a predicted sea level rise of 41 cm further pumping is economically unreasonable.

TI High-resolution architecture of late Holocene highstand prodeltaic
   deposits from southern Spain: the imprint of high-frequency climatic and
   relative sea-level changes
SO CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
AB The stratigraphic architecture and recent evolution of two late Holocene prodeltas (Guadalquivir and Guadalhorce rivers) from the south of Spain are compared on the basis of a high-resolution seismic stratigraphic analysis. These sedimentary bodies display a similar internal architecture, being characterised by a thin transgressive systems tract at their bases and an overlying thick, wedge-shaped highstand systems tract (HST). The internal structure of the HST deposits shows the repetition of two progradational/aggradational cycles, whose generation seems to be related to the influence of high-frequency climatic changes during the last 6-7 ka. Those changes probably involved small amplitude (< 3=1 m) sea-level oscillations and associated changes of sediment supply, conditioning the development of delta switching processes. Small differences in the distribution and characteristics of the seismic units in each area are attributed to local factors, such as physiography of the coastal plains, the wave climate and increased sediment supplies conditioned by anthropic actions.

TI Major, trace-elemental and sedimentological characterization of the
   upper Ordovician Wufeng-lower Silurian Longmaxi formations, Sichuan
   Basin, south China: Insights into the effect of relative sea-level
   fluctuations on organic matter accumulation in shales
SO MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY
AB The relative sea-level fluctuations play a vital role in the organic matter enrichment of black shales across the world. The Wufeng-Lower Longmaxi shales deposited during the Late Ordovician to Early Silurian stage are accompanied by the global transgression and regression, whereas the role of relative sea-level changes on organic matter accumulation has been rarely discussed. In this study, we integrated TOC content, X-ray diffraction (XRD) mineralogical composition, thin section and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images, elemental geochemical data, and petrographic features of pyrite framboids to investigate the varying paleoenvironmental conditions and the effect of relative sea-level changes on organic matter accumulation under a robust sequence stratigraphic framework.
   Based on detailed petrographic observations and mineralogical analysis, six major lithofacies are identified in the Wufeng-Lower Longmaxi formations, including siliceous mudstone, clay-rich siliceous mudstone, siliceous-argillaceous mixed shale, silty mudstone, siltstone, and bentonite. TOC content is generally higher in the transgressive systems tracts (relative sea-level rise stage) than in the highstand systems tracts and falling stage systems tract (relative sea-level fall stage). Multiple geochemical proxies indicate contrasting paleoenvironmental changes between relative sea-level rise and fall stage. Relative sea-level rise resulted in elevated productivity, predominantly anoxic conditions, low detrital flux, and moderate water mass restriction, as indicated by high biogenic Si content, high Mo-EF (enrichment factor of element Mo), small-sized pyrite framboids, low Al content and moderate Mo/TOC ratio. On the contrary, relative sea-level fall generally resulted in decreased productivity, dysoxic conditions, increased detrital flux, and strongly restricted conditions. The cor relations between TOC content and geochemical proxies suggest that organic matter accumulation was a combined effect of paleoproductivity, paleoredox conditions, detrital influx, and water mass restriction. The variation of these factors was strongly influenced by relative sea-level fluctuations related to Hirnantian glaciation and regional tectonic movements during the Late Ordovician-Early Silurian transitional stage.

TI An oscillating holocene sea-level? Revisiting Rottnest Island, Western
   Australia, and the Fairbridge Eustatic Hypothesis
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB There is a similarity in the pattern of Holocene sea-level change at Rottnest Island and a number of other locations in southern Western Australia. Rottnest Island was one of the field study areas that Fairbridge (1961) used to develop his fluctuating Holocene sea-level curve. Eight 14 C ages obtained from fixed shell material of Serpulid tubeworms from tightly constrained inter-tidal zones are presented from Rottnest Island, and thirteen more from a transect extending 1000 km along the coast of southwest Australia. The age-elevation profiles show a consistent mid- to late-Holocene sea-level fluctuation over the entire southwest Australian region, which argues against a strong local tectonic or a broader hydro-isostatic influence. A comparison of the southwest and southeast coasts of Australia, based on fixed inter-tidal biological indicators obtained by similar methods, indicates a broadly similar mid- to late-Holocene oscillating sea-level curve up to two metres higher-than-present. Peak levels are preceded and followed by sharp similar to 1 metre falls, which appear to be associated with cooling sea temperatures at similar to 5200 and similar to 3800 cal years BP. Both rising sea levels and warmer-than-present sea surface temperatures occur at all locations at similar to 4200 and similar to 6500 cal years BP, with a net sea-level fall to the present, but a slight warming beginning at similar to 1400 cal yr BP. There also appears to be a common pattern of species change suggestive of synchronous climatic variations. These mid-latitude fluctuations and environmental changes on the Australian coastline are similar to some events over the same period in the equivalent far-field locations of southern Brazil and southeast Asia. The synchronicity of these oscillations and their climatic underpinnings, in mid-latitude sites far from the complications of glacial isostasy, is not inconsistent with Fairbridge's (1961) basic thesis of world-wide eustatic Holocene sea-level change.

TI Interannual variability of mean sea level and its sensitivity to wind
   climate in an inter-tidal basin
SO EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS
AB The relationship between the annual wind records from a weather station and annual mean sea level in an inter-tidal basin, the Dutch Wadden Sea, is examined. Recent, homogeneous wind records are used, covering the past 2 decades. It is demonstrated that even such a relatively short record is sufficient for finding a convincing relationship. The interannual variability of mean sea level is largely explained by the west-east component of the net wind energy, with some further improvement if one also includes the south-north component and the annual mean atmospheric pressure. Using measured data from a weather station is found to give a slight improvement over reanalysis data, but for both the correlation between annual mean sea level and wind energy in the west-east direction is high. For different tide gauge stations in the Dutch Wadden Sea and along the coast, we find the same qualitative characteristics, but even within this small region, different locations show a different sensitivity of annual mean sea level to wind direction. Correcting observed values of annual mean level for meteorological factors reduces the margin of error (expressed as 95% confidence interval) by more than a factor of 4 in the trends of the 20-year sea level record. Supplementary data from a numerical hydrodynamical model are used to illustrate the regional variability in annual mean sea level and its interannual variability at a high spatial resolution. This study implies that climatic changes in the strength of winds from a specific direction may affect local annual mean sea level quite significantly.

TI Should Quaternary sea-level changes be used to correct glacier ELAs,
   vegetation belt altitudes and sea level temperatures for inferring
   climate changes?
SO QUATERNARY RESEARCH
AB Changes in the altitudes of glacier snowlines (ELAs) and the altitudes of montane vegetation belts (VBAs) measure Quaternary climatic change. An accepted 'correction' to Such changes by deducting the amount of contemporary sea level fall is wrong, since the air displaced by the ice sheets approximately fills the space left by the failing sea level and so there is no overall downward movement of the troposphere. This also causes a reduced cooling at the lowered sea level relative to that at the former inter-glacial sea level, about 1 degrees C at the Las Glacial Maximum, which reduces the discrepancies previously noted by others between terrestrial and marine estimates of sea-level cooling. The change in temperature is indicated by the product of the ELA or VBA lowering and the environmental lapse rate (ELR). Prior estimates of Delta ELA (-900 +/- 135 m) and ELR (-6 degrees +/- 0.1 degrees C km(-1)) would indicate a cooling of -5.4 degrees C at interglacial sea level and -4.4 degrees C at glacial sea level, although glacial-period ELRs are not known reliably. Established ELA corrections for local epeirogenic uplift or subsidence are appropriate. (c) 2005 University of Washington. All rights reserved.

TI Response of Mangroves to Late Holocene Sea-Level Change:
   Palaeoecological Evidence from Sumatra, Indonesia
SO WETLANDS
AB This study was conducted with aim to reconstruct the late Holocene mangrove history and to investigate if mangroves can be resilient to current and projected sea-level rise (SLR). The palynological record from a sediment core in the Mendahara Ilir region (MI) in Sumatra was compared with available sea level reconstructions from sites close to MI (Malacca Strait and Singapore). The palynological results show that the mangrove swamp forest was already present in MI ca. 2300 years ago. At time, the sea-level was estimated to be ca. 2 m higher than the present level, thus indicating persistence of mangroves in MI for the current global increase scenario of more than 1 m SLR by 2100. However, the estimated rate of change from the MI core are ca. 2.2 mm/yr. These values are much lower than current (5.0 mm/yr) and future (7 mm/yr) estimates. Thus posing a threat on the resilience and the capacity to adapt of the mangrove swamp forest. Additionally, the palynological results indicate that the mangrove swamp forests were quickly moving seaward and landward following regression and transgression phases in MI. Without a clear inland free path, such migration will be impeded under current and future projections of SLR.

TI Foraminiferal evidence of late holocene sea-level change and Amerindian
   site distribution at Montague Harbour, British Columbia
SO GEOGRAPHIE PHYSIQUE ET QUATERNAIRE
AB Foraminiferal and sedimentological analysis of an underwater stratigraphic section from an Amerindian habitation site at Montague Harbour, British Columbia has further documented late Holocene sea level changes. It appears that part of the documented transgression was caused by tectonic subsidence of the area (Event 1 at approx. 3500 calendar years BP and Event 2 sometime before 1 100 calendar years BP) and was recognized in the stratigraphic record by rapid environmental changes. The environmental changes caused by rapid shifts in water depth were recognized through sedimentological and foraminiferal evidence. The tectonic subsidence events, coupled with gentle late Holocene transgression, caused the breaching of Montague Harbour's northwestern channel. The breaching of the channel improved water circulation and increased salinity within the harbour. The salinity changes are reflected in the shift from a low salinity Cribroelphidium excavatum (Terquem, 1876) phenotype ''clavata'' dominated biofacies (1) at the base of the section to a higher salinity Buccella tenerrima (Bandy, 1950) and Elphidiella hannai (Cushman and Grant, 1927) dominated biofacies (2) at the top. These sea-level changes would have eventually forced local Amerindian settlements inland. The C-14 dating of wood and shell, indicates that the recovery of archaeological remains of the Charles culture (ca.6500-3200 years BP) requires investigation in deeper waters.

TI Evidence of an Marine Isotope Stage 3 transgression at the Baixada
   Santista, south-eastern Brazilian coast
SO BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY
AB In this paper, we present new evidence regarding a Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS3) transgression on the south-eastern Brazilian coast (Baixada Santista coastal plain). Data collected from a Standard Penetration Test (SPT) drilling reveal the occurrence of myxohaline sediments between cal BP 45,000 and 41,000. A deeper sequence, which shows a clear transition from terrestrial to a myxohaline environment, was associated with MIS5e. Organic and inorganic proxies have been used to recognize the variations on the terrestrial/myxohaline/marine deposits, as well as to infer about climate and energy of the depositional environment. Environmental change, which could correspond to a sea-level peak or the occurrence of drier conditions, was recognized between 43,000 and 42,000 cal BP. The results reinforce the need for future works on MIS3 variability on the South American Atlantic coast.

AB Global warming causes world-wide concern on the impact of sea-level rise on oceanic coasts. Predicting this impact is hampered by the slow pace of sea-level rise in the past (17 cm in the 20th century, 2.8 mm/year in the last 15 years; IPCC, 2007), and the complexity of coastal processes. The Caspian Sea, having experienced phases of sea-level rise of up to a hundred times the eustatic rate, offers accelerated real-world models of how coasts behave under such conditions. These data can be used to calibrate and validate existing simulation models of coastal geochemical landscapes behaviour, including behaviour of the Mediterranean and Black Sea coasts. Long-term monitoring of the Caspian Sea shore zone landscapes allows revealing the environmental changes due to the whole cycle of sea-level changes. The first part of the cycle lasted for 50 years (1929-1978) and was characterized by the retreat of the sea, lowering of the ground water table, and general decrease in the degree of hydromorphism of the territory. The second phase of the cycle (1978-1995) corresponded to the rise in the sea level and the depth of the ground water, and to increase in the degree of water-logging of the soil cover.

TI Sedimentary history of the western Bohai coastal plain since the late
   Pliocene: Implications on tectonic, climatic and sea-level changes
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
AB Thick Cenozoic deposits from the western Bohai coastal plain, a tectonic-subsiding region, provide the potential to study the relations between sedimentary environments and tectonic, climatic and sea-level changes. However, sedimentary history of this region extending to the whole Quaternary, as well as their links to tectonic, climatic and sea-level changes are still poorly understood, mainly because of the lack of long-term records with well-constrained chronology. In this study, we present an integrated record based on sedimentology and proxies (grain-size and color reflectance) of a 203.6 m core recovered from the western Bohai coastal plain near Tianjin. The core was chronologically well constrained using paleomagnetic and optically stimulated luminescence dating methods. The results show that from the late Pliocene (similar to 3.3 Ma) to the late Pleistocene (similar to 0.10 Ma), the study region was mainly dominated by fluvial setting, and the extensive incursion of sea water into this region began during the last interglacial period (similar to 0.10 Ma). The sedimentology and the color index suggest that tectonic subsidence of the Bohai Basin during the Plio-Quaternary must have played a significant role in controlling the sedimentary environments in this region. The changes in base-level because of sea-level fluctuations during the Quaternary influenced the fluvial development greatly and led to the alternations of coarse crevasse splay/channel and finer floodplain deposits in the core sequence. In addition, climatic changes since the late Pliocene also have had significant effects on the sedimentary settings in the Bohai coastal plain by influencing the fluvial process with a series of mechanisms.

TI Environmental changes and human impact on landscapes as recorded in
   lagoon-lacustrine sequences of Russky Island, South Far East
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
AB Diatom and pollen analyses of paleolake sediments allowed assessment of the natural and anthropogenic factors that affected the local landscape evolution over the last 7500 cal yr on Russky Island in South Far East of Russia. Eight stages in lagoon development mainly controlled by sea level fluctuations were inferred. Lagoon salinity was highest during the maximum of the Holocene transgression. The lagoon developed into a brackish lake at similar to 5090 cal yr BP and became completely fresh at similar to 4090 cal yr BP. The sedimentation rate decreased around 3510 cal yr BP, which coincided with a weakening of the summer monsoon. A swamp formed during the last 700 years. The data suggest that natural factors were the main controls on the observed changes in the landscape. Pollen analysis indicates periods of increased proportions of thermophilic species in the broadleaf forests. Pollen data indicate appearance of Korean pine and fir, role oak and birches, and changes of the plant community on the coast. First notable human impact on the vegetation coincided with the Neolithic colonization of the coastal area. Evidence of fires between similar to 5500 and 4920 cal yr BP was possibly associated with human activities. Human impact on the vegetation increased markedly in the late 19th century.

TI The record of the Quaternary on continental shelves - their
   interpretation, correlation and applications
SO EPISODES
AB Continental shelves provide a direct record of Quaternary sea-level changes but have nor played a major role in land-sea correlation. This is attributed mainly to the lack of a major international initiative like the Ocean Drilling Programme on shelves, the high cost of off shore drilling, and, the restrictions imposed on the release of information obtained by the offshore petroleum industry. The main aim of International Geological Correlation Programme project number 396 (IGCP 396) initiated in 1996 is to study and interpret Quaternary sequences on shelves to permit global correlation of sea-level and climatic changes while at the same time identify beneficial uses for humankind. This paper provides information on the project including selected highlights from the research conducted to date.

TI Holocene sea levels and palaeoenvironments, Malay-Thai Peninsula,
   southeast Asia
SO HOLOCENE
AB Sedimentological and palynological investigations of Great Songkhla Lakes, east coast of the Malay-Thai Peninsula, Southeast Asia, reveal sedimentary sequences rich in palynomorph assemblages dominated by pollen of mangroves and freshwater swamps. Compared with other regions in Southeast Asia the assemblages are of relatively low diversity. Geochronological data indicate that the Great Songkhla Lakes record one of the earliest mangrove environments in Southeast Asia (8420-8190 cal. yr BP), which are subsequently replaced by a freshwater swamp at 7880-7680 cal. yr BP owing to the decline of marine influence. Sea-level observations from Great Songkhla Lakes and other areas of the Malay-Thai Peninsula reveal an upward trend of Holocene relative sea level from a minimum of -22 m at 9700-9250 cal. yr BP to a mid-Holocene high stand of 4850-4450 cal. yr BP, which equates to a rise of c. 5.5 mm/yr. The sea-level fall from the high stand is steady at c. -1.1 mm/yr. Geophysical modelling shows that hydro-isostasy contributes a significant spatial variation to the sea-level signal between some site locations (3-4 m during the mid-Holocene), indicating that it is not correct to construct a single relative sea-level history for the Malay-Thai Peninsula.

TI Sea level rise and impacts on nearshore sedimentation: An overview
SO GEOLOGISCHE RUNDSCHAU
AB Impacts on nearshore sedimentation arising Introduction from potential sea level change of the magnitude predicted in Intergovernmental Panel on Climatic Change scenarios associated with global warming are reviewed. For sandy duned coasts, the obvious sedimentation impacts include potential erosion of coastal dunes with implied deposition of the eroded material in the nearshore, possible deepening of embayments, and flooding of wetlands. For the sandy coasts a number of two-dimensional models are available for predicting shore line change, but there are significant difficulties in applying Bruun-type models for dune erosion and assessment of sediment redistribution over the inner shelf, and for predicting the amount of shoreline retreat for a given rate of sea level rise. If the beach profile contains excessive sand relative to its equilibrium profile, sensu Dean (1991), then shoreline retreat may not occur upon sea level rise. From the evidence of Kiel Bay, at least in these semi-enclosed basin types, it is during major transgressions that maximum deposition in adjacent basins occurs, due to the sea eroding weakly consolidated and weathered surface regolith. But at the same time climatic patterns were re-adjusting and probably contributed to maximum deposition in adjacent shelf and basins below wave base.

TI Holocene Sea Level Recorded by Beach Rocks at Ionian Coasts of Apulia
   (Italy)
SO GEOSCIENCES
AB Beach rocks are located along many coasts of the Mediterranean basin. The early diagenesis environment and the mean sea level along the shoreline make these landforms useful in the reconstruction of relative sea-level changes and, in particular, as SLIPs (sea-level index points). The beach rocks surveyed along the Ionian coast of Apulia were found to be well preserved at three specific depth ranges: 6-9 m, 3-4 m, and from the foreshore to about 1.20 m. Morpho-bathymetric and dive surveys were performed to assess both the geometries and the extension of the submerged beach rocks. Samples were collected at these different depths in the localities of Lido Torretta, Campomarino di Maruggio, San Pietro in Bevagna, and Porto Cesareo. Bivalve shells were identified and isolated from the beach rock samples collected at a depth of 7 m; AMS dating provided a calibrated age of about 7.8 ka BP. Their morphology and petrological features, along with the time constraints, enabled us to (i) reconstruct the local sea-level curve during the Holocene, (ii) corroborate acquired knowledge of the relative sea-level history, and (iii) identify possible local vertical land movement (VLM).

TI Carbonate mud mounds, conglomerates, and sea-level history in the Katian
   (Upper Ordovician) of central Sweden
SO FACIES
AB The Katian (Upper Ordovician) facies succession of the Siljan district, central Sweden, records some of the most prominent environmental changes in the Ordovician of Baltoscandia. These changes include two separate phases of major sea-level drawdown that were of basinwide and presumably global importance. The first regression and lowstand terminated an entire generation of carbonate mud mounds (the Kullsberg Limestone) and resulted in the formation of polymict carbonate conglomerates (SkAyenlberg Limestone) belonging to the Amorphognathus superbus Zone. New stable isotope data from the Amtjarn quarry shows that this is immediately after the peak of the Guttenberg Carbon Isotope Excursion (GICE), which reaches a delta C-13 peak value at 3.3aEuro degrees in the uppermost Amorphognathus tvaerensis Conodont Zone. A second major regression and sea-level lowstand is manifested by palaeokarst morphologies in the Slandrom Limestone, which formed close in time to the comparably minor Waynesville positive carbon excursion in the basal Amorphognathus ordovicicus Conodont Zone. The widespread exposure associated with this latter lowstand terminated carbonate production in much of the basin, and, during the subsequent flooding, organic-rich, graptolitic shale formed across most of Baltoscandia. The two corresponding sequence boundaries are amalgamated at the top of truncated carbonate mud mounds in the Siljan district, resulting in a pronounced Middle Katian hiatus in the immediate mound areas.

AB Benthic foraminiferal, ostracod, calcareous nannoplankton and diatom assemblages have been analysed from the 25.45 sedimentary succession of a borehole drilled in the Santo Andre lagoon (southwestern Portugal). The zones and subzones recognized according to their microfossil content have been used to define six palaeoenvironmental stages extending from the Lateglacial to the present. Stage A and the lower part of stage B (14.2 to 10,0 ka) represent a postglacial terrestrial environment when sea level was below present. Following eustatic sea-level rise, a normal marine, open-bay environment established during the upper part of stage B (10.0 to 5.4 ka). Before 5.4 ka, a coastal lagoon developed as a consequence of a sandy barrier formation. Since then, natural variation in the permeability of the detrital barrier through time has been the primary control of the physical. chemical and biological features of the lagoonal environment: during stage C (5.4 to 3.6 ka) as a freshwater-dominated lagoon, stage D (3.6 to 1.6 ka) as a brackish lagoonal environment, and stage E (1.6 to 0.5 ka) as a return to a freshwater-dominated lagoon. Finally, in the last 400 years (stage F), human intervention on the sandy barrier (artificial open- and closed-inlet conditions) has provoked rapid and dramatic environmental changes in Santo Andre.

TI Oceanic Forcing of Ice-Sheet Retreat: West Antarctica and More
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCES, VOL 43
SE Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences
AB Ocean-ice interactions have exerted primary control on the Antarctic Ice Sheet and parts of the Greenland Ice Sheet, and will continue to do so in the near future, especially through melting of ice shelves and calving cliffs. Retreat in response to increasing marine melting typically exhibits threshold behavior, with little change for forcing below the threshold but a rapid, possibly delayed shift to a reduced state once the threshold is exceeded. For Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica, the threshold may already have been exceeded, although rapid change may be delayed by centuries, and the reduced state will likely involve loss of most of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, causing > 3 m of sea-level rise. Because of shortcomings in physical understanding and available data, uncertainty persists about this threshold and the subsequent rate of change. Although sea-level histories and physical understanding allow the possibility that ice-sheet response could be quite fast, no strong constraints are yet available on the worst-case scenario. Recent work also suggests that the Greenland and East Antarctic Ice Sheets share some of the same vulnerabilities to shrinkage from marine influence.

TI ECOSYSTEM ORGANIZATION AND EXTINCTION DYNAMICS
SO PALAIOS
AB Most recent explanations for extinctions have focused on abiotic mechanisms such as climatic change, bolide impact, and eustatic sea-level change. The structure and dynamics of the ecological systems that are responding to these disturbances have generally been overlooked. The internal structure of an ecosystem, especially interdependencies among its components, should strongly influence its response to environmental change, by controlling the degree to which loss of one component can produce additional extinctions. We used percolation theory to model this process, by examining how disturbances propagate among interconnected nodes on lattices. Our models suggest that the magnitude of ecosystem response to disturbance is strongly non-linear. Small disturbances can produce large extinctions and large disturbances small extinctions, depending on the degree of interdependency within the system. Disturbances may act to maintain ecosystems at low levels of overall integration. Paleontological and neontological evidence for long-term ecosystem stability, co-evolutionary interactions, and mass extinction selectivity all emphasize the potential importance of interdependence in ancient and modern ecosystems.

   north-west
SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
AB The Dampier Archipelago (properly known as Murujuga) is a rich rock art province in north-western Australia which documents an arid-maritime cultural landscape. But this Archipelago of 42 islands has only existed since the mid-Holocene. When people started to engrave art here, the granophyre bedrock was part of an inland range, more than 160 km from the coast. The Pilbara archaeological record demonstrates human responses through over forty thousand years of environmental change. This paper discusses how rock art across Murujuga can give insights to changing dynamics of people in place as well as depicting major environmental change. A predictive model is developed to assist in understanding the social changes which have been wrought by sea-level rise and consequential environmental changes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

TI Relative sea-level changes in southeastern Australia during the 19(th)
   and 20(th) centuries
SO JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE
AB Rates of global and regional sea-level rise between similar to 1850 and 1950 were high compared to those in preceding centuries. The cause of this sea-level acceleration remains uncertain, but it appears to be pronounced in a small set of relative sea-level proxy records from the Southern Hemisphere. Here we generate three new proxy-based relative sea-level reconstructions for southeastern Australia to investigate spatial patterns and causes of historical sea-level changes in the Tasman Sea. Palaeo sea-level estimates were determined using salt-marsh foraminifera as sea-level indicators. Records are underpinned by chronologies based on accelerator mass spectrometry C-14, radiogenic lead (Pb-210), stable lead isotopes and palynological analyses. Our reconstructions show that relative sea level rose by similar to 0.2-0.3 m over the last 200 years in southeastern Australia, and rates of sea-level rise were especially high over the first half of the 20(th) century. Based on modelled estimates of the contributing components to sea-level rise, we suggest that the episode of rapid sea-level rise was driven by barystatic contributions, but sterodynamic contributions were dominant by the mid-20(th) century. Significant spatial variability in relative sea level indicates that local to sub-regional drivers of sea level are also prominent. Our reconstructions significantly enhance our understanding of the spatiotemporal pattern of early 20(th) century sea-level rise in the region.

Changing environmental conditions resulting from climatic oscillations and glacially derived sea level rise surely affected human settlement patterns and subsistence procurement strategies. In this paper, we present a synopsis of local palynological, stratigraphic, sea level and radiocarbon data and attempt to correlate associated changes in settlement strategies from the latest Pleistocene to about 5000 yr BP,(1) when the seas attained today's levels.

TI A review of coastal palaeoclimate and relative sea-level reconstructions
   using delta C-13 and C/N ratios in organic material

AB Holocene reconstructions of relative sea-level (RSL) and environmental change in the coastal zone have become progressively more numerous since the importance of assessing possible future sea-level rises has become apparent. Traditionally this has been achieved using a combination of biological and physical indicators (e.g. pollen, diatoms, foraminifera, grain size, etc.). In some circumstances, microfossils can be rare or absent from Holocene sediments and in these cases carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13)and organic carbon to total nitrogen ratios (C/N) can be used because they have the potential to provide information as to the origin of organic material preserved in coastal environments. The distinction in delta C-13 and ON of the various sources of carbon to estuarine sediments has led to its wide use as a tracer of carbon pathways and storage in estuaries. More recently these techniques have been applied to Holocene sediments to decipher changes in palaeocoastal environments and thus position relative to sea-level and/or palaeoriver discharge, which have direct relevance to palacoclimate. This paper reviews the studies that have utilised this technique and explores examples from a wide range of coastal environments (saltmarshes, estuaries, lagoons, isolation basins and fjords). It also discusses the potential alteration of geochemical signatures as a result of decompositional processes. Organic matter decomposition has been shown to change sediment delta C-13 and C/N values and thus an understanding of the processes involved is necessary in order to have confidence in the palaeoenvironmental interpretation of Holocerie delta C-13 and C/N. Decompositional shifts in UN, and particularly delta C-13, can occur over a relatively short time-period, however it is the direction of change in delta C-13 and C/N, rather than absolute values, that is key for interpreting changes in relative sea-level and thus such changes are commonly preserved.

TI A multi-proxy evidence for the transition from estuarine mangroves to
   deltaic freshwater marshes, Southeastern Brazil, due to climatic and
   sea-level changes during the late Holocene
SO CATENA
AB The present study investigates a paleo-estuary at the Doce River Delta, southeastern Brazil, through a multi-proxy approach that links palynology, diatoms, sedimentology and geochemistry analyses (i.e., Total C, Total N, delta C-13 and delta N-15). These analyses, temporally synchronized with five radiocarbon ages, revealed environmental changes from marine to continental over the last similar to 7550 years. The studied sedimentary succession recorded the upward transition from estuarine channel (until similar to 7550 cal yr BP) to estuarine central basin (>similar to 7550 to similar to 5250 cal yr BP) deposits, the latter containing increased mangrove vegetation, marine and marine/brackish water diatoms. The range of geochemical values (delta C-13 = -30- -10 parts per thousand, delta N-15 = 2 - 8 parts per thousand, and C/N = 4-40) also indicate marine/ estuarine organic matter and C-3 terrestrial plants to that time interval. A following period recorded two phases: lake/ria (similar to 5250 to similar to 400 cal yr BP) and fluvial channel (similar to 400 cal yr BP until modern age). During this stage, mangroves were replaced by trees/shrubs and herbs/grasses due to the disconnection with the marine realm. As a result, the corresponding sediments contain only organic matter sourced from freshwater and C-3 terrestrial plants (delta C-13 = -29- -26%., delta N-15 = 0 - 8%. and C/N = 10-45). The equilibrium between fluvial sediment supply and relative sea-level changes during the Holocene controlled the morphologic and vegetation changes in the studied littoral. The estuary became established during the early Holocene as a resulted of a eustatic sea-level rise, when the fluvial sediment supply to the coast was relatively lower due to a dry period. However, during the late Holocene, the climatic force was more significant to the development of coastal morphology due to a wet period that caused an increase in sandy sediment supply to coastal system. Then, the increase of fluvial discharge associated to a relative sea-level fall caused a marine regression and shrinkage of Mangroves during the late Holocene. The evaluation of mangrove dynamics according to climatic and sea-level changes mainly during the late Holocene is essential for the understanding of their survival ability under future scenarios, with a probable accelerated sea-level rise and intensification of extreme climatic events in southeastern Brazil for the next century.

TI TRENDS ON GLOBAL CLIMATIC CHANGE AND THE ASSOCIATED EXTREME EVENTS
SO REVISTA RA XIMHAI
AB Currently, it has a consensus about that human activity has direct and indirectly impacts on atmospheric greenhouse gases, plus the natural weather variability, that render in a significant global climatic change on this and past centuries. The raising on greenhouse gas concentrations is responsible of regional and global changes over temperature, precipitation and other climatic variables that alter global patterns of relative soil humidity, glacier thawing, sea level increase and extremely climatic events more often, as droughts, hurricanes and cold fronts. Thus, humanity has in front two big challenges: 1) to revert the negative current trends by mitigation actions, and 2) to change down vulnerability in the face of extremely climatic events (environmental contingencies) associated to global change, by adaptative strategies and preventive actions.

TI Middle to late Holocene relative sea level rise, climate variability and
   environmental change along the Colombian Caribbean coast
SO HOLOCENE
AB We analyzed diatoms, lithology, and stable isotopes in a sediment core from the Cienaga Grande de Santa Marta lagoon to reveal the history of late Holocene relative sea level rise and the ontogeny of the lagoon on the Caribbean coast of Colombia. At similar to 5300 cal. yr BP, the area was characterized by shallow, freshwater ponds that were prone to seasonal flooding. From similar to 4250 to similar to 2060 cal. yr BP, these ponds became brackish as relative sea level began to rise, and since similar to 2060 cal. yr BP, marine conditions have prevailed. In addition to tracking relative sea level rise, we also investigated periods of greater and lesser precipitation during times of brackish and marine conditions, respectively, as indicated by diatom-inferred changes in water salinity and shifts in the source of sediment organic matter. Comparisons with other regional paleoenvironmental records suggest that humid climate conditions prevailed in the Caribbean until about 4000 cal. yr BP. After that time, climate became more variable, with drier conditions registered from similar to 4000 to 2000 cal. yr BP. Wetter conditions returned after similar to 2000 cal. yr BP.

TI Changes in organic matter composition during the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic
   Event (T-OAE) in the Posidonia Shale Formation from Dormettingen
   (SW-Germany)
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB During the Early Toarcian, deposition of organic carbon-rich-shales occurred throughout the epicontinental sea across Europe. Climate instability and high extinction rates in the marine realm were associated with profound environmental changes. The Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (T-OAE) has been linked to the injection of greenhouse gases (e.g. oceanic methane) into the atmosphere triggered by the emplacement of the Karoo-Ferrar large igneous province (LIP) volcanism. The data presented are obtained from the Posidonia Shale Formation in Dormettingen (southwestern Germany), similar to 2 km from the well-known Dotternhausen section. Despite the intense palaeontological and geochemical research, studies on the particulate organic matter (POM) across the T-OAE are scarce. Here, we provide a detailed study of POM of the Dormettingen section as a tool to evaluate changes in the depositional environment. Integrated POM (i.e. amorphous organic matter, marine and terrestrial palynomorphs) and geochemical (i.e. carbon isotope delta C-13) analyses reveal different episodes of palaeoecological upheavals during the studied time interval. In this study, we will integrate new palynofacies data and combine it with the existing sedimentological and palaeoecological data of Dotternhausen in order to interpret relative sea-level fluctuations and climatic changes at the local palaeogeographic setting.

AB As it was shown recently, climate changes in the Baltic Sea resulted in interannual trends of some climatic parameters like sea level atmospheric pressure, surface air temperature, ice thickness and others. These tendencies have effect on the Baltic Sea meteorological and hydrological regime. The following remote sensing data: GODAE (Global Ocean Data Assimilation Project) High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature data and satellite altimetry data of mission TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1/2 are used to analyze the interannual and/or climatic tendency of sea surface temperature (SST) and sea level anomaly (SLA). According to the obtained results, on average for the entire the sea area in the period 1992-2013 SST has positive trend +0.06 +/- 0.03 degrees C/yr and SLA also has positive interannual trend +0.33 +/- 0.07 cm/yr. For different time intervals SST and SLA are decreased or dropped.

SO HOLOCENE
AB Multi-proxy investigations of sediment lithology, geochemistry, benthic foraminifera, and O-18 and C-13 of Elphidium striatopunctatum were carried out on a sediment core SHUA3 (2.2m long) spanning the last 3.6ka and recovered from Shuaiba Lagoon, eastern Red Sea coast. Results showed that the interval before 1500 BC was deposited under supratidal to sabkha environments as indicated by the absence of benthic foraminifera and predominance of clastics enriched in terrestrial materials due to a relative lowering of sea level accompanied with arid conditions. From 1550 BC to the top of the core, the benthic species variations showed progressive depositional environmental changes from subtidal to intertidal conditions. Relative abundance of Sorites orbiculus co-varied with the reconstructed palaeo-tidal elevation, O-18 and C-13 values suggesting its sensitivity to climatic changes in the lagoon. O-18 and C-13 showed intervals of depletion at 350 BC, the beginning of the 1st millennium, AD 400 and AD 700 due likely to arid conditions that led to low evaporation and rapid water circulation. These are interleaved with intervals of enrichment at 150 BC, AD 200 and AD 600, due likely to warm conditions that led to high evaporation as testified also by changes in both palaeo-tidal elevation and Sorites orbiculus abundance. These proxies reached their highest and most prolonged levels during the AD 800-1550 interval, indicating warm conditions corresponding to the world Medieval Warm Period'. Immediately after this period, the arid conditions of the Little Ice Age' prevailed throughout the AD 1550-1850 interval, and this was succeeded by the present warming conditions.

TI Stepwise post-glacial transgression in the Rhone Delta area as revealed
   by high-resolution core data
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB Integrated sedimentological and micropalaeontological (benthic foraminifers and ostracods) analyses of two continuous cores (40 m and 50 m long, respectively) recovered in the lower delta plain of modem Petit Rhone Delta, along with data from the previously studied Core SF, enable detailed reconstruction of the late Pleistocene-Holocene palaeoenvironmental evolution of the Rhone Delta system. Through identification of nine microfossil assemblages and with the aid of 28 radiocarbon dates, a high-resolution picture of stratigraphic architecture is offered for the first time for the entire post-glacial succession. Above late Pleistocene fluvial-channel gravels, a retrograding pattern of swamp and estuarine/bay deposits (lower transgressive systems tract -TST) is overlain by vertically stacked, late transgressive nearshore deposits (upper TST). This succession reflects the progressive landward migration of the palaeoshoreline driven by the rapid post-glacial sea-level rise, which took place in the study area between ca. 12 and 7 cal Icy BP. The following deceleration in sea-level rise (highstand phase) induced the onset of deltaic sedimentation, as evidenced by superposition of middle-late Holocene prodelta, delta-front and delta-plain deposits within the cored succession. At distal location the occurrence, within prodelta deposits, of a distinctive microfossil assemblage dominated by opportunistic benthic foraminifer Valvulineria bradyana marks the onset of the Rhone Delta mud-belt around 4 cal ky BP. Identification and lateral tracking of six separate flooding surfaces within the TST enable the characterization of five short-term (millennial to sub millennial-scale) depositional cycles with distinctive transgressive-regressive internal architecture (T-R 1-5). The lower, transgressive portions of cycles 1-3 (11.8-9.8 cal Icy BP) mark abrupt shifts from freshwater to increasingly mixed, brackish-marine environments under conditions of rapid sea-level rise. In contrast the upper, 'regressive' portions represent the filling of newly formed accommodation space via extensive crevasse to bay-head delta processes. Cycles 4 and 5 (9.8-82 cal Icy BP) and the uppermost transgressive deposit below the maximum flooding surface document three distinct landward shifts of the shoreline that took place under conditions of rapidly increasing sea-level rise. The vertical stacking of these millennial-scale cycles is interpreted to reflect the stratigraphic response to stepwise sea-level rise during the early Holocene. The youngest flooding surface may represent the sea-level signature of the 8.2 ka climate event. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF ISLAND & COASTAL ARCHAEOLOGY
AB While seldom integrated within coastal archaeological research in Southeastern North America, vegetation histories derived from palynological data offer valuable records of ancient landscape transformations driven by climatic flux, sea-level oscillations, and anthropogenic modifications. In this paper, we develop a paleo-historical-ecological reconstruction from preliminary analyses on fossil pollen assemblages preserved within marsh, hammock, and shell-midden soils at the Crystal River site (8CI1), a mound center on Florida's west-central coast occupied throughout the first millennium AD. When contextualized alongside paleoenvironmental records from western Florida and farther afield, our analysis suggests that the nature and timing of late-Holocene climatic changes varied little between different sub-regions of Florida's Gulf Coast, but also that manifestations of eustatic sea-level flux may have been highly localized.

TI Central Santa Catarina coastal dunefields chronology and their relation

CY JUL 14-17, 2013
CL Univ Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, BRAZIL
HO Univ Sao Paulo
AB During the past decades, there have been contrarian explanations for the formation and stabilization of coastal dunefields: while many authors believe the dunes formation would be enhanced by falling sea level, others argue that a rising or stable sea level context would be favorable. For Brazilian coastal dunefields, the second hypothesis seems to be more consistent with the luminescence ages found so far; however, most of these data were obtained without using the SAR protocol. Another point of concern is the role of climate change in the aeolian system, which is still not very clear. The aim of this paper is to try to clarify these two questions. To this end, five coastal dunefields were selected in central Santa Catarina coast. The remote sensing and dating results allowed the discrimination and mapping of at least four aeolian generations. Their age distribution in relation to the global curve of relative sea level variation during the Late Pleistocene allows us to suggest that the formation of Aeolian dunefields in the coastal context is supported by stable relative sea level. However, relative sea level is not the only determinant for the formation and preservation of the aeolian coastal dunes. Evidences of climatic control indicate that the initiation of dunefields would be favored by periods of less humidity while their stabilization would occur preferably during the periods of rain intensification, connected to monsoon activity.

Moving up the cores to 110-150 cm, an abrupt increase in C/N to 26-63 in every core suggests the sudden entry of higher plants into the estuary, potentially the moment sea level retreated. High continental (10,743 palynomorphs/g) and low marine palynomorph concentrations (323 palynomorphs/g) suggest a primarily continental source even during transgression and at high sea level. Around 8973 cal BP, an open bay already existed in the region of Vitoria. Sea level potentially exceeded the current level around 7110 cal BP. The transgressive maximum was at 5567 cal BP. Marine insertion indicators, such as marine shells, low C/N ratios and foraminiferal linings, did not always respond directly to sea level oscillations. These discrepancies probably result from lateral variations in sedimentary deposits from transport patterns and from variations in organic matter and palynomorph preservation due to differences in river and obstacle proximity.

TI Coastal stratigraphies as indicators of environmental changes upon
   European Atlantic coasts in the Late Holocene
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
CT Carter Memorial Symposium
CY 1994
CL SAN FRANCISCO, CA
AB This paper is based upon work undertaken within contract EPOC-CT9000015, in the Environment Programme (Third Framework), Commission of European Communities, Brussels.
   Late Holocene (post c.4000 BP) stratigraphies from beach-barrier-lagoon environments are presented from five locations between northwest Spain (Galicia) and western Ireland. These meso- to macrotidal coasts are conditioned by high energy waves and storms. As such the coasts are sensitive potentially to the future impacts of rising sea-level and to climate-led controls on coastal behaviour. Consequently an objective of this study has been to establish the pattern of physical environmental changes recorded here, as a basis for helping assess the possible effects of future alterations in these coastal systems. The stratigraphies studied commonly show the occurrence of interleaved inorganic and organic sediments. The sedimentary sequences together evidence the importance of sand movements, alternating irregularly with periods of vegetation growth and relative environmental stability. Mechanisms of onshore sediment transfer appear to be linked to aeolian action, possibly most associated with storms, and to barrier over-washing. Repeated periods of sand movement are recorded particularly in barrier environments from about the fifteenth century AD onward. The nineteenth century to the present day also shows strong human influences upon coastal changes. Rates of relative sea-level rise on some coasts are placed at similar to 0.5-0.6mm yr(-1) post c.2000 BP. Studies indicate that coastal barriers in Galicia appear to have been relatively stable, or even to have prograded, during this period. In Brittany and western Ireland similar systems record persistent retreat and barrier breakdown.

TI Sea-level change and human occupation over 6000 years on Areoso Island
   (Ria de Arousa, NW Iberian Peninsula)
SO ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
AB Coastal areas are extremely sensitive to variations in environmental conditions. The interaction of marine and continental processes causes a high degree of dynamism, generating depositional formations of great value for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. This paper focuses on two pedostratigraphic deposits located under the current beach, in close proximity to archaeological tumuli located on Areoso Island (Ria de Arousa, NW Iberian Peninsula). Employing a geoarchaeological approach, sea-level rise, environmental conditions and human occupation over a 6000-year period are interpreted. The results of granulometric and mineralogical data, elemental composition and stratigraphic features, help to identify three successive environments: continental (rock weathering, soil formation and erosion); a transition to a coastal environment; and the establishment of full coastal conditions. The geomorphological evolution of the last 6.0 kyr BP has been controlled by climate, sea-level rise and human activity. The continental facies shows evidence of low sea-level up to 4.8 kyr BP and the first evidence of coastal processes after 3.2 kyr BP. These pedostratigraphic deposits located in an open coastal system improve the Holocene sea-level rise curve in the NW Iberian Peninsula and help to understand the context in which the most important archaeological structures on the island (the tumuli) began to be eroded.

TI Paleoecological indicators of the highstand sea level on the Amazonian
   supralittoral until the last two millennia
SO JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
AB Holocene sea-level changes are ubiquitous worldwide. The relative sea levels (RSL) of the Northeast and Southeast littoral zones of Brazil were higher than the current level during the middle Holocene. It has been assumed that the RSL was stable since 7 ka BP in the North Brazilian littoral, particularly in the Amazonian coast. Based on a multiproxy approach (pollen content, d13C, 14C-dating, and sedimentary and geomorphological features) applied to a sediment core obtained from the Amazonian supralittoral zone (>50 km away from the modern coastline), our study investigated the signatures of the RSL highstand in this region. The results show that the marine influence was more intense from 8410 to 1490 cal yr BP than that of the present. During this period, a mangrove community represented by Rhizophora and Avicennia established and thrived on the Itacuruca & PRIME; tidal flat, probably due to post-glacial sea-level rise, which surpassed the present level during the middle Ho-locene. The mangrove population declined after 1490 cal yr BP, while freshwater vegetation developed, with the dominance of various associations of taxa. The sudden deposition of organic debris in the sedimentary record is consistent with the decrease in mangrove communities. This pronounced environmental change is possibly related to the reduction of the RSL, which reached the present-day position before the last millennium. Climate influence has not been recognized as significant in this process. Irrespective of the curve model showing the position or values from the RSL and related causes, this investigation addresses the indicators of this phenom-enon. The results presented here suggest that understanding the variable trends of the Late Holocene RSL and their influence on paleoecological dynamics and paleogeographical evolution requires further advancement.

TI Coastal dune evolution under sea level changes
SO OCEANOLOGY
AB Particular features of the coastal dune evolution on the islands of the northwestern part of the Pacific Ocean and the Vietnam shelf and on the Seychelles Islands in the course of the Pleistocene-Holocene climatic changes and related transgressive-regressive cycles are revealed. The ages of the different coastal dune generations and the sources of the matter supply are established and the factors controlling their dynamics and evolution on accumulative and abrasive coasts are analyzed. The role of the amplitude and duration of the regressive sea level position at different stages of the Middle and Late Holocene in the development of eolian sedimentation environments is demonstrated.

TI Mangrove Response to Environmental Change in Kakadu National Park
SO IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE
   SENSING
AB The responses of mangroves to climate-related phenomena are difficult to decipher in many areas as human activities also influence changes in their extent and biophysical properties. In Kakadu National Park (KNP) in Australia's Northern Territory, human disturbance of mangroves is minimal and hence observed changes are more likely to indicate a natural environmental change, including that associated with climatic fluctuation. Using fine (<2m) resolution aerial photography, hyperspectral, and light detection and ranging data from 1991, 2002, and 2011, respectively, maps of mangroves were generated for four catchments in the Alligator Rivers Region, the Wildman, West, South and East Alligator Rivers, and Field Island. The net change in mangrove for all areas where data intersected were 1.29 km(2), but redistributions approximating 18.5 km(2) occurred with both losses and gains toward the coast and inland intrusion along many smaller creeks. A close correspondence between the planimetric canopy cover (PCC; %) within 25-m cells, as determined from aerial sensor data, and Landsat-derived foliage projected cover (FPC) was observed. A FPC threshold of >= 30% (similar to 50% PCC) best captured mangrove extent and was used to quantify annual changes in the area for all catchments and Field Island from 1987-2012 Landsat sensor data. Over the period of the time-series, fluctuations in extent above this threshold were observed with these corresponding to changes in sea level and, to a lesser extent, river discharge. The study concludes that changes in mangrove extent and cover in KNP are indicating a changing climate, as manifested by fluctuations (and a general) rise in sea level and changes in rainfall amounts. Such changes are anticipated to lead to alterations of the hydrological regime, with these further affecting mangroves and potentially impacting on the internationally important wetlands of KNP.

TI The Eocene-Oligocene climate transition in the Alpine foreland basin:
   Paleoenvironmental change recorded in submarine fans
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB The Eocene-Oligocene transition (EOT) was a period of considerable environmental change, signifying the transition from Paleocene greenhouse to Oligocene icehouse conditions. Preservation of the sedimentary signal of such an environmental change is most likely in net-depositional environments, such as submarine fans, which are the terminal parts of sedimentary systems. Here, using sedimentary and stable isotope data from the Alpine foreland basin, we assess whether this major climatic transition influenced the stratigraphic evolution of submarine fans. Results indicate that fine-grained deposition in deep-water environments corresponds to positive delta C-13 excursions and eustatic highstands, while coarse-grained deposition corresponds to negative delta C-13 excursions and eustatic lowstands during the earliest Oligocene. While alternative explanations cannot be ruled out on the basis of this dataset alone, our results suggest that eustatic fluctuations across the EOT and into the early Oligocene influenced sediment supply to deep-water environments.

TI Analysis of global impacts of sea-level rise: a case study of flooding
SO PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
CT 26th General Assembly of the European-Geophysical-Society
CY MAR 26-30, 2001
CL NICE, FRANCE
SP European Geophys Soc
AB Analysis of the response to climate change and sea-level rise requires a link from climate change science to the resulting impacts and their policy implications. This paper explores the impacts of sea-level rise, particularly increased coastal flooding due to storm surges. In particular, it asks the simple question "how,much will projected global sea-level rise exacerbate coastal flood problems, if ignored?" This is an important question to the intergovernmental process considering climate change. Further many countries presently ignore sea-level rise in long-term coastal planning, even though global sea levels are presently slowly rising.
   Using the model of Nicholls et al. [Global Environmental Change 9 (1999) S69], the analysis. considers the flood impacts of sea-level rise on an "IS92a world" based on a consistent set of scenarios of global-mean sea-level rise, subsidence (where appropriate), coastal population change (usually increase), and flood defence standards (derived from GDP/capita). Two of the protection scenarios consider the possible upgrade of flood defences, but no allowance for global-mean sea-level rise is allowed to ensure consistency with the question being investigated. This model has been validated against national- and regional-scale assessments indicating that the relative results are reasonable, and the absolute results are of the right order of magnitude.
   The model estimates that 10 million people experienced flooding annually in 1990. It also predicts that the incidence of flooding will change without sea-level rise due to changes to the other three factors. Taking the full range of scenarios considered by 2100 the number of people flooded could be from 0.4 to 39 million/year. All the sea-level rise scenarios would cause an increase in flooding during the 21st century if measures to adapt to sea-level rise are not taken. However, there are significant uncertainties and the number of people who are estimated to experience flooding in 2100 is 16-388 million for the mid (55-cm) global-mean sea-level rise scenarios, and up to 510 million people/year for the high (96-cm) scenario. These results suggest that sea-level rise could be a significant problem if it is ignored, and hence it needs to be considered within the policy process considering climate change in terms of mitigation (reducing greenhouse gas emissions) and adaptation (improved coastal management and planning) needs.

TI Subsidence-driven environmental change in three Holocene embayments of
   Ahuriri Inlet, Hikurangi Subduction Margin, New Zealand
SO NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS
AB Three paleo-embayments on the southwest side of the uplifted Ahuriri Inlet, Hawkes Bay, contain complex interfingering sequences of Holocene terrestrial and saltmarsh peat and intertidal shelly sand and mud. We use 295 foraminiferal samples from 45 short cores (up to 8m deep) to reconstruct the paleoenvironmental history of the bays. We infer that the strongest influence on their paleoenvironmental history was 8-10m of net tectonic subsidence since 7.3ka, which provided the accommodation space for sediment deposition prior to the c.1.5m of uplift in the AD 1931 Hawkes Bay Earthquake. Much of the subsidence appears to have occurred in eight large co-seismic events (0.4-2kyr recurrence time) which caused marine transgressions of varying amounts into each bay. Sea-level changes (eustatic and isostatic) have been a secondary driver over the middle-late Holocene with an interval (c.2.6-1.7ka) of widespread erosion or slow sedimentation, caused by a sea-level fall of c.1m following the middle Holocene highstand. The interval of fastest sedimentation and maximum marine transgression occurred within the last 1kyr and was driven by increased tectonic subsidence, rising sea level and enhanced compaction of thicker sequences of Holocene sediment, particularly peat. The supply of fluvial mud and cliff-eroded sand was the main, relatively constant source of clastic sediment. Airfall and reworking of three pumiceous tephras had a minimal impact on the paleoenvironments of the bays.

TI Climate Change and Monsoon: Looking Into Its Antecedents
SO SAGE OPEN
AB Climate change is a tricky issue. The Indian subcontinent has experienced many regional and local climatic changes in its past. There is overwhelming geological evidence of global climatic changes which are associated with extinctions and new life form adaptations. The Indian subcontinent is governed by monsoonal precipitation inextricably linked with the socioeconomic conditions of its citizenry. The subcontinent has a long coastline which is prone to sea level changes having potential to displace millions of people. The agriculture, dependent on the monsoonal precipitation, is already showing signs of disarray. Floods and droughts have been visiting regions that were hitherto immune to these hazards. The fast-eroding green cover and forests has unleashed extinctions of life forms that are so vital to the well-being of the environment. In climate change dynamics, many variables, and not a single one, have a role to play. Humans have the capacity to tackle this situation, and all the nations need to come together to fight the menace of climate change, that is part natural and part man-made. The technological innovations are long overdue to mitigate the hazards faced.

TI Holocene coastal environmental changes and human occupation of the lower
   Herault River, southern France
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB Sea-level rise, human impacts and climate change have deeply affected coastal environments during the Holocene. These forcing factors are studied using the Lower Flerault valley, which constitutes a very representative Mediterranean case study because of (i) its very early, intense and continuous land use since Neolithic times, and (ii) its sensitivity to sea-level rise and Mediterranean climate changes over a relatively small watershed. 34 cores and 61 AMS radiocarbon dates, associated with biological and geochemical analyses, have allowed us to precisely reconstruct the Holocene evolution of the lower valley. Until 6500 cal yr BP, a wave-dominated morphology and retrogradational dynamics were reconstructed. During this phase, ephemeral channels and successive river mouths formed and were rapidly submerged by sea-level rise. The progradational phase began after 6500 cal yr BP, and the alluvial plain gradually built seawards with the formation of a beachridge system outside the valley. Growth of the fertile alluvial plain was coeval with the development of Neolithic agriculture. This alluvial progradation gradually filled the estuary with advances of the mouths, several shallow lagoons and sandbar. The high density of information collected allows us to recognize, for the first time, a pronounced fluvial-dominated deltaic morphology, especially 3000 years ago, during the Bronze Age. Lagoonal and coastal shores were continually inhabited. Human land use continually adapted to geomorphological and environmental changes. Around 300 years ago, the delta shifted to a wave-dominated system. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF CLIMATIC-CHANGE AND OF SEA-LEVEL RISE ON THE YIELDS
   OF AQUIFER, RIVER AND RESERVOIR SOURCES
SO JOURNAL OF THE INSTITUTION OF WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Using regional statistics of daily rainfall, a simple water-balance model was employed to generate runoff sequences with which to simulate the yield/storage behaviour of reservoirs in south-east England, in north-west England, and North Wales.  Similarly sequences of recharge to an unconfined aquifer in eastern England were the basis of deriving its yield/storage behaviour.  Then, taking scenarios of the year 2030 rainfall and evaporation, provided by the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit, reductions in yield were calculated to be 5-15% below present-day values.  For direct supply reservoirs, greater percentage reductions in yield were found to apply to the south-east region, as compared to the north-west.  The results from the aquifer example are interpreted on a novel basis which allows an immediate comparison with the surface reservoir examples.
   Coastal sea-water intrusion was modelled for three common geological conditions (i) the Grimsby Chalk (confined), (ii) the Brighton Chalk (unconfined), and (iii) the Otter Valley Sandstone (unconfined).  In all three cases the effect of a possible 0.6 m rise in mean sea level was shown to have only a marginal effect on sustainable yields, which reduced by about 1.5%.
   Estuarine fresh-salt water interfaces are important to the abstraction regime of freshwater intakes in the lower reaches of rivers.  The effect of a 0.6-m sea-level rise on the saline interface location at high tide was evaluated by hydrodynamic computational models.  Only a minor inland shift of the interface was found, less than 800 m in the Thames tideway and less than 500 m in the Lune estuary.  The Severn estuary is exceptional in having its saline interface move 3.5 km landwards for the same 0.6-m rise in mean sea level.

AB Palynological studies have been carried out on two cores from the Loyalty Basin, one near the New Caledonia shore (KK 231) and the other near Lifou Island (KK 88).
   The sediments under consideration cover the interval from the Last Interglacial to the Holocene. All the samples revealed the mixing of continental and marine palynomorphs varying with carbonate sediment variations that are themselves correlated with the Late Quaternary sea level fluctuations.
   Dinoflagellate cysts and foraminifera are the dominant components of the marine fraction. Dinoflagellate cysts reached their maximum abundance during the high sea-level of the Last Interglacial, while foraminifera were most abundant during the onset of the Holocene transgression.
   Changes in the continental palynomorphs can also be observed; these seem to be linked to sea-level variations, modifying conditions of production, transport and deposition, and to the effects of climatic changes on the community structure of terrestrial vegetation.

TI Assessment of vulnerability of the eastern Cretan beaches (Greece) to
   sea level rise
SO REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB Beaches are both sensitive and critical components of the coastal systems, as they are particularly vulnerable to environmental change (e.g., the sea level rise) and form valuable coastal ecosystems and economic resources. The objective of the present study has been to record the spatial characteristics and other attributes (e.g., topography, sediments and accessibility) of the 71 beaches of the E. Crete (Eastern Mediterranean) that are either already developed or have a reasonable development potential and assess their erosion risk under sea level rise. Beach retreats are predicted by ensembles of six cross-shore (1D) analytical and numerical morphodynamic models, set up/forced on the basis of collected/collated information and three sea level rise scenarios (0.26, 0.82 and 1.86 m); these retreats are then compared with the recorded maximum (dry) beach widths. Projections by the unified ensemble suggest that, in the case of a 0.26 m rise, 80 % of the examined beaches are to retreat by more than 20 and 16 % by more than 50 % of their maximum dry width. In the case of a 0.82 m rise, 72 % of the tested beaches are predicted to retreat by more than 50 % of their dry width and 21 % by a distance at least equal to their observed maximum dry widths. A sea level rise of 1.86 m represents a 'doom' scenario, as 75 % of the beaches are predicted to retreat by more than their maximum width. These results may be conservative, as other significant beach erosion factors (e.g., decreasing beach sediment supply) have not been considered.

TI Calendar year age estimates of Allerod-Younger Dryas sea-level
   oscillations at Os, western Norway
SO JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE
AB A detailed shoreline displacement curve documents the Younger Dryas transgression in western Norway. The relative sea-level rise was more than 9 m in an area which subsequently experienced an emergence of almost 60 m. The sea-level curve is based on the stratigraphy of six isolation basins with bedrock thresholds. Effort has been made to establish an accurate chronology using a calendar year time-scale by C-14 wiggle matching and the use of time synchronic markers (the Vedde Ash Bed and the post-glacial rise in Betula (birch) pollen). The sea-level curve demonstrates that the Younger Dryas transgression started close to the Allerod-Younger Dryas transition and that the high stand was reached only 200 yr before the Younger Dryas-Holocene boundary. The sea level remained at the high stand for about 300 yr and 100 yr into Holocene it started to fall rapidly.
   The peak of the Younger Dryas transgression occurred simultaneously with the maximum extent of the ice-sheet readvance in the area. Our results support earlier geophysical modelling concluding a causal relationship between the Younger Dryas glacier advance and Younger Dryas transgression in western Norway. We argue that the sea-level curve indicates that the Younger Dryas glacial advance started in the late Allerod or close to the Allerod-Younger Dryas transition.

TI Evidence of former Holocene sea level in the Marennes-Oleron Bay (French
   Atlantic coast)
SO COMPTES RENDUS GEOSCIENCE
AB Both sedimentological and mollusc death assemblage analyses from a C-14-dated core, coupled with seismic stratigraphical analysis within the Marennes-Oleron Bay (French Atlantic coast), provide a detailed record of environmental changes during the end of the Holocene rapid sea-level rise. Lithofacies and mollusc fauna changes evidence the transition from a former intertidal bare mudflat to a subtidal environment. The newly shown former sea-level record, computed from radiocarbon-dated Scrobicularia plana shell, matches previously published local sea-level curves. This drowned mudflat belongs to an incised valley-fill that provides new insights into valley-fill successions along the French Atlantic coast.

TI Evolution of ancient harbours in deltaic contexts: A geoarchaeological
   typology
SO EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB In deltaic areas, within a context of relative sea-level stability during the past 6000 years, environmental conditions have been key in mediating human settlements and the evolution of ancient harbours. The natural diversity of clastic-coast environments, in particular deltas, is central to explain the wide disparity in harbour contexts. It is, therefore, important to understand the impact of these settlements on the evolution of clastic coasts. How did ancient societies exploit and adapt to deltaic environments? Here, we detail a typology of ancient harbours on clastic coasts using a suite of multidisciplinary case studies from the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.
   We present the impact of different forcing agents (floods, storms, sedimentary inputs, relative sea-level (RSL) changes, dredging and harbour structures) on the geomorphological evolution of selected harbour sites, and underline the important role of coastal changes at different temporal and spatial scales. These processes affected the infrastructure and the viability of harbours to varying degrees. In deltaic contexts, our analysis differentiates five harbour types: (1) fluvial harbours, affected by floods, rapid sedimentation and river-channel changes; (2a) infilled estuarine harbours; or (2b) submerged estuarine harbours, lying at the interface between marine and fluvial processes; (3) lagoonal harbours strongly affected by sedimentary inputs; and (4) the impact of humans on harbour basins via harbour protection structures and dredging. For these harbour types, we probe the advantages and disadvantages of each geomorphological setting, in addition to the consequences of environmental pressures on human societies.

TI Past environmental change and seawater intrusion into coastal Lake
   Lilaste, Latvia
SO JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY
AB Diatoms, organic matter and magnetic susceptibility in a 10-m-long sediment sequence from coastal Lake Lilaste, Latvia, were analysed to evaluate Holocene environmental changes related to past sea-water intrusions. Lake Lilaste is located similar to 1 km from the present sea coast in an area with a low uplift rate and a threshold altitude of 0.5 m a.s.l. It was thus considered to be an appropriate site to study the influence of past sea level fluctuations on the lake and its sediments. Variations in diatom community composition, along with sediment lithostratigraphy, show that a shallow, nutrient-rich freshwater lake existed there during the early Holocene. The first brackish-water diatoms appeared concurrent with a sea level rise ca. 8700 +/- 50 cal a BP, but long-term, intermittent inputs of brackish water were observed between 6700 +/- 40 and 4200 +/- 80 cal a BP. During those time spans, diatoms indicate increased nutrient concentrations and high conductivity, a consequence of occasional mixing of brackish and freshwater that promoted biological productivity. Lilaste was isolated from the sea at 4200 +/- 80 cal a BP, after which a stable freshwater environment, dominated by planktonic diatoms such as Aulacoseira ambigua, A. granulata, A. islandica and A. subarctica, was established. At 400 +/- 50 cal a BP, planktonic diatoms were gradually replaced by Fragilaria spp., indicating the beginning of anthropogenic impact. The reconstructed relative water-level curve from the lake coincides with the eustatic sea level curve from 6800 +/- 40 cal a BP onwards. There was a distinct increase in abundance of brackish-water diatoms when the sea level reached the threshold of Lilaste, which at that time was probably about 3 m lower than the present sea level. According to radiocarbon-dated shifts in the diatom community composition, the Litorina Sea transgression was a long-lasting event (ca. 2200 years) in the southern part of the Gulf of Riga, where the land uplift rate was near zero. It culminated more than 1000 years later than at other sites with higher uplift, in the northern part of the Baltic Sea.

TI The Race to Document Archaeological Sites Ahead of Rising Sea Levels:
   Recent Applications of Geospatial Technologies in the Archaeology of
   Polynesia
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Marine environments are rich in natural resources, and therefore, have been targeted for human occupation from at least the Pleistocene. In the modern day, the preservation and documentation of the physical archaeological evidence of human occupation and use of coasts, islands, and the ocean must now include mitigating the impacts of global climate change. Here, I review recent efforts to document archaeological sites across the islands of Polynesia using geospatial technology, specifically remote sensing, high-resolution documentation, and the creation of archaeological site geodatabases. I discuss these geospatial technologies in terms of planning for likely future impacts from sea level rise; a problem that will be felt across the region, and based on current evidence, will affect more than 12% of all known sites in New Zealand (Aotearoa).

TI Petrologic evidence for sea-level drop in latest Permian in Jiangxi
   province, China and its meanings for the mass extinction.
SO ACTA PETROLOGICA SINICA
AB A new-found Permian-Triassic boundary section in Xiushui, Jiangxi Province, China shows evidence for sea-level drop during the latest Permian. Evidence for sea-level drop was preserved in a 2.1 m thick interval of limestone, and is I m from the P-T boundary. The basal 0.1 m of this interval is a reddish sparry-cemented grainstone. The grains are rounded, dolomitized, all having a black coating. Microprobe analysis indicates that the coating is limonite, which indicates a weathering event in subaerial environments after a sea-level drop event. The internal structure of most grains has been destroyed by diagenesis. Some remained structures of foraminifers and fusulinids. So, this bed is formed before the mass extinction. The 2.0 m thick bed overlying the reddish grainstone is a dedolornitized limestone. The shapes of some original finely-erystalline dolomite rhombus were preserved. The occurrence of dedolornitization is generally related to meteorie water. So, this bed recorded a sea-level drop event. Fossils in this bed are simple: fusulinids and large foraminifers such as Colaniella are absent. It is clear that mass extinction began before this bed. The I m thick limestone between the dedolornitized bed and the P-T boundary is composed of grainstone and lime mudstone. Study of this section reached two points: (1) sea-level drop occurred in latest Permian; (2) The end-Permian mass extinction began in the earliest episode of the sea-level drop event. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that the mass extinction was caused by a dramatic environmental change which triggered the end-Permian sea-level drop.

TI Impacts of sea-level changes on mangroves from southeastern Brazil
   during the Holocene and Anthropocene using a multi-proxy approach
SO GEOMORPHOLOGY
AB Globally, mangroves are expected to move inland as sea-level rises. However, local characteristics mainly related to mangrove structure, geomorphology and coastal hydrodynamics may change the mangrove response to sea-level rise. The most useful evidence to support projections for the future likely comes from mangrove history reconstruction corresponding to past sea-level changes. This study characterized modern (1985-2018 CE) and past (<6300 cal yr BP) mangrove dynamics according to sea-level changes along two estuarine valleys on the southeastern Brazilian coast to predict the mangrove response to sea-level rise by 2100. Relative Sea-Level (RSL) rise triggered changes from a tidal flat occupied by herbs, palms, tree/shrubs to a lagoon surrounded by mangroves between-6300 and-4230 cal yr BP. More recently, the RSL fall converted that lagoon into flats occupied by herbs, trees/shrubs, and palms on higher surfaces, and mangroves on lower flats during the mid-late Holocene. The last thousand years were characterized by a mangrove contraction between 390 and 77 cal yr BP, caused by a RSL fall. By contrast, mangrove expansion began at 77 cal yr BP (1873 CE) and continued after 1950 CE, migrating onto higher tidal flats previously occupied by herbs, palms, and trees/shrubs. Spatial-temporal analysis also indicated a mangrove invasion onto higher flats since 1985 CE. These trends are likely related to RSL rise since the end of the Little Ice Age and they intensified during recent decades, when the lower mangrove boundaries remained stable, and mangroves expanded to higher surfaces. Mangroves, confined between steep surfaces, will expand-22ha under the influence of a sea-level rise of 98 cm by 2100. However, an upstream mangrove migration by 2100 on low and extensive fluvial plains (-4030 ha) will depend mainly on the interaction between fluvial discharge/sea-level rise. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI Fine structure of dark layers in the central Japan Sea and their
   relationship with the abrupt climate and sea level changes over the last
   75 ka inferred from lithophysical, geochemical and pollen results
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
AB High resolution of the color lightness, productivity proxies (TOC, chlorin, CaCO3, Ba-bio, Mo and U), and lithological description defined alternation of dark layers (DLs) and light layers in sediment core LV53-23 recovered from the central Japan Sea (west Yamato Rise) over the last 75 ka. Age model was constructed by AMS 14C data, tephrochronology, delta 18o of planktonic foraminifera record, and the correlation of DLs with lightness of Japan Sea core MD01-2407 and with millennial interstadials recorded in the Greenland ice cores and East Asia stalagmites. Regional interstadials were also independently established and dated by vegetation amelioration of the surrounded land, inferred from the pollen results. Correlation of the DLs with millennial scale climate and sea level changes indicate that both interstadial warming and sea level fluctuations influence on its formation providing their individual features. During MIS 3, with sea level above -90 m, DL was formed mostly consistent with the Tada et al. (1999)'s hypotheses. During MIS 2 and 4, when sea level was nearly and below 90 m, sea level descending led to water column stratification, oxygen depletion in bottom water and facilitates the DLs formation. High-resolution lightness and productivity proxies defined the subtle structure of pronounced interstadials 14 and 12. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Vulnerable Islands: Climate Change, Tectonic Change, and Changing
   Livelihoods in the Western Pacific
SO CONTEMPORARY PACIFIC
AB Small Pacific islands, especially atolls, have been widely argued to be in the forefront of climate change. Recent degradation of island environments has primarily been attributed to the impact of sea-level rise. However, physical changes to several small islands can be linked to a range of physical influences and to human modification. La Nifia events, cyclones, and wind waves have caused localized flooding and storm damage. Most atoll islands have not significantly changed in size, as deposition balances erosion. Many islands have experienced broadly similar environmental problems in earlier times, at different scales, and over different time periods, now accentuated by human pressures on scarce land areas and resources. Local human factors (including construction and mining), tectonic subsidence, and La Nifia events have created some iconic sites that have become symbols of sea-level rise, sometimes erroneously attributed solely to global warming. Limited economic prospects in most small islands, rising expectations, and growing populations have contributed to a culture of migration, marked by international migration and urbanization, that has diversified impoverished livelihoods, extended island geographies, and resulted in accentuated population concentrations. Contemporary climate change exacerbates present environmental changes, stimulates further migration, and points to diasporic futures.

TI Between the devil and the deep blue sea: Florida's unenviable position
   with respect to sea level rise
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
AB This paper introduces and summarizes a series of articles on the potential impacts of sea level rise on Florida's natural and human communities and what might be done to reduce the severity of those impacts. Most of the papers in this special issue of Climatic Change were developed from presentations at a symposium held at Archbold Biological Station in January 2010, sponsored by the Florida Institute for Conservation Science. Symposium participants agreed that adaptation to sea level rise for the benefit of human communities should be planned in concert with adaptation to reduce vulnerability and impacts to natural communities and native species. The papers in this special issue discuss both of these categories of impacts and adaptation options. In this introductory paper, I place the subject in context by noting that that the literature in conservation biology related to climate change has been concerned largely about increasing temperatures and reduced moisture availability, rather than about sea level rise. The latter, however, is the most immediate and among the most severe impacts of global warming in low-lying regions such as Florida. I then review the content of this special issue by summarizing and interpreting the following 10 papers. I conclude with a review of the recommendations for research and policy that were developed from group discussions at the Archbold symposium. The main lesson that emerges from this volume is that sea level rise, combined with human population growth, urban development in coastal areas, and landscape fragmentation, poses an enormous threat to human and natural well-being in Florida. How Floridians respond to sea level rise will offer lessons, for better or worse, for other low-lying regions worldwide.

TI Temporalities in Adaptation to Sea-Level Rise
SO ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS
AB Local residents, businesspeople, and policymakers engaged in climate change adaptation often think differently of the time available for action. Their understandings of time, and their practices that invoke time, form the complex and sometimes conflicting temporalities of adaptation to environmental change. They link the conditions of the past to those of the present and the future in a variety of ways, and their contemporary practices rest on such linking explicitly or implicitly. Yet the temporal connections between the present and distant future of places are undertheorized and poorly considered in the science and policy of adaptation to environmental change. In this article we address this theoretical and practical challenge by weaving together arguments from social and environmental geography with evidence from small coastal communities in southeastern Australia. We show that the past conditions residents' imagined futures and that these local, imagined futures are incongruent with scientific, popular, and policy accounts of the future. Thus we argue that the temporalities of adaptation include incommensurate and unacknowledged ways of knowing and that these affect adaptation practices. We propose that strategies devised by governments for adapting to environmental change need to make visible-and calibrate policies with-the diverse temporalities of adaptation. On this basis, the times between the present and the long-term future can be better navigated as a series of short and negotiated policy steps.

TI LATE WEICHSELIAN ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE IN NORWAY, INCLUDING SVALBARD
SO JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE
AB A synthesis of the principal environmental changes that are inferred to have occurred in Norway and Svalbard (Fig. 1) during the Late-glacial period (14-9 ka BP) is presented. The paper has three sections dealing separately with (I) western Norway, (II) northern Norway and (III) Spitsbergen, Svalbard. The main conditions described include glacial events, sea-level changes, vegetation history and climatic variations. A summary chart of environmental reconstructions is presented for each of the three areas, each including a curve of temperature reconstructions for the Late-glacial period. These indicate some significant regional variations in contemporaneous thermal conditions during the Late-glacial.

TI HYDRO-MORPHOLOGICAL RISK PHENOMENA INDUCED BY THE CLIMATIC CHANGES
   WITHIN ROMANIAN BLACK SEA COASTAL ZONE
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY
AB Among the natural environmental factors directly influenced by climate change are the sea level and ocean level rise and by default the level of the Black Sea, due to melting glaciers under the effect of global average temperature increase. Climatic risk phenomena is the object of extended research, due to its specific characteristics (severity, recurrence, temporality, etc.), which through its strong ecological and economic impact is in the special consideration of the international organisations and specialised institutions of various countries. Thus, the growing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (storms, squalls, tornadoes) rising sea levels during storms (storm surges), drifting sand effect due to wind action, particularly strong wave action during storms, was felt more strongly in the last half century, highlighting the increasing risk in terms of hydrological or meteorological phenomena/climate. This paper analyses some of the multiple changes induced by climatic factors influence stairs along the western shore of the Black Sea.

TI The interplay between true eustatic sea-level changes, tectonics, and
   climatic changes: what is the dominating factor in sequence formation of
   the Upper Oligocene-Miocene succession in the eastern North Sea Basin,
   Denmark?
SO GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
AB The Upper Oligocene-Miocene succession of the eastern North Sea is subdivided into six sequences on the basis of an integrated study of outcrops, boreholes, and seismic data. All available data and methodologies/criteria for the definition of sequences have been used. Datings of the sequences are based on palynology, micropalaeontology, and macropalaeontolgy' which give them a high confidence. The six sequences defined in this study do not correlate to the eight marked changes in true eustatic sea-level variation as indicated from oxygen isotope curves nor to the nine glacial maxima that have been recognised within the Miocene. The development of the individual sequences and the stacking pattern of the sequences is dependent both on true eustatic sea-level changes, relative sea-level changes (tectonics), and sediment supply. For example, a true eustatic sea-level fall as well as uplift may result in major progradation of a siliciclastic wedge. In the Miocene succession studied here, a distinct progradation in the lower Aquitanian was the result of a true eustatic sea-level fall. This resulted in deposition of a clean and widespread sand-rich elastic wedge. Marked progradation associated with an uplift of the hinterland in the Langhian resulted in sand-rich deposits alternating with coals. The interbedded coal seams were the result of a rising ground water table within the basin due partly to stable or even rising sea level and partly to local subsidence around faults. Similarly, a major transgression may be a result of a true sea-level rise or accelerated subsidence of a basin. In the case of the eastern North Sea Basin, accelerated subsidence was responsible for the major transgression in the Serravallian and Tortonian times, which is a period with a general climatic cooling. The frequency of true eustatic sea-level changes and relative sea-level changes (tectonic pulses) in the Miocene is of the order of 2.9-2.0 to 4 m.y., respectively. Both these intervals are within the time range of the studied sequences, which span 2-4 m.y. Consequently, but not surprisingly, neither of the two processes responsible for changes in relative sea level can be solely attributed to glaciations nor to tectonics. The climatic changes during the Late Oligocene-Miocene, which changed from cool temperate to subtropical with several reversals, did not influence the sediment yield. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

TI The natural environment of the Quebec City region during the Holocene
SO POST-MEDIEVAL ARCHAEOLOGY
AB In the St Lawrence River valley the 10,000-year period following the Wisconsinian glaciation was marked by major geographic and climatic changes which influenced the development of plant communities. In this paper the Holocene environments in the Quebec City region have been reconstructed on the basis of palaeogeographic and palaeoecological data. Fluctuations in relative sea level, particularly in recent millennia, are of particular interest in light of Quebec's situation as a marine gateway on the St Lawrence. Changes in plant cover since Euro-American settlement some 400 years ago are principally due to forest clearing for agriculture and more recently to urban development.

TI Coastal Retreat and Sedimentation during the Last 3000 Years. Atlantic
   Coast of NW Spain
SO JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB During the last glaciation, thick nival and periglacial sediments buried large sectors of the NW coast of Spain. The sediments were mostly eroded by the rising sea level during the Holocene, but in several places they remain, forming sedimentary cliffs. Radiocarbon dates obtained at the topmost layers of these cliffs prove that continental sedimentation was active until very recent times, followed by a retreat of the cliffs. During the first stages of the transgression, the erosion of the cliffs and the changes in the coastal system were controlled by the rising sea-level. Once the sea-level stabilized, the exhumation of inherited landforms, the supply of sediments, and a continuous continental sedimentation became the main factors. The last stages of cliff retreat were almost synchronous with the sedimentation of the upper layers of the deposits.

TI Orbital and suborbital environmental changes in the southern Bering Sea
   during the last 50 kyr
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB High-resolution geochemical, paleontological and lithological records of two sediment cores in the southern Bering Sea manifest regional environmental changes over the last 50 kyr on orbital and millennial time scales. High ice rafted debris (IRD) content and percentages of radiolarian species Cycladophora davisiana (Ehrenberg) during Marine Isotope Stages (MISS) 3 and 2 indicate active intermediate water ventilation driven by intensive winter sea ice formation in the southern Bering Sea. Although the total abundance of siliceous microfossils in glacial sediments is relatively low, glacial productivity is higher than in the Late Holocene. On the millennial time scale, decreases in the abundance of calcareous and siliceous microfossils and in C. davisiana % at studied core may imply enhancement of sea ice influence synchronous with Heinrich events H 5 to 2. Changes in the delta O-18 of fossil benthic and planktonic foraminifera during H 5-3 are inferred to be related to variability in ice sheet volume similar to the pattern from Antarctica accompanied by glacioeustatic sea-level fluctuations up to 20-30 m in amplitude. The maximum benthic and planktonic delta O-18 values in the studied cores occur during the LGM when sea level was at the lowest stand and sea bottom water temperature was around -0.4 degrees C. Strong environmental changes during the Heinrich event 1 and B/A warming in the southern Bering Sea provide evidence of deglacial injection of very old water and the subsequent increase in productivity due to surface and intermediate water mixing. From the LGM to the mid-Holocene the delta O-18(benthforam) changes corresponded to changes in the global deep-water delta O-18 and a rise in the deep-water temperature to + 1.0 degrees C at 8.5-6.5 kyr BP. The subsequent environmental changes in late Holocene helped establishment of near modern-day hydrological and environmental conditions, featuring strong surface water stratification and weakened deep-water ventilation.

TI Sr-87/Sr-86 evidence from the epeiric Martin Ridge Basin for enhanced
   carbonate weathering during the Hirnantian
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB A pronounced positive delta C-13 excursion in the Hirnantian Age has been documented globally, reflecting large perturbations of carbon cycling in the Late Ordovician oceans. Increased organic-carbon burial or enhanced carbonate weathering during glacioeustatic sea-level regression has been proposed to account for this anomalous C-isotope excursion. To test the two competing hypotheses, we measured Sr-87/Sr-86 and delta C-13 of carbonates from the Copenhagen Canyon section in Nevada, USA. Our data reveal two rapid negative (8)7Sr/Sr-86 shifts that coincide with two prominent positive delta C-13 excursions and glacial advances. Numerical model simulations suggest that enhanced weathering of carbonates driven by glacio-eustatically controlled sea-level fall is required to produce the observed drops of Sr-87/Sr-86 and the coeval large positive delta C-13 excursions, possibly with or without increased organic carbon burial.

SO MARINE PROTECTED AREAS: SCIENCE, POLICY AND MANAGEMENT
AB Eutrophication and sedimentation are affecting global Marine Protected Area (MPA) ecosystems, such as estuaries, as catchments are developed and sea levels rise. Managers are often faced with short term datasets and modelling evidence with which to undertake management of these complex open systems. Longer term datasets which monitor environmental change can be used to improve understanding of estuary biogeochemistry and the resulting ecological response. In this paper we use the case study of Holes Bay, Poole Harbour to explore how palaeoenvironmental archives can be used to extend the evidence base for sediment, nutrient and ecological management within a coastal MPA.

TI Inferring Environmental Change in Estuaries from Plant Macrofossils
SO APPLICATIONS OF PALEOENVIRONMENTAL TECHNIQUES IN ESTUARINE STUDIES
SE Developments in Paleoenvironmental Research
AB Aquatic plants are critical components of estuarine ecosystems supporting biodiversity and a range of ecosystem services such as sediment stabilisation and denitrification. However, estuarine plants, similar to their freshwater counterparts, are in decline and under threat. The examination of remains of aquatic plants in sediment records can document the fate of the plants themselves, along with numerous natural and anthropogenic changes in estuaries, including those associated with relative sea level change, pollution and habitat degradation. In comparison with other proxies, the use of macrofossils in estuaries is in its relative infancy. However, many approaches to the examination of plant macrofossils in estuaries can be utilised from the freshwater domain where a number of advances have been made, particularly in the past decade.

TI Impact of Climate Change on Nearshore Waves at a Beach Protected by a
   Barrier Reef
SO WATER
AB Barrier reefs dissipate most incoming wind-generated waves and, as a consequence, regulate the morphodynamics of its inbounded shorelines. The coastal protective capacity of reefs may nevertheless be compromised by climate change effects, such as reef degradation and sea-level rise. To assess the magnitude of these climate change effects, an analysis of the waves propagating across the barrier reef is carried out in Flic-en-Flac beach, Mauritius, based on scenarios of future sea levels and predicted coral reef condition. In the study, both the mean wave climate and extreme event conditions are considered. The results show that lower coral structure complexity jointly with higher water levels allow for higher waves to pass over the reef and, therefore, to reach the shoreline. In addition, modeling for cyclonic conditions showed that nearshore waves would also increase in height, which could lead to major coastal morphodynamic changes. Measures aimed at preserving the coral reef may allow the system to accommodate for the gradual climatic changes forecasted while keeping its coastal protective function.

TI Sea-level rise projections for Sweden based on the new IPCC special
   report: The ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate
SO AMBIO
AB New sea-level rise projections for Sweden are presented. Compared to earlier projections, we have here, more carefully, taken regional variations in sea-level rise into consideration. The better treatment of regional variations leads to lower sea-level rise projections for Sweden. However, recent research has also shown that Antarctic ice loss, in high emission scenarios, could be greater than what was believed earlier. Taking also this into account, we find a near cancellation between the increased Antarctic contribution and the decrease owing to the better treatment of spatial inhomogeneities. Sweden's sensitivity to melt from Antarctica and Greenland is also estimated using a new set of sea-level fingerprint kernels, and the sensitivity to melt from Greenland is found to be weak. To illustrate the influence mean sea-level rise has on extreme sea levels, it is also shown how the return period of sea-level extremes changes as a function of time owing to mean sea-level rise in the different projections.

TI Past environmental changes during the Late Holocene sea-level fall (last
   2.7 Ka) at Bahia Samborombon, NE coastal plain (Argentina)
SO JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
AB Here we present a reconstruction of vegetation history and environmental changes at the central zone of Bahia Samborombon during the Late Holocene sea-level regressive phase (last 2.7 Ka) corresponding to MIS 1. This study is an integrative approach based on the combination of geomorphological and micropaleontological (pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs and foraminifera) proxy data. We found agreement among the environmental inferences from each proxy, which clearly show the evolution of the estuarine saltmarsh from an intertidal environment under significant marine influence towards a supratidal brackish-freshwater environment as sea level was falling. The evidence of this evolution is (1) coastal progradation encompassing at least 5.7 km as revealed by relict shorelines. Saltmarsh elevation is another evidenced as a result of accretion due to fine sediments accumulation of at least 1.2 m thick. We posit based on these values, significant progradation and accumulation processes. (2) Plant succession, characterized by the replacement of low saltmarsh vegetation by that typical of high saltmarsh; which then is associated to brackish-freshwaters plant communities in shallow water-bodies environments. (3) A gradual decrease of dinocysts and foraminifera assemblages, the latter absent during the last millennium indicating a decrease in marine influence and the consequent lower salinity values. Bahia Samborombon coastal plains became a regional scale character during the last 2.7 Ka due to its surface increase, turning into one of the most extensive southeastern-South America saltmarshes, currently constituting a biosphere reserve.

TI Holocene evolution of Itapeva Lake, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil:
   Palynomorphs C-org, N, and S records
SO JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
AB Holocene coastal environmental changes are interpreted from a 590 cm long core taken from Itapeva Lake in the northern coastal plain, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The sediment core is radiocarbon dated at 211 cm depth (6460 +/- 40 yr B.P.) and studied by geochemistry and palynomorph analyses. The Pleistocene-Holocene boundary is predicted at the top of a glauconitic sand layer at 330 cm depth. On the basis of C-org, N.S. and palynomorph data, it is possible to distinguish four zones related to the Holocene transgression-regression cycle, as well as proxies for the salinity trends and organic matter source. The start of Zone I represents the oldest Holocene sedimentary record in the core. Palynomorphs reveal a marsh environment with a freshwater influence. In Zone 2, Opereuloclinium centrocarpum and high S values indicate brackish water and reflect a Holocene sea-level rise related to the post-facial marine transgression. The high amount of Cyperaceae pollen grains and a significant C-org increase in Zone 3 indicate a typical marsh environment with episodes of marine water that reflect a regression phase. Salvinia natans (L) All. and Cyperaceae pollen grains are the most significant palynomorphs in Zone 4, which charterizes a freshwater marsh. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI ANOXIC EVENTS IN THE LATE FRASNIAN - CAUSES OF THE FRASNIAN-FAMENNIAN
   FAUNAL CRISIS
SO GEOLOGY
AB Carbon isotope data collected from five Frasnian-Famennian boundary sections in central Europe show two positive deltaC-13 excursions in the late Frasnian (approximately 367 Ma). Both anomalies coincided with the deposition of the bituminous lower and upper Kellwasser horizons. The carbon isotope patterns indicate two phases of enhanced burial and subsequent recycling of organic carbon. A maximum formation of warm saline waters on the subtropical to tropical epicontinental shelves during late Frasnian transgressive episodes may have induced oceanic oxygen deficits. Variations in the C(org) burial rates may have resulted in changes in the CO2 concentrations in the oceans and in the atmosphere, culminating in global climatic changes. We propose that the repeated co-occurrences of sea-level fluctuations, anoxic conditions, and global climatic changes during the late Frasnian would affect especially the subtropical to tropical shallow-water communities and reef ecosystems, which were severely affected during the Frasnian-Famennian faunal crisis.

TI Holocene environmental changes and human activity at the Jijitan site in
   the Nihewan Basin, China
SO HOLOCENE
AB Knowledge of the relationship between human activities and environmental changes during the Holocene is important for understanding the survival and development of prehistoric humans. Using AMS C-14 dating and pollen and charcoal analysis, we reconstructed the history of environmental changes and human activity during the Holocene at the Jijitan site in the Nihewan Basin. During 13,000-7500 cal. yr BP, the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) gradually intensified and precipitation increased, the vegetation changed from temperate grassland to wooded grassland and human activity remained at a low intensity. During 7500-5500 cal. yr BP, the EASM reached peak level, and the climate was warm and humid interval, and human activity intensified substantially. Within this interval, from 6600 to 6000 cal. yr BP, the forests were burned to increase the area of farmland. After 5500 cal. yr BP, the forest cover continued to gradually decrease due to the combined influences of the weakening EASM and increasing human activity. Comparison with regional climate records shows that the optimum period of forest development in northern China was approximately 8000-5000 cal. yr BP, indicating that the EASM reached a peak level in the mid-Holocene, which we suggest may have been due to the reduced influence of the high northern-latitude ice sheets and rising global sea level, rather than in the early Holocene.

TI Amplitude of climatic changes in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
SO CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN
AB On the basis of ice core and meteorological data from the Qinghai-Tibetan (Q-T) Plateau, this article focuses on the discussion of the problems related to the sensitivity of temporal and spatial changes of the climate in high-altitude regions, particularly in the Q-T Plateau. The features of abrupt climatic changes of the past 100 ka, 2 000 a and recent years indicate that the amplitude of these changes in the Q-T Plateau was obviously larger than that in low-altitude regions. The scope of temperature change above 6 000 m in the Q-T Plateau between glacial and interglacial stages could reach over 10 degrees C, but only about 4 degrees C in low-elevation regions close to sea level. During the last 2 000 a, the amplitude of temperature changes at Guliya (over 6 000 m a.s.l.) in the Q-T Plateau reached 7 degrees C, in comparison with 2 degrees C in eastern China at low altitude. In the present age, apparent differences of climatic warming have been observed in the Q-T Plateau, indicating that the warming in high-elevation regions is much higher than that in low-elevation regions. The temperature in over 3 500 m regions of the Q-T Plateau have been increasing at a rate of 0.25x10 (1)/a in recent 30 years, but almost no change has taken place in the regions below 500 m. Thus, we concluded that high-altitude regions are more sensitive to climatic changes than the low-altitude regions.

TI Evolution of the inter-reef Halimeda carbonate factory in response to
   Holocene sea-level and environmental change in the Great Barrier Reef
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB The inter-reef Halimeda bioherms of the northern Great Barrier Reef (GBR) have accumulated up to 25 m of positive relief and up to four times greater volume of calcium carbonate sediment than the nearby coral reefs during the Holocene. Covering >6000 km(2), the Halimeda bioherms represent a significant contribution to the development of the northeast Australian continental shelf geomorphology, neritic carbonate factory, and sedimentary archive of post-glacial environmental changes. However, the geochronological record of initiation and development of the Halimeda bioherm carbonate factory was poorly constrained and based on very few datapoints. A comprehensive age dataset is presented, comprising sixty-three new AMS radiocarbon measurements of Halimeda and foraminifera grains, mollusc shells and bulk soil from twelve inter-reef sediment cores, and ten previously published Halimeda ages. Facies transitions and environmental changes are recorded from lithological and palynological analyses spanning Last Interglacial Halimeda deposits, Last Glacial Maximum terrestrial palaeosols, transgressive mangrove vegetated shorelines, and the turn-on of the Halimeda bioherm carbonate factory. Mangrove pollen and coral records from the study area provide additional spatial, temporal and environmental context.
   Halimeda had established by 11.1 cal kyr BP, just 450 years after transgressive shelf inundation and approximately 1000 years earlier than previous inferred estimates. The outer-shelf carbonate factory was initially dominated by benthic foraminifera, then Halimeda was productive for at least 2100 years prior to the turn-on of Holocene coral reefs in the study area at 8.9 cal kyr BP from Boulder Reef (15.4 degrees S, 145.4 degrees E). Inter-reef Halimeda bioherms play a major role in carbon and nutrient cycling and potentially preserve a near-continuous geochemical record of northeast Australian Holocene oceanographic and climatic changes, filling spatial and temporal gaps not covered by coral and other marine sediment proxies.

TI Brackish Marsh Plant Community Responses to Regional Precipitation and
   Relative sea-Level Rise
SO WETLANDS
AB Climate-driven shifts in environmental conditions can transform the structure and function of coastal ecosystems. Here we examine how two back-barrier brackish marshes in Pamlico Sound (North Carolina, USA) responded to changes in precipitation, temperature, and relative sea level and whether local rates of accretion have kept pace with relative sea-level rise. We used the distribution of seeds in sediment cores, coupled with Pb-210-sediment geochronology, to determine patterns of community and ecosystem change over the past century. The chronologies demonstrate that both marshes recently transitioned from communities dominated by Cladium jamaicense, which prefers fresh and brackish settings, to communities dominated by Schoenoplectus americanus, which prefers brackish and saline environments. Multiple regression analysis indicates that community shifts are best explained by relative sea-level rise and regional trends in precipitation. Results also indicate that the marshes are developing an elevation deficit with respect to rising sea level, which likely influenced the conversion from C. jamaicense dominated to S. americanus dominated communities. These findings substantiate a growing body of evidence indicating that climate-driven shifts in environmental conditions are transforming coastal ecosystems and suggest that brackish intertidal marshes may become increasingly threatened by accelerated sea-level rise and associated environmental changes expected to unfold this century.

TI Late Holocene Sea Level Reconstructions Based on Observations of Roman
   Fish Tanks, Tyrrhenian Coast of Italy
SO GEOARCHAEOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB We present estimates for late Holocene relative sea level change along the Tyrrhenian coast of Italy based on morphological characteristics of eight submerged Roman fish tanks (piscinae) constructed between the 1st century B.C. and the 2nd century A.D. Underwater geomorphological features and archaeological remains related to past sea level have been measured and corrected using recorded tidal values. We conclude that local sea level during the Roman period did not exceed 58 +/- 5 cm below the present sea level. These results broadly agree with previous observations in the region but contrast with recent analysis that suggests a significantly larger sea level rise during the last 2000 years. Using a glacial isostatic adjustment model, we explain how regional sea level change departs from the eustatic component. Our calculation of relative sea level during the Roman period provides a reference for isolating the long-wavelength contribution to sea level change from secular sea level rise. Precise determination of sea level rise in the study area improves our understanding of secular, instrumentally observed, variations across the Mediterranean. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI Bahamian carbonate platform development in response to sea-level changes
   and the closure of the Isthmus of Panama
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
AB In this paper we show that the development of the sediment architecture at the leeward toe-of-slope of Great Bahama Bank (Ocean Drilling Project Leg 166, Bahama Transect) during the last 6 Ma is not only a response to sea-level fluctuations, but also to major paleo-oceanographic and climatic changes. A major sequence boundary close to the Miocene/Pliocene boundary (dated at 5.6-5.4 Ma) is interpreted to reflect a major sea-level drop that was followed by a sea-level rise, which led to the re-flooding of the Mediterranean Sea at the end of the Messinian and increasing sea-surface temperatures at Great Bahama Bank. Distinct erosional horizons occurred during the Pliocene (dated at 4.6 and 3.3-3.6 Ma) related to sea-level chan-e and the intensification of the Gulf Stream when the emergence of the Isthmus of Panama reached a critical threshold. The Gulf Stream brings warm, saline and nutrient-poor waters to the Bahamas. Starting at the Early-Late Pliocene boundary at 3.6 Ma this paleo-oceanographic reorganization in combination with enhanced sea-level fluctuations associated with the Late Pliocene main intensification in Northern Hemisphere Glaciation (since 3.2 Ma) led to (1) a gradual change from a ramp-type to a flat-topped type morphology, and (2) a change from a skeletal to a non-skeletal-dominated sedimentary system (mainly peloidal). Increased sea-level fluctuations during the second half of the Pleistocene led to an intensified high stand-shedding depositional pattern within the surrounding basins.

TI Hydrogeological changes in coastal aquifers due to sea level rise
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Global warming and climatic changes can lead to sea level rise (SLR) of dozens of cms over up-coming decades, along with groundwater permanent reserve losses (PRL). This study focuses on understanding the processes and estimating groundwater losses. A case study for such phenomena is Israel's Coastal aquifer. PRL estimation methodology is based upon a simple hydrogeological conceptual model. The results lead to estimation of two main components of an aquifer's PRL, and to key factors that can enhance or mitigate these losses. Such recommended measures as high-resolution topographic mapping and improved monitoring of sea level have been noted. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Response and Recovery of Low-Salinity Marsh Plant Communities to Presses
   and Pulses of Elevated Salinity
SO ESTUARIES AND COASTS
AB In estuaries, future variation in sea level and river discharge will lead to saline intrusion into low-salinity tidal marshes. To investigate the processes that control the differential response and recovery of tidal freshwater marsh plant communities to saline pulses, a 3x5 factorial greenhouse experiment was conducted to examine the effects of a range of salinity levels (3, 5, and 10practical salinity units (PSU)) and pulse durations (5, 10, 15, 20, and 30days per month) on community composition of tidal freshwater marsh vegetation. Recovery of perturbed communities was also examined after 10months. The results showed that community composition was increasingly affected by the more-saline and longer-duration treatments. The increasing suppression of salt-sensitive species resulted in species reordering, decreased species richness, and decreased aboveground biomass. Most of the plant species were able to recover from low-salinity, short-duration saline pulses in less than 1year. However, because not all species recovered in the heavily salinized treatments, species richness at the end of the recovery period remained low for treatments that were heavily salinized during the treatment period. In contrast, plant aboveground biomass fully recovered in the heavily salinized treatments. Although the magnitude and duration of pulsed environmental changes had strong effects on community composition, shifts in community composition prevented long-term reductions in productivity. Thus, in this study system, environmental change affected species composition more strongly than it did ecosystem processes.

TI Quaternary environmental change: Why the past can help us understand the
   present and maybe predict the future
SO GEOGRAPHY
AB Recent climatic and environmental changes have increased our awareness of the timescales of such changes; some date back hundreds of thousands of years, others are more recent and short-term. This article reviews the evidence used to reconstruct environmental change, based on analysis of proxy data, and the uniformity inn assumptions which under-lie the uses of such data. In addition it attempts to examine this evidence in the context of the possible causes, both natural and anthropogenic, of climatic and environmental change. In all of this a crucial factor is the dating of evidence, and recent advances and new techniques are continually, extending our knowledge and understanding of the processes of change.
   Case studies based on three different records and their associated methods (cliff exposures on the north Norfolk coast, analyses of lake sediments, and dendrochronological techniques) are used to demonstrate the relevance and importance of an understanding of climatic and environmental changes during the Quaternary period The reconstruction of palaeoclimates provides (i) a perspective against which to evaluate the increasing concerns about contemporary climatic changes, (ii) the state of the Earth prior to large scale anthropogenic impacts, and (iii) the timings of such impacts. Exercises are suggested which students can use to gain experience of some of the practicalities and issues involved in Quaternary research.

TI Comparison of satellite altimetry to tide gauge measurement of sea
   level: Predictions of glacio-isostatic adjustment
SO JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
AB Modern rates of sea level change are of interest because of concerns that global warming may be causing glacier retreat. Both tide gauges and satellite radar altimetry are used to measure the present rates of change in sea level. Tide gauges measure sea level relative to the ocean floor whereas the reference for satellite altimetry is the earth's center. A numerical model of deformation of the earth's solid surface and its geoid forced by melting ice sheets, both past and present, is used to predict the present rate of sea level change as measured by tide gauges and satellites. Sea level change observed by both tide gauges and satellites are predicted to be spatially nonuniform. Considering only past ice sheets tide gauges in glaciated regions would record a fall in sea level of -13 mm yr(-1), whereas satellite altimetry would record a rise in sea level of 0.7 mm yr(-1). In the region peripheral to the glaciated zone a tide gauge would record a rise in sea level (3 mm yr(-1)) in contrast to a predicted fall in sea level (-0.3 mm yr(-1)) recorded with satellite altimetry. Near regions once glaciated, the rate of sea level change as recorded by satellite decays more rapidly than the tide gauge sea level signature and so isostatic adjustment caused by past ice sheets contributes proportionately less to the modern rate of sea level change as measured by satellites than by tide gauges. At regions distant from glaciated areas both tide gauges and satellites would record a slight (-0.3 mm yr(-1)) sea level fall. The immediate elastic sea level response from melting of present ice sheets yields a similar signature for data from both tide gauges and satellite altimetry. Recorded sea level would fall near the meltwater source and at great distance from the source would rise approximately 122% of the oceanwide average sea level amount. Therefore glacio-isostatic processes will contaminate the sea level record measured by satellite less than the tide gauge record.

TI From shelf to abyss: Record of the Paleocene/Eocene-boundary in the
   Eastern Alps (Austria)
SO GEOLOGICA ACTA
AB In the Eastern Alps (Austria) several marine successions, which were deposited ranging from shallow shelf to bathyal slope and abyssal basin, provide detailed records across the Paleocene/Eocene-boundary. These records indicate a two-step event starting with a prominent sea-level fall and followed by climatic changes. At the northern and southern shelves that fringed the Penninic Basin, the shallow-water sedimentary records are incomplete across the Paleocene/Eocene transition. Erosional surfaces indicate a major sea-level drop, which was terminated by an early Eocene (Ypresian) transgression within calcareous nannoplankton Zone NP12. As a proxy for the onset of this sea-level fall a strong increase in the terrestrially-derived input into the Penninic Basin can be used. The abyssal Anthering section from the northern part of the basin comprises a complete succession from NP9 to the upper part of NP10 (upper Thanetian-lower Ypresian). The thickest turbidite beds of this 250 m thick succession appear just before the carbon isotope event in the upper part of zone NP9, which is used to recognize the Paleocene/Eocene-boundary. A major lithological change from a sandstone-dominated facies to a claystone-dominated facies occurs at the onset of the carbon isotope event. This might be the result of a climatic change, resulting in increased intra-annual humidity gradients and increased physical erosion of the hinterland. Consequently, mainly fine-grained suspended material would have come into the basin and caused an increase in hemipelagic sedimentation rates by about a factor of 6. A similar value has been calculated for the bathyal Untersberg section, which was deposited on the southern slope of the basin, where an increased input of siliciclastic material is associated with a carbonate dissolution event during the carbon isotope event. At the southern shelf, a stratigraphic gap within the Gosau Group in the Krappfeld area (Carinthia) comprises the Maastrichtian and Paleocene. After a sea-level rise nummulitic marlstone and limestone were deposited in the lower part of zone NP12. Since the northern and southern shelves of the Penninic Basin belonged to different tectonic domains, with different potentials of crustal subsidence, the temporal similarity of sea-level changes on both shelves in the latest Paleocene and earliest Eocene suggests that these sea level fluctuations were mainly eustatic in origin.

TI Phytoplankton response to palaeoenvironmental changes across the
   Campanian-Maastrichtian (Upper Cretaceous) boundary interval of the
   Middle Vistula River section, central Poland
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB Palynological and palynofacies analyses were applied in order to characterise the palaeoenvironmental conditions that existed during the formation of the upper Campanian-lowermost Maastrichtian epicontinental succession of the Middle Vistula River section (central Poland). The abundant and diverse phytoplankton assemblages, dominated by dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts) indicative of inner- to outer-neritic settings, varied distinctly throughout the succession. A high-resolution analysis of dinocyst palaeoecological groups revealed a distinct trend, interpreted in terms of the dinoflagellate response to relative sea-level fluctuations. A comparison with the short-term global sea-level curve suggests that the recorded sea-level changes were of eustatic origin. The palaeoenvironmental preferences of Circulodinium distinctum, Spongodinium delitiense, Callaiosphaeridium spp. and some ceratiacean dinocysts (Odontochitina and Xenascus) are discussed. The importance of Tanyosphaeridium xanthiopyxides and of the Cretaceous species of the acritarch genus Palaeostomocystis (P. foveolata, P. reticulata) as potential proxies for cooler-water conditions is highlighted. Circulodinium distinctum and Odontochitina dilatata likely preferred warmer waters. The trend in the palynofacies pattern (short-term cyclicity manifested as significant influxes of translucent phytoclasts) was found not to correspond to the dinocyst-inferred sea-level changes. Instead, variation in the terrestrially-sourced (probably from nearby Kukernitz Island) organic-matter supply was possibly caused by changes in river runoff.

SO GEOLOGIA CROATICA
AB U-Th and C-14 dating, and X-ray diffraction of parts of 16 submerged speleothems taken from depths of 1.5-41.5 m from 7 submarine caves and pits along the Eastern Adriatic coast, provided insight into the sea-level fluctuations during the last 220 ka, and to the palaeogeographic changes caused by sea-level changes. Due to climate changes, palaeoenvironmental settings also varied, but not so abruptly and intensely as in the rest of Europe. As the Alps and Dinarides acted as orographic barriers, the Eastern Adriatic coast was the border region between periglacial Europe and the temperate Mediterranean region. It was also a refuge area for plant species from the north. This study showed that appropriate temperature, humidity and vegetation cover ensured favourable conditions for karstification and speleothem formation even during the Last Glacial Maximum.

TI Sea level and climatic controls on turbidite occurrence for the past 26
   kyr on the flank of the Gaoping Canyon off SW Taiwan
SO MARINE GEOLOGY
AB Submarine canyons are major conduits for delivery of sediments originating from the continental margin into the deep sea. Here we analyze the effects of changing sea levels and climate (e.g. sediment supply) on the frequency of turbidites over the last 26 kyr. Our study is based on high resolution age controls for turbidites in core MD178-10-3291 from a water depth of 2070 m on the flank of the Gaoping Canyon offshore in SW Taiwan. Unlike most other submarine canyons worldwide, the head of the Gaoping Canyon has remained connected to the river mouth during the recent flooding of the continental shelf. Our results reveal that turbidity currents are less frequent during periods of sea-level lowstand. In contrast, turbidity currents have been more frequent since 12 kyr BP, during the final stage of rising sea level and sea-level highstands. This may be the result of increased terrestrial sediment delivery due to enhanced rainfall intensity. Moreover, comparing to other source-to-sink systems, the turbidite occurrence in the flank of Gaoping Canyon through the last glacial cycle might have been more strongly influenced by climatic changes due to short sediment storage/response time.

TI Species distribution modeling reveals the ecological niche of extinct
   megafauna from South America
SO QUATERNARY RESEARCH
AB Climatic and environmental changes, as well as human action, have been cited as potential causes for the extinction of megafauna in South America at the end of the Pleistocene. Among megamammals lineages with Holarctic origin, only horses and proboscideans went extinct in South America during this period. This study aims to understand how the spatial extent of habitats suitable for Equus neogeus and Notiomastodon platensis changed between the last glacial maximum (LGM) and the middle Holocene in order to determine the impact that climatic and environmental changes had on these taxa. We used species distribution modeling to estimate their potential extent on the continent and found that both species occupied arid and semiarid open lands during the LGM, mainly in the Pampean region of Argentina, southern and northeastern Brazil, and parts of the Andes. However, when climate conditions changed from dry and cold during the LGM to humid and warm during the middle Holocene, the areas suitable for these taxa were reduced dramatically. These results support the hypothesis that climatic changes were a driving cause of extinction of these megamammals in South America, although we cannot rule out the impact of human actions or other potential causes for their extinction.

TI Facies development, depositional settings and sequence stratigraphy
   across the Ordovician-Silurian boundary: a new perspective from the
   Barrandian area of the Czech Republic
SO GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
AB The Himantian and Llandovery sedimentary succession of the Barrandian area has been assigned to middle and outer clastic-shelf depositional settings, respectively. Deposition was influenced by the remote Gondwanan glaciation and subsequent, long-persisting, post-glacial anoxia triggered by a current-driven upwelling system. High-resolution graptolite stratigraphy, based upon 19 formally defined biozones - largely interval zones-and five subzones, enabled a detailed correlation between 42 surface sections and boreholes, and enabled linking of the sedimentary record, graptoloid fauna dynamics, organic-content fluctuations and spectral gamma-ray curves. The Himantian and Llandovery succession has been subdivided into four biostratigraphically dated third-order sequences (units 1-4). Time-spatial facies distribution recorded early and late Himantian glacio-eustatic sea-level lowstands separated by a remarkable mid-Himantian rise in sea-level. A major part of the post-glacial sea-level rise took place within the late Himantian. The highstand of Unit 2 is apparently at the base of the Silurian succession. Short-term relative sea-level drawdown and a third-order sequence boundary followed in the early Rhuddanian upper acuminatus Zone. Early Aeronian and late Telychian sea-level highstands and late Aeronian drawdown of likely eustatic origin belong to units 3 and 4. Sea-level rise culminated in the late Telychian, which may also be considered as a highstand episode of a second-order Himantian-early Silurian cycle. Facies and sequence-stratigraphic analysis supports recent interpretations on nappe structures in the core part of the Ordovician-Middle Devonian Prague Synform of the Barrandian.

TI Effect of climatic change on the harvest of the kelp Macrocystis
   pyrifera on the Mexican Pacific Coast
SO BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE
AB The effect of sea temperature, sea level, upwelling, and wind speed on the Macrocystis pyrifera harvest was evaluated using historical harvest data for the western coast of the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico. The relationship between the environmental variables and harvest per unit effort (CPUE) was determined through correlation analysis for the period from 1956-1998. The effects of temperature, upwelling, and sea level were inverse, whereas the effect of wind speed was not significant. Multiple regression analysis showed that, of the variables studied, temperature best explained variations in Macrocystis harvest.

TI Sea-Level Rise Implications for Coastal Regions
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB Sea-level rise, a dominant driving force of change for coastal regions, is becoming increasingly important as a hazard to humans and urban areas in the coastal zone worldwide as global climate change takes effect. The geologic record shows that sea level, due to past natural climate factors, has been highly variable, as much as 6-8 m higher than present during the last interglacial warm period and 130 m lower during the last glacial period. Sea level was fairly stable for the past 3,000 years until about the mid-19th century. During the 20th century, sea level began rising at a global average rate of 1.7 mm/yr. The current average rise rate is 3.1 mm/yr, a 50% increase over the past two decades. Many regions are experiencing even greater rise rates due to local geophysical (e.g., Louisiana, Chesapeake Bay) and oceanographic (Mid-Atlantic coast) forces. A few regions experience rise rates less than the global average due to land uplift. Observations show the increase of carbon emissions since the Industrial Revolution has increased global mean temperature of the air and ocean, which is responsible for sea-level rise due to ice sheet melting and steric expansion, and many related environmental changes. Sea-level rise, with high regional variability, is exhibiting acceleration and is expected to continue for centuries unless mitigation is enacted to reduce atmospheric carbon. Low-lying coastal plain regions, deltas, and most islands are highly vulnerable. Adaptation planning on local, state and national scales for projected sea-level rise of 0.5-2 m by A.D. 2100 is advisable. Sustained global rise in sea level of 4 m to as much as 8 m is possible, but not likely until well after A.D. 2100.

TI Tracking anthropogenic- and climatic-related environmental changes in
   the remaining habitat lakes of the endangered Atlantic whitefish
   (Coregonus huntsmani) using palaeolimnological techniques
SO AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
AB 1. Atlantic whitefish (Coregonus huntsmani) is a critically endangered species whose remaining habitat is restricted to three lakes near Bridgewater, Nova Scotia, Canada. Other lakes in this region have been affected by a variety of environmental changes over the past 150 years (e.g. acidic deposition, eutrophication, and climatic changes); however, the extent of the impact on these remaining Atlantic whitefish lakes, and how the current limnological conditions compare with pre-industrial conditions, is not known.
   2. Given the lack of long-term monitoring data, palaeolimnological techniques were used to track environmental changes in these three lakes to infer historic limnological conditions.
   3. Results of this study show that acidic deposition has had no significant impact on these lakes (diatom-inferred lakewater pH has changed little over time), nor has the nutrient status of these lakes changed as the sediment profiles have been consistently dominated by oligotrophic diatom taxa.
   4. Changes in the dominance of diatom assemblages since similar to 1850, from Aulacoseira distans to Cyclotella stelligera, are correlated with climatic warming (r = 0.48-0.89, P < 0.05).
   5. Contrary to initial concerns, these only remaining habitats of the Atlantic whitefish have not yet been affected by acidic precipitation. However, other potential stressors, such as climatic warming and associated limnological changes, may now be affecting the habitat of this endangered species.

TI Sea Level Fluctuation in West Taiwan
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB If sea level rises significantly around Taiwan, it would cause many devastating impacts to its western coastal area, such as flooding, wave overtopping, beach erosion, etc. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the apparent sea level fluctuation in Western Taiwan by analyzing tidal data at all tidal sites along the west coastline. The result shows that the relative sea levels at most west coastal locations have a rising trend except around Taichung Harbor. The largest sea level rise rates are 1.92 cm/year in Wenkung and 1.1 cm/year in Junjung. Sea levels for both Keelung Harbor and Kaohsiung Harbor areas also show a rising tendency, but their rates are rather small, just 0.35 mm/year and 0.58 mm/year, respectively. Sea level fluctuation for Taichung Harbor shows a falling trend of 0.52 cm/year. Because almost all those tidal sites on the west coast are affected by some degree of ground subsidence, the regional sea level rise requires further more thorough study.

TI Mangrove response to environmental change in Australia's Gulf of
   Carpentaria
SO ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB Across their range, mangroves are responding to coastal environmental change. However, separating the influence of human activities from natural events and processes (including that associated with climatic fluctuation) is often difficult. In the Gulf of Carpentaria, northern Australia (Leichhardt, Nicholson, Mornington Inlet, and Flinders River catchments), changes in mangroves are assumed to be the result of natural drivers as human impacts are minimal. By comparing classifications from time series of Landsat sensor data for the period 1987-2014, mangroves were observed to have extended seawards by up to 1.9 km (perpendicular to the coastline), with inland intrusion occurring along many of the rivers and rivulets in the tidal reaches. Seaward expansion was particularly evident near the mouth of the Leichhardt River, and was associated with peaks in river discharge with LiDAR data indicating distinct structural zones developing following each large rainfall and discharge event. However, along the Gulf coast, and particularly within the Mornington Inlet catchment, the expansion was more gradual and linked to inundation and regular sediment supply through freshwater input. Landward expansion along the Mornington Inlet catchment was attributed to the combined effects of sea level rise and prolonged periods of tidal and freshwater inundation on coastal lowlands. The study concluded that increased amounts of rainfall and associated flooding and sea level rise were responsible for recent seaward and landward extension of mangroves in this region.

AB Integrated sedimentologic, biostratigraphic, chemostratigraphic, and tectonic analyses of Late Ordovician stratigraphic sequences on the Laurentian plate indicate that one of the most severe extinctions among marine organisms in the Phanerozoic may be linked to climate and environmental changes related to a relatively brief glacial Interval. These studies indicate that most of the extinctions occurred in relation to environmental change stimulated by relative sea-level fall or rise. Although some of the extinctions took place at the onset of glaciation, more of them occurred as sea level rose with the onset of deglaciation. A significant excursion in carbon isotopic ratios coincided with a cycle of sea-level fall and rise. Deposition of siliciclastic sediments in the Late Ordovician Queenston Delta complex on the southern margin of Laurentia may have been responsible for a brief decline in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, which, in turn, led to global cooling and glaciation. The Queenston Delta sedimentary record suggests that the complex accumulated for only a brief interval that coincided with the duration of glaciation.

TI Mangrove shoreline responses to holocene environmental change, Makassar
   strait, Indonesia
SO REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY
AB Pollen and radiocarbon analyses have been used to study environmental and mangrove dynamics at two near-coastal sites at Batulicin, South Kalimantan and Pare-Pare, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. These two sites are separated by the Makassar Strait. The results indicate that mangroves developed at Batulicin in the mid-Holocene following sea-level stabilization. Although mangroves might have degraded to some extent due to a high rate of sea level rise prior to the mid-Holocene peak, they persisted to the present time at Batulicin. In contrast, mangrove development commenced at Pare-Pare in the early Holocene following Holocene transgression. Their development was abruptly halted in the mid-Holocene. Deposition at the site since the mid Holocene has been supra-tidal terrestrial (fluvia/floodplain), this may have been facilitated by a minor sea-level regression. Briefly, Holocene environmental and mangrove dynamics at Batulicin are: shallow marine-lower half intertidal zone/mid-tide mangroves forest-upper half intertidal zone/high-tide mangroves, while at Pare-Pare site are: terrestrial/fluvial environment-intertidal zone/mangroves-fluvial environment.

TI Analyzing the Effects of Short-Term Persistence and Shift in Sea Level
   Records along the US Coast
SO HYDROLOGY
AB Is sea level change affected by the presence of autocorrelation and abrupt shift? This question reflects the importance of trend and shift detection analysis in sea level. The primary factor driving the global sea level rise is often related to climate change. The current study investigates the changes in sea level along the US coast. The sea level records of 59 tide gauge data were used to evaluate the trend, shift, and persistence using non-parametric statistical tests. Mann-Kendall and Pettitt's tests were utilized to estimate gradual trends and abrupt shifts, respectively. The study also assessed the presence of autocorrelation in sea level records and its effect on both trend and shift was examined along the US coast. The presence of short-term persistence was found in 57 stations and the trend significance of most stations was not changed at a 95% confidence level. Total of 25 stations showed increasing shift between 1990-2000 that was evaluated from annual sea level records. Results from the current study may contribute to understanding sea level variability across the contiguous US. This study extends an elaborative understanding of sea level trends and shifts which might be useful for water managers.

TI Planktonic Biota Constituents Responses to Global Sea-Level Changes
   Recorded in the Uppermost Albian to Middle Cenomanian Deep-Water Facies
   of the Outer Carpathians
SO MINERALS
AB Interpretations of sea-level changes over geological time are mainly based on analyses of sediments deposited within stable platforms. One of the criteria for recognizing these changes is the composition of skeleton-bearing protists living in environments close to the shoreline and on the continental shelf. It can be assumed that the source of information about sea-level changes may also be found in assemblages of microfossils redeposited from the shelf to the marginal ocean basin. With such an assumption, this article presents an interpretation of changes in marine plankton communities (radiolarians and planktonic foraminifera), which during late Albian-middle Cenomanian were redeposited with carbonate mud by gravity currents from the peri-Tethyan shelf to the northern, marginal Silesian Basin of the Western Tethys. Planktonic biota identified in sediments deposited by gravity flows and those found in hemipelagic shales separating them, indicate that their composition may be correlated with eustatic changes in the sea level from the late Albian (KAl8) to middle Cenomanian (KCe3).

SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB The multidisciplinary study (sedimentology: texture, carbonates, organic matter, elemental composition, mineralogy of sand and clay; micropaleontology: foraminifera, calcareous nannoplankton and pollen - and radiocarbon dating) of three cores recovered from the Douro estuary infill has allowed to reconstruct the paleoenvironmental guidelines of this area for the last 14000 years. The major environmental changes recognized in the geological record of this area are principally associated with the Holocene transgression and the succession of different climatic types. The transgressive sequence is expressed through several environmental changes, related with a succession of different facies: a continental one till circa 9834 BP, followed by an alternated marine/continental facies with an intensification of marine signature till 5750BP; particularly after 6050BP, the environment is typically marine. After that and till present, it is followed by a regressive sequence (although within a still positive eustatic trend).

Studies have been conducted to see the impact of global warming towards the changes in sea level. In this study, a total of 21 tide gauge stations along the Malaysian coastlines were used to analyse the rate and magnitude of sea level rise using robust fit regression. Tidal data used in this study is from year 1984 to 2013, which is about 30 years. The analysis shows that the total average sea level rate for Malaysian Seas including Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak is rising at 3.67 +/- 0.15 mm/yr. While the total average magnitude of sea level rise is at 0.095 m. Conclusively, the sea level trend for all stations along the coasts of Malaysia shows an increasing pattern. This study offers valuable sea level information particularly related to environmental issue such as flood and global warming in Malaysia.

TI Palaeoshorelines on the Australian continental shelf: Morphology,
   sea-level relationship and applications to environmental management and
   archaeology
SO CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
AB Palaeoshorelines that lie submerged on stable continental shelves are relict coastal depositional and erosional structures formed during periods of lower sea level. An analysis of the well-dated Late Quaternary (0-128 ka) sea-level record indicates that the most persistent (modal) lower sea levels were at 30 \- 40 m below present, which occurred between 97 and 116 ka and at approximately 85 ka and 10 ka. A secondary modal position was at 70 - 90 m that occurred mostly during a period of fluctuating sea level between 30 and 60 ka, as well as at around 87 ka (70 - 80 m only) and 12-15 ka. For the tectonically stable Australian continental shelf, we show that a range of shorelines formed at each of these sea level modal positions and their morphology and degree of preservation depends on composition (carbonate vs siliciclastic) and oceanographic setting (wave, tide and wind energy). These ancient coasts record a range of oceanographic and geological regimes that existed during relatively long periods of lower sea level and provide a guide to the general depth zones in which similar features likely occur on other shelves globally. Australian palaeoshorelines represent distinctive benthic habitats that strongly influence the distribution of biodiversity across the shelf. Accurate mapping of these features provides a robust geospatial framework for investigations of marine species distributions and environmental change monitoring. These data also enable the better targeting of relict coastal areas that potentially include sand resources and sites of human occupation during periods of lower sea level.

TI Crustal subsidence inferred from reconstruction of the
   Pleistocene-Holocene palaeogeography in the northern Lake Inba area,
   central Japan
SO QUATERNARY RESEARCH
AB To help characterise the palaeogeographic and lacustrine environmental changes that resulted from the Holocene transgression and residual subsidence in the eastern Kanto Plain of central Japan, we analysed four drill cores and reviewed other core data from the southern part of the Lake Inba area. Fossil diatom assemblages yielded evidence of centennial-scale palaeogeographic and salinity responses to sea-level changes since the late Pleistocene. We determined that the seawater incursion into the Lake Inba area during the Holocene transgression occurred at approximately 9000 yr. We also recognised a late Holocene regression event corresponding to the Yayoi regression, considered to have occurred from ca. 3000 to ca. 2000 yr, and a subsequent transgression. Our data clarify some of the palaeogeographic changes that occurred in the Lake Inba area and document an overall trend toward lower salinity in the lake during the regression. In particular, the environment in Lake Inba changed from brackish to freshwater no later than 1000 yr. From the detailed palaeogeographic and palaeo-sea-level reconstruction, we recognised that residual subsidence occurred during the Holocene in this area. Thus, comparison of sea-level reconstructions based on modelling and fossil diatom assemblages is effective in interpreting Holocene long-term subsidence.

AB Within the framework of an ongoing scientific project undertaken in the area of Istron-Kalo Chorio, Gulf of Mirabello, eastern Crete, several geoarchaeological methods were employed, to provide information on the paleoenvironmental reconstruction and landscape evolution. The combination of detailed field-survey, geophysical prospection, archaeological excavations, along with geomorphologic observations, analyses and dating on deposited sediments, gave evidence of the paleogeographic evolution of the area and its impact on prehistoric, classical and Roman establishments.
   The study of sea-land interactions during the last seven millennia in relation to the eustatic sea level oscillations and the regional neotectonic regime provided new data for sea level changes and local tectonics.
   The results of field work and analyses provide insight for landscape evolution, influenced mainly by environmental changes and human presence during the Holocene.

TI Implications of Global Climatic Change on Water and Food Security
SO GLOBAL CHANGE: IMPACTS ON WATER AND FOOD SECURITY
SE Water Resources Development and Management
AB Water availability, access, and use has ensured food and livelihood security for millions. In the future, food and livelihood security may be challenged due to global environmental changes, particularly global climatic changes, that evidence has gradually shown to be appearing. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has projected that the global mean surface temperature will rise by 1.4-5.8 degrees C by 2100 due to increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. Climate variability is also projected to increase, leading to uncertainty in the onset of monsoons and more frequent extreme weather events, such as more severe droughts and floods. These environmental changes are known to affect all aspects of the hydrological cycle, which in turn may alter the balance between food demand and supply in time and space in many parts of the world. Regions such as South Asia and Africa are expected to be particularly vulnerable to these environmental changes due to their large population, predominance of agriculture, and limited resource base. The potential impact of climatic changes on the quality of fruits, vegetables, cereals and medicinal plants can have a negative impact on emerging trade opportunities for these commodities in many countries. To ensure future water and food security, greater attention is now needed on adaptations to climatic change, which calls for increased diversification, improved land use and natural resource management policies, increased use of biofuels, improved risk management through early warning systems and crop insurance, and wastewater recycling in agriculture.

TI Middle to late Holocene environmental changes in the depositional system
   of the tropical brackish Bolgoda Lake, coastal southwest Sri Lanka
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB The tropical Bolgoda Lake is one of the largest lagoonal estuaries in Sri Lanka. Organic constituents in this lake were investigated using 28 surface sediments, three cores from the lake, and four short cores from mangrove mud. Elemental and molecular compositions of sediments and living organic matter (OM) were determined using CNS elemental analysis and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. Chronology of events was determined using accelerated mass spectrometry (AMS)C-14 data for bulk OMs, woods and mollusk shells. The history of Bolgoda Lake can be divided into two major chrono-stratigraphic divisions, namely a lower sedimentary succession (from ca. 7.0 cal ky B.P. to 2.5 cal ky B.P.) and an upper sedimentary succession (from ca. 2.5 cal ky B.P. to the Recent), according to the sapropelic depositional system. Concentrations of the mangrove biomarker taraxone increased significantly at ca. 7.0 cal ky B.P. The lower part of the sediment sequence had moderate productivity, and was mainly deposited under marine-terrestrial influence in oxygen-poor/anoxic conditions during mid-Holocene sea-level highstands. A drastic increase in total organic carbon (TOC) content, reaching 29%, was found in one of the Bolgoda cores. This increase occurred because of sea-level regression at about 2.5 cal ky B.P. This change was probably caused by development of a beach rock/sandbar, and the estuary system changed to a semi-closed lake due to the sea-level regression. As a result, aquatic vascular plants predominate in this depositional system. After ca. 2.5 cal kyB.P., TOC content decreased slightly, but relatively high TOC contents were maintained in the muddy sediments. In moderately-sized and shallow (1-2 m) tropical estuaries/lagoons such as Bolgoda Lake, drastic changes in TOC contents may be the most sensitive indicator of sea-level variations. Increase in higher plant OM with higher n-C-29/n-C-all and n-C-37/n-C-all alkane ratios also suggest a climatic transition from wetter to somewhat drier after the middle Holocene. Accumulations of pyrogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the modern sediments record anthropogenic activity after European settlement in the 15th century. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI Geomorphological response of the East Frisian barrier islands to
   sea-level rise: An investigation of past and future evolution
SO GEOMORPHOLOGY
AB Post-glacial sea-level rise has resulted in shoreline erosion in many places. Sandy barrier islands migrate in a landward direction in order to compensate for the rise in sea-level. Several models for the possible response of the East Frisian barrier islands and tidal hats to the Holocene sea-level rise are summarized. The historical morphological development of the region has been influenced by a sea-level rise of ca. 0.25 m per century. In the future, sea-level rise - especially if sea-level rise is accelerated in response to human influences - will change the morphology of this coastal zone. Several developmental models are considered which predict the geomorphological response of the East Frisian coastal zone to sea-level rise. Four possible scenarios are conceivable depending on island width, back-barrier Lagoon area and human protection measures.

TI Rate and synchronicity of environmental changes on a shallow carbonate
   platform (Late Oxfordian, Swiss Jura Mountains)
SO SEDIMENTOLOGY
AB Recent global change occurs within decades and leaves a significant imprint on shallow carbonate platforms. To what extent can rate and synchronicity of environmental changes in the past be evaluated in order to allow comparisons with the processes and products of today? Sections of a carbonate-dominated platform of Late Oxfordian age have been logged in detail in the Swiss Jura Mountains. The time frame, based on ammonite biostratigraphy and the hierarchical stacking of the sedimentary sequences, suggests that these formed by low-amplitude, high-frequency sea-level changes in tune with the orbital cycles. The smallest unit, the elementary sequence, can thus be attributed to the 20 kyr precession cycle. By identifying sequence-stratigraphic elements such as maximum-flooding surfaces within an elementary sequence, an even higher time resolution can be obtained and reconstructions of changes in water depth and sea-level are attempted. Sedimentation rates were highly irregular and discontinuity surfaces are common. Correlation of such surfaces from one section to the other is tentative because they could also have formed locally and are not necessarily synchronous. On the scale of elementary sequences, the vertical facies evolution permits interpretation of changes in water depth, which were produced by eustatic sea-level changes (allocyclic) and/or by autocyclic processes. The distribution of clay minerals indicates changes of sea-level, as well as of rainfall in the hinterland. Biotic changes were controlled by water depth and water quality, and also by nutrient and clay input. Carbon and oxygen isotopes do not show significant shifts within the elementary sequences. The original ecological, mineralogical and geochemical signals have partly been homogenized because of time-averaging through bioturbation and through reworking by storms, and because of diagenetic modifications. Consequently, there is potential to interpret environmental changes on the studied carbonate platform but the time resolution is not better than a few thousand years. The rates and the synchronicity of the processes leading to the observed environmental changes can thus be estimated only within this time frame.

TI Comparing perceived effects of climate-related environmental change and
   adaptation strategies for the Pacific small island states of Tuvalu,
   Samoa, and Tonga
SO ISLAND STUDIES JOURNAL
AB Inhabitants of Pacific small island states are facing multiple socio-ecological pressures, with climate change being one of the most prominent. Nevertheless, the agency of local stakeholders in decisions on how to adapt to climate-related environmental change has been largely underappreciated in the climate change sciences as well as in policy decisions. We, therefore, conducted a survey study in Tuvalu, Samoa, and Tonga, asking specifically how residents perceive their situation regarding climate-related challenges, what adaptation strategies they have devised and implemented, and what they expect of governmental and nongovernmental organisations in these efforts. In contrast to the common perception that Pacific small island states are primarily threatened by rising sea levels, residents' perceptions indicate that drought, cyclones and other flood-related problems pose a far more imminent danger. Our results suggest that further research on those perceived environmental changes is advisable to provide reliable data for scientific models and policy decisions.

TI Influence of climate change on concrete durability in Yucatan peninsula
SO CORROSION ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The environmental effects of global climate change (GCC) are becoming more evident. Nonetheless, efforts to document its effects on the durability of infrastructure are still limited. The present study used long term data (1961-2008) on temperature, relative humidity, precipitation and evaporation recorded in a tropical microclimate of the port of Progreso (Yucatan, Mexico) in order to detect climatic patterns associated to GCC. In addition, the authors analysed chloride profiles in concretes of different quality but of the same age (15 years) and exposed to the same microclimate. Results suggest the presence of environmental changes associated to GCC during the last 40 years, especially in terms of average and maximum temperature, which showed increases of 1 and 0.22 degrees C per decade respectively. Results also showed that seasonal and multiannual climatic cycles had an influence on the behaviour of the chloride profile of the studied concretes and thus on their durability.

TI Response and adaptability of mangrove habitats from the Indian
   subcontinent to changing climate
SO AMBIO
AB Mangroves, a predominant coastal habitat in the tropics, are constantly threatened by various anthropogenic pressures that are deteriorating the mangroves to a great extent. Global emissions of greenhouse gases are likely to raise the world temperature and the sea level at the rate of 0.3 degrees C and 6 mm 10 y(-1) by the year 2100. Mangrove habitats would be more vulnerable to climatic changes and resultant sea level rise (SLR) because of their unique location at the interface of the sea. By altering ecobiological processes, the intertidal and supratidal zones may extend further inland, resulting in changes in the existing ecological setup. The limitation of the landward margin would cause vertical rise, resulting in water-logging and ultimately killing the mangroves and dependent biota. The present document describes mangrove habitats and related issues from the Indian subcontinent in the context of climate variations and SLR, and recommends integrated long-term monitoring.

TI Multiscale Analysis and Prediction of Sea Level in the Northern South
   China Sea Based on Tide Gauge and Satellite Data
SO JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Under the influence of global warming, the problem of sea-level rise is becoming increasingly prominent. The northern part of the South China Sea (SCS) is low lying, with intense economic development, and densely populated. These characteristics make the region extremely sensitive to the consequences of rising sea levels. This study aims to reveal the trends of sea-level changes in the northern SCS and provide scientific insights into the potential flooding risks in low-lying areas. To achieve this, the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method is used to analyze the water level time series data from three tide gauges along the coast of Hong Kong. This analysis reveals the multidimensional change characteristics and response mechanisms of the sea level in the SCS. The findings reveal distinct seasonal, interannual, decadal, and interdecadal variations in sea-level changes. Furthermore, we explore the impact of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on sea-level changes in the study area, finding a 6-month lagged correlation between the sea level and ENSO. Spatially, the rate of sea-level change is faster in nearshore areas than in the open ocean and higher in the northern regions than in the southern regions. The Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA) method is employed to analyze the sea-level change time series, revealing long-range correlations and multifractal characteristics. In addition, we propose a sea-level prediction method that combines EEMD with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and conducts empirical research on sea-level changes in the northern South China Sea. The results indicate that the EEMD-LSTM model outperforms the standalone LSTM model in terms of predictive accuracy, effectively eliminating noise from signals and providing a valuable reference. In summary, this research delves into the multiscale characteristics and influencing factors of sea-level changes in the northern SCS, proposing an improved sea-level prediction method that integrates EEMD and LSTM. The findings lay the groundwork for evaluating the risks of sea-level rise in low-lying regions of the northern SCS and inform future response strategies.

TI Late Holocene Environmental Changes in a Sediment Core from Al-Kharrar
   Lagoon, Eastern Red Sea Coast, Saudi Arabia
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB This paper aims to reconstruct paleoenvironmental conditions and sea-level changes over the last 5500years. Multi-proxy investigations of sediment types, foraminiferal records, geochemistry parameters and paleotidal elevation changes were conducted on a short sediment core KHAR1 (225cm long) retrieved from the intertidal area of the Al-Kharrar Lagoon. The sediment age was determined using C-14 dating of marine mollusk shells. Results showed that two prominent warming events during AD 750-1500 and 1750-present and a cooling event during AD 1500-1750 were inferred from the variation of benthic foraminiferal composition in core KHAR1. Before 3000 BC interval, the core sediment was deposited under intertidal-subtidal conditions as indicated by the presence of terrestrial sediments (siliciclastic materials), a decrease in subtidal-deep species and a slight drop in the paleotidal elevation about 0.50cm below the present lowest astronomical tide (LAT). From 3000 to 750 BC, deep-lagoonal species such as S. costigera, T. trigonula, T. serrulata and S. communis dominated this interval and co-occurred with a decrease in coarse sand and an increase in muddy substrates, indicating a prevalence of subtidal environmental conditions during the deposition of this interval. With the beginning of the 1st millennium, symbiotic (epiphytic) species started to increase, reaching the highest abundances between AD 800 and 1500. This increase in symbiotic species during the AD 800-1500 interval coincided with a stepwise increase in sea level and may indicate the prevalence of seagrasses associated with the occurrence of warm water due to climate warming prevailed in/around the lagoon during the deposition of this interval that corresponds to the Medieval Warm Period' (MWP). The MWP was followed by cooler (arid) conditions of the Little Ice Age (AD 1500-1750), causing a decrease in the abundance of the epiphytic species S. orbiculus and P. planatus (up to 14%) and a drop in paleotidal elevations. After this, the modern warming conditions prevailed until the present day.

TI A proposed integrated multi-signature model for peritidal cycles in
   carbonates
SO JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH
AB A new integrated multi-signature model for meter-scale peritidal carbonate cycles presented here is relevant to the interpretation of these cycles in the stratigraphic record. Meter-scale shaflowing-upward (micro)facies cycles are the most common type of peritidal parasequence. Peritidal parasequences are a fundamental component of carbonate sequence stratigraphic models. However, the existence of meter-scale cycles in the geological record has been questioned owing to the failure to prove statistically the existence of these cycles using data on (micro)facies and stacking pattern taken from previous studies. Nevertheless, the shallowing-upwards (micro)facies interpretive template remains widely used to identify these cycles and parasequences.
   We propose that the sedimentary signatures of meter-scale peritidal cycles vary systematically during the various phases of an underlying 3rd-order relative sea-level cycle. Although during specific phases of a 3rd-order relative sea-level cycle meter-scale peritidal cycles may be characterized by shallowing-upward units (e.g., early transgressive systems tract), during other periods the stratigraphic signal of cyclicity may be more cryptic and complex, causing them to be overlooked (e.g., late transgressive systems tract and highstand systems tract). We also propose that there is a half-cycle phase shift in periods of deposition and the formation of drowning surfaces, relative to 4th- to 5th-order relative sea-level cycles, over the course of a 3rdorder relative sea-level cycle.
   These points have ramifications for defining parasequences and using stacking patterns to determine peritidal cycle periodicity. Specifically, parasequences defined using flooding surfaces identify sedimentary units that inconsistently partition 4th- to 5th-order relative sea-level cycles at different stages of a 3rd-order relative sea-level cycle. We propose testable, new physical stratigraphic signatures for identifying meter-scale cycles that have consistent genetic significance, each cycle recording a relative sea-level cycle characterized by a 4th- to 5th-order relative sea-level rise and fall. Meter-scale peritidal cycles are recorded by an ordered pattern of systematically varying (micro)facies signatures related to their position within a 3rd-order relative sea-level cycle. The integrated multi-signature model of meter-scale peritidal carbonate cycles we propose here may assist in explaining the apparently contradictory evidence both for and against their existence in the geological record. As a result of the detailed consideration in this paper of the nature of parasequences and their variations with 3rd-order relative sea-level changes, a redefinition of parasequence is required and one is presented here.

TI Impact of sea-level and climatic changes on the Amazon coastal wetlands
   during the late Holocene
SO VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY
AB Wetland dynamics in northern Brazil during the Holocene were studied by pollen analysis and AMS radiocarbon dating of three cores. Near the Amazon mouth region, covered mainly by primary Amazon coastal forest and herbaceous vegetation, the pollen record indicates the dominance of mangroves between 4800 and 1100 cal yr B.P. A contraction of the mangrove area and an expansion of herbaceous and fern vegetation occurred between 1100 and 750 cal yr B.P. The period between 750 and 200 cal yr B.P. is characterized by an expansion of mangrove and a decrease in herbaceous and fern vegetation. This trend continued until the present. On Atalaia Island, the sediment core indicates a period with poor pollen preservation between 830 and 630 cal yr B.P. Between 630 and 330 cal yr B.P., mangroves expanded. Later, up to 45 cal yr B.P., the mangrove area decreased and the herbaceous vegetation expanded. During the last hundred years, the relative sea-level rise most probably favored the mangrove expansion as far as the topographically highest sector on this island, while the herbaceous vegetation decreased. The pollen data from Agua Preta Lake indicate dry conditions, as reflected by the poor pollen preservation between 390 and 240 cal yr B.P. Between 240 and 60 cal yr B.P., restinga and Amazon coastal forest with palms dominated this region. For the last 120 years, the record indicates an expansion of the mangrove area. However, recent confinement of mangrove development to the topographically highest area, and the loss of mangrove areas on the lowest surfaces have led to a net loss of mangrove coverage during the last decades.

TI RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF RECENT CLIMATIC CHANGE IN NORTH-WEST AFRICA
SO PHYSIO-GEO
AB The following study aims to evaluate and understand the recent climatic trends and significant stationary breaks in Morocco, Mauritania, Senegal and the nearest ocean. It is therefore necessary to statistically analyze the annual evolution of the air temperature, the atmospheric pressure at sea level, the rainfall as well as the aeolian dynamic.
   The analyses bear out the climatic turning point since the 1970' s, which does not lead to homogenous trends. Thus, the Atlantic Ocean between latitudes 40 N and 14 N but also Morocco and Northern Senegal are getting warmer. However, Southeastern Mauritania seems to have a tendency to cooling. Moreover, the strengthening of sea level pressure is followed by a shift of the harmattan trade wind and by a strengthening of its eastern component.
   Paleoclimatic data highlight the difficulty to find significant similarities with the last major climatic changes (Holocene Climatic Optimum and the Last Glacial Maximum). The littoral and continental warming as well as the wind reversal remembers the early Holocene. However, increase rainfalls in recent years remain less significant. Besides, the strengthening of sea level pressure reveals a strengthening of the subtropical high, but also a weakening of the Saharan low.
   The climatic signal is therefore very difficult to understand focusing to his spatiotemporal easurement. Several m studies concerning other climatic parameters or past analogues are still required.

AB A Late Ordovician episode of remarkable biotic, climatic, sea level and facies changes, named here as the Middle Caradoc Facies and Faunal Turnover, took place in the Baltoscandian area. This paper presents an integrated overview of these changes in the critical middle Caradoc interval. Data are given on carbonate rock composition, distribution and grain-size composition of the siliciclastic material and the carbon isotopic composition of whole-rock carbonates in cores of Estonia and Sweden.
   The Middle Caradoc Facies and Faunal Turnover can be described as a succession of related environmental changes. The turnover began with a positive excursion in carbonate delta(13)C and continued with sea level changes that led to a sedimentary hiatus on the shelf and a change from carbonate-dominated to siliciclastic-dominated sedimentation in the basin. The turnover ended with an extinction event and associated microfaunal crisis.
   The middle Caradoc turnover in Baltoscandia is comparable to a similar succession of changes in North America. The turnover affected two palaeocontinents, and reflects a widespread, possibly global environmental change. Onset of glaciation on Gondwana and/or increased orogenic activity might have initiated the changes in ocean circulation and led to the initial carbon isotope excursion. The following sea level rise and faunal changes affected several different continents. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Deltaic and estuarine environments have been, and continue to be, some of the most rapidly changing environments. Those associated with the Sunda shelf generally receive large volumes of sediment and were characterised by a diverse and productive vegetation before much of it was cleared and converted for agriculture, silviculture or urban development. By contrast estuaries in northern Australia receive far less sediment supply, and record a much less modified pattern of landform change during the Holocene. Three periods of change are discussed: first, the long-term geological development and response of deltaic-estuarine plains to eustatic cycles of sea-level change, particularly postglacial sea-level rise to present; second, Holocene development of deltaic-estuarine environments, dominated by patterns of coastal progradation and distributary migration, under relatively stable sea level; and third, the impact of human modifications. These observations provide a framework within which response of the deltaic-estuarine environments to future, anticipated environmental change can be assessed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Luminescence dating of fluvial and coastal red sediments in the SE
   coast, India, and implications for paleoenvironmental changes and dune
   reddening
SO QUATERNARY RESEARCH
AB The Holocene and late Pleistocene environmental history of the teri ('sandy waste' in local parlance) red sands in the southeast coastal Tamil Nadu was examined using remote sensing, stratigraphy, and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating. Geomorphological surveys enabled the classification of the teri red sands as, 1) inland fluvial ten, 2) coastal teri and, 3) near-coastal teri dunes. The inland teri sediments have higher clay and silty-sand component than the coastal and near-coastal teri, suggesting that these sediments were deposited by the fluvial process during a stronger winter monsoon around >15 ka. The coastal teri dunes were deposited prior to 11.4 +/- 0.9 ka, and the near-coastal dunes aggraded at around 5.6 +/- 0.4 ka. We interpret that the coastal dunes were formed during a period of lower relative sea level and the near-coastal dunes formed during a period of higher sea level. Dune reddening is post deposition occurred after 11.4 +/- 0.9 ka for the coastal ten i dunes and after 5.6 +/- 0.4 ka for the near-coastal ten i dunes. Presence of microlithic sites associated with the coastal dunes suggest that the cultures existed in the region during 11.4 +/- 0.9 ka and 5.6 +/- 0.4 ka. (C) 2012 University of Washington.

TI Causal link between Quaternary paleoclimatic changes and volcanic
   islands evolution
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Giant landslides and resulting tsunamis represent the main geologic hazards linked to volcanic island evolution. From offshore and onland studies, flank failures have been identified around numerous islands, in most geodynamic contexts. However, the triggering conditions are still poorly understood and several causes may act simultaneously to reach a critical threshold. Here we show that most large volume (> 10 km(3)) landslides occur at glacial stages termination and we propose that a causal relationship between flank collapse of volcanic islands and global climatic changes has existed at least since 900 kyr. Moreover, ages reported here favour the hypothesis that major collapses occurred during the onset of glacial to interglacial transitions when sudden influx of melt water from polar ice caps causes rapid sea level rise. We propose that rapid sea level rise induces enhanced coastal erosion and sudden changes of pore pressure conditions within basal layers, which favour edifice failure.

TI The dynamic mechanism of sea level variations in the Bohai Sea and
   Yellow Sea
SO CLIMATE DYNAMICS
AB Sea level rise has important implications for coastal regions. In this study, seasonal and interannual variations of sea level in the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea (BYS) from 1993 to 2017 are investigated using the reanalysis product Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO). Sea level is comprised of two major components: steric sea level and ocean bottom pressure (OBP). On seasonal time scales, steric sea level and OBP have considerable contributions to the sea level variations in the BYS. The sea level in the deep water is dominated by steric sea level, while OBP controls the coastal sea level. Diagnostic analysis further suggests that the steric change is owing to temperature change. On interannual timescales, the contribution of steric effect is indiscernible, and OBP dominates the variability of sea level in the BYS. The seasonal and interannual variability of OBP is forced by wind-induced Ekman transport, and is closely related to the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) during wintertime. Moreover, Kuroshio modulates the interannual variability of sea level in the BYS via controlling water volume transport from the Pacific Ocean to the BYS. This study sheds light on the mechanism of sea level low-frequency variability in the BYS, and complements the dynamic processes along the coast.

TI Gravel barrier resilience to future sea level rise and storms
SO MARINE GEOLOGY
AB Globally, communities, ecosystems, and assets situated within the coastal zone will likely experience increased risk in the future owing to chronic and acute pressures associated with climate change and accompanying sea level rise. Gravel barrier islands represent an intermediate pathway between seaward hazards and vulnerable landward receptors and possess inherent morpho-sedimentary characteristics which allow coastal risk reduction functions. If gravel barriers are to be usefully and reliably integrated into broader coastal risk management strategies, there is a need to understand the extent to which these landforms are likely to remain resilient under future environmental conditions. Using the Blakeney Point Barrier System, southern North Sea, this study investigates the resilience of gravel barrier landforms to storm surge conditions under future sea level rise scenarios. Resilience is assessed through reference to barrier resistance, susceptibility to state change, persistence, and continued functional performance. Numerical modelling reveals that variable pre-surge barrier morphologies result in a spectrum of episodic resilience trajectories along the barrier frontage. This study also considers the role of humans in altering landscape resilience, demonstrating that previously managed barrier sections (through reprofiling to steepen and heighten the barrier) are more vulnerable to severe morphological change, and associated landward overtopping volume, compared to unmanaged barrier sections. This said, under moderate to high sea level rise, even unmanaged barrier sections failed to demonstrate resilience to storm surge forcing. Such insights help temper our expectations regarding the coastal erosion and flood risk reduction functions of gravel barriers in the face of global environmental change.

TI Understanding past climate variation and environmental change for the
   future of an iconic landscape - K'gari Fraser Island, Queensland,
   Australia
SO AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB The unique combination of landscapes and processes that are present and operate on Fraser Island (K'gari) create a dynamic setting that is capable of recording past environmental events, climate variations and former landscapes. Likewise, its geographic position makes Fraser Island sensitive to those events and processes. Based on optically stimulated luminescence dating, the records archived within the world's largest sand island span a period that has the potential to exceed 750 ka and contain specific records that are of extremely high resolution over the past 40,000 years. This is due to the geographic position of Fraser Island, which lies in the coastal subtropical region of Queensland Australia. Fraser Island is exposed to the open ocean currents of the Coral Sea on the east coast and the waters of Hervey Bay on its western margin and is positioned to receive moisture from the Indo-Australian monsoon, southeast trade winds and experiences occasional tropical and ex-tropical cyclones. We review literature that presents the current level of understanding of sea level change, ecological variation and environmental change on Fraser Island. The previous works illustrate the importance of Fraser Island and may link processes, environments and climates on Fraser Island with global records.

TI Movements of the future: environmental change, its affect on migration
   and policy responses
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE SOCIOLOGIE
AB As temperatures and sea levels rise, among other issues, environmental change is becoming an increasingly important driver of both internal and external migration across the globe. The loss of livelihood that these changes engender, and will increasingly cause in the coming decades, is forcing larger and larger numbers of individuals and groups to seek opportunities in other areas. As this phenomenon becomes more prevalent, it is imperative that communities, governments, NGOs, and other interested parties put in place policies to mitigate and adapt. This paper looks at the intersection of environmental change and migration. More specifically, it discusses the changing climate and environment and then looks at how this will, and already is, affecting migration patterns around the world. It then will provide a number of guiding principles for policymakers, academics, and others to think about when dealing with this issue.

TI A multiproxy palaeoecological record of Holocene lake sediments from the
   Rio Tapajos, eastern Amazonia
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB Two sediment cores up to 42 m in length were raised from the wide, deep, section of the lower Tapajos River, Amazonia, referred to as Lago Tapajos. These cores reveal a history of subtle environmental change that began with the formation of Lago Tapajos as sea level rose about 11,000 years ago. The sediments of the lake were deposited fairly quickly-at a rate of ca. 4 m per millennium and are uniformly fine grained, with low organic content. The fossil pollen record derived from these sediments reveals that forest surrounded this site throughout the Holocene. The largest change in the core took place between ca. 5500 and 4200 cal. years BP and reflects a transition from coarser to finer sediments. Coincident with the change in sediment is a slight transition in the pollen spectra with an increase in Poaceae abundance at the expense of the pioneer tree Cecropia cecropia. A tentative explanation is offered in which increased human activity, possibly spurred by climatic change, resulted in the formation of some local grasslands. However, despite the apparent actions of humans, there is no indication of basin-wide transformation of landscapes in this record. The Holocene persistence of forest as the dominant landscape matrix around Lago Tapajos is supported by low delta C-13 values and by the constant geochemistry and mineralogy of the lake sediments.

TI Holocene Paleoenvironmental Evolution of a Semi-Enclosed Shallow Aegean
   Basin: A Combination of Seismic Stratigraphy and Sediment Core Proxies
SO WATER
AB The island of Astypalea (Greece), known for its rich and pristine archeological sites, encompasses a semi-enclosed silled basin that has been very susceptible to global sea levels and regional climate changes due to its relatively modern shallow sill of 4.7 m water deep that connects the Vathy bay with the adjacent Aegean Sea. To identify the causal relationship between regional climate, sea-level trajectories, and environmental change and their potential impact on hominine habitats on the island, we investigated a high-resolution seismic profile together with sediment, stable isotope, geochemical, and biotic proxies retrieved from a marine sediment core (ASTC1). Our results show that the basin was once isolated, and a marine inundation occurred at around 7.3 ka BP, which is older than expected, based on global sea level reconstructions. The entire transition from isolation to full marine conditions was accomplished in three major phases: (1) non-marine isolated conditions between 9-7.3 ka BP, (2) semi-isolated hypersaline marsh and lagoonal conditions between 7.3 and 4.1 ka BP, and (3) semi-isolated shallow marine conditions of today (4.1 ka BP to present). High water alkalinity, elevated organic content, and heavier isotopic signals indicate relatively arid conditions in the region that favored Sr-rich carbonate precipitation within the 7.3-6 ka BP interval. On the other hand, freshwater biota, along with a high C-org/N ratio and lighter isotopic signal, showed wetter conditions, at least for the intervals 8-7.3 ka and 6-5.4 ka BP, in contrast to the aridification trend seen as 4.1 ka to present. Finally, the hominine habitat evolution at around 6 ka BP might be attributed to the wetter conditions and the freshwater source provided by the bay at that time.

TI Holocene relative sea level changes along the Seattle fault at
   Restoration Point, Washington
SO QUATERNARY RESEARCH
AB At a marsh on the hanging wall of the Seattle fault, fossil brackish water diatom and plant seed assemblages show that the marsh lay near sea level between similar to 7500 and 1000 cal yr B.P. This marsh is uniquely situated for recording environmental changes associated with past earthquakes on the Seattle fault. Since 7500 cal yr B.P., changes in fossil diatoms and seeds record several rapid environmental changes. In the earliest of these, brackish conditions changed to freshwater similar to 6900 cal yr B.P., possibly because of coseismic uplift or beach berm accretion. If coseismic uplift produced the freshening similar to 6900 cal yr B.P., that uplift probably did not exceed 2 m. During another event about 1700 cal yr B.P., brackish plant and diatom assemblages changed rapidly to a tidal flat assemblage because of either tectonic subsidence or berm erosion. The site then remained a tideflat until the most recent event, when an abrupt shift from tideflat diatoms to freshwater taxa resulted from similar to7 m of uplift during an earthquake on the Seattle fault similar to 1000 cal yr B.P. Regardless of the earlier events, no Seattle fault earthquake similar to the one similar to 1000 cal yr B.P. occurred at any other time in the past 7500 years. (C) 2000 University of Washington.

This sea level documentation lacks traces of a global sea level rise. This implies totally new perspectives for the future of Bangladesh. No longer are there any reasons to fear an extensive sea level inundation in the near future.

AB Bioclimatology plays a key role in the mitigation of climatic impacts on animal production. In and and semi-arid regions, high ambient temperature accompanied with scarcity of water affects significantly animal production to be about 2-4% of world meat, milk and egg production. General circulation models (GCMs) of climatic changes indicate that rising levels of greenhouse gases are likely to increase the global average surface temperature by 1.5-4.5 C over the next 100 years, raise sea-levels, amplify extreme weather events such as storms and hot spells, shift climate zones poleward, and reduce soil moisture. Farm animals will be affected directly and indirectly by these climatic changes resulting in a substantial reduction in meat, milk and egg production. Study of animal adaptation mechanisms and managerial techniques to alleviate the effect of extreme climates and climatic changes on animal will help in mitigation of climatic impacts on animal production. The aim is to discuss the bioclimatic factors causing necessity of farm animal adaptation as well as adaptive mechanisms to mitigate the impacts of climate on animal performance to overcome the gap between human demands and animal production.

TI The last interglacial sea-level record of Aotearoa New Zealand
SO EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
AB This paper presents the current state of knowledge of the Aotearoa New Zealand last interglacial (marine isotope stage 5, MIS 5, sensu lato) sea-level record compiled within the framework of the World Atlas of Last Interglacial Shorelines (WALIS) database. A total of 77 relative sea-level (RSL) indicators (direct, marine-limiting, and terrestrial-limiting points), commonly in association with marine terraces, were identified from over 120 studies reviewed. Extensive coastal deformation around New Zealand has prompted research focused on active tectonics, the scale of which overprints the sea-level record in most regions. The ranges of last interglacial palaeo-shoreline elevations are significant on both the North Island (276.8 +/- 10.0 to -94.2 +/- 10.6 ma.m.s.l., above mean sea level) and South Island (165.8 +/- 2.0 to -70.0 +/- 10.3 ma.m.s.l.) and have been used to estimate rates of vertical land movement; however, in many instances there is a lack of adequate description and age constraint for high-quality RSL indicators. Identified RSL indicators are correlated with MIS 5, MIS 5e, MIS 5c, and MIS 5a and indicate the potential for the New Zealand sea-level record to inform sea-level fluctuation and climatic change within MIS 5. The Northland Region of the North Island and southeastern South Island, historically considered stable, have the potential to provide a regional sea-level curve, minimally impacted by glacio- and hydro-isostatic adjustment (GIA) and reflecting near-eustatic fluctuations in a remote location of the South Pacific, across broad degrees of latitude; however, additional records from these regions are needed. Future work requires modern analogue information, heights above a defined sea-level datum, better stratigraphic descriptions, and use of improved geochronological methods.

TI Neolithic agriculture, freshwater resources and rapid environmental
   changes on the lower Yangtze, China
SO QUATERNARY RESEARCH
AB Analyses of sedimentary evidence in the form of spores, pollen, freshwater algae, dinoflagellate cysts, phytoliths and charcoal from AMS C-14-dated, Holocene-aged sequences provide an excellent opportunity to examine the responses of Neolithic agriculturalists in the lower Yangtze to changing environments. Evidence from two sites close to the southern margin of the Yangtze delta and separated by what is now Hangzhou Bay attests the critical importance to early attempts at food production of access to freshwater resources. More readily, if episodically, available freshwater resources during the early to mid-Holocene on the Hangjiahu plain may have encouraged an early reliance on rice-based agriculture, which in turn facilitated the accumulation of agricultural surpluses and cultural diversification. Cultural change was relatively attenuated and human population pressures possibly lower on the Ningshao plain, seemingly because of much more profound environmental impacts of variations in local hydrological conditions, and because predominantly saline conditions, associated with rising relative sea level, hampered the early development of irrigated agriculture. The evidence, although largely dating to the early and middle parts of the Holocene, provides a timely warning of the complexity of vulnerability to climate change-induced processes of agriculture, and indeed human activities more generally, on megadeltas in Asia.

TI Peat Accretion Histories During the Past 6,000 Years in Marshes of the
   Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, CA, USA
SO ESTUARIES AND COASTS
AB The purpose of this study was to determine how vertical accretion rates in marshes vary through the millennia. Peat cores were collected in remnant and drained marshes in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California. Cubic smooth spline regression models were used to construct age-depth models and accretion histories for three remnant marshes. Estimated vertical accretion rates at these sites range from 0.03 to 0.49 cm year(-1). The mean contribution of organic matter to soil volume at the remnant marsh sites is generally stable (4.73% to 6.94%), whereas the mean contribution of inorganic matter to soil volume has greater temporal variability (1.40% to 7.92%). The hydrogeomorphic position of each marsh largely determines the inorganic content of peat. Currently, the remnant marshes are keeping pace with sea level rise, but this balance may shift for at least one of the sites under future sea level rise scenarios.

TI Threshold response of Madagascar's littoral forest to sea-level rise
SO GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB Coastal biodiversity hotspots are globally threatened by sea-level rise. As such it is important to understand how ecosystems resist, respond and adapt to sea-level rise. Using pollen, geochemistry, charcoal and diatom records in conjunction with previously published palaeoclimatic records, we investigated the mechanism, interactions and ecosystem response and resilience of Madagascar's littoral forest to late Holocene sea-level rise.
   Sediment sequences were collected along the south-east coast of Madagascar in two adjacent habitats in Mandena; the highly diverse littoral forest fragment and species-poor Erica-matrix.
   We used a multi-proxy approach to investigate the relative influence of environmental changes on the littoral ecosystem. We reconstructed past vegetation and fire dynamics over the past 6500 years at two sites in the littoral forest using fossil pollen and macrofossil charcoal contained in sedimentary sequences. Alongside these records we reconstructed past marine transgressions from the same sedimentary sequences using geochemical analyses, and a salinity and drought index through the analysis of fossil diatoms.
   Our findings indicated that it was the synergistic effect of sea-level rise coupled with rainfall deficits that triggered a threshold event with a switch from two types of littoral forest (an open Uapaca forest and a closed littoral forest fragment) to an Erica-Myrica heath/grassland occurring in approximately less than 100 years. Resilience to sea-level rise differed in the two adjacent habitats, suggesting that the littoral forest fragment was more resilient to the impacts of sea-level change and aridity than the open Uapaca woodland.
   We demonstrated that the littoral ecosystem was influenced by late Holocene sea-level rise and climatic desiccation. While climate change-integrated conservation strategies address the effects of climate change on species distribution and dispersal, our work suggests that more attention should be paid to the impacts of interactive climatic variables that affect ecosystem thresholds.

TI The pattern of glaciation on the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland
SO GEOGRAPHIE PHYSIQUE ET QUATERNAIRE
AB The pattern of glaciation on the Avalon Peninsula has been established through study of geomorphic features, striations, and erratic provenance. Three phases in a continuum of glaciation are recognized. The initial phase involved the expansion of ice from several centres. Ice thickness and extent reached a maximum during the subsequent Phase 2 event, correlated with the Late Wisconsinan. Lowered sea level permitted the development of the St. Mary's Bay ice centre. Ice from the Newfoundland mainland coalesced with Avalon Peninsula ice in Placentia Bay, on the Isthmus, and in Trinity Bay. Rising sea level, triggered by the retreat of Laurentide ice in Labrador, resulted in destabilization of the St. Mary's Bay ice cap, marking Phase 3. Final deglaciation of the Avalon Peninsula began before 10,100 +/- 250 BP. The Avalon Peninsula ice caps were controlled by regional and hemispheric events, and by the response of the Laurentide glaciers.

TI A sea level equation for seismic perturbations
SO GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
AB P>Large earthquakes are a potentially important source of relative sea level variations, since they can drive global deformation and simultaneously perturb the gravity field of the Earth. For the first time, we formalize a gravitationally self-consistent, integral sea level equation suitable for earthquakes, in which we account both for direct effects by the seismic dislocation and for the feedback from water loading associated with sea level changes. Our approach builds upon the well-established theory first proposed in the realm of glacio-isostatic adjustment modelling. The seismic sea level equation is numerically implemented to model sea level signals following the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake, showing that surface loading from ocean water redistribution (so far ignored in post-seismic deformation modelling) may account for a significant fraction of the total computed post-seismic sea level variation.

TI Holocene Indian Ocean sea level, Antarctic melting history and past
   Tsunami deposits inferred using sea level reconstructions from the Sri
   Lankan, Southeastern Indian and Maldivian coasts
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB Holocene sea level change in the northern Indian Ocean was studied using geochemical and geophysical approaches. Molluscs were sub-sampled for radiocarbon dating from sediment cores retrieved from a south Sri Lankan coastal lagoon. They were then combined with previously published sediment core radiocarbon ages from the same lagoon. We observe a similar to 20-fold reduction in sedimentation rates at around 4 ka, attributed to a decrease in the rate of sea level rise. Previously reported radiocarbon ages based on total organic matter in the lagoon show remarkable agreement with our new dates suggesting stable and homogeneous sedimentation during the last 8 ka. Comparison of down core age trends of both data sets reveal that sediments are older than coeval molluscs, except for the horizons adjacent to the paleo Tsunami layers, indicating fresh and younger sediments are provided during Tsunami events, which could become a new proxy for identifying paleo Tsunamis. Compilation of previously reported sea level indicators from Sri Lanka, Southeastern. India and the Maldives, together with predicted sea level obtained from a glacio-hydro-isostatic adjustment model (GIA), suggest that 3-4 m of global sea level equivalent ice sheet melting occurred during the Mid Holocene due to the retreat of the Antarctic and/or Greenland ice sheets. Previous works suggests late Holocene (ca. 4 ka) climate anomalies in both the low and high latitudes. We suggest the low latitude climate anomaly, transmitted via atmosphere to the high latitude during the late Holocene, seems to have induced changes in polar ice sheets. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Impact of the Holocene sea-level changes in coastal, eastern and Central
   Amazonia
SO AMAZONIANA-LIMNOLOGIA ET OECOLOGIA REGIONALIS SYSTEMAE FLUMINIS AMAZONAS
AB Pollen records from six sites are summarised and compared to provide insights in Holocene changes in the Amazon coastal and lowland regions of northern Brazil. The hydrology of Amazonian wetlands, especially those in the eastern part of the Basin, is strongly influenced by the Atlantic sea-level. Rapid sea-level rise in the early Holocene stabilized at near modern levels at ca. 7500 C-14 yr B.P. Mangroves first occur in coastal sequences of northeastern Pari State about 7500 C-14 yr B.P. The arrival of the mangroves in the pollen sequences is taken as an indication of sea-level. The retreat of mangroves after about 6700 C-14 yr B.P. reflects a lower relative sea-level. The modem mangroves developed mostly between 4000 and 3500 C-14 yr B.P. or somewhat later at the present-day coastline.
   First impact of early Holocene sea-level rise in the Amazon Basin is found by the change of active to passive river systems between at ca. 8300 and 8000 C-14 yr B.P. Later, local Mauritia palm swamps developed along river margins in central and eastern Amazonia. The timing and length of this period differs and is probably related to the different location and topography of the rivers. It is suggested that the Mauritia palm swamp stage is a regional phenomenon for the whole low lying Amazon Basin. First vdrzea and igapo forests (seasonally inundated forests) developed at that time as well, but the area of this seasonally inundated forests was still small. The modem large extension of virzea and igapo forest areas is relatively young in age. In eastern Amazonia, marked increase of varzea/igapo forests is documented since 3120 C-14 yr B.P., especially since 2470 C-14 yr B.P., and in central Amazonia since 4070 C-14 yr B.P. and especially since 2080 C-14 yr B.P. The development of huge seasonally inundated areas must have had an important influence on the Amazonian water and carbon cycle and the regional climate in Amazonia.

TI The urban geology of Cairns, Queensland, Australia
SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
AB The urban geology of Cairns, on the northeast tropical coast of Australia, is dominated by Quaternary sediments. These sediments provide a record of sea-level change, alluvial and slope response to late Quaternary climatic changes and millennial scale occurrences of various natural hazards. Drying of climate and consequent retraction of rainforest into refugia just prior to and after the Last Glacial Maximum resulted in the construction of extensive high-level alluvial fans and slope deposits which were incised following the amelioration of climate during the early Holocene. The Holocene sea-level record of the region is best shown by coral micro-atolls which suggest that hydro-isostatic rebound following flooding of the continental shelf resulted in a sea-level fall of approximately 1 m since 5.5 ka. Coastal progradation following sea-level stabilisation at approximately 6 ka has occurred with the deposition of sandy beach ridges and cheniers on a mud substrate. These and other ridges on offshore islands along the Great Barrier Reef were likely a result of deposition by storm surge and waves during tropical cyclones. These millennial scale records highlight that extreme intensity tropical cyclones occur an order of magnitude more frequently than that suggested by the short (similar to 100 yr) historical record of tropical cyclones from the region.

TI Is coastal mean sea level rising faster than the global mean? A
   comparison between tide gauges and satellite altimetry over 1993-2007
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Based on a careful selection of tide gauges records from the Global Sea Level Observing System network, we investigate whether coastal mean sea level is rising faster than the global mean derived from satellite altimetry over the January 1993-December 2007 time span. Over this 15-year time span, mean coastal rate of sea level rise is found to be + 3.3 +/- 0.5 mm/yr, in good agreement with the altimetry-derived rate of + 3.4 +/- 0.1 mm/yr. Tests indicate that the trends are statistically significant, hence coastal sea level does not rise faster than the global mean. Although trends agree well, tide gauges-based mean sea level exhibits much larger interannual variability than altimetry-based global mean. Interannual variability in coastal sea level appears related to the regional variability in sea level rates reported by satellite altimetry. When global mean sea level is considered (as allowed by satellite altimetry coverage), interannual variability is largely smoothed out. Citation: Prandi, P., A. Cazenave, and M.

TI Climate-induced migration and conflict: what are the links?
SO CLIMATE CHANGE AND HUMAN MOBILITY: GLOBAL CHALLENGES TO THE SOCIAL
   SCIENCES
AB History tells us that humans are perfectly capable of adapting to a changing environment. The past ice ages are proof of the great adaptive capacity of our kind. Anthropogenic climate change will happen - and, if unabated - with catastrophic consequences. More extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and a hotter and drier climate are some of the predicted outcomes seriously affecting people's choice of where to live on an increasingly crowded planet. Climate-induced migration is not new, as already in the past people moved when faced by environmental change; but today, population densities have increased dramatically, and arable land has become more limited. Large cross-border streams of 'climate migrants' or 'environmental refugees' caused by tropical cyclones, associated flooding and landslides, droughts, and sea-level rise could trigger resource competition with violent outcomes in the receiving country or region. But can these claims be substantiated? This chapter examines different types of natural hazards relevant for climate-induced migration, and argues that without an analysis identifying the people most vulnerable to natural hazards (for example, where they live and how they are affected), it is difficult to access the conflict potential of climate-induced migration.

TI Holocene coastal vegetation changes at the mouth of the Amazon River
SO REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY
AB Wetland dynamics in the eastern Amazon region during the past 7000 years were studied using pollen, textural and structural analyses of sediment cores, as well as AMS radiocarbon dating. Four sediment cores were sampled from Marajo Island, which is located at the mouth of the Amazon River. Marajo Island is covered mainly by Amazon coastal forest, as well as herbaceous and varzea vegetation. Three cores were sampled from Lake Arari, which is surrounded by herbaceous vegetation flooded by freshwater. One core was sampled from a herbaceous plain located 15 km southeast of Lake Arari. Pollen preservation in the sedimentary deposits from this lake and from its drainage basin suggests significant vegetation changes on Marajo Island during the mid- and late-Holocene. Between 7328-7168 and 2306-2234 cal. yr BP, mangrove vegetation was more widely distributed on the island than it is today. During the past 2306-2234 cal. yr BP herbaceous vegetation expanded. Sedimentary structures and pollen data suggest a lagoon system until similar to 2300 cal. yr BP. The current distribution of mangroves along the Para littoral, together with the presence of mangrove pollen and the sedimentary structures of the cores, indicates greater marine influence during the mid-Holocene. This may be attributed to the association between the eustatic sea-level change and the dry period recorded in Amazonia during the early- and mid-Holocene, followed by a wet phase over the past 2000 years.

TI Holocene sea level dynamics drive formation of a large atoll island in
   the central Indian Ocean
SO GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
AB The impact of global environmental change on coral reef islands is uncertain with few studies having resolved the critical controls on island formation and change. Based on detailed, topographic surveys, sediment analysis and radiometric dating, we present a multi-phase model of the formation of a large inhabited reef island in the central Indian Ocean in response to Holocene sea level dynamics and transformations in reef development and reef ecology. The initial phase of island building occurred later than elsewhere reported in the Maldives, 2500-2100 years ago during the mid-Holocene sea level highstand. The island was able to support habitation shortly thereafter. Subsequent island expansion occurred as a consequence of relative sea-level fall and emergence of the reef platform that forced a transition in reef flat ecology and dominant sediment producers that contributed to island accumulation to the southwest. Small-scale sea level oscillations (+/- 0.8 m) over the past two millennia have driven periods of island accumulation, that intermittently reactivate geomorphic processes around the is-land shoreline. Significantly, the multiple phases of island development have occurred while the island has been continuously inhabited, demonstrating the adaptive capacity of the island community to multiple phases of change. Results highlight the complexity of reef island development and indicate that future physical trajectories will vary depending on not only relative sea level change, but how such changes modify water depth and wave regimes across reef surfaces, and changes in dominant sediment producers able to contribute to island building. This interrelationship differs between sites within and between reef regions and may account for currently expanding islands on reef surfaces.

TI Heightened storm activity drives late Holocene reef island formation in
   the central Pacific Ocean
SO GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
AB The impact of global environmental change on coral reef islands is uncertain, with few studies having resolved the critical controls on island formation and change. Based on detailed, topographic surveys, sediment analysis and radiometric dating, we present a multi-phase model of the formation of two reef islands in Jaluit atoll, Republic of the Marshall Islands. The initial phase of island building occurred 1300 years ago, later than elsewhere in the Marshall Islands and during a period of relative sea level fall from the mid-Holocene sea level highstand. Initial accumulation occurred as a consequence of relative emergence of the reef flat that forced a transition in reef flat ecology and dominant foraminifera sediment producers that contributed to island building. Distinctive sets of progradational ridges and their coarse sediment character provide evidence for the importance of extreme wave events in island expansion from an initial core. Expansion occurred in two principle phases, 650-350 years ago and 200 years ago to the present, each coincident with known phases of increased storminess in the central Pacific. Results highlight the complexity of island formation and show that future change will depend not only on sea level but storm processes that have been a major influence on island development over the past 650 years. Anticipated reduction in cyclogenesis in the southern Marshall Islands region suggests a near-future period of geomorphic stasis of the islands of Jaluit. An increase in cyclogenesis in the central Pacific and higher latitudes may enhance opportunities for storm-driven island accumulation events over the next century where coral growth is able to be maintained.

TI Global environmental change: The causes and consequences of disruption
   to biogeochemical cycles
SO GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
AB Since the Earth first came into existence environmental change has involved the redistribution of elements and compounds via biogeochemical cycles. Such cycles link the lithosphere, biosphere and atmosphere within reciprocal relationships. These relationships have been profoundly altered by human activity but remain reciprocal. Examples are given to illustrate the magnitude of anthropogenic perturbations to the global biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur. The major issues concern fossil fuel consumption which influences all three cycles, and agriculture which affects the carbon and nitrogen cycles in particular. Anthropogenic perturbations of these cycles has given rise to some of the most important environmental issues of the 1990s, notably global climatic change, acidification and cultural eutrophication. Policies and protocols to mitigate these problems indirectly represent efforts to manage biogeochemical cycles. In view of a likely 46 per cent increase in human population In the next three decades, biogeochemical perturbations will undoubtedly intensify, the impact of which will require increasingly close management. This will need to lake into account the interactions between the cycles.

TI Climatic and oceanological changes in the southwestern part of the Sea
   of Okhotsk during the last 94 kyr
SO PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
AB This paper presents the results of a study on a sediment core obtained from the southwestern part of the Sea of Okhotsk. By analyzing the diatoms in the sediment, along with the productivity proxy and ice-rafted debris data, we reconstructed the regional environmental and climatic changes occurring over last 94 kyr (sea-ice expansion, periods of active ice melting, and variations in marine plankton productivity). Local warming and cooling events occurring in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene periods, as well as transgressive-regressive fluctuations in the sea level, were documented. The shift in the relatively warm interglacial conditions to severe glaciation over 34 kyr ago that occurred in the studied area of the Sea of Okhotsk was reported for the first time. The time at which the La Perouse Strait opened, the Soya Current input began, and the establishment of modern hydrological conditions was approximately 5.6 kyr.

TI A review of the Delta Po evolution (Italy) related to climatic changes
   and human impacts
SO GEOMORPHOLOGY
AB Climate changes and sea-level rise are important issues, especially for deltas such as the Po Delta, Italy. The evolution of the Po Delta shows a succession in space and a superposition in time of complex environmental natural processes. During the last few centuries, anthropogenic action has played a major role. The formation of the Po Delta began about 2000 years ago and has undergone many phases of development. Between 1500 AD and 1600 AD, the Venetian technicians diverted the Po river course. With these interventions, the "Renaissance delta" was cut off from the hydraulic network and the "modern delta" began to form.
   Until the middle of the 20th century, progradation of the delta was noticeable due to the abundant sediment supply. In the following decades coastal erosion occurred, this was caused by the reduction of the solid supply of the Po, due to dam and barrier construction and to river bed excavation. These and other interventions (e.g. reclamation, methane extractions from superficial ground water table) have deeply modified the physical and ecological characteristics of the Po Delta.
   The morphological characteristics of the Po Delta make the largest Italian wetland particularly unstable and very fragile when subjected to human pressure. Furthermore, the delta evidences multiple threats that will probably be exacerbated in the following decades by the effects of expected climatic changes. Only the application of careful policies concerning coastal defence. flood mitigation, anthropogenic subsidence reduction and salt wedge intrusion control will allow reduction of the present or predicted negative effects. This paper reviews how natural and human factors have controlled the Po Delta through time and discusses management strategies taking into account the importance of the human factor and the potential effects of climatic changes.

TI CLIMATES AND ENVIRONMENTS OF THE HOLOCENE MEGATHERMAL MAXIMUM IN CHINA
SO SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES B-CHEMISTRY
AB Based on data from palynology, paleosols; paleolimnology, ice core, archeology, sea levels, etc., we reconstructed climates and environments of the Holocene Megathermal maximum (7.2-6.0 ka B. P.), particularly vegetation zones, temperatures, precipitation and sea-level fluctuations. Annual mean temperature during that period was estimated at 1 degrees C higher than today for South China, 2 degrees C higher for the Changjiang River Valley, about 3 degrees C higher for North China, Northeast China and Northwest China and up to 4-5 degrees C higher for southern Qinghai-Xizang Plateau. Relative winter temperatures increased much more than average annual temperatures. The centennial-scale warming was accompanied by the expansion of summer monsoon and recession of winter cold currents as well as northward and westward shift of vegetation zones, Higher lake levels registered in all inland lakes of Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Qinghai and Xizang indicated that precipitation increased to a certain extent. The Holocene highest sea level in East China about 1-3 m higher than today, occurred within 6.5 and 5.0 kaB. P. and sea water covered coastal areas of about 7X10(4) km(2), which was the Holocene greatest scope of transpression.

AB Since 1992, in order to obtain accurate and high frequency sea level variation data, the French Hydrographic Service, the SHOM, has installed a permanent sea gauge network in co-operation with certain French ports and some other agencies like the French National Geographical Institute (IGN).
   Today, 8 ports are equipped with the SHOM instrumentation and many other sites will be studied for possible installation The aim is to have obtained a complete coverage of the ports in metropolitan and overseas France by the year 2003.
   The accuracy and the permanency of sea level measurements interest the SHOM and its partners for many reasons. The first one is maritime safety (publication of tide tables and maritime charts). This is one of the missions of all the hydrographers around the world and a permanent subject of international co-operation,
   The SHOM is also a member of the Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS) program co-ordinated by the International Oceanographic Commission. The SHOM provides these necessary data to the international scientific community which studies the increase of the mean sea le, el and climatic changes.
   The national community is also interested in the statistical studies of the extreme sea levels-the positive and negative surges. These studies are a tool for the coastal and environmental managers who build new piers and ports but this kind of calculation needs long term observation.
   The technological solution chosen by the SHOM is digital technology linked with ultrasonic sensors. The digital tide gauge is equipped with a modem. The SHOM collects data every week and validates them Furthermore, the real time sea level data can be used by the port authorities to give users the necessary information and thus prevent any possible accident.
   The list of uses is not exhaustive and new areas appear, such as altimetry which relies on sea level observations. In the year 2003, the network will be made up of 24 digital coastal tide gauges.

TI Tropical island adaptations in Southeast Asia during the Last Glacial
   Maximum: evidence from Palawan
SO ANTIQUITY
AB Throughout the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene, humans adapted to significant climate and environmental change. One key region for investigating these adaptive strategies is Island Southeast Asia, where fluctuating sea levels led to dramatic changes in coastlines, vegetation and fauna. The authors present new data from the re-excavation of Pilanduk Cave on Palawan Island, Philippines. The results corroborate the results of earlier excavations that identified Pleistocene occupation of the site. Pilanduk shows evidence for specialised deer hunting and freshwater mollusc consumption during the Last Glacial Maximum. The results add to the evidence for the shifting foraging behaviours of modern humans occupying variable tropical environments across Island Southeast Asia.

TI Middle Pleistocene to Holocene geochronology of the River Aguas terrace
   sequence (Iberian Peninsula): Fluvial response to Mediterranean
   environmental change
SO GEOMORPHOLOGY
CT 6th International Conference on Geomorphology
CY SEP 06-11, 2005
CL Zaragoza, SPAIN
AB Our results from the River Aguas basin suggest that fluvial archives, travertine and slope deposits provide sensitive resolution records of environmental changes during the last 170 kyr. From the chronostratigraphic data sets we have established a model of middle and late Pleistocene river response for littoral basins on the southern Iberian Peninsula.
   U/Th and OSL dating indicate the major periods of travertine formation of the Alfaix travertine platform, which range from, 169 to 26 kyr. At least four incision events interrupted this aggradation period: between 167 and 148 kyr, between 148 and 110 kyr, around 95 kyr and at 71 kyr. Aggradation ceased after 26 kyr and incision occurred during OIS 2. Subsequently, the terraces T4a and T4b were deposited. OSL dating of the T4a channel deposit provides maximum ages of 28, 20 and 18 kyr. However, short climatic events, such as the Younger Dryas, produced two more river incision episodes during OIS 2.
   Nonetheless, for river systems influenced by tectonics, climate and sea-level changes it is difficult to assess the weight of each controlling factor. Regarding the three mechanisms of Pleistocene river dynamics in middle-size catchment areas of the littoral region of southeastern Spain, our results support the hypothesis that large scale tectonics triggered the general downcutting trend, whereas the main aggradation and incision phases occurred during periods of major sea-level changes. Over short-time scales the influence of climate variability, as documented by pollen records, plays a decisive role. Thus, the river responses to the three cyclic mechanisms operate at different time scales although synergetic processes should be considered with respect to the magnitude of abrupt incision/aggradation events.

TI Social vulnerability projections improve sea-level rise risk assessments
SO APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB Rising seas will impact millions of coastal residents in coming decades. The vulnerability of coastal populations exposed to inundation will be greater for some sub-populations due to differences in their socio-demographic characteristics. Many climate risk and vulnerability assessments, however, model current populations against future environments. We advance sea-level rise risk assessments by dynamically modeling environmental change and socio-demographic change. We project three scenarios of inundation exposure due to future sea-level rise in coastal Georgia from 2010 to 2050. We align the sea-level rise projections with five population projection scenarios of socially vulnerable sub-populations via the Hamilton-Perry method and the theory of demographic metabolism. Our combined fast sea-level rise and middle population scenarios project a near doubling of the population exposed, and a more than five-fold increase for those at risk (i.e., residing in a census tract with high social vulnerability) and most at risk (i.e., high social vulnerability and high exposure) compared to the same estimate based on 2010 population data, Of vulnerable sub-populations, women had the largest absolute increase in exposure for all scenario combinations. The Hispanic/Latinx population's exposure increased the largest proportionally under the fast and medium sea-level rise projections and elderly people's (65 +) under the slow sea-level rise scenario. Our findings suggest that for coastal areas experiencing rapid growth (or declines) in more socially vulnerable sub-populations, estimates based on current population data are likely to underestimate (or overestimate) the proportion of such groups' risk to inundation from future sea-level rise.

TI Rauk - A Forgotten Witness of Holocene Sea-level Change and Development
   of Baltic Rocky Coasts: A Pilot Geomorphological Study in Lergrav Raukar
   Field
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB The Holocene history of Baltic Sea evolution is definitely one of the most interesting and intriguing stories of environmental change in Europe. To date, the key information on changes in sea-level and shifts in the environment associated with climate fluctuations were found in coastal lakes, marshes and wide stripe of barrier-lagoon systems of southern Baltic. Only limited research was conducted along rocky coasts, so characteristic features for Baltic islands from Bornholm, through Oland, Gotland, Faro, Hiiumaa, Saarema to thousands of isles of Aland Archipelago. Among the most thrilling natural wonders found along Baltic coasts are rauks or raukars, unique limestone stacks-often with humanlike features-that tower above rocky shore platforms in northern Gotland and on Faro, Gotland's sister island. Raukar coasts are one of the greatest touristic attractions in Sweden and the mythical coastal landscape of northern Gotland and Faro had inspired many artists, including Ingmar Bergman. Surprisingly, what attracts tourists and artists, have been neglected by geomorphologists and those fascinating landforms still wait for detailed explanation of their origin and preservation. This paper provides insight into pilot geomorphological study of raukar coast in Lergrav, NE Gotland. Schmidt hammer rock tests were applied to characterize the degree of weathering of rock surface of well-preserved notches. The results of notch rock surface resistance and elevation above present sea-level are discussed with recent relative sea-level curves developed in the region.

TI Palaeodrainage on Marajo Island, northern Brazil, in relation to
   Holocene relative sea-level dynamics
SO HOLOCENE
AB A large area in northeastern Marajo Island, northern Brazil, has been characterized geomorphologically, applying information acquired from Landsat imagery. This study was combined with detailed sedimentologic analysis of continuous cores, which provided a record of depositional settings developed in this area through the Holocene. The results revealed well-preserved, meandering to anastomosed drainage networks of wide palaeochannels that were superimposed by a narrower palaeochannel system. In both cases, the sedimentary record consists of sands, heterolithic deposits and muds, locally rich in plant debris. The strata are organized into fining upward successions that reach approximately 18 m thick in the wide channels and 4 m thick in the narrow channels. Sedimentary features suggestive of a coastal location for the wider palaeochannels and reworking of sediments by tidal currents include the prevalence of well to moderately sorted, rounded to sub-rounded, fine- to medium-grained sands displaying foreset packages separated by mud couplets, suggestive of tidal cycles. The data presented herein point to a rise in relative sea level reaching the Lake Arari area during the early to late/mid Holocene. This event was followed by a relative sea level drop. Tectonics seem to have contributed to an overall lowering in relative sea level in the study area since the mid-Holocene, which does not follow the same pattern recorded in other areas along the northern Brazilian coast.

TI Middle Holocene marine flooding and human response in the south Yangtze
   coastal plain, East China
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB Coastal flooding catastrophes have affected human societies on coastal plains around the world on several occasions in the past, and are threatening 21st century societies under global warming and sea level rise. However, the role of coastal flooding in the interruption of the Neolithic Liangzhu culture in the lower Yangtze valley, East China coast has been long contested. In this study, we used a well-dated Neolithic site (the Yushan site) close to the present coastline to demonstrate a marine drowning event at the terminal stage of the Liangzhu culture and discuss its linkage to relative sea-level rise. We analysed sedimentology, chronology, organic elemental composition, diatoms and dinoflagellate cysts for several typical profiles at the Yushan site. The field and sedimentary data provided clear evidence of a palaeo-typhoon event that overwhelmed the Yushan site at similar to 2560 BCE, which heralded a period of marine inundation and ecological deterioration at the site. We also infer an acceleration in sea-level rise at 2560-2440 BCE from the sedimentary records at Yushan, which explains the widespread signatures of coastal flooding across the south Yangtze coastal plain at that time. The timing of this mid-Holocene coastal flooding coincided with the sudden disappearance of the advanced and widespread Liangzhu culture along the lower Yangtze valley. We infer that extreme events and flooding accompanying accelerated sea-level rise were major causes of vulnerability for prehistoric coastal societies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Effects of Middle-Late Permian sea-level changes and mass extinction on
   the formation of the Tieqiao skeletal mound in the Laibin area, South
   China
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
AB A skeletal mound is described for first time from a Middle-Late Permian succession that contains the Guadalupian-Lopingian (G/L) boundary at the Tieqiao section in the Laibin area, Guangxi Province, South China. The Tieqiao mound grew on a deep-water, south-facing carbonate ramp during the late Middle Permian. The mound features a range of grainstone-packstone to rudstone-floatstone facies together with sponge boundstone facies. Both sponges and algae acted as frame builders which colonised skeletal debris on the ramp and initiated mound growth. Diverse benthic biota comprising mound dwellers and constructors proliferated in the Tieqiao mound complex. The water depth changes recorded in the Tieqiao mound successions reflect the refined trajectory of global sea-level changes during the great regression at the end of the Middle Permian. The timing of sea-level lowstand coincides with disappearance of the Jinogondella granti conodont zone at Tieqiao. The change to sea-level rise pre-dated the G/L boundary. Growth and demise of the mound is interpreted to have been controlled by changes in sea-level. Abrupt disappearance of both body fossils and fossil fragments of leading fossil groups at Tieqiao is interpreted as the result of the G/L mass extinction rather than environmental change. The potential extinction horizon is 30cm above the G/L boundary at Tieqiao and also records a rise in sea-level. The regional fall in sea-level destroyed the Tieqiao mound, but the G/L crisis halted redevelopment of the mound in the earliest Late Permian. Most mound builders suffered severely the Lazarus effect of the G/L mass extinction.

TI The Impact of Climate Change on Mangrove Forests
SO CURRENT CLIMATE CHANGE REPORTS
AB Mangrove forests have survived a number of catastrophic climate events since first appearing along the shores of the Tethys Sea during the late Cretaceous-Early Tertiary. The existence of mangrove peat deposits worldwide attests to past episodes of local and regional extinction, primarily in response to abrupt, rapid rises in sea level. Occupying a harsh margin between land and sea, most mangrove plants and associated organisms are predisposed to be either resilient or resistant to most environmental change. Based on the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) forecasts, mangrove forests along arid coasts, in subsiding river deltas, and on many islands are predicted to decline in area, structural complexity, and/or in functionality, but mangroves will continue to expand polewards. It is highly likely that they will survive into the foreseeable future as sea level, global temperatures, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations continue to rise.

TI Holocene palaeoenvironmental changes in three lagoons on the Algarve
   coast of Portugal
SO PALAEOBIODIVERSITY AND PALAEOENVIRONMENTS
AB Three sediment cores from neighbouring estuaries along the Portuguese Algarve coast were analysed for the comparison of grain-size distribution, geochemical composition and microfossil associations. The goal of this study is to reconstruct the environmental evolution of the estuaries. Our reconstructions based on foraminifera and ostracods reveal several distinct chronological stages, including the initial situation of the palaeo-valleys, the ingression of the sea into the river mouths at about 7500-8000 cal BP in the Quarteira and So Louren double dagger o estuaries and 8000 cal BP in the Carcavai estuary, and the silting-up following the sea-level high stand after 6500 cal BP until the present.

TI Predicting effects of environmental change on a migratory herbivore
SO ECOSPHERE
AB Changes in climate, food abundance and disturbance from humans threaten the ability of species to successfully use stopover sites and migrate between non-breeding and breeding areas. To devise successful conservation strategies for migratory species we need to be able to predict how such changes will affect both individuals and populations. Such predictions should ideally be process-based, focusing on the mechanisms through which changes alter individual physiological state and behavior. In this study we use a process-based model to evaluate how Black Brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) foraging on common eelgrass (Zostera marina) at a stopover site (Humboldt Bay, USA), may be affected by changes in sea level, food abundance and disturbance. The model is individual-based, with empirically based parameters, and incorporates the immigration of birds into the site, tidal changes in availability of eelgrass, seasonal and depth-related changes in eelgrass biomass, foraging behavior and energetics of the birds, and their mass-dependent decisions to emigrate. The model is validated by comparing predictions to observations across a range of system properties including the time birds spent foraging, probability of birds emigrating, mean stopover duration, peak bird numbers, rates of mass gain and distribution of birds within the site: all 11 predictions were within 35% of the observed value, and 8 within 20%. The model predicted that the eelgrass within the site could potentially support up to five times as many birds as currently use the site. Future predictions indicated that the rate of mass gain and mean stopover duration were relatively insensitive to sea level rise over the next 100 years, primarily because eelgrass habitat could redistribute shoreward into intertidal mudflats within the site to compensate for higher sea levels. In contrast, the rate of mass gain and mean stopover duration were sensitive to changes in total eelgrass biomass and the percentage of time for which birds were disturbed. We discuss the consequences of these predictions for Black Brant conservation. A wide range of migratory species responses are expected in response to environmental change. Process-based models are potential tools to predict such responses and understand the mechanisms which underpin them.

CL Texas State Univ, San Marcos, TX
HO Texas State Univ
AB Geomorphic system resilience is often perceived as an intrinsic property of system structure and interactions but is also related to idiosyncratic place and history factors. The importance of geographical and historical circumstances makes it difficult to generate categorical statements about geomorphic resilience. However, network based analyses of system structure can be used to determine the dynamical stability (= resilience) based on generally applicable relationships and to determine scenarios of stability or instability. These provide guidelines for assessing place and history factors to assess resilience. A model of coastal wetlands is analyzed, based on interactions among relative sea level, wetland surface elevation, hydroperiod, vegetation, and sedimentation. The system is generally (but not always) dynamically unstable and non-resilient. Because of gradients of environmental factors and patchy distributions of microtopography and vegetation, a coastal wetland landscape may have extensive local variations in stability/resilience and in the key relationships that trigger instabilities. This is illustrated by a case study where dynamically unstable fragmentation is found in two nearby coastal wetlands in North Carolina's Neuse River estuary-Otter Creek Mouth and Anderson Creek. Neither is keeping pace with relative sea level rise, and both show unstable state transitions within the wetland system; but locally stable relationships exist within the wetland systems.

TI Variation of sediment magnetic properties and their paleoenvironmental
   implications in Yangtze River Delta during 30-50 ka BP
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
AB Identifying the variability in and driving forces of relative sea-level (RSL) change in the Yangtze River Delta during 30-50 ka B.P. is vital for understanding global climatic and RSL changes. In this study, the environmental magnetism of sediments in the Yangtze River Delta was systematically studied for the period 30-50 ka B.P. based on the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates. Detailed magnetic measurements, including hightemperature kappa-T, magnetic hysteresis loop, isothermal remanent magnetization acquisition, and demagnetization curve measurements illustrate that the predominant magnetic contribution of core YZ07 is from magnetite, with a small contribution from hematite. Detrital input may be the primary source of magnetic minerals according to the chi/chi(fd)% and chi(ARM)/chi correlations. In addition, the positive relationship between chi and the RSL curve indicates that chi is a valid indicator of RSL change. Additionally, comparing chi, RSL curves, and delta O-18 dates of the stalagmites demonstrated that climatic change influenced the RSL change, which mainly affected the concentration of magnetite. The results are conducive for understanding the response mechanism of magnetic indicators to relative sea-level change, and provide a scientific basis for encouraging for future work in understanding climate variability.

TI Sea-level fall implicated in profound societal change about 2570 cal yr
   BP (620 BC) in western Pacific island groups
SO GEO-GEOGRAPHY AND ENVIRONMENT
AB During the warmest time of the last 10 000 years (Holocene Thermal Maximum), approximately 6000-4000 cal yr BP in the western Pacific, sea level is known to have reached as much as 2.1 m above its present mean level before declining subsequently. Records throughout the region show that sea level fell an average 0.7 m in the period 3500-2000 cal yr BP during which the earliest (culturally distinct) period of human occupation occurred in five western Pacific island groups [Bismarck Archipelago (Papua New Guinea), Fiji, Mariana Islands, New Caledonia, Vanuatu]. In the interest of testing whether there is evidence for climate forcing of cultural change in this region, dates are presented for the archaeologically conspicuous termination of early-period settlement in these island groups which show that it ended in each around 2570 cal yr BP. From the contemporaneity of this, it is argued that sea-level fall was the principal driver of this cultural transformation, forcing coastal peoples who had previously depended (largely) on foraging from nearshore-marine ecosystems to reconfigure their subsistence economy, something that invariably involved moving their settlements to places where horticulture and agriculture could be practiced more successfully. This research provides an example of where insights into causation of cultural change can be gleaned from comparing precise chronologies of human occupation to equally precise palaeoclimate chronologies.

TI Unravelling the microfacies signatures of parasequences using
   computer-optimized similarity matrices
SO SEDIMENTOLOGY
AB The microfacies of a Lower Cretaceous carbonate drillcore from Oman are characterized using optimizing matrices of Jaccard's similarity coefficients of community. Other than systems tract boundaries, there is no obvious evidence of individual parasequences in the core. However, diagnostic patterns in microfossil distribution identify environmental gradients recording changes in water depth. These gradients are used to define individual parasequences, parasequence sets, stacking patterns and key surfaces. The patterns suggest that deposition was controlled by successive fourth- to fifth-order (high-frequency) relative sea-level cycles superimposed on an underlying third-order relative sea-level rise. Although the correlation of these depositional subunits to systematic changes in water depth and the rate of carbonate accumulation alone is not incontrovertible proof of such a sea-level control, concurrent multiorder relative sea-level cyclicity provides by far the most likely explanation. A microfacies deposited when the water depth was shallowing is characterized by a relay of microfossils with affinities that shallow upwards. Conversely, a microfacies that records a gradual increase in water depth has a relay of microfossils with affinities that deepen upwards. Microfacies characterized by an assemblage of microfossils with similar affinities record deposition when the benthic environmental conditions remained stable, either because of an equilibrium between shallow water carbonate deposition and rising sea level, or in deeper water where sediment composition was relatively insensitive to changes of water depth. Microfacies characterized by mixed affinity assemblages record syndepositional reworking. During periods of embedded multiorder sea-level changes, individual parasequences within systems tracts are shown to record more complex environmental gradients than simply the repetition of successive shallowing-up units as traditionally represented in carbonate sequence stratigraphic models. The microfacies of an individual parasequence may shallow up, or may record both deepening-up and shallowing-up depositional phases, as well as periods of sedimentation when benthic environments remained stable. Individual parasequence boundaries may be submarine or subaerial unconformities, or be conformable, as part of a predictable stratigraphic pattern related to the temporal position of an individual parasequence within the underlying third-order cycle of relative sea-level change. The hitherto ubiquitous use of assemblages to describe carbonate microfacies, coupled with the widespread use of the metre-scale shallowing-up template to identify parasequences, may have led to such complexities previously being overlooked.

TI Relating environmental change and species stability in Late Ordovician
   seas
SO GFF
AB Niche stability of a diverse suite of 21 invertebrate species and genera from the Cincinnatian Series (Katian Stage) of North America was examined using spatial distribution modeling across nine time slices, including abiotic and biotic environmental change. Niche stability varied through time. The focal taxa exhibited niche stability (=no adaptive response) and tracked their preferred environment laterally to accommodate gradual sea-level fall. Niche evolution increased during the Richmondian Invasion. Species adjusted to the introduction of new competitors by contracting their niche into a subset of their previous niche parameters. In Cincinnatian species and genera, adaptive response (stability vs. evolution) was related to the tempo and mode of environmental change.

TI Controls on cyclostratigraphy of Lower Cretaceous carbonates and
   evaporites, Cupido and Coahuila platforms, northeastern Mexico
SO JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH
AB The Lower Cretaceous Cupido (Barremian-Aptian) and Coahuila (Albian) carbonate platforms of northeastern Mexico exhibit thick successions of meter-scale cycles deposited in three unique paleoenvironmental settings. (1) The Cupido shelf lagoon is composed of peritidal carbonate cycles deposited in the protected lee of a reef-rimmed to barrier-shoal margin. (2) The restricted Coahuila ramp interior consists of cyclic alternations of subtidal evaporites and peritidal carbonates. (3) The deep-water parts of both the Cupido and Coahuila platforms are composed of foraminiferal wackestones and lime mudstones interspersed with firmgrounds and hardgrounds in a "cyclic" arrangement. Vertical successions of meter-scale evaporitic cycles and peritidal cycles exhibit systematic stacking patterns that build into intermediate-scale high-frequency sequences (tens to hundreds of meters thick), and large-scale composite sequences (hundreds of meters thick) that can be correlated across the Cupido and Coahuila platforms. These large-scale stacking patterns are interpreted to reflect long-term accommodation events and, when combined with the scale-independent architecture of all genetic units, permit the inference that all three meter-scale cycle types on the Cupido and Coahuila platforms are also governed by relative sea-level change.
   The composition, thickness, and number of meter-scale cycles within individual high-frequency sequences can be highly variable across the Cupido and Coahuila platforms, however, even though the overall upward-shallowing patterns are evident. The lateral complexity of cycle architecture and distribution is interpreted to be a natural response to fluctuations in regional climate interacting with autogenic processes such as variations in carbonate production and dispersal, intensity and frequency of tropical storms and monsoons, thermohaline circulation patterns, and ambient ocean chemistry and temperature, These interacting processes created laterally variable physiographic and oceanographic conditions across the Cupido and Coahuila platforms, complicating the sedimentary record generated by the composite sea-level signal.
   Well-documented evidence from Barremian-Cenomanian pelagic cycles throughout the Tethyan seaway strongly indicates that Milankovitch-driven climatic changes operated during the Early Cretaceous, Contemporaneous shallow-marine cyclicity in several locations suggests that these climatic changes may have had globally widespread effects. In an effort to link the shallow-water and deep-water realms, we propose a model whereby Milankovitch-driven global climatic changes generated low-amplitude, high-frequency eustatic fluctuations through some combination of thermal expansion and contraction of ocean water, waxing and waning of small ice caps and alpine glaciers, and changes in the storage capacity of aquifers and lakes to produce meter-scale cycles across Lower Cretaceous shallow-marine platforms.

TI Impact of late Quaternary environmental changes on deep-sea benthic
   foraminiferal faunas of the Red Sea
SO MARINE MICROPALEONTOLOGY
AB Fluctuations in abundance, diversity and species composition of benthic foraminifera from two sites of the northern and southern Red Sea indicate strong variability of deep-sea ecosystems during the last four glacial to interglacial cycles. In total, five and four different benthic foraminiferal assemblages have been identified in the northern core and southern core, respectively. Comparison with recent faunas from the Red Sea and adjacent oceans allowed the reconstruction of temporal changes in deep-water ventilation, salinity and food availability at the seafloor. Generally, the abundance of infaunal and miliolid taxa increase during glacial intervals indicating increased organic matter fluxes, oxygen decrease and salinity increase in deep waters during these times. These fluctuations are attributed to enhanced oxygen consumption rates and temporarily reduced deep-water formation in the northern Red Sea during glacial intervals. The recorded environmental changes are a reflection of both high- and low-latitude climate changes. The northern Red Sea is mainly influenced by glacio-eustatic sea level fluctuations that control deep-water formation rates and by mid-latitude climate changes of the Mediterranean region that control surface productivity. In contrast, deep-sea ecosystem variability of the southern Red Sea is additionally influenced by low-latitude climate changes attributed to the NE monsoon intensity that drives the inflow of nutrient-rich surface waters from the Gulf of Aden. These results demonstrate the high sensitivity of deep-sea ecosystems of the Red Sea to both global and regional climate changes. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

TI Aeolianite and barrier dune construction spanning the last two
   glacial-interglacial cycles from the southern Cape coast, South Africa
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB The southern Cape region of South Africa has extensive coastal aeolianites and barrier dunes. Whilst previously reported, limited knowledge of their age has precluded an understanding of their relationship with the climatic and sea-level fluctuations that have taken place during the Late Quaternary. Sedimentological and geomorphological studies combined with an optical dating programme reveal aeolianite development and barrier dune construction spanning at least the last two glacial-interglacial cycles. Aeolianite deposition has occurred on the southern Cape coast at ca 67-80, 88-90, 104-128, 160-189 and > 200 ka before the present. Using this and other published data coupled with a better understanding of Late Quaternary sea-level fluctuations and palaeocoastline configurations, it is concluded that these depositional phases appear to be controlled by interglacial and subsequent interstadial sea-level high stands. These marine transgressions and regressions allowed onshore carbonate-rich sediment movement and subsequent aeolian reworking to occur at similar points in the landscape on a number of occasions. The lack of carbonates in more recent dunes (Oxygen Isotope Stages 1/2 and 4/5) is attributed not to leaching but to changes to carbonate production in the sediment source area caused by increased terrigenous material and/or changes in the balance between the warm Agulhas and nutrient-rich Benguela ocean currents.

TI Multi-decadal shoreline morphodynamics of a shelf-edge reef island,
   Great Barrier Reef: Implications for future island persistence
SO GEOMORPHOLOGY
AB Future climatic change and sea-level rise threaten the persistence of reef islands potentially making them unin-habitable over the next century. Improved understanding of island morphodynamics at multiple time scales is required for resolving major drivers of shoreline change and predicting future island resilience. Utilising 45 indi-vidually mapped shorelines, the morphodynamic change of a shelf-edge reef island (Raine Island, Great Barrier Reef) has been quantified over a 57-year time scale in the context of environmental change and anthropogenic impacts. Results show that between 1963 and 2020, there has been an average net shoreline movement (NSM) of -4.71 m and an average rate of retreat of -0.11 m/yr. However, only 23% of the shoreline has exhibited statistically significant erosion while the remaining 77% has remained stable. Importantly, data reveal a remark-able level of long-term shoreline stability despite large seasonal fluctuations in wind and wave climate, episodic storm events, and a regional sea level rise currently outpacing the global mean. Direct human impact, through modifications of the beach profile since 2014, have resulted in localised increases in rates of shoreline change but have only slightly decreased the proportion of stable shoreline (91% since modifications commenced versus 96% prior to modifications). Interestingly, there is a significant decreasing trend in island planform area over the 57-year period and especially over the last decade. However, the length of the observation interval between sam-pled shorelines has a strong effect on the change in planform area recorded over the interval, suggesting in-creased sampling frequency, rather than sea level rise, is a more likely cause of the decreasing trend. The findings of this study have direct implications for more accurate assessments of past, present and future shoreline change on reef islands. They also support the concept of 21st century island persistence in the face of climate change although the relative resilience of a given island to change (e.g., sea level, human modifications) will de-pend on a continuous adequate supply of sediment from organisms living on the surrounding reef, which may or may not be threatened in the future.

TI Stratigraphic records and variability of incised valleys and estuaries
   along French coasts
SO BULLETIN DE LA SOCIETE GEOLOGIQUE DE FRANCE
AB Some of the striking results of the papers published in the special publication "French Incised valleys, estuaries and lagoons" of the Bulletin de la Societe geologique de France are presented and compared. The selection of papers within this volume focuses exclusively on the recent progress made on modern French incised valleys, estuaries and lagoons around the coasts of France. Those papers together with abundant papers recently published on modern French incised valleys provide new insights for the knowledge on these sedimentary systems. The large amount of new results obtained is indebted to an extensive exploration within a large variety of estuaries, lagoons and coastal areas, from macrotidal tide-dominated, to microtidal wave-dominated, with also meso- to macrotidal mixed tide- and wave-dominated estuaries. These data allow comparing incised valleys within the same setting of tectonically stable and sediment starved margins, but showing contrasted conditions of hydrodynamics, sediment supply and bedrock control. At a stratigraphic level, sea-level variation is the main parameter controlling incised valley formation and sediment fill. The first-order controlling factor explaining the observed variations in valley fills is hydrodynamics. Three valley-fill categories are highlighted: tide-dominated, mixed tide-and-wave and wave-dominated, that match the classification based on hydrodynamics and morphology of present-day estuaries or lagoons. The second-order controlling factor explaining the observed variations in valley fills is the antecedent morphology of the bedrock, which in turn controls hydrodynamics and sediment supply. Finally, a promising result is the demonstration of the potential of incised valley fills to record high frequency environmental changes related to climate events and human activities.

SO CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN
AB delta(13)C of dolostones from the Wumishan Formation (1 310-1 207 Ma) in the Ming Tombs area near Beijing ranges from -1.5 to 1.5 parts per thousand (PDB), and generally, the delta(18)O ranges from - 4 to - 5 parts per thousand ( PDB). The secular variation of stable carbon isotopic compositions is cyclic, delta(13)C displays positive shifts from a sequence boundary to 1.5 per mil (PDB), then a negative shifts to - 1.5 per mil (PDB), In some unit, where delta(13)C values of the rocks are negative, they have relatively high delta(18)O values close to -4.0 parts per thousand (PDB), These characteristics of the carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions may be associated with sea-level changes.

The delta C-13 values of total organic carbon (TOC), which represent relative inputs of terrestrial (or freshwater) and marine organic sources, revealed a long-term increasing trend from -27.5 to -21.7 parts per thousand during the period between 10,000 and 3000 cal BP, suggesting an evolutionary series of fluvial-dominant to marine-dominant environments, coupled with weakened summer monsoon intensity. From 3000 cal BP to the present, the delta C-13(TOC) decreased gradually from -21.7 to -24 parts per thousand, indicating enhancement of freshwater input during this time. The observed long-term environmental change was divided into six stages based on the averages of the total sulfur content (TS%) and the organic carbon to sulfur ratio (C/S), proxies for paleosalinity. On multi-centennial to millennial timescales, higher C/S ratios and lower TS% were linked to higher delta C-13(TOC) values, indicating strong freshwater input at Stage 2 (similar to 8300-7400 cal BP), Stage 4 (similar to 4500-3300 cal BP), and Stage 6 (similar to 1100 cal BP to present). Strong freshwater discharge events synchronously occurred at 4300 cal BP and 3600 cal BP along the south coast of Korea. Further testing should be carried out in other East Asian coastal areas. This study suggests that sedimentary delta C-13(TOC) values and C/S ratios can be used in Asian coastal regions to trace past freshwater input events and summer monsoon intensity during relatively stable sea level periods (e.g., the middle to late Holocene).

SE Geological Society Special Publication
AB Quantitative analysis performed on latest Pliensbachian-early Toarcian calcareous nannofossil assemblages from the Camino section (Basque Cantabrian Basin) allowed their response to the environmental changes recorded during this time interval to be deciphered, characterized by an extinction event. The results were introduced within a principal component analysis and compared with the stable isotope and total organic carbon curves. During the latest Pliensbachian, the Mirabile and the lowermost part of the Semicelatum Ammonite Subzones, Schizosphaerella, Bussonius prinsii, Biscutum finchii, Calcivascularis jansae and Similiscutum avitum, taxa that probably thrived in rather cold waters, dominated the calcareous nannofossil assemblages. Coinciding with warmer and wetter conditions, which probably led to an increase in surface water fertility, recorded slightly below the extinction boundary, the mesotrophic taxa B. novum, L. hauffii and Calyculus spp. were dominant. Nevertheless, T. patulus and C. jansae, which became extinct just below the extinction boundary, show preferences for oligotrophic conditions. Salinities similar to those of modern oceans have been inferred around the extinction boundary, considering the coupling between the abundances of Calyculus spp. and the species richness together with the absence of black shales. After the extinction boundary, nannofossil assemblages were dominated by the deep-dwelling C. crassus and the shallow-dwelling Lotharingius species, interpreted as opportunistic taxa. This work confirms that calcareous nannofossils are a really useful tool for palaeoceanographic and palaeoenvironmental reconstructions, especially in terms of climatic changes.

TI Path Analysis of Sea-Level Rise and Its Impact
SO STATS
AB Global sea-level rise has been drawing increasingly greater attention in recent years, as it directly impacts the livelihood and sustainable development of humankind. Our research focuses on identifying causal factors and pathways on sea level changes (both global and regional) and subsequently predicting the magnitude of such changes. To this end, we have designed a novel analysis pipeline including three sequential steps: (1) a dynamic structural equation model (dSEM) to identify pathways between the global mean sea level (GMSL) and various predictors, (2) a vector autoregression model (VAR) to quantify the GMSL changes due to the significant relations identified in the first step, and (3) a generalized additive model (GAM) to model the relationship between regional sea level and GMSL. Historical records of GMSL and other variables from 1992 to 2020 were used to calibrate the analysis pipeline. Our results indicate that greenhouse gases, water, and air temperatures, change in Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheet mass, sea ice, and historical sea level all play a significant role in future sea-level rise. The resulting 95% upper bound of the sea-level projections was combined with a threshold for extreme flooding to map out the extent of sea-level rise in coastal communities using a digital coastal tracker.

SO TERRA NOVA
AB The expected climatic change resulting from global warming due to the greenhouse effect causes worldwide concern. The main consequences of such climate changes include rises in temperature and sea level, and the key role in predicting their impacts on an area falls to the earth scientist. Such a study should include the description of the present environmental physical parameters of the area, their behaviour and evolution under the induced climatic scenario and suggestions as to the action necessary to mitigate the impacts. Examples of two case studies from the Mediterranean, a deltaic lowland and an insular environment, are cited. These two case studies can serve as examples of 'Prognostic Geology'. The methodology followed can be applied to other coastal areas that will be affected by a sea-level rise.

TI Sequence Stratigraphy and Sea-Level Change
SO GEOLOGIC TIME SCALE 2012, VOLS 1 & 2
AB The history of stratigraphic correlation and the subdivision of geological time have long been associated with understanding changes in sea level. Sequence stratigraphy can be summarized as an attempt to subdivide sedimentary successions (either at the local basinal scale or at the global scale) into packages relating to changes in relative sea level. Such sequences, being rooted in time-stratigraphy, can, for example, be the basis for correlation and mapping of facies. There is a growing set of observations that demonstrate the synchronicity of some sea-level changes globally, leading to the establishment of global eustatic models. These, in turn, require an explanation for the driving mechanisms of eustatic change. Growing direct and proxy evidence suggests a link between climatic change and eustasy and hence the presence of glacio-eustasy, even in "greenhouse" times. There are strong links between sequence stratigraphy and the geological time scale. Sequence stratigraphic surfaces, especially correlative conformities, may form "natural boundaries" to stages and are associated with biostratigraphic events. Such an approach would mark a return to the criteria upon which stages were originally defined.

TI Discontinuity surfaces on a shallow-marine carbonate platform
   (Berriasian, Valanginian, France and Switzerland)
SO JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH
AB Discontinuities in sedimentation are commonly expressed as surfaces in outcrop sections and are due to rapid and substantial environmental changes, On shallow-marine carbonate platforms most such surfaces represent hiatuses below biostratigraphic resolution, and detailed analysis is necessary to identify and evaluate the environmental change involved. Surfaces in nine sections of the Lower Cretaceous of the French and Swiss Jura platform are characterized on the basis of eight universally applicable criteria (geometry, lateral extent, morphology, biological activity, mineralization, facies contrast, diagenetic contrast, and biostratigraphy), Nine different surface types are distinguished by their common features and environment of formation. All of them are related to environmental changes in the form of subaqueous erosion, subaerial exposure, subaqueous omission, or changes in texture and facies, The distribution of surface types in the studied sections shows that condensation and exposure-related surfaces tend to occur repetitively in certain intervals. Calibrated by biostratigraphy, these surface zones can be correlated across the platform from proximal to distal positions, In comparison with the global sequence-stratigraphic framework (Hardenbol et al, 1997) most exposure zones correlate with third-order sequence boundaries; condensation zones fall in between. In the studied sections, third-order eustatic sea-level drops appear to be represented rather by zones of small-scale discontinuities than by widespread and well-marked single sequence boundaries. This is explained by the superposition of high-frequency, low-amplitude sealevel fluctuations on a larger-scale sea-level trend under greenhouse conditions. The lateral extent of the surface zones varies through time and indicates important changes in platform morphology, Changes in local subsidence rate indicated by variable thicknesses of the deposits in comparison with second- and third-order sea-level trends suggest an evolution of the French Jura platform from a ramp-type morphology in the late Middle Berriasian to a flat-topped platform in the Late Berriasian, The Early Valanginian again is characterized by increased differential subsidence and well-marked platform morphology.
   This study demonstrates that:
   (1) small-scale and short-lived discontinuities can reflect large-scale variations of relative sea level;
   (2) on shallow platforms characterized by small topographic variations and lateral facies changes, third-order sequence-stratigraphic surfaces are not necessarily expressed by one widespread single surface, but by zones of surfaces indicating repeated environmental changes; surface zones can serve as an additional tool for correlation and interpretation of platform evolution; and
   (3) small-scale discontinuities form an integral part of the stratigraphic record and should receive the same attention as the sedimentary deposits they delimit.

AB Geochemical elements, significant indicator of environmental change, have been widely used in paleoenvironment research. By comparative analysizing of sediment's geochemical characterstics of core PJ and core ZX-1, almost opposite relations was found between them. In Holocene, there are repeated transgression-regression cycles and the deposition profile of core Pi was in the critical zone of transgression-regression. When climate was warm and humid, sea-level rose, the sedimentary environmental salinity increased and ability of element eluviate-leaching were weak, geochemical elements can not be effectively separated. On the contrary, when climate was dry and cold, sea-level became lower, the role of the element eluviate-leaching was enhanced, and different geochemical elements can be effective separated. This mechanism enables that indicators significance of core PJ's geochemistry element changing is the opposite direction to other regions.

TI River Deltas and Sea-Level Rise
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCES
AB Future sea-level rise poses an existential threat for many river deltas, yet quantifying the effect of sea-level changes on these coastal landforms remains a challenge. Sea-level changes have been slow compared to other coastal processes during the instrumental record, such that our knowledge comes primarily from models, experiments, and the geologic record. Here we review the current state of science on river delta response to sea-level change, including models and observations from the Holocene until 2300 CE.We report on improvements in the detection and modeling of past and future regional sea-level change, including a better understanding of the underlying processes and sources of uncertainty.We also see significant improvements in morphodynamic delta models. Still, substantial uncertainties remain, notably on present and future subsidence rates in and near deltas. Observations of delta submergence and land loss due to modern sea-level rise also remain elusive, posing major challenges to model validation.

TI Organic Carbon Deposition on the Inner Shelf of the East China Sea
   Constrained by Sea Level and Climatic Changes Since the Last
   Deglaciation
SO JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
AB The East China Sea (ECS), which is located in the transitional zone between land and ocean, is the main site for the burial of sedimentary organic carbon. Despite good constraints of the modern source to the sinking process of organic carbon, its fate in response to changes in climate and sea level since the last deglaciation remains poorly understood. We aim to fill this gap by presenting a high-resolution sedimentary record of core EC2005 to derive a better understanding of the evolution of the depositional environment and its control on the organic deposition since 17.3 kyr. Our results suggest that sedimentary organic carbon was deposited in a terrestrial environment before the seawater reached the study area around 13.1 kyr. This significant transition from a terrestrial environment to a marine environment is reflected by the decrease in TOC/TN and TOC/TS ratios, which is attributed to deglacial sea level rise. The sea level continued to rise until it reached its highstand at approximately 7.3 kyr when the mud depocenter was developed. Our results further indicate that the deposition of the sedimentary organic carbon could respond quickly to abrupt cold events, including the Heinrich stadial 1 and the Younger Dryas during the last deglaciation, as well as 'Bond events' during the Holocene. We propose that the rapid response of the organic deposition to those cold events in the northern hemisphere is linked to the East Asian winter monsoon. These new findings demonstrate that organic carbon deposition and burial on the inner shelf could effectively document sea level and climatic changes.

AB Changes in sea level observed at tide gauges are caused by actual changes in water level and by changes in elevation at the observing station. Recent research has focused on the relationship between climatic change and sea level, but vertical land movement can be just as important, particularly in subsiding sedimentary basins. The purpose of this study is to compare long-term rates of subsidence estimated from upper Pleistocene strata along the central Texas coast with historical subsidence rates from the same area obtained from geodetic surveys and tide gauge data. This comparison shows that historical subsidence rates are much greater than long-term averages and are equal or greater than actual sea-level change along the Texas coast south of Galveston Bay.
   Long-term (approximately 10(5) vr) subsidence rates were estimated by establishing the extent of marine, marine-influenced, and nonmarine strata within the upper Pleistocene Beaumont Formation in the Copano Bay area of the central Texas coast, and comparing the maximum elevation of in-place, marine-influenced deposits with published maximum sea level estimates of 5-8 m above mean sea level (MSL) from correlative, well-dated coral terraces from stable and uplifted areas. In-place, shell-bearing horizons deposited at or below sea level occur no higher than 2 m MSL in the Copano Bay area, suggesting that there has been no more than 6 m of subsidence since the probable time of deposition during the Sangamon interglacial at approximately 120 ka. The long-term, average subsidence rate for this part of the Texas coast is thus 0.05 mm/yr or less.
   Historical subsidence rates were obtained by: (1) calculating relative elevation changes between National Geodetic Survey first-order leveling surveys conducted in the early 1950s with those conducted in the late 1970s to early 1980s; (2) normalizing the relative elevation differences between surveys to annual rates of change relative to an arbitrarily chosen benchmark; (3) referencing these lines to sea level at three tide gauges; and (4) comparing calculated rates of relative sea-level (RSL) rise along the lines with estimates of eustatic sea-level (ESL) rise. Rates of RSL rise for the Texas coast south of Galveston Bay were generally 4-8 mm/yr; locally, rates were as high as 23 mm/yr. These rates are significantly higher than global averages of approximately 1 mm/yr. Much of the difference is probably caused by subsidence of the Texas coastal zone at rates of 1-22 mm/yr, or 20-440 times the long-term average of 0.05 mm/yr. The highest subsidence rates were found locally where there has been historical water-level decline in shallow aquifers. Lower subsidence rates of 3-7 mm/yr occur regionally where groundwater decline is minimal or nonexistent. Increased subsidence over the long-term average in these areas may be caused by pressure decline in underlying oil and gas reservoirs.

AB Regional sea level changes occur at different time scales. Global warming of the oceans, glacial and polar ice melting and meteorological or hydrological factors are major contributors to long-term sea level rise. In the recent years, a lot of attention has been paid to research concerning sea level change and seasonal fluctuations.
   The main objective of this paper was to determine the seasonal variability in the Baltic Sea level using satellite altimetry data for the period 1 January 2010 - 31 December 2014. The ANOVA analysis of variance was used in the research in order to estimate seasonal fluctuations.
   This study focused on investigate the monthly and annual amplitude in sea level anomalies over a given time period. The results from research showed that the amplitudes of fluctuations are the highest in winter and the smallest in summer in three analyzed points of the Baltic Sea.
   The results can bring valuable information about ongoing aspects in sea level changes, as a way of tracking climate change.

TI The history of water salinity in the Pearl River estuary, China, during
   the Late Quaternary
SO EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
AB This research reconstructed the Late Quaternary salinity history of the Pearl River estuary, China, from diatom records of four sedimentary cores. The reconstruction was produced through the application of a diatom-salinity transfer function developed based on 77 modern surface sediment samples collected across the estuary from shallow marine environment to deltaic distributaries. The statistical analysis indicates that the majority of sediment samples from the cores has good modern analogues, thus the reconstructions are reliable. The reconstructed salinity history shows the older estuarine sequence formed during the last interglacial was deposited under similar salinity conditions to the younger estuarine sequence, which was formed during the present interglacial. Further analysis into the younger estuarine sequence reveals the interplays between sea level, monsoon-driven freshwater discharge, and deltaic shoreline movement, key factors that have influenced water salinity in the estuary. In particular, a core from the delta plain shows the effects of sea-level change and deltaic progradation, while cores from the mouth region of the estuary reveal changes of monsoon-driven freshwater discharge. This study demonstrates the advantages of quantitative salinity reconstructions to improve the quality of reconstruction and allow direct comparison with other quantitative records and the instrumentally observed values of salinity.

TI Is the Red Sea Sea-Level Rising at a Faster Rate than the Global

SO REMOTE SENSING
AB Satellite altimetry sea-level data was taken for nearly three decades (1993-2020) and is used to understand the variability and associated dynamics in the Red Sea sea-level. Seasonally, the sea-level is higher during December-January and lower during August, with a consistent pattern from south to north. The interannual fluctuations in sea-level have a close agreement with the variability in the global climate modes, i.e., El-Nino Southern Oscillation events, East Atlantic-West Russian oscillation, and the Indian Ocean Dipole. The impact of the El-Nino Southern Oscillation mode on sea-level is higher than other climate modes. The Red Sea sea-level was seen to rise at a rate of 3.88 mm/year from 1993-present, which was consistent with the global rate of 3.3 +/- 0.5 mm/year. However, a noticeably faster rate of 6.40 mm/year was observed in the Red Sea sea-level from 2000-present.

TI The multi-millennial Antarctic commitment to future sea-level rise
SO NATURE
AB Atmospheric warming is projected to increase global mean surface temperatures by 0.3 to 4.8 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial values by the end of this century(1). If anthropogenic emissions continue unchecked, the warming increase may reach 8-10 degrees Celsius by 2300 (ref. 2). The contribution that large ice sheets will make to sea-level rise under such warming scenarios is difficult to quantify because the equilibrium-response timescale of ice sheets is longer than those of the atmosphere or ocean. Here we use a coupled ice-sheet/ice-shelf model to show that if atmospheric warming exceeds 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius above present, collapse of the major Antarctic ice shelves triggers a centennial-to millennial-scale response of the Antarctic ice sheet in which enhanced viscous flow produces a long-term commitment (an unstoppable contribution) to sea-level rise. Our simulations represent the response of the present-day Antarctic ice-sheet system to the oceanic and climatic changes of four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) from the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(3). We find that substantial Antarctic ice loss can be prevented only by limiting greenhouse gas emissions to RCP 2.6 levels. Higher-emissions scenarios lead to ice loss from Antarctic that will raise sea level by 0.6-3 metres by the year 2300. Our results imply that greenhouse gas emissions in the next few decades will strongly influence the long-term contribution of the Antarctic ice sheet to global sea level.

TI Multi-scale, integrated approaches to understanding the nature and
   impact of past environmental and climatic change in the archaeological
   record, and the role of isotope zooarchaeology
SO JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS
AB Climatic change, and associated environmental changes, are key challenges facing the world today, and are altering the future of our planet and its inhabitants. Climatic and environmental shifts also had profound effects on human societies in the past, and archaeology has a key role in helping us understand how humans, animals and the broader ecosystem responds and adapts to environmental change. Understanding human-environmental interactions on local, regional, and global scales is therefore not only a key part of better understanding the past, but also for informing the present. A significant area to explore is the palaeoecology of archaeologically-important prey-species, both as a means of more accurately reconstructing ancient landscapes and ecosystems, but also for better understanding past human activity, landscape use and faunal resource exploitation. New biomolecular approaches, and particularly isotope zooarchaeology, have enhanced our ability to reconstruct past ecosystem dynamics, paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic conditions, and the economic strategies that humans used to cope with them. However, the integration of multiple lines of evidence and methodologies remains the most powerful approach towards studying environmental change, resilience and adaptation in the past, not only for the benefit of archaeologists but other specialists. This special section of Journal of Archaeological Science Reports draws together papers using a range of methodologies to understand past human interactions with their environments, from Alaska, to Coastal Brazil, Europe and beyond. Studies are on a range of scales, from individual sites to big data, multi-site analyses, and encompass periods from Palaeolithic to the Middle Ages. Given the multi-faceted nature of the human past, archaeologists need to use a broad range of datasets to best understand environmental change and its impact on humans and animals. By drawing on inter-disciplinary specialisations and working alongside experts from other fields it will be possible to gain a more integrated and complete understanding of the ecological, economic, social and cultural effects of climatic and environmental changes on past populations.

TI Younger Dryas sea level and meltwater pulse 1B recorded in Barbados reef
   crest coral Acropora palmata
SO PALEOCEANOGRAPHY
AB The Younger Dryas climate event occurred during the middle of the last deglacial cycle and is marked by an abrupt shift in the North Atlantic polar front almost to its former glacial position, trending east to west. Using high-precision and high-accuracy U-Th-dated Barbados reef crest coral, Acropora palmata, we generate a detailed sea level record from 13.9 to 9000years before present (kyrB.P.) and reconstruct the ice volume response to the Younger Dryas cooling. From the mid-AllerOd (13.9kyrB.P.) to the end of the Younger Dryas (11.65kyrB.P.), rates of sea level rise decreased smoothly from 20mmyr(-1) to 4mmyr(-1), culminating in a 400year slow stand before accelerating into meltwater pulse 1B (MWP-1B). The MWP-1B event at Barbados is better constrained as beginning by 11.45kyrB.P. and ending at 11.1kyrB.P. during which time sea level rose 142m and rates of sea level rise reached 40mmyr(-1). We propose that MWP-1B is the direct albeit lagged response of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets to the rapid warming marking the end of the Younger Dryas coinciding with rapid warming in the circum-North Atlantic region and the polar front shift from its zonal to meridional position 11.65kyrB.P. As predicted by glaciological models, the ice sheet response to rapid North Atlantic warming was lagged by 400years due to the thermal inertia of large ice sheets. The regional circum-North Atlantic Younger Dryas climate event is elevated to a global response through sea level changes, starting with the global slowdown in sea level rise during the Younger Dryas and culminating with MWP-1B. No meltwater pulses are evident at the initiation of the Younger Dryas climate event as is often speculated.

TI The specific vulnerability of plant biodiversity and vegetation on
   Mediterranean islands in the face of global change
SO REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB The numerous Mediterranean islands (> 10,000) are very important from a biodiversity point of view, both in term of plant species (numerous endemics, presence of 'climate relicts') and of ecosystems' assemblage. These patterns can be explained by complex interactions between a highly heterogeneous historical biogeography and ecological processes related to diverse island conditions. Furthermore, most of the ups and downs of this biodiversity were closely linked with human pressures which have changed many times through the long socio-ecological history of these island landscapes since the Neolithic period. At present, insular plant biodiversity and rural landscapes are threatened by diverse global environmental changes related to urbanization, habitat fragmentation, unsustainable tourism and other practices (e.g. overgrazing, forest fires), and by other more recent drivers such as climate warming and aridification, sea-level rise and biological invasions. Some of these impacts will be exacerbated on islands because of no (or highly limited) adjacent areas of expansion, notably on the smallest ones (i.e. size < ca. 1000 ha). With regards to the biome crisis facing the Mediterranean basin and induced by human activities, islands constitute key ecological systems and 'current refugia' to ensure the long-term preservation of coastal plant biodiversity. They also represent fascinating ecological systems to disentangle the role of environmental versus human pressures on spatially simplified communities of the Mediterranean coastal areas. Future detailed studies of these 'natural island microcosms' could greatly improve our knowledge of the functional and evolutionary processes induced by rapid environmental changes in this region.

TI Development of the western Limfjord, Denmark, after the last
   deglaciation: a review with new data
SO BULLETIN OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF DENMARK
AB This paper presents new marine evidence of Lateglacial and Holocene environmental changes in the western part of Limfjorden, and provides a review of the geological history/development of this part of northern Jylland, Denmark. Lateglacial clay without fossils is widespread in the region and is probably a glaciolacustrine deposit. Limfjorden began to form as a strait in the Early Holocene due to rising relative sea level and the oldest marine shells are dated to c. 9300 cal. years BP. We propose a new relative sea-level curve for the region based on new and published data, which appear to confirm that the relative sea-level change was not extremely rapid, which was suggested earlier. During the Mid-Holocene a wide connection existed from the western part of Limfjorden to the North Sea in the west and more narrow connections existed between Limfjorden and Skagerrak in the north. The marine fauna included several species that indicate warmer and more salty waters than at present. Gradually, the connections to the North Sea and Skagerrak closed due to long-shore sediment transport and deposition of aeolian sand combined with a fall in the relative sea level during the Middle- to Late Holocene. During the Viking Age, 800-1050 CE (Common Era), the western connection to the North Sea was still open, but around 1200 CE it was closed by a coastal sandy barrier and the western part of Limfjorden became brackish. The coastal barrier was flooded on several occasions but soon formed again. After 1825 CE the western connection from Limfjorden to the North Sea has been maintained artificially.

TI Latest Campanian and Maastrichtian palaeoenvironmental changes:
   Implications from an epicontinental sea (SE Poland and western Ukraine)
SO CRETACEOUS RESEARCH
AB The Maastrichtian was a time of a high variability in the climate/ocean system. Most studies on Maastrichtian palaeoenvironment fluxes have been based on evidence from the open ocean realm or from outcrops in the Tethyan realm. We have investigated epicontinental carbonate-rich sediments of Maastrichtian age of the Lublin-Lviv Syncline (SE Poland and western Ukraine). Our study is focused on the population changes of planktonic foraminifers from 21 Maastrichtian outcrop successions and one borehole section. Quantitative and qualitative studies of planktonic foraminifers show long-term foraminiferal changes that make it possible to reconstruct climatic changes and a sea-level curve for the latest Campanian and Maastrichtian from the high-latitude epicontinental sea. A significant regression is inferred for the latest Campanian and earliest Maastrichtian. The highest sea level is noted in the earliest Late Maastrichtian. It coincides with a migration of the benthic and planktonic foraminiferal fauna that was probably triggered by a cooling episode. The cooler episodes correlated with a eustatic sea-level highstand during that time, suggesting that sea level was the most likely mechanism causing a change of global circulation; this temperature drop could be the cause of the mid-Maastrichtian event.

AB Chrono-sequences of paleosols buried under different mounds of the large Ipatovo Kurgan, constructed during the Bronze Age, have been studied to reconstruct climatic changes in the dry steppe zone of the Northern Caucasus, Russia. Abrupt climatic and environmental changes in the third millennium BC have been reconstructed, using morphological and analytical data of the soil. Based on accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dates of small charcoal fragments from the soil chrono-sequence, we concluded that two upper paleosols (with the clearest evidence of and pedogenesis) developed between about 2600-2450 BC.

TI ACCOMMODATION AND SUPPLY - A DUAL CONTROL ON STRATIGRAPHIC SEQUENCES
SO SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY
AB It is widely accepted that both eustatic and tectonically controlled regional changes of sea level have contributed to the record of stratigraphic sequences. I suggest that environmental change be added as a third, autonomous control. Sedimentologic principles clearly indicate that sequences and their systems tracts are controlled by the interplay of two rates -the rate of change in accommodation (space available for sedimentation) and the rate of sediment supply. Sea level has direct control on accommodation, but its influence on sediment supply is remote and easily overshadowed by environmental factors. For instance, the record of the most recent sea-level rise is a transgressive systems tract where supply is low; it is a prograding highstand systems tract in deltas where the supply is high. Examples of sequence boundaries generated by changes in sediment supply include tectonically driven shifts in sediment input into basins, changes in ocean currents, pulsating supply from failure of submarine slopes and drowning of carbonate platforms by environmental stress. Furthermore, the stratigraphic sequences in fluviatile continental basins are physically removed from sea-level induced changes in accommodation and must have formed by changes in the rate and pattern of supply.
   Subaerial exposure of marine sediments at the sequence boundary is a most important criterion for recognizing sea level cycles as opposed to supply cycles. Other criteria include downstepping of shelf breaks and characteristic patterns in the spacing of time lines within sequences. Some third-order cycles (ca. 0.5-3 Ma duration) meet these criteria, others do not. Cycle-stacking patterns and the shifting facies belts on cratons indicate that many second- and third-order cycles lack pronounced exposure unconformities and represent gradual changes superimposed on more rapid, shorter oscillations. Seismic data yield poor images of these gradational changes because they lack resolution. Seismic models of outcrops show that near the limits of resolution, the seismic tool tends to portray rapid changes in facies and bed thickness, i.e. lateral variations in supply, as unconformities. Seismic unconformities do not necessarily correspond to unconformities in outcrop.
   The succession of stratigraphic sequences is best considered a composite record of sea-level and environmental change. Separating the various controls requires carefully planned experiments. Work on the oxygen-isotope curve-another proxy for sea level-has set an example in this respect.

TI Post-glacial sea-level changes around the Australian margin: a review
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB It has been known since Rhodes Fairbridge's first attempt to establish a global pattern of Holocene sea-level change by combining evidence from Western Australia and from sites in the northern hemisphere that the details of sea-level history since the Last Glacial Maximum vary considerably across the globe. The Australian region is relatively stable tectonically and is situated in the 'far-field' of former ice sheets. It therefore preserves important records of post-glacial sea levels that are less complicated by neo-tectonics or glacio-isostatic adjustments. Accordingly, the relative sea-level record of this region is dominantly one of glacio-eustatic (ice equivalent) sea-level changes. The broader Australasian region has provided critical information on the nature of post-glacial sea level, including the termination of the Last Glacial Maximum when sea level was approximately 125 m lower than present around 21,000-19,000 years BP, and insights into meltwater pulse 1A between 14,600 and 14,300 cal. yr BP. Although most parts of the Australian continent reveals a high degree of tectonic stability, research conducted since the 1970s has shown that the timing and elevation of a Holocene highstand varies systematically around its margin. This is attributed primarily to variations in the timing of the response of the ocean basins and shallow continental shelves to the increased ocean volumes following ice-melt, including a process known as ocean siphoning (i.e. glacio-hydro-isostatic adjustment processes).
   Several seminal studies in the early 1980s produced important data sets from the Australasian region that have provided a solid foundation for more recent palaeo-sea-level research. This review revisits these key studies emphasising their continuing influence on Quaternary research and incorporates relatively recent investigations to interpret the nature of post-glacial sea-level change around Australia. These include a synthesis of research from the Northern Territory, Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia. A focus of these more recent studies has been the re-examination of: (1) the accuracy and reliability of different proxy sea-level indicators; (2) the rate and nature of post-glacial sea-level rise; (3) the evidence for timing, elevation, and duration of mid-Holocene highstands; and, (4) the notion of mid- to late Holocene sea-level oscillations, and their basis.
   Based on this synthesis of previous research, it is clear that estimates of past sea-surface elevation are a function of eustatic factors as well as morphodynamics of individual sites, the wide variety of proxy sea-level indicators used, their wide geographical range, and their indicative meaning. Some progress has been made in understanding the variability of the accuracy of proxy indicators in relation to their contemporary sea level, the inter-comparison of the variety of dating techniques used and the nuances of calibration of radiocarbon ages to sidereal years. These issues need to be thoroughly understood before proxy sea-level indicators can be incorporated into credible reconstructions of relative sea-level change at individual locations. Many of the issues, which challenged sea-level researchers in the latter part of the twentieth century, remain contentious today. Divergent opinions remain about: (1) exactly when sea level attained present levels following the most recent post-glacial marine transgression (PMT); (2) the elevation that sea-level reached during the Holocene sea-level highstand; (3) whether sea-level fell smoothly from a metre or more above its present level following the PMT: (4) whether sea level remained at these highstand levels for a considerable period before falling to its present position; or (5) whether it underwent a series of moderate oscillations during the Holocene highstand.

TI Ostracods as Recorders of Palaeoenvironmental Change in Estuaries
SO APPLICATIONS OF PALEOENVIRONMENTAL TECHNIQUES IN ESTUARINE STUDIES
SE Developments in Paleoenvironmental Research
AB Ostracods are microscopic, aquatic Crustacea with calcareous carapaces and are common components of estuarine ecosystems. The valves of ostracods are commonly preserved in sediment and thus can be very useful for reconstruction of palaeoenvironmental conditions. Utilising a combination of assemblage composition, ecophenotypy, taphonomy and shell chemistry (stable isotope and trace element), a great deal can be determined about estuarine formation and evolution, such as past salinity, water temperature, hydrochemistry, substrate characteristics and nutrient availability. Here, I provide an overview of how ostracods can be utilised in palaeo-studies of estuaries with examples that include hydrodynamic change, sea-level and climate variability, and the impact of pollution.

TI Recent global sea level acceleration started over 200 years ago?
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB We present a reconstruction of global sea level (GSL) since 1700 calculated from tide gauge records and analyse the evolution of global sea level acceleration during the past 300 years. We provide observational evidence that sea level acceleration up to the present has been about 0.01 mm/yr(2) and appears to have started at the end of the 18th century. Sea level rose by 6 cm during the 19th century and 19 cm in the 20th century. Superimposed on the long-term acceleration are quasi-periodic fluctuations with a period of about 60 years. If the conditions that established the acceleration continue, then sea level will rise 34 cm over the 21st century. Long time constants in oceanic heat content and increased ice sheet melting imply that the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates of sea level are probably too low.

TI Sequence stratigraphy after the demise of a high-relief carbonate
   platform (Carnian of the Dolomites): Sea-level and climate disentangled
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB Sedimentary fades analysis aided by quantitative 3D georeferenced field data is applied to constrain the sequence stratigraphy of a complex stratigraphic interval in the Late Triassic of the Dolomites. This multidisciplinary approach was the key to disentangle the timing of climatic change vs. sea-level fluctuation and their effects on shallow water carbonate depositional systems. The "Carnian Pluvial Event", a global episode of climate change worldwide documented at low latitudes, involved increased rainfall and possibly global warming. This climatic event begins before a drop of sea-level and caused the demise of microbial-dominated high-relief carbonate platforms that dominated the Dolomites region, and was followed by a period of coexistence of small microbial carbonate mounds and arenaceous skeletal-oolitic grainstones. A subsequent sea-level fall brought to the definitive disappearance of microbialites and shallow water carbonates switched to ramps dominated by oolitic-bioclastic grainstones. The crisis of early Carnian shallow water carbonate systems of the Dolomites generated a geological surface similar to a drowning unconformity, although no transgression occurred. As the high-relief microbial carbonate systems characterized by steep slopes switched to gently inclined oolitic-skeletal-siliciclastic ramps, basins were rapidly filled. The change of carbonate depositional systems was associated with an increase in siliciclastic input, in turn triggered by the onset of a humid climatic event and only later to a sea-level drop. This evolution of carbonate systems cannot be interpreted in the light of sea-level changes only: climate change, and consequent ecological changes in the main carbonate producing biotas, induced significant modifications in depositional geometries. This case study may serve as a conceptual model for the sedimentary evolution of carbonate systems subject to ecological crisis that do not evolve in platform drowning because, despite a drop in shallow water carbonate production, a combination of low subsidence and/or sea level drop maintains the platform top at shallow depth.

TI Holocene sea-level history of the northern coast of South China Sea
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB This study has collected and analyzed seven sediment cores from the Pearl River delta, from which 16 new and high-quality sea-level index points are generated using a new approach. This study has also re-checked and re-calibrated the previously published sea-level data from China's southeast coast with corrections made for tectonic subsidence and sediment compaction factors. These sea-level data indicate a rise of relative sea level from -49.3 +/- 0.8 m to the present height between 10,500 and 7000 cal. a BP. This sea-level history is similar to those recorded from other far-field locations and ice-volume equivalent sea-level models. The early to early-middle Holocene sea-level history in the study area shows a phase of accelerated rise at a rate increasing rapidly from 16.4 +/- 6.1 mm/a at 10,500 cal. a BP to 33.0 +/- 7.1 mm/a at 9500 cal. a BP. This phase was followed by a period of rapid decrease in the rate of sea-level rise to 8.8 +/- 1.9 mm/a at 8500 cal. a BP and 1.7 +/- 1.3 mm/a at 7500 cal. a BP. During the past 7000 years, the relative sea level in the study area changed very little. This new and complete history of Holocene sea level change supports the following findings: (1) no obvious higher-than-present sea-level highstand in the Holocene is found from the northern South China Sea; (2) certain proportion of the effects of the predicted glacial isostatic adjustment were cancelled out by the effects of the weak upper mantle viscosity in the study area; (3) meltwater pulse 1b likely exists spanning into the early Holocene; (4) there are significant misfit between sea-level data and glacial isostatic adjustment models, and a revision to the existing ice melting history for the early Holocene is possibly needed.

TI Tidal marsh sedimentation and resilience to environmental change:
   Exploratory modelling of tidal, sea-level and sediment supply forcing in
   predominantly allochthonous systems
SO MARINE GEOLOGY
CT 6th International Conference on Tidal Sedimentology
CY AUG, 2004
CL Univ Copenhagen, dept Geog, Copenhagen, DENMARK
HO Univ Copenhagen, dept Geog
AB The existence and function of tidally dominated and predominantly allochthonous marshes are ultimately contingent upon the operation of hydrodynamic and sedimentary processes within constraints imposed by the available accommodation space and sediment supply. This paper re-interprets published data relating to contemporary vertical marsh growth and sea-level rise in the context of the conceptual model relating elevation, sedimentation, sea-level rise, sediment supply and tidal range. This analysis is supported by numerical mass balance modelling of the equivalent parameter space and of the sensitivity of marsh hydroperiod and sedimentation to sea-level and sediment supply forcing. The effect of autocompaction on the translation of sedimentation into elevation change is also considered.
   Parameter space modelling provides a framework for the interpretation of field data and affords indicative insights into marsh resilience to change. It is argued that the assessment of marsh response to external environmental forcing should be based not on empirical comparisons of sedimentation versus sea-level rise but on the estimation of sediment supply, and the efficiency with which this is depleted by deposition, as metrics of marsh resilience. This implies a shift towards more intensive process studies aimed at elucidating more fully the linkages between tidal marshes and adjacent estuarine and coastal systems.
   Model results also indicate significant variability in marsh sedimentation associated with 18.6 yr tidal modulation and meteorological processes at short-term scales. Such variability further complicates the interpretation of sedimentation or elevation change data obtained from monitoring programmes of short duration. Longer-term monitoring is of value, however, as a means of identifying important mechanisms of climate and sediment supply forcing that may contribute to the formation and maintenance of marsh sedimentary sequences.

TI Sea level, biotic and carbon-isotope response to the Paleocene-Eocene
   thermal maximum in Tibetan Himalayan platform carbonates
SO GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
AB During the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, similar to 56 Ma), a large, negative carbon-isotope excursion (CIE) testifies to a massive perturbation of the global carbon cycle. Shallow-marine settings are crucial to understand the environmental and ecological changes associated with the PETM and the connection between continental and open-marine environments. Detailed sedimentological, paleontological, and geochemical analysis of a quasi-continuous succession of shallow-marine carbonates in the Tethys Himalaya of southern Tibet indicates that a relative rise in sea level coincided with PETM onset, continued through PETM core, and terminated with a regression at PETM recovery. At PETM onset, corresponding to the SBZ4/SBZ5 boundary, no obvious impact on biota and specifically on larger benthic foraminifera (LBF) is observed. The major biotic change occurs later on at PETM recovery, corresponding to the SBZ5/SBZ6 boundary. Our data suggest that relative sea level, rather than temperature, exerted the main control on benthic biota during the PETM. Although the delta C-13(org) values of organic matter are similar in the deep sea and shallow-marine continental margins, the delta C-13(carb) value of bulk carbonates are significantly C-13-depleted, which we attribute to environmental change driven by relative sea-level fluctuations.

TI Geological and climatic changes in quaternary shaped the evolutionary
   history of Calibrachoa heterophylla, an endemic South-Atlantic species
   of petunia
SO BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY
AB Background: The glacial and interglacial cycles that characterized the Quaternary greatly affected the distribution and genetic diversity of plants. In the Neotropics, few phylogeographic studies have focused on coastal species outside of the Atlantic Rainforest. Climatic and sea level changes during the Quaternary played an important role in the evolutionary history of many organisms found in coastal regions. To contribute to a better understanding of plant evolution in this environment in Southern South America, we focused on Calibrachoa heterophylla (Solanaceae), an endemic and vulnerable wild petunia species from the South Atlantic Coastal Plain (SACP).
   Results: We assessed DNA sequences from two cpDNA intergenic spacers and analyzed them using a phylogeographic approach. The present phylogeographic study reveals the influence of complex geologic and climatic events on patterns of genetic diversification. The results indicate that C. heterophylla originated inland and subsequently colonized the SACP; the data show that the inland haplogroup is more ancient than the coastal one and that the inland was not affected by sea level changes in the Quaternary. The major diversification of C. heterophylla that occurred after 0.4 Myr was linked to sea level oscillations in the Quaternary, and any diversification that occurred before this time was obscured by marine transgressions that occurred before the coastal sand barrier's formation. Results of the Bayesian skyline plot showed a recent population expansion detected in C. heterophylla seems to be related to an increase in temperature and humidity that occurred at the beginning of the Holocene.
   Conclusions: The geographic clades have been formed when the coastal plain was deeply dissected by paleochannels and these correlate very well with the distributional limits of the clades. The four major sea transgressions formed a series of four sand barriers parallel to the coast that progressively increased the availability of coastal areas after the regressions and that may have promoted the geographic structuring of genetic diversity observed today. The recent population expansion for the entire species may be linked with the event of marine regression after the most recent sea transgression at similar to 5 kya.

TI Patterns of Indian Ocean sea-level change in a warming climate
SO NATURE GEOSCIENCE
AB Global sea level has risen during the past decades as a result of thermal expansion of the warming ocean and freshwater addition from melting continental ice(1). However, sea-level rise is not globally uniform(1-5). Regional sea levels can be affected by changes in atmospheric or oceanic circulation. As long-term observational records are scarce, regional changes in sea level in the Indian Ocean are poorly constrained. Yet estimates of future sea-level changes are essential for effective risk assessment(2). Here we combine in situ and satellite observations of Indian Ocean sea level with climate-model simulations, to identify a distinct spatial pattern of sea-level rise since the 1960s. We find that sea level has decreased substantially in the south tropical Indian Ocean whereas it has increased elsewhere. This pattern is driven by changing surface winds associated with a combined invigoration of the Indian Ocean Hadley and Walker cells, patterns of atmospheric overturning circulation in the north-south and east-west direction, respectively, which is partly attributable to rising levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases. We conclude that-if ongoing anthropogenic warming dominates natural variability-the pattern we detected is likely to persist and to increase the environmental stress on some coasts and islands in the Indian Ocean.

AB An inventory is made of the effects of sea level rise and expected climatic change on the level of the district water authorities in the Netherlands and especially the "hoogheemraadschap" of Rhineland in the next 100-200 years.  Special attention is paid to the effects on land utilization, coastal defence and water control.
   The first is hard to describe by lack of research, the second can already be determined in terms of cost; the third can be described in its effects on brackishness and water provision with indication of policies and measures to be taken.
   Preliminary conclusions are that larger efforts on coastal defence - even with present techniques - will be a realistic answer in terms of cost.  The foreseen increase of brackishness in area and salt concentration, will give a significant extra need for fresh water.
   High cost and even higher risks have to be expected with regard to measures to neutralize the effects of a water surplus in winter and a growing water shortage in (late) summer, while the cost will further grow.  Because of the effect a larger area must be drained off and water has to be raised higher as the Netherlands will sink in relation to the North Sea.

AB Given the unquestioned impacts of recent/future environmental changes on human societies, it is reasonable to posit that past societal responses could be used as proxies of contemporaneous environmental forcing and might help identify the drivers of these, particularly where independent evidence of the effects of these events is inadequate. Such areas include Pacific oceanic islands for most of which there is evidence of a societal perturbation in the 14th and 15th centuries that saw the outbreak of region-wide conflict, abandonment of coastal settlements and the abrupt end of long-distance cross-ocean voyaging networks. The contemporaneity of these effects across a vast region requires a driver that is external to particular island groups with the only possibility that of oceanic origin, most likely large waves (tsunamis or storm surges) or rapid sea-level change. The explanation is less important than the principle that societal changes can be used as proxies for environmental activity.

TI The dynamics of a riverine civilization: a geoarchaeological perspective
   on the Nile Valley, Egypt
SO WORLD ARCHAEOLOGY
AB Egyptian civilization depended on the bounty of the River Nile. Frequent fluctuations in the height of summer floods influenced both floodplain geomorphology and the area cultivated. Thus agricultural yield oscillated as a function of pronounced interannual variability, as well as episodic variations in response to abrupt climatic changes in the watershed of the Nile tributaries. This situation also created a dynamic landscape and a variety of cultural responses depending on the specific cultural-historical circumstances. The aggradation of the floodplain has also influenced the recovery of archaeological remains. Predynastic settlement sites in the Delta are 4-6m below the surface and Graeco-Roman settlements are 1-2m deep. Subsidence of the Delta and sea-level change were responsible for pronounced changes in the geomorphology of the Delta, the distribution of waterways and hence trade.

AB Quaternary climato-custatic oscillations and tectonic movements result in base-level changes that modify the shape of fluvial systems. At the onset of the Holocene, NW European fluvial systems were deeply incised and comprised several terraces. Some terraces now lie beneath the estuary that formed in response to the Holocene sea-level rise.
   The macrotidal estuary of the Seine River is one example of that NW European fluvial valley evolution. Although the system has been CN tensively studied over the last 40 years, no study has drawn together all the research on its Holocene evolution. We gathered available data on five sites distributed across the system, in order to discuss that evolution and the related forcing factors. We have identified four main phases.
   (1) Prior to 6000 BC, there was a retrogradational shifting of the shoreline, where pre-Holocene topography and the sea level were the main forcing factors. Only depositional environments of low-elevated areas were affected by the influence of the sea-level rise, while the others were affected by climatic changes. (2) Around 6000-5000 BC, there was a maximum flooding event, where all depositional sites were affected by the influence of the sea-level rise. (3) Between 5000 and 1100 BC, there was an aggrading sequence, where tide and local hydrological conditions were the main forcing factors. The deposition record indicates that there were open tidal environments toward the sea, while landward peat accumulated. and was sometimes disturbed by tidal channel formation. (4) From 1100 BC, there was a progradational shifting of the shoreline, where human activity was the main forcing factor. Seaward environments at this time still indicate open-tidal conditions, while landward ones show: a return to elastic deposits related to floodplain deposition. All the C-14 data accumulated in the area should allow us to present a regional sea-level curve in the near future.

TI Negative sea level oscillation in Bahia Blanca Estuary related to a
   global climatic change around 2,650 yr BP
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB Bathymetric and side scan sonar surveys, sedimentological analyses and boreholes carried out in the external zone of Bahia Blanca Estuary, determined the regional presence of cohesive fine-stratified layers cropping out at depths of up to 17 in below the present mean sea level. Sedimentological and micropalaeontological studies carried out on the most representative core give evidence of an alternating environmental energy during deposition as it currently occurs in muddy tidal plains. The lower core section consists of sediments which are deposited in a restricted intertidal environment. The middle section represents an intertidal environment which is more strongly influenced by the action of tidal currents as it currently occurs in tidal flats in close relation with a channel system. The upper section shows the gradual passage to present conditions (strong tidal currents). The core lower section (C-14 63 50 yr B.P.) could have been deposited before the maximum Holocene transgression while its middle section (C-14 2460 yr B.P.) indicates the occurrence of an important negative mean sea-level oscillation that is correlated with evidence emerging from the coasts of southern Argentina and central-southern Brazil. The magnitude of this negative oscillation below the current sea level may be correlated with the worldwide climatic change that occurred around 2650 yr B.P. This suggests that the consequences resulting from relatively short perturbations in the global climate are more important than heretofore believed.

TI Holocene changes in the Douro estuary (Northwestern Iberia)
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB Holocene changes are recorded by sedimentology and palynology on a 20 in long core retrieved in the mouth of the Douro estuary (northwestern Portugal). Results show that the early Holocene (10720-6530 calibrated [cal] YBP) was characterized by a warm and humid climate as testified by a well-established Pinus-Quercus-Alnus regional forest. Shelf and slope foraminifera assemblages as well as echinoderms gradually increased toward the end of this period, reflecting the sea-level rise that occurred between 11500 and 6000 cal yr BP. A gravel barrier developed in the southern part of the estuary as a result of sea-level rise attenuation and strong hydrodynamisim of the river. A radical change from regional fluvially transported pollen assemblages (mainly composed of trees) to pollen spectra derived from local vegetation (mainly Ericaceae and Poaceae) occurred between 6530 and 1500 cal yr BP, contemporaneously to the settlement of the gravel barrier. This suggests that the northward migration of the river main channel, already testified by the existence of a palaeovalley with its axis located southward of the present main channel, occurred as early as 6530 cal yr BP.

TI Shoreline Response to Rapid 20th Century Sea-Level Change along the
   Iranian Caspian Coast
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB The Caspian Sea, the largest lake in the world, is characterized by rapid sea-level changes. This Provides a real physical model of coastal response to rapid sea-level change in a period of just a few years, which might take a millennium along oceanic coasts. Between 1929 and 1995, the Caspian sea level experienced the last cycle, with a range of +/- 3 m. This caused disastrous effects along the coast and destroyed many buildings, roads, farms, and other human property. During the preceding 48 years of sea-level fall, a large area of the sea bottom emerged, which was then used for the development of residential zones. That area had to be abandoned when sea level rose by almost 3 m in a period of 18 years. With the use of LANDSAT data, we calculated total shoreline shifts in 22 littoral cells, each cell containing three transects over a 3-km distance. Both landward and seaward shifts occur during rapid sea-level rise between 1977 and 2001.

TI Environmental changes on the west coast of the Gulf of Thailand during
   the 8.2 ka event
SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
AB The expression of the abrupt cooling of the 8.2 ka event in the tropics is poorly understood. In this study, we applied lithostratigraphy, loss on ignition, grain size and pollen analyses to sedimentary sequences from Thale Noi, which is located in the west coast of the Gulf of Thailand, in order to reconstruct the regional environmental history during the 8.2 ka event. Our results, based on sediment. This characteristics and pollen records, indicated that the study area was likely to have flooded prior to c. 8300 cal. a BP. The fall in sea-level coincided with a high precipitation, inferred from grain size, between c. 8250 and 8100 cal a BP. The increased precipitation can be attributed to the strengthening of the northeast (winter) monsoonal rains in the western Gulf of Thailand. The timing of the sea-level fall and strengthen stronger winter monsoon is consistent with the abrupt decrease in the temperature records emanating from the northern hemisphere. Subsequently, we observed a sea-level rise from c. 8100 to 7950 cal a BP, which potentially continued fill c. 7650 cal. a BP. The possibility of coastal erosion was detected by a hiatus in the sedimentary sequences dated between c. 7950 and 7650 cal a BP. Then, a standstill of the sea-level occurred from c. 7650 to 7100 cal a BP. This transgression is suggested to have caused coastal erosion that resulted in a hiatus in the sedimentation process between c. 7950 and 7650 cal a BP. Correspondingly, fluctuations in the monsoon strength resulted in an overall decreased precipitation from c. 8100 to 7450 cal a BP, although punctuated wet intervals were observed at c. 7950 and 7575 cal a BP.

TI An 800 year record of mangrove dynamics and human activities in the
   upper Gulf of Thailand
SO VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY
AB A multiproxy record comprising pollen, charcoal, loss on ignition and particle size analyses from two radiocarbon dated sediment cores from Klong Kone subdistrict on the western coast of the Gulf of Thailand provides insights on mangrove dynamics, environmental changes and human activities during the last 800 years. The mangroves were dominated by Rhizophora which indicates that the area has been influenced by the sea level from at least 820 cal bp until 720 cal bp. An intertidal area may have formed that supported mangrove development as part of an old shoreline during 820-720 cal bp. After 720 cal bp, mangroves decreased and were replaced by grasses, suggesting that a lower sea level caused the mangroves to grow closer to the sea until around 140 cal bp. Cereal pollen increased from 720 cal bp suggesting probable use of the shoreline for intensive cultivation. The mangroves were characterised by Avicennia, which increased toward the top of the 2 cores, suggesting that the mangroves then grew further inland, probably due to recent sea-level rise. Intensive human activity is recorded during the 20th century, as indicated by increased particle size, charcoal and carbonate content. At present, human activity in the area includes dams and construction as well as aquaculture.

TI Coastal multi-hazard vulnerability assessment along the Ganges deltaic
   coast of Bangladesh-A geospatial approach
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
AB It is ironic that countries that are least responsible for or insignificant contributors to global climate change, are in fact, the most susceptible to its harmful impact. The Ganges deltaic coast, one of the largest sediment depocentres with the 286 km long coastline of Bangladesh, faces potentially multi-hazard threat due to climatic change. This study attempted to develop a coastal vulnerability index (CVI) by using seven physical parameters namely: (a) geomorphology; (b) coastal slope; (c) shoreline change rate; (d) rate of sea level change; (e) mean tide range; (f) bathymetry; and (g) storm surge height. These variables are considered as relative risk parameters and integrated through geospatial techniques (i.e., remote sensing and GIS), and then ranked to estimate the degree of coastline vulnerability to sea level rise. The entire coastline is ranked in accordance with multi-hazard vulnerability and the results reveal that 20.1% of the shoreline (57.9 km of total coastline in the Ganges delta) is very highly vulnerable, whilst 17.5% of shoreline (50.0 km) is estimated to be highly vulnerable. In contrast, 21.5% of the entire shoreline (61.3 km) is moderately vulnerable, whereas approximately 56.6 km (19.7%) and 60.4 km (21.2%) of the total shorelines are in low and very low vulnerability categories, respectively. The results of the CVI are expected to provide a clear picture for predicting future recession of shorelines; hence the outcome of this study can be used as an important tool by coastal managers for developing sustainable resources management practices. Furthermore, this study also offers a framework for prioritizing actions to enhance a community's resilience or to assist in developing appropriate adaptive measures as part of disaster risk reduction initiative.

AB The trace-element chemistry of ostracod shells provides one of the most promising methods for palaeolimnological reconstruction. In this paper, molar Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios in shells of the ostracod Cypretta brevisaepta Furtos, 1934 were used to reconstruct the late Quaternary palaeolimnology of Wallywash Great Pond, a small freshwater coastal lake in Jamaica, Analyses of modern Jamaican ostracods were undertaken to establish molar distribution coefficients (K-D(M)'s) for this species (K-D(Sr) = 0.306 +/- 0.069; K-D(Mg) = 0.0142 +/- 0.0088). These values were used to reconstruct past levels of (Sr/Ca)(water) and (Mg/Ca)(water) for a 9.23-m lake-sediment core from Wallywash Great Pond. The results were coupled with previously-published stable-isotope (delta(18)O and delta(13)C) determinations on fine-grained calcite, to reconstruct the salinity, palaeohydrology and palaeo-productivity of the lake over the last 125 ka B.P. (10(3) calendar years before present). Three major highstands with slightly elevated salinity occurred during marine isotope stage 5, under elevated sea level and a humid climate. The lake dried out similar to 93.5 ka B.P. as sea level fell and the climate became drier. It refilled around 10.7 ka B.P. Three separate highstands during the Holocene were sustained by humid conditions and high relative sea level. Although there were small increases in salinity during the Holocene when sea level was close to the deepest part of the lake, significant saltwater intrusion appears to have been prevented by freshwater discharge from inland, Throughout the late Quaternary, the salinity of the Great Pond showed low absolute variations, from similar to 0.3 to similar to 0.6 parts per thousand. The long-term trends in lake level reflect both orbitally-induced changes in insolation and eustatic sea level. Water-level fluctuations during the Holocene, however, reflect climatic changes on the millennial timescale rather than orbital forcing or sea-level change.

TI The Holocene History of the Diatom Community in a Small Water Body on
   Shemya Island (Aleutian Arc, USA): The Influence of Global and Local
   Environmental Changes
SO WATER
AB A diatom analysis of a peat deposit from Shemya Island (Aleutian Arc, USA) is performed, and the dynamics of the diatom community are described. According to the radiocarbon dating, the formation of the deposit began 9300 cal. years BP. Principal component analysis made it possible to relate the dynamics of the diatom community to certain environmental conditions and the factors that influenced the coastal ecosystems during its formation. The following factors (predictors) were considered: the influence of age, zoo- and anthropogenic effects, and changes in climatic conditions. Sea level change was the main driver of the diatom community in the studied water body having a continuous direct and indirect influence on the studied small water body, i.e., by bird colony formation and more humid and coastal conditions. Since 3000-2000 cal. years BP, the anthropogenic factor (hunting depression of the bird colony) also became significant. During the whole water body lifetime and following peat formation, the diatom community was influenced by groups of factors: global factors (e.g., sea level rise) caused gradual change of local factors, which resulted in smooth shifts in community. In contrast, local factor influence (bird colony rise and fall due to human activity) caused abrupt and transient shifts. We can hypothesize that the relatively stable global environmental conditions in the Late Holocene were an auspicious background to see abrupt changes due to influence of the zoogenic and anthropogenic factors. We believe that further works on the material from other islands will make it possible to form a general picture of changes in the diatom communities in the Holocene and interpret it in connection with climatic changes in the region.

TI Paleo sea levels reconsidered from direct observation of paleoshoreline
   position during Glacial Maxima (for the last 500,000 yr)
SO EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
AB The drastic climatic changes which characterise the cooling trend of the last few million years of Earth history led to variations in eustatic sea level that had tremendous impact on the geology and ecology of continental margins. Reconstructing a sea-level curve back in time is not an easy task. Observations of shoreline positions are always a local measurement of Relative Sea Level that needs to be corrected from the effect of tectonic and thermal subsidence, sediment loading, compaction and glacio-hydro isostasy. Extensive studies have been done for the last deglaciation and for the last 100,000 yr cycle. But very few studies deal with position of sea level during earlier cycles, simply because conditions are very rarely favourable for the preservation of such witnesses. The shelf of the Golfe du Lion (Western Mediterranean) reveals a unique record of shoreline paleopositions during glacial maxima of at least the last five circa 100 kyr glacial/interglacial cycles. In fact it is the entire glacial deltaic lobe of up to 50 m thick (froth delta front or shoreface to prodelta) that has been preserved in place and which provides direct and independent constraints for relative sea-level minima. We measure a relative sea level of: -112m, -128, -134, -246 and -262 m for MIS 2, 6, 8, 10 and 12 respectively. After corrections taking into account postdepositional movement of strata (subsidence), we find, that sea level dropped to a depth of -102 +/- 6 m during the last three glaciations (MIS2, MIS6, MIS8) but reached exceptionally low values of more than -150 +/- 10 m during the preceding glaciations MIS10 and MIS12 at about 340 and 434 kyr BP. This general time framework and sedimentological interpretation has been confirmed by preliminary results from two deep drillings during the PROMESS cruise (July 2004), which validate our methodology. However, no detailed and absolute datings of such witnesses are available so far, so that we cannot prove that these levels are the lowest ever reached during each glacials, but they correspond undoubtedly to the last preserved shoreface before rapid sea-level rise. We also suggest that the abrupt change in sea-level maxima might be the overprint of 400 kyr orbital periodicity cycles. Last but not least, these results prove that the Golfe du Lion is indeed a unique laboratory to study paleoclimates and sea-level variations on a larger time scale. Further work is needed for a complete glacio-hydro-sedimento isostatic modelling of each sequence and each glacial to further constraint local sea level versus global sea level and quantify, in particular the relative effect of glacio-hydro isostatic effect (which differ according to ice sheet extend) but also of erosion-sedimentation isostatic effect (erosion on land and deposition on the outer shelf and slope).

TI Examining the potential impacts of sea level rise on coastal wetlands in

SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
AB The coastal wetlands of north-eastern New South Wales (NSW) Australia are increasingly being affected by anthropogenic factors such as urbanisation, residential development and agricultural development. However, little is known about their vulnerability to sea level rise as a result of climate change. The aim of this research is to predict the potential impact of sea level rise (SLR) on the coastal wetland communities. Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) was used to predict the potential impacts of sea level rise. Geographic Information System (GIS) was used for mapping and analysis. It was found that a meter rise in sea level could decrease coastal wetlands such as Inland fresh marshes from about 225.67 km(2) in February 2009 to about 168.04 km(2) by the end of the century in north-eastern NSW, Australia. The outcomes from this research can contribute to enhancing wetland conservation and management in NSW.

SO BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
CT International Seminar on the FINSKEN Project
CY NOV 27-28, 2002
CL Helsinki, FINLAND
AB This paper presents the rationale, methodology and results of the three-year FINSKEN project to develop global change scenarios for Finland in the 21st century. Scenario consistency was pursued by relating all scenarios to the same global driving factors of environmental change specified by the IPCC. Scenarios were constructed of socioeconomic development, climate, sea level, surface ozone exposure, and sulphur and nitrogen deposition. Both empirical and modelling approaches were used to develop scenarios. Linkages between scenario types were examined to improve scenario integration. Stakeholder dialogue was encouraged through a questionnaire survey, two project seminars, and face-to-face interviews. Two types of future world are described: a consumer-driven "A-world" and a community-minded "B-world". In the A-world there is strong economic growth in Finland accompanied by rapid increases in CO2 concentration, increased ozone pollution and nitrogen deposition, rapid climate warming, increased precipitation and a possible reversal from falling to rising sea levels. The B-world shows lower economic growth than the A-world, and less rapid increases in CO2 concentration, temperature and precipitation. After initial increases, ozone pollution and deposition are unlikely to exceed present levels and will probably be much lower by the end of the century. Sea levels in southern Finland either stabilise or continue to fall.

TI Holocene environmental changes in Red River delta, Vietnam as inferred
   from the stable carbon isotopes and C/N ratios
SO JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
AB The present study applied stable carbon isotopes, C/N ratios, and sedimentological indicators to reconstruct environmental changes during Holocene and to test the hypothesis that delta C-13 and C/N ratios are accurate proxies of sea level change in the Red River delta (RRD), Vietnam. A 36 m long sediment core was mechanically drilled in the wave-dominated region of the RRD. The covariation of lithological characteristics, sediment grain-size distribution and geochemical proxies (LOI, TOC, C/N, delta C-13) suggested that the sediment core could be divided into six depositional environments, consisting of sub-and inter-tidal flats (formed before 8860 cal. year BP), shelf-prodelta, delta front slope (formed from 8860 to 2290 cal. year BP), delta front platform, tidal flat, and flood plain (from 2290 to 0 cal. year BP). Covariation of delta C-13 and C/N ratios in the sediment core allowed for tracing the origin of sedimentary organic carbon, which shifted from the dominance of mangroves and C3 plants at the suband inter-tidal flats to marine phytoplankton at the shelf-prodelta and delta front slope. The sedimentary sources of the delta front platform, tidal flat and flood plain were a mixture of phytoplankton and C3 plants, with the later source being dominant.

SO FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
AB The sensitivity of magnetic properties, which characterize the mineralogy, concentration, and grain size distribution of magnetic minerals, to environmental processes may provide useful information on paleoenvironmental changes in estuarine environments. Magnetic property studies of estuaries are less common than other environments and, due to the west coast of South Korea having an abundance of estuaries, it provides a good place to study these processes. In this study, we analyzed a variety of magnetic properties based on magnetic susceptibility, hysteresis parameters, progressive acquisition of isothermal remanent magnetization and first-order reversal curve data from a Holocene muddy sediment core recovered from the Yeongsan Estuary on the west coast of South Korea. We examined diagenetic effects on magnetic properties and tested their availability as proxies of paleoenvironmental change. The presence of generally low magnetic susceptibility, ubiquitous greigite-like authigenic magnetic component, and very fine magnetic particle occurrence suggested that the analyzed sediments had undergone considerable early diagenetic alteration. Electron microscopic observations of magnetic minerals support this suggestion. Our results confirm that the use of initial bulk susceptibility as a stand-alone environmental change proxy is not recommended unless it is supported by additional magnetic analyses. We recognized the existence of ferromagnetic-based variabilities related to something besides the adverse diagenetic effects, and have examined possible relationships with sea-level and major climate changes during the Holocene. The most remarkable finding of this study is the two distinct intervals with high values in magnetic coercivity (B-c), coercivity of remanence (B-cr), and ratio of remanent saturation moment to saturation moment (M-rs/M-s) that were well coincident with the respective abrupt decelerations in the rate of sea-level rise occurred at around 8.2 and 7 thousand years ago. It is then inferred that such condition with abrupt drop in sea-level rise rate would be favorable for the abrupt modification of grain size distribution toward more single-domain-like content. We modestly propose consideration of the B-c, B-cr, and M-rs/M-s variability as a potential indicator for the initiation/occurrence of sea-level stillstand/slowstand or highstand during the Holocence, at least at estuarine environments in and around the studied area.

TI Theorizing (im)mobility in the face of environmental change
SO REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB The study of the relationship between environmental change and human mobility has largely focused on the movement of people as it is driven by environmental change with little regard for those who stay when faced with many of the same adverse conditions. An emerging body of work recognizes and seeks to understand the lack of migration, or immobility, in the contexts of environmental and climatic change, primarily through the notion of "trapped populations." Theoretically, however, our understandings of immobility in relation to environmental change are underdeveloped and oversimplified, and do not do justice to the diversity, dynamism, or unevenness of (im)mobilities. In order to advance knowledge, this paper connects knowledge from environmental migration studies to immobility in broader migration research. Although there is no silver theoretical bullet, it explores the strengths and weaknesses of three frameworks in explaining and understanding (im)mobility decision-making, patterns, and consequences: (1) the New Economics of Labour Migration; (2) the aspirations-(cap)abilities framework; and (3) the mobilities paradigm. In order to break away from both sedentary and mobility biases, it asserts that scholars should theorize and analyze the entire mobility spectrum in the face of environmental change, rather than considering immobility as a separate outcome.

TI Adapting to sea-level rise: Relative sea-level trends to 2100 for the
   United States
SO COASTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Global sea levels have slowly risen during this century, and that rise is expected to accelerate in the coming century due to anthropogenic global warming. A total rise of up to 1 m is possible by the year 2100 (relative to 1990). To deal with this change, coastal managers require site-specific information on relative (i.e., local) changes in sea level to determine what might be threatened. Therefore as a first step, global sea-level rise scenarios need to be transformed into relative sea-level change scenarios which take account of local and regional factors, such as vertical land movements, in addition to global changes. Even present rates of relative sealevel rise have important long-term implications for coastal management-projecting existing trends predicts a relative sea-level rise from 1990 to 2100 of up to 0.4 m and 1.15 m for the Mid-Atlantic Region and Louisiana, respectively. Ignoring sea-level rise will lead to unwise decisions and increasing hazard with time.
   This article adapts the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) global scenarios for sea-level rise (Warrick et at, 1996) to three relative sea-level rise scenarios for the contiguous United States. These scenarios cover the period 1990 to 2100 and provide a basis to assess possible proactive measures for sea-level rise. However, they are subject to the same uncertainties as the global scenarios as most of the sea-level rise will occur decades into the future. When considering what should be done now in response to future sea-level rise, given these large uncertainties, if is best to identify (I) low-cost, no regret responses which would maintain or enhance the choices available to tomorrow's coastal managers; and (2) sectors where reactive adaptation would have particularly high costs and where allowance for future sealevel rise can be considered a worthwhile ''insurance policy. '' Sea-level rise will impact an evolving coastal landscape which already is experiencing a range of other pressures. Therefore, to be most effective, responses to sea-level rise need to be integrated with all other planning occurring in the coastal zone.

TI Coastal impacts of storm surges on a changing climate: a global
   bibliometric analysis
SO NATURAL HAZARDS
AB An increase in the global mean sea level is predicted during the twenty-first century, as a consequence of global average rising temperature projections. In addition, changes in the strength of atmospheric cyclonic storms may alter the development of storm surges, exacerbating the risks to coastal communities. Based on the fact that the interest and range of papers on this topic are growing, this study aims to present the status of the global scientific production on studies that have correlated climate change and the impact of storm surges on the coastal zone leading to erosion and flooding (inundation) via a bibliometric analysis. We analyzed 429 papers published in journals between January 1991 and February 2021 from the Scopus database. Through the VOSviewer and Bibliometrix R package, we describe the most relevant countries, affiliations, journals, authors, and keywords. Our results demonstrate that there has been an exponential growth in the research topic and that authors from the USA and the United Kingdom are the most prolific. Among the 1454 authors found, ten researchers published at least five papers on the topic and obtained at least 453 citations in the period. The most represented journals were the Journal of Coastal Research, Climatic Change, and Natural Hazards. We also found and discuss the lack of standardization in the choice of keywords, of which climate change, storm surge, and sea-level rise are the most frequent. Finally, we have written a guide to facilitate the authors' bibliographic review.

TI Paleoclimatic interpretation in southern Laizhou Bay since the late
   Pleistocene: Evidence from groundwater and sedimentary strata
SO CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
AB Understanding past climatic change and the associated responses of sea level may contribute to the ability to evaluate the relationship between these factors in the future under the background of sea-level changed. Here, we aimed to reveal the climate change and sea-level characteristics of southern Laizhou Bay (SLB) since the late Pleistocene by combining groundwater stable isotopes (H-2, O-18 and deuterium excess (dexcess)), age dating (14C) and the structural characteristics of sediments from several boreholes. The isotopic proxies for climates demonstrated the depletion of H-2, O-18 and dexcess of groundwater recharged in the last glacial period of the late Pleistocene, indicating that the weather was cooler and wetter in the last glacial maximum, while the stable isotopes and dexcess of groundwater were enriched in the Holocene. Several transgressions were revealed through the structural characteristics of boreholes, which also indirectly reflected the large-scale changes of in global temperature. Finally, a conceptual model that describes the evolution of coastal saline groundwater based on the transgression process was proposed based on the sedimentary chronology of strata and groundwater age. These results not only contribute to the study of climate-related sea-level change since the late Pleistocene but also provides a theoretical explanation for the mechanism by which coastal saline groundwater forms.

TI Mid and late Holocene multiproxy analysis of environmental changes
   linked to sea-level fluctuation and climate variability of the Rio de la
   Plata estuary
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB In the present study, we carried out pollen, diatom and other palynomorph analyses from a sedimentary sequence from the marshes of Arroyo Solis Grande, in the Rio de la Plata northeastern coast (Uruguay), and compared the results with a regional model of surface pollen-vegetation relationship from the Atlantic coastal salt marshes (30 degrees - 37 degrees S). Results indicated that salt marsh vegetation developed around the estuary between 8000 and 5100 cal yr BP, as the sea level rose and reached the Holocene sea-level highstand. Brackish marshes around the estuary between 5100 and 2900 cal yr BP reflect the late Holocene sea-level fall and associated increased input of freshwater. Brackish marshes and shallow salt pond environments between 2900 and 1000 cal yr BP are most probably linked to the Parana delta formation and a further sea-level fall. Present-day marshes behind the sand bar characterize the last 1000 cal yr BP. The integration of our results with multiproxy records from the Rio de la Plata southern coast (Argentina) and from the coastal plain of the southern Atlantic margin of South America (30 degrees - 37 degrees S) revealed that marine influence during the maximum sea-level highstand resulted in the development of vegetation similar to that of the geographical region. However, after ca. 3000 cal yr BP, local differentiation related to different climate and geomorphology occurred at each area, thus resulting in the establishment of different modem plant communities at different times during the late Holocene.

TI Identifying and prioritising adaptation options for a coastal freshwater
   supply and demand system under climatic and non-climatic changes
SO REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB Coastal freshwater supply and demand systems are expected to be significantly affected by changes to both climatic and non-climatic drivers over coming decades. Adapting to these changes to secure adequate freshwater to meet the rising demands of socio-economic development has become a critical task for decision-makers. Whilst a range of adaptation options may be available, the complexity and interconnectedness of water resource systems make it challenging to identify which options are likely to be most feasible and effective. Here, we present a Bayesian decision network (BDN) that was co-developed with local experts to identify appropriate adaptation options for freshwater management under both current and likely future conditions in the Da Do Basin of coastal Vietnam. Potential adaptation options were prioritised according to cost-effectiveness based on relative costs incurred and relative utilities delivered across a range of future scenarios. The BDN model indicated that cost-effectiveness of adaptation options varied between future scenarios. Constructing pumping stations was the most cost-effective option under climate change scenarios, whilst a higher water price was the most cost-effective option under non-climatic changes. Under combined climatic and non-climatic changes, constructing pumping stations in combination with increasing water prices provided the most cost-effective option. The model affords an opportunity for decision-makers in the Da Do Basin to prioritise and evaluate appropriate and feasible adaptation actions under different scenarios with respect to multiple drivers.

We find that the inclusion of a glacio-isostatically induced rotational excitation can significantly affect previous predictions of both present-day sea-level rates and postglacial sea-level histories which were based on a theory that assumed a non-rotating Earth model. To illustrate, we consider present-day sea-level rates (and tide-gauge corrections) along the US east coast, and relative sea-level curves in the far field of the late Pleistocene ice sheets.

TI Reconstruction of the depositional history of the former coastal lagoon
   of Vilamoura (Algarve, Portugal): A sedimentological, microfaunal and
   geophysical approach
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB The late Holocene evolution of the former coastal lagoon of Vilamoura was reconstructed according to sediment cores and geophysical profiles. According to sedimentological analyses of the cores, five palaeoenvironmental stages were defined. (1) The pretransgression stage is represented by an erosive surface formed during incision of the river into the basement because of a lower sea level. This palaeosurface was retraced by refraction seismic profiles, showing that the marine transgression took place on a wide plain with several incised channels. (2) The development of an estuary started by transgression into the river valley corresponding to the postglacial sea level rise. Radiocarbon dating indicates a sea level not lower than -4 m at a minimum age of 4716 +/- 72 Cal BP. After the transgressive maximum, infilling of the estuary started, beginning with (3) subtidal infilling related to the formation of a sandy barrier followed by (4) supratidal infilling with further accretion of the barrier, changing the previous open bay into a coastal lagoon. (5) Finally, the lagoon was fluvially filled with terrestrial sediments, changing the marine to a fluvial milieu with floodplain deposition. Analysis of benthic foraminiferal and ostracod assemblages revealed additional information about the environmental conditions during evolution of the estuary, which led to a further subdivision of the marine facies into stages with mainly estuarine, lagoonal, or marine influence. The end of the marine stage was dated at 2895 +/- 48 Cal BP, indicating a pre-Roman onset of human-induced soil erosion.

TI The configuration of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets through the
   Quaternary
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Our understanding of how global climatic changes are translated into ice-sheet fluctuations and sea-level change is currently limited by a lack of knowledge of the configuration of ice sheets prior to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Here, we compile a synthesis of empirical data and numerical modelling results related to pre-LGM ice sheets to produce new hypotheses regarding their extent in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) at 17 time-slices that span the Quaternary. Our reconstructions illustrate pronounced ice-sheet asymmetry within the last glacial cycle and significant variations in ice-marginal positions between older glacial cycles. We find support for a significant reduction in the extent of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) during MIS 3, implying that global sea levels may have been 30-40 m higher than most previous estimates. Our ice-sheet reconstructions illustrate the current state-of-the-art knowledge of pre-LGM ice sheets and provide a conceptual framework to interpret NH landscape evolution.

TI Is the Atlantic a Source for Decadal Predictability of Sea-Level Rise in
   Venice?
SO EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
AB Sea-level rise is one of the most critical consequences of global warming, with potentially vast impacts on coastal environments and societies. Sea-level changes are spatially and temporally heterogeneous on multiannual-to-multidecadal timescales. Here, we demonstrate that the observed rate of winter sea-level rise in the Italian city of Venice contains significant multidecadal fluctuations, including interdecadal periods of near-zero trend. Previous literature established a connection between the local sea-level trend in Venice and over the broad subpolar and eastern North Atlantic. We demonstrate that for multidecadal variations in sea-level trend such connection holds only since the mid-20th Century. Such multidecadal sea-level fluctuations relate to North Atlantic sea-surface temperature changes described by the Atlantic multidecadal variability, or AMV. The link is explained by combined effect of AMV-linked steric variations in the North Atlantic propagating in the Mediterranean Sea, and large-scale atmospheric circulation anomalies over the North Atlantic with a local effect on sea level in Venice. We discuss the implications of such variability for near-term predictability of winter sea-level changes in Venice. Combining available sea-level projections for Venice with a scenario of imminent AMV cooling yields a slowdown in the rate of sea-level rise in Venice, with the possibility of mean values remaining even roughly constant in the next two decades as AMV effects contrast the expected long-term sea-level rise. Acknowledging, understanding, and communicating this multidecadal variability in local sea-level rise is crucial for management and protection of this world-class historical site.
   Plain Language Summary Environmental and socioeconomic impacts of sea-level rise are one of the major concerns of global warming. Here, we consider the case of the Italian city of Venice, one of the iconic locations for the potentially dramatic effects of sea-level rise. We show that the sea-level evolution in Venice during the past similar to 150 years contains strong multidecadal fluctuations, so that periods of more than two decades when there is little or no trend occurred even in the recent past. We link these fluctuations with sea-level and climatic variations in the North Atlantic. In particular, we focus on the phenomenon known as Atlantic multidecadal variability, or AMV, which describes the alternation over multidecadal periods of warm and cold phases of the North Atlantic surface. Our results indicate that warm AMV phases are linked to faster sea-level rise in Venice and vice versa. Accordingly, we build sea-level rise scenarios for Venice until 2035 by considering an imminent AMV cooling as suggested by recent studies. The scenarios yield a temporary slowdown of sea-level rise as the AMV contrasts the effects of global warming. This sea-level variability can strongly impact on the management of protective measures against flooding currently operative in Venice.

TI The Disaster Risk, Global Change, and Sustainability Nexus
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Until the 1970s, disaster risk was perceived as a direct consequence of natural hazards. Gradually, disaster risk has come to be understood as a compound event, which lies at the intersection of hazards, exposure, and vulnerability of the exposed elements. After decades of research and lessons learned from mega-disasters, social scientists have introduced the social dimension of disaster risk, and the prevailing understanding is that disasters are also a human construct. Now, due to climate and global environmental changes, even the natural component of hazards is being altered by anthropogenic activities, changing hazard susceptibility, coverage, frequency, and severity. This review retraces the brief history and evolution of the global understanding of disaster risk as a compound event, in parallel with research on global environmental change. It highlights the main milestones in this area, and shows that there are tight connections between trends of disaster risk and global change. This paper aims to demonstrate the need to better consider the role of global environmental change in disaster risk assessment. In 2015, three major new agreements were reached to improve global environmental governance: the new Sendai Framework (2015-2030), the post-2015 development agenda with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the Climate COP21 in Paris. These all include a clear focus on disaster risk reduction; however, several aspects of disaster risk linked with global environmental changes are still not clearly addressed by the main stakeholders (governments, insurers, or agencies). As the complexity of risk unfolds, more actors are getting together; the need for a holistic approach for disaster risk reduction has become clear, and is closely connected with achieving sustainable development.

TI Fire or ice: Anticorrelation of volcanism and glaciation in California
   over the past 800,000 years
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Compilation of published ages of Quaternary volcanism in eastern California indicates that volcanism was episodic, with maxima occurring during interglacial periods. The smoothed age distribution shows peaks at 10, 100, 185, 320, and 690 kyr, corresponding to interglacial cycles 1, 5, 7, 9, and 17. This implies that volcanism was modulated by changes in climate, although the processes that link the two are not well understood. Several factors, including transient loads imposed across rugged topography by ice and water and changes in groundwater regime, may provide the link. Although climatic modulation of volcanism is generally tied to changes in sea level, these data indicate that even volcanoes far from the coast can be affected by climatic change.

AB Sea level rise becomes our concern nowadays as a result of variously contribution of climate change that cause by the anthropogenic effects. Global sea levels have been rising through the past century and are projected to rise at an accelerated rate throughout the 21st century. Due to this change, sea level is now constantly rising and eventually will threaten many low-lying and unprotected coastal areas in many ways. This paper is proposing a significant effort to quantify the sea level trend over Malaysian seas based on the combination of multi-mission satellite altimeters over a period of 23 years. Eight altimeter missions are used to derive the absolute sea level from Radar Altimeter Database System (RADS). Data verification is then carried out to verify the satellite derived sea level rise data with tidal data. Eight selected tide gauge stations from Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak are chosen for this data verification. The pattern and correlation of both measurements of sea level anomalies (SLA) are evaluated over the same period in each area in order to produce comparable results. Afterwards, the time series of the sea level trend is quantified using robust fit regression analysis. The findings clearly show that the absolute sea level trend is rising and varying over the Malaysian seas with the rate of sea level varies and gradually increase from east to west of Malaysia. Highly confident and correlation level of the 23 years measurement data with an astonishing root mean square difference permits the absolute sea level trend of the Malaysian seas has raised at the rate 3.14 +/- 0.12 mm yr-1 to 4.81 +/- 0.15 mm yr-1 for the chosen sub-areas, with an overall mean of 4.09 +/- 0.12 mm yr-1. This study hopefully offers a beneficial sea level information to be applied in a wide range of related environmental and climatology issue such as flood and global warming.

AB Rural coastal communities have unique vulnerabilities to the impacts caused by sea level rise and saltwater intrusion compared to coastal urban areas that have growing populations, increasing property values, and extensive infrastructure. In contrast, rural coastal communities are typically dependent on traditional natural resource livelihoods like farming, commercial fishing, forestry, and outdoor recreation opportunities. Saltwater intrusion, exacerbated by sea level rise, impacts rural livelihoods by limiting suitable agricultural land and development options, which compounds local economic difficulties. Higher rates of poverty, aging demographics, and out-migration already challenge the resilience of rural coastal communities. Informed by sociological research that addresses the local economic factors unique to rural communities and resilience research on coastal communities and natural hazards, we propose the Rural Coastal Community Resilience (RCCR) framework. We test the RCCR framework through a series of focus groups within the Albemarle Pamlico Peninsula of North Carolina (U.S.), a low-lying, rural region with nearly one-half of its land less than 1 m above sea level. Applying the RCCR framework revealed that local priorities include maintaining rural livelihoods, creating job opportunities, and addressing highly vulnerable populations. By including stakeholder voices to stimulate capacity building dialogue, the RCCR framework boosts rural coastal community resilience by focusing on locally perceived resilience needs as targets for capacity building workshops, management interventions, and climate action planning.

TI Late Holocene Evolution of Currituck Sound, North Carolina, USA:
   Environmental Change Driven by Sea-Level Rise, Storms, and Barrier
   Island Morphology
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB The Holocene evolution of Currituck Sound, North Carolina, is investigated using geological data and a hydrodynamic model to understand how this depositional basin changed in response to sea-level rise and regional climate patterns. Five depositional units (one Pleistocene and four Holocene) are defined based on geophysical surveys, lithofacies, biofacies, and geochronological data. The earliest Holocene unit (ca. 5000 cal YBP) represents a midsalinity (10-25 parts per thousand) sand shoal above the transgressive ravinement surface. This unit is overlain, successively, by (1) a freshwater swamp forest deposit, (2) a relatively saline (25-35 parts per thousand) back-barrier estuarine deposit associated with increased inlet activity, and (3) a mid- to low-salinity (<10 parts per thousand) deposit that is typical of modern (post-1827) Currituck Sound, a back-barrier estuary with no inlets in the barrier island. Geomorphic reconstructions provided the boundary conditions input to hydrodynamically model tide and current patterns and to constrain the probable size and location of inlets. The evolution of this system depends on sea-level rise and barrier morphology, regional hydrological factors, and regional climatic conditions, which modulate storm impacts and inlet activity along the fronting barrier system. The late Holocene stratigraphy reflects climate variability also recorded in the sediments of Chesapeake Bay (to the north) and Pamlico Sound (to the south) and is consistent with an increase in tropical cyclone activity during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and subsequent decrease in tropical storm activity since ca. 500 cal YBP.

TI The influences of sea-level changes on the quality of bank reservoirs of
   the Lower Cambrian Longwangmiao Formation, in the Gaoshiti-Moxi area,
   Sichuan Province, China
SO JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Reservoir properties of banks of the Longwangmiao Formation show strong lateral and vertical variations in the Gaoshiti-Moxi area, central Sichuan. In this study, we utilized outcrop, core data, thin sections, wireline logs, and seismic data to investigate the influences of sea-level changes on the development of banks and penecontemporaneous dissolution which controlled the formation of high-quality bank reservoirs. Our results revealed that the Longwangmiao Formation corresponds to a third-order sea-level change cycle, which consisted of a rapid sea-level rise and a slower sea-level fall; we further identify four fourth-order sea-level cycles. Bank reservoirs are dominated by grain dolostone, silt to fine sand-sized crystalline dolostone, and mottled silt to fine sand-sized crystalline dolostone. The main reservoir spaces were pores and vugs, with an average porosity of 4.81% and average permeability of 4.75 x 10(-3) mu m(2). Bank deposition and dissolution during the third-order sea-level fall developed better than during the rising period, and the late fall stage was better than the early fall stage. Under the influence of fourth-order sea-level changes within the third-order sea-level change, the development of banks shows strong variations between different areas, which are evidenced by the fact that banks in the Moxi block were better developed than those in the Gaoshiti block. Bank dissolution in the Moxi block developed during the early and the late stage within the third-order sea-level fall, whereas the Gaoshiti block was developed only during the late stage. Therefore, we have concluded that sea-level changes played a significant role in controlling the quality of bank reservoirs in the Gaoshiti-Moxi area. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SP Int Union Quaternary Res
AB This study presents findings concerning Late Quaternary environmental changes in the Pearl River mouth region, China based on the study of over 300 boreholes. Out of these, 35 boreholes are selected for the reconstruction of transects across the deltaic plain and estuary. 39 radiocarbon dates obtained from these boreholes are used to help define the chronology of stratigraphic units present including two terrestrial units (T1 and T2) and two marine units (M1 and M2). Diatom assemblages are studied in 6 boreholes revealing similarities and differences between the two marine units. Before the area was inundated by the last interglacial sea (MIS 5), an older terrestrial unit of sand and gravel (T2) was laid down in a number of palaeo-valleys. During the last interglacial period, an older marine unit of silt and clay (M2) was laid down which was subsequently subaerially exposed when sea-level regressed during the last glacial period (MIS 4-2) causing the uppermost section to be weathered. During the same period, a younger terrestrial unit of sand and gravel (T1) was deposited along palaeo-river channels. Around the early Holocene before 8.2 cal. ka BP, the postglacial rise in sea level initiated a new phase of sedimentation in the outer part of the estuary, characterised by the high percentages of marine diatoms in the sediments. In the early Holocene, strong monsoon freshwater discharge resulted in sedimentation of a fine-sand layer in the inner part of the estuary. After 8.2 cal. ka BP, rapid rises in sea level caused widespread marine inundation and sedimentation. The diatom data suggest that the relative sea level associated with the M2 and M1 units were both at similar levels. Because the M2 unit is typically recorded at altitudes of 15 m and 20 m below the present sea level, this is likely to be a result of long-term subsidence. Although numerical dating of the pre-M1 units has not been made in the present study, the chronology of these units can be inferred from uranium-series ages and optically stimulated luminescence dating obtained from the adjacent coastal waters of Hong Kong. The T1 unit has yielded ages of about 30.0 cal. ka BP while the M2 unit has yielded ages about 130.0 cal. ka BP confirming their MIS 4-2 and MIS 5 ages respectively. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

TI Antarctic temperature and global sea level closely coupled over the past
   five glacial cycles
SO NATURE GEOSCIENCE
AB Ice cores from Antarctica record temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide variations over the past six glacial cycles(1,2). Yet concomitant records of sea-level fluctuations-needed to reveal rates and magnitudes of ice-volume change that provide context to projections for the future(3-9)-remain elusive. Reconstructions indicate fast rates of sea-level rise up to 5 cm yr(-1) during glacial terminations(10), and 1-2 cm yr(-1) during interglacials(11,12) and within the past glacial cycle(13). However, little is known about the total long-term sea-level rise in equilibration to warming. Here we present a sea-level record for the past 520,000 years based on stable oxygen isotope analyses of planktonic foraminifera and bulk sediments from the Red Sea. Our record reveals a strong correlation on multi-millennial timescales between global sea level and Antarctic temperature(1), which is related to global temperature(6,7). On the basis of this correlation, we estimate sea level for the Middle Pliocene epoch (3.0-3.5 Myr ago)-a period with near-modern CO2 levels-at 25 +/- 5 m above present, which is validated by independent sea-level data(6,14-16). Our results imply that even stabilization at today's CO2 levels may cause sea-level rise over several millennia that by far exceeds existing long-term projections(3).

TI The role of sea-level rise, monsoonal discharge and the palaeo-landscape
   in the early Holocene evolution of the Pearl River delta, southern China
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB The early Holocene history of the Pearl River delta is reconstructed based on a series of sediment cores obtained from one of the main palaeo-valleys in the basin. Sedimentary and microfossil diatom analyses combined with radiocarbon dating provide new evidence for the interactions between sea-level rise, antecedent topography and sedimentary discharge changes within the deltaic basin since the last glacial. These new records show that river channels of last glacial age incised down to c. -40 m into an older (possibly MIS5 age) marine sequence which forms the floor of the deltaic basin and exists primarily at c. 10 m-15 m below present mean sea level. Rapid postglacial sea-level rise flooded the incised valleys by the beginning of the Holocene, and prior to c. 9000 cal. years BP, marine inundation was largely confined within these incised valleys. The confined available accommodation space of the incised valleys combined with strong monsoon-driven freshwater, high sediment discharge and a period of rapid rising sea level meant that sedimentation rates were exceptionally high. Towards c. 8000 cal. years BP as sea level rose to about 5 m, marine inundation spilled out of the incised valleys and the sea flooded the whole deltaic basin. As a result, the mouth of the Pearl River was forced to retreat to the apex of the deltaic basin, water salinity within the basin increased markedly as the previously confined system dispersed across the basin, and the sedimentation changed from fluvial dominated to tidal dominated. Sea level continued to rise, albeit at a much reduced rate between 8000 and 7000 cal. years BP, and deltaic sedimentation was concentrated around the apex area of the basin. During the last 7000 cal. years BP, the delta shoreline moved seawards, and the sedimentary processes changed gradually from tidal dominated to fluvial dominated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Holocene sea-level changes affected people living in the Pacific Islands and their ancestors along the western Pacific Rim. Sea-level changes, particularly those that were rapid, may have led to profound and enduring societal/lifestyle changes. Examples are given of (1) how a rapid sea-level rise (CRE-3) about 7600 BP could ultimately have led to the earliest significant cross-ocean movements of people from the western Pacific Rim into the islands; (2) how mid to late Holocene sea-level changes gradually created coastal environments on Pacific Islands that were highly attractive to human settlers; (3) a hypothesis that rapid sea-level fall during the 'AD 1300 Event' brought about widespread disruption to trajectories of cultural evolution throughout the Pacific Islands; and (4) the effects of recent and likely future sea-level rise on Pacific Island peoples.

TI The Duxbury Sunken Forest-Constraints for Local, Late Holocene
   Environmental Changes Resulting from Marine Transgression, Duxbury Bay,
   Eastern Massachusetts, USA
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB The present marine transgression has forced geological and ecological zones vertically higher and landward since the late Pleistocene. A recent investigation in Duxbury Bay, Massachusetts, identified 18 Juniperus virginiana tree stumps emergent on an intertidal flat immediately seaward of a small marsh and pond situated between two eroding drumlins. The position of each stump was mapped with global positioning system (GPS), and its elevation with respect to mean lower low water was surveyed. Samples were selected from four stumps with elevations ranging from 2.03 and 0.75 m above mean lower low water for radiocarbon dating. The samples returned calibrated ages between 2219 +/- 94 and 2867 +/- 79 cal YBP, with the topographically highest sample returning the youngest date. Stump positions suggest a landscape gradient of 1.4 mm/yr between 2000 and 3000 cal YBP. The results are comparable with high-resolution studies of sea level in eastern Massachusetts for the same time period. Comparison of the youngest paleostumps with modern living trees suggests a dramatic change in the landscape gradient, an increase to 1.8 mm/yr. While this is contrary to sea-level studies nearby, it may represent an increase in the energetics of Duxbury Bay and resultant coastal erosion as the bay floods. The site can be used to put the impacts of changing sea-level rates into a landscape evolution framework.

TI Micropalaeontological evidence for deglacial marine flooding of the
   ancient courses of the River Murray across the Lacepede Shelf, southern
   Australia
SO MARINE MICROPALEONTOLOGY
AB Previous sub-bottom profiling of the Lacepede Shelf, southern Australia, had inferred the course of the palaeo-River Murray during periods of low sea level. Micropalaeontological analysis of two cores taken during the SST-02-07 cruise, confirm these earlier observations, and reveal the past existence of permanently open, estuarine environments substantially larger than currently prevailing at the mouth of the terminal lakes of the River Murray, Australia's largest exorheic river. The characteristics of the sediment and contained microfossils provide substantial evidence for the repeated development of large, oxygen depleting algal blooms (sapropels).
   Detailed analyses of the ostracod and foraminifer microfaunas, together with other fossil remains such as pteropods, bryozoan, sponge spicules and echinoid spines, combined with the dating of selected ostracods and bivalve molluscs (by AMS radiocarbon) and bivalve molluscs (by amino acid racemization) reveal rapid sediment accumulation within the ancient channels of the River Murray under estuarine conditions. The oldest infill relates to the end of the rapid sea-level rise following Meltwater Pulse IA similar to 13,600 cal. years BP and the second one that coincides with the Meltwater Pulse IB at 11,500-11,000 cal. years BP; in both cases, marine microfauna confirm the presence of marine incursions.
   The palaeoenvironmental reconstructions based on microfossils presented here rely on the study of six southeastern Australian contemporaneous estuaries where foraminifers and ostracods were collected, together with some ecological data such as salinity, dissolved oxygen and presence/absence of aquatic vegetation.

TI Trends of sea level variations in the Indo-Pacific warm pool

AB The long-term trends of sea level height in the Indo-Pacific warm pool (IPWP) were examined using merged altimetry data, and possible mechanisms were studied using multiple datasets. Sea level in the IPWP and the Western Pacific warm pool (WPWP) has distinct interannual variabilities related to ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) event. The mean sea level in the IPWP has a rising rate of 4.5 mm/yr over the 1993-2005 period, while the WPWP and the Indian Ocean warm pool (IOWP) have rising rate of 6.0 mm/yr and 1.6 mm/yr respectively. The trends of thermosteric sea level were also examined using Ishii data and MITgcm assimilation data and the results indicate that thermal change of upper layer has a significant contribution to the sea level variations in the WPWP But the thermosteric sea level has little contribution to sea level change in the IOWP region. Apart from thermal contribution, the contribution of precipitation and evaporation to sea level change were also examined. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO MARINE POLICY
AB The impact of global warming on coastal areas, in terms of erosion, flooding and environmental change is a source of concerns for many peoples in the Pacific region. In New Caledonia, Ouvea atoll is one of the most vulnerable areas to sea level rise. The population strongly oriented towards his lagoon, is concerned about shoreline erosion and wants to build a climate change adaptation strategy. This paper presents a research-action device aimed to renforce people's resilience in the proper regulatory environment to customary Kanak lands. The creation of a coastline participatory monitoring as data acquisition instrument, and sharing "inhabitants" and "experts" knowledges, is the heart of the approach. The dissemination of information to the population is one of the aims.

   environment and climatic history of Cauvery delta, Southern India
SO CATENA
AB Palynological and other sedimentary records in the south-eastern peninsular India where the retreating (North-East) monsoon brings the main rainfall are scarce. This paper tries to address not only this gap in data but also the methodological challenges of interpreting such data in terms of sea level, depositional environment and climatic changes of the area going back nearly 11040 years. In addition to other (chemical) proxies studied previously, pollen data of a chronologically well constrained sediment core (similar to 20 m) from Porayar (11 degrees 01.178'N 79 degrees 50.446'E), in the coastal marginal part of the Cauvery delta, Southern India, have been analyzed. The three major pollen zones observed since 11,040 years are presented and discussed, as are the methodological challenges of interpreting the vegetation record in such a dynamic and diverse environment (the delta plains of southern India). The zones observed indicate various transitions: from a lower sea level condition to a more stable sea level that created an estuarine environment filled with brackish water that supported pollen assemblages of a marshland but not a true mangrove. Concurrently, pollen assemblages that indicate catchments at multiple spatial scales - local to regional, extending from the North-East monsoon dominated delta to the Western Ghats is also inferred for climate interpretation.

TI Repeated turnovers in Late Jurassic faunal assemblages of the Gulf of
   Mexico: Correlation with cold ocean water
SO JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
AB Our research on Late Jurassic-earliest Cretaceous (Kimmeridgian-earliest Berriasian) marine shelf to bathyal sediments in northeastern Mexico reveals significant repeated oceanic and biotic turnovers in the northwestern Proto-Gulf of Mexico. We here document these environmental changes based on alternating cold and warm water mollusk assemblages, element concentrations and organofacies, as well as associated changes in sea level. We hypothesize that oscillations in the oceanic current system of the Gulf of Mexico were responsible for appearance of cold-water assemblages of Boreal and possibly Austral origins, situated in specific horizons which were previously described as poor in fossil content or even as fossil-free. In addition, these specific horizons show significant changes in element concentrations and organofacies and correlate to relative sea-level changes.

TI Facies associations and discontinuous surfaces in the Syringothyris
   limestone formation of Tethyan margin of Gondwana, Kashmir
SO GONDWANA RESEARCH
AB The early Carboniferous sedimentation of the Tethyan Margin of Gondwana in the Kashmir Himalaya represents alternating siliciclastic - carbonate succession consisting of distinct stratigraphic sequences which are bounded by discontinuities. The discontinuities in the sedimentation are related to environmental changes in the form of subaerial exposure, subaqueous erosion, subaqueous omission or changes in texture and facies. These distinct surface zones or time significant boundaries can be correlated across the depositional platform. Low stand, high stand and transgressive sedimentation units in the lower and middle parts of early Carboniferous Syringothyris Limestone Formation in Banihal area have been recognised. This is explained by superposition of high frequency and low amplitude sea level fluctuations on a large-scale trend under greenhouse conditions during the early Carboniferous period. The facies associations present in the early Carboniferous succession of the Himalaya broadly represent intertidal (peritidal), shallow subtidal, deeper subtidal, off-shore-slope and deeper environments. Discontinuities that are interpreted as progradational, retrogradational and aggradational phases of sedimentation bound these facies associations. This formation represents continental margin depositional setting which is authenticated by deposition of siliciclastic sediments. This marginal depositional setting is greatly affected by numerous dynamic processes including tectonic and other active sea as well as continental processes. The records of all those processes in this formation reflect the eustatic changes in sea level. These periodic eustatic changes have generated the various discontinuities, stratigraphic sequences or systems tracts. Overall it appears that interplay of many processes such as sediment supply, thermal and tectonic activity, eustatic and climatic changes in the Kashmir Tethyan depositional basin generated these distinct depositional sequences during the early Carboniferous period.

TI Radial growth in mangrove Xylocarpus granatum J. Koenig is driven by
   salinity in the Sundarbans, Bangladesh
SO DENDROCHRONOLOGIA
AB Albeit the Sundarbans provides protection and livelihood supports to similar to 7.5 million climate vulnerable coastal people in Bangladesh and India, this sentinel mangrove ecosystem has been threatened by anthropogenic disturbances and rapid environmental changes including sea level rise (SLR). In this context, long-term tree growth data are increasingly essential to understand the effects of environmental changes on mangroves and also to formulate their management plans. In this study, we evaluate the nature and periodicity of growth rings in Xylocarpus granatum, an ecologically important mangrove tree species growing in the Bangladesh Sundarbans. In addition, we analyze the influences of climatic variables (i.e., precipitation and temperature) and river discharge on its radial growth. The results reveal that X. granatum forms distinct growth rings which are marked by a layer of parenchyma band consisting of 1-4 cells. The visual crossdating and the quality of chronology statistics indicate that the growth rings are crossdatable. A site-specific chronology was developed spanning from 1973 to 2020 based on the crossdated samples. The annual nature of X. granatum's growth rings offer an opportunity to estimate tree age and growth rate. The ring width is influenced by salinity which is regulated mainly by freshwater influx through annual precipitation along with river discharge, particularly in July. This study suggests that growth rings could be used as a proxy in exploring X. granatum's growth dynamics, especially in relation to environmental changes.

TI Impacts of sea-level rise on prehistoric coastal communities: land use
   and risk perception during the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition in
   central Mediterranean Spain
SO JOURNAL OF MAPS
AB Mapping methods to represent the interplay between environmental changes and prehistoric communities were investigated through a case study of the Mediterranean Iberia coastal landscape in the context of Holocene sea-level rise. We developed a four-dimension GIS-based analysis of the environmental evolution based on primary data acquisition (fieldwork, laboratory analyses) and spatial modeling of paleo-Digital Elevation Models (paleoDEMs). Five paleoDEMs were computed, representing key stages of the morphogenetic evolution between 9000 and 7000 years ago. Second, each paleoDEM was used as input in a Site-Catchment Analysis (a 1- and 2-hour walking distance from the archeological sites). Finally, we provide a bird-view visualization of the landscape evolution, centered on the perspective of an individual located at the archeological sites. By shifting the focus to the human scale, this GIS-assisted mapping allows refining assessments of the impact of environmental changes on settlement and subsistence patterns during the Mesolithic and Early Neolithic periods.

TI Holocene evolution of a rock-bounded barrier-lagoon system, Cies
   Islands, northwest Iberia
SO EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
AB Coastal geomorphology results from the combined effects of contemporary dynamics, sea-level rise and the inherited geological framework, yet the relative importance of these driving mechanisms may change throughout the evolutionary history of coastal deposits. In this contribution, we analyse the depositional history of the Cies Islands barrier-lagoon system, based on lithofacies, radiocarbon ages, and pollen analysis. Our results reveal a sedimentary sequence that provides evidence for striking changes in the dynamical functioning of this complex since the mid-Holocene. The sedimentary sequence commenced about 7700 cal years BP by fresh-water ponding of an upland depression located about 4 m below present mean sea-level. Freshwater ponds were infilled by aeolian sediments following a gradual lowering of the water-table 4000 cal years BE. Post-3600 cal years BP sea-level rise allowed water oscillations to reach the elevation of the bedrock causing the inundation of fresh-water ponds and subsequent lagoonal and marine sedimentation. Subsequently, landward and upward migration of a sand-barrier led to overwash and deposition of sand in the newly formed lagoon.
   The resultant sedimentary sequence suggests that climatic conditions played an important role controlling the sedimentation regime during the entire history of the basin; changing water-table levels during early stages of evolution and increasing storminess during more recent times. In addition, background sea-level rise related to the Holocene transgression was a key factor in controlling the evolution of the system, yet its influence depended to an extent on the relative elevation of the bedrock topography.

AB Life or death, this is a question. Environmental change and environmental degradation have fundamentally changed the world's geographic pattern. As global warming accelerates sea level rise, some island nations are in danger of disappearing completely. When the land of the island nation disappears, these environmentally displaced persons (EDPs) not only need to be relocated, but also run the risk of losing their unique culture, language and lifestyle. Of course, this is a very complicated issue. Our paper will explain our views from the drivers of environmental change and population migration, the cultural protection of displaced persons and the pattern of immigration integration. It should be noted. If we are islanders, we would very much hope that our culture, location and identity will not disappear. Obviously, the full emigration and abandonment of these islands will have far-reaching adverse effects on the protection of islands culture and territorial political sovereignty.

TI Costal sea level variability and extreme events in Monitos, Cordoba,
   Colombian Caribbean Sea
SO CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
AB Flooding episodes occur frequently in the Colombian Caribbean and cause damage to coastal settlements. However, there is little knowledge about these episodes and about how changes in associated variables affect coastal flooding. This paper presents the results obtained from analyzing the temporal variability of flood levels in Monitos-COrdoba on the Colombian Caribbean coast, as well as the contribution their components make to different time scales. To achieve this, the total sea level (TSL) was estimated indirectly as the sum of the variables involved (sea level anomalies, astronomical tide, storm surge and wave runup). These variables were obtained by applying numerical and empirical modeling using satellite altimetry data, tidal modeled data and wind, waves and atmospheric pressure from reanalysis. Data Trends and contributions were analyzed using statistical methods, including variance analysis, exceedance distributions, linear regressions, Sen-Slope and the Mann Kendall test. The results indicate that the total sea level has a semi-annual cycle with its highest maximum levels in the months of December to March and its lowest maximum levels in the months of April and September. The total sea level variability in Monitos is dominated by the runup component at monthly, intra-annual and inter-annual scales, while at longer-term timescales (2-7 years and greater) variability is dominated by the sea level anomaly. Runup is the greatest contributor to the total sea level, followed by the sea level anomaly in average conditions and the astronomical tide in extreme conditions. There was a trend of increasing total sea level, related to the trend in sea level anomaly, with a consequent increasing trend of frequency and magnitude of extreme sea levels.

TI Late Pleistocene-Holocene climate and sea level changes inferred based
   on the tidal terrace sequence, Kachchh, Western India
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB An estuarine tidal terrace sequence at the mouth of the Kharod River, Kachchh, Western India is investigated for Pleistocene to Holocene climate and sea-level changes. Based on sedimentology, major element geochemistry, mineralogy, supported by optical dating, the study reports a lowered sea level during 13.8 ka, followed by gradual rise in the sea level until around 6 ka. This is ascribed to a combination of enhanced melt water discharge and strengthened Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM). The temporal changes in major elements (detrital proxies), suggest a fluctuating to an overall arid monsoon conditions during 5.7 to 3.1 ka with a rapidly rising sea level. This is further supported by the dominance of fine textured sediment along with the occurrences of shell rich horizon. In the absence of any evidence of land-level changes, the study suggests that at around 6 ka to 3 ka, the sea was approximately 2 m higher then present. The decline in the concentration of geochemical proxies and occurrence of Aeolian sand after 3 ka is interpreted as the onset of aridity and present day like conditions. The three levels of sea stands, during Early, Middle and Late Holocene are synchronous with various archeological (Harappan) settlements in the region. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Sedimentological and geochemical imprint of environmental changes in
   late Pleistocene palaeodelta-hosting deposits, southwest of the Hainan
   Island (South China Sea)
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
AB The study was aimed at elucidating relationships between lithological and geochemical characteristics of sediments as indicators of sea level changes during the Late Quaternary on the eastern slope of the Yinggehai-Song Hong basin. The focus was on sediments of the late Pleistocene paleodelta formed on the shelf off the Hainan Island. Examination of two cores revealed a significant lithological and geochemical variability of the sediments, particularly in the lower segments of the delta deposits, associated with the delta front (core LDW) and with the distal part of the prodelta (core ZBW). The upper segment of the deltaic sediments in core LDW most likely represents a delta plain formed under the prevalent trend of increasing sea level. On other hand the upper segment of the deltaic sediments in core ZBW should be regarded as associated with sediments of the proximal part of the prodelta, formed when the delta front was advancing and the sea level was first rising and then stabilised. Attention was paid to the relationship between lithological and geochemical features of the sediments and the seismic profiling records, particularly with respect to the paleodelta sediment series. An attempt was also made to link and correlate the sediment series with sea level changes.

TI The effect of climatic change on southeast Asian geomorphology
SO JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE
AB There is no evidence that the climatic conditions in southeast Asia during the Neogene differed substantially from the humid tropical and subtropical climates that then characterised large tracts of the globe. Tropical plantation surfaces are less extensive than those prevailing, for example, in Africa as a result of tectonism related to plate tectonics.
   However, during the generally somewhat drier Quaternary period the effects of climatic changes on landform development were rather unique in the southeast Asian region because large areas were under the regime of the monsoonal wind system. The climatic changes thus were not limited to changes in temperature and precipitation but included changes in wind direction. The exposure of extensive shelf areas during the low sea-levels of the Pleistocene glacial stages is another characteristic that added to the area's uniqueness.
   The Quaternary climatic changes in southeast Asia thus comprise four types of fluctuations: temperature, precipitation, wind patterns and sea-level. Their geomorphological effects are discussed and illustrated by examples.
   Fluctuations in temperature had a marked effect on landform development, especially in the high mountains. The lowering of the snow-and vegetation lines resulted in glaciation in the highest parts, frost shattering further down and debris formation in the piedmont zone.
   Fluctuations in precipitation had a marked effect, especially on the landforms of the lower areas, where foot slopes developed under the effect of lateral activity processes in the drier periods, alternating with vertical activity processes during the more humid phases. Many sediment sequences and soil profiles, and in the driest areas even fossil dune fields, bear witness to former drier periods.
   Fluctuations of sea-level governed coastal evolution during the Pleistocene, when the extensive shelf areas emerged in the glacial periods and a drainage network developed. Coral reef formation in those parts thus was interrupted several times. Long records of sea-level changes are recorded in some raised coral reek in the island are zones.
   Fluctuations of wind patterns also had a pronounced effect on coastal development and coral cays in southeast Asia. This is especially evident from Holocene and recent changes. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Holocene highstand deposits in the Gulf of Cadiz, SW Iberian Peninsula:
   A high-resolution record of hierarchical environmental changes
SO MARINE GEOLOGY
AB A comparison of the internal structure of Holocene highstand shallow-marine deposits with emerged spit-bar systems in the Gulf of Cadiz margin (SW Iberian Peninsula) is presented, in order to increase the knowledge about the patterns of environmental fluctuations of sub-Milankovitch periodicity during the recent highstand period. A high-resolution seismic database of boomer profiles was interpreted, focusing on shallow-marine deposits of the Gulf of Cadiz shelf, such as the Guadalquivir River prodelta, the Guadiana River depositional system and the Faro-Tavira infralittoral prograding wedge.
   The results indicate that the internal architecture of recent highstand shelf deposits is complex, as the recognition of three main types of seismic unit motifs suggests the existence of a hierarchical pattern of environmental fluctuations: (a) Major-scale motifs: the most significant feature observed in the seismic records is the pervasive occurrence of two major-scale motifs (lower and upper) within the Holocene highstand systems tract. (b) Intermediate-scale motifs: each major-scale motif is composed of two intermediate-scale motifs, defining four intermediate-scale motifs (H, to HQ). (c) Minor-scale motifs: the internal structure of major- and intermediate-scale motifs reveals a high degree of environmental variability during the recent highstand, probably led by climatic cyclicities of submillenial scale. The lower major-scale motif is characterised by alternating progradational-aggradational minor-scale motifs, whereas the upper major-scale motif presents a more uniform internal structure dominated by progradational units.
   The influence of two distinct trends or asymmetric cycles of sea-level change seems to have been significant in the generation of the major-scale architecture. The transition between both major phases was probably related with a major sea-level rise. Other factors, such as changes in the magnitude and/or direction of storm events and climatically induced changes of sediment supply, are proposed to have controlled the generation of intermediate- and minor-scale architectures.

TI Sea level trend and variability in the Singapore Strait
SO OCEAN SCIENCE
AB Sea level in the Singapore Strait (SS) exhibits response to various scale phenomena, from local to global. Longest tide gauge records in SS are analysed to derive local sea level trend and annual, inter-annual and multi-decadal sea level variability, which then are attributed to regional and global phenomena. Annual data gaps are reconstructed using functions correlating sea level variability with ENSO. At annual scale, sea level anomalies in SS are (quasi-periodic) monsoon-driven, of the order of +/- 20 cm, the highest during northeast monsoon and the lowest during southwest monsoon. Interannual regional sea level drops are associated with El Nino events, while the rises are correlated with La Nina episodes; both variations are in the range of +/- 5 cm. At multi-decadal scale, annual measured sea levels in SS are varying with global mean sea level, rising at the rate 1.2-1.7 mm yr(-1) for 1975-2009, 1.8-2.3 mm yr(-1) for 1984-2009 and 1.9-4.6 mm yr(-1) for 1993-2009. When SS rates are compared with the global trends (2.0, 2.4 and 2.8 mm yr(-1), respectively) derived from tide gauge measurements for the same periods, they are smaller in the earlier era and considerably larger in the recent one. Taking into account the first estimate of land subsidence rate, 1-1.5 mm yr(-1) in Singapore, the recent trend of absolute sea level rise in SS follows regional tendency.

TI A preliminary study on upstream migration of mangroves in response to
   changing environment along River Hooghly, India
SO MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB Environmental changes and anthropogenic activities can be linked to altered distribution and abundance of species. However, the ecological impacts of change in the microenvironment have not been well documented. Herein, we have identified the distribution of mangroves and associated species and characterized surface sediment and water samples along the banks of River Hooghly. The application of Combined Mangrove Recognition Index (CMRI) and its validation with the available ground data on satellite image of 2015 indicates that some mangrove species have reclaimed the upper course of the river, which was earlier absent before 1995. This study is the first report on the upstream migration of mangrove species such as Sonneratia caseolaris, Sonneratia apetala, Derris trifoliate, Hibiscus tiliaceus, and Thespesia populnea in River Hooghly. The changes in pollution load, varied sedimentation pattern, high chemical oxygen demand, mean sea-level rise, and anthropogenic activity might have played a significant role in the upstream migration of mangroves.

TI A dynamic vulnerability approach for tourism destinations
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM
AB Tourism destinations are vulnerable to increasing environmental change. The available scientific knowledge, however, is of little practical use as it is too aggregate, too conceptual, or too static. Various authors have called for dynamic vulnerability assessments, but the principles for dynamic vulnerability assessments have not been specified nor is it clear how to operationalise these principles. This paper formulates five principles: human agency, heterogeneity, feedbacks, uncertainty, and iteration. To address these principles, it proposes a dynamic approach that involves stakeholders. The approach's proposed methodological tools enable system integration as well as the opportunity for both researchers and stakeholders to experience and experiment with dynamic vulnerabilities, which is key to moving beyond aggregate and static assessments. To demonstrate some of the approach's added value for tourism destinations, a short illustration is provided of the critical challenge of sea level rise for coastal tourism in the Caribbean islands of Barbados and Curacao. Future application of the approach can extend well beyond Caribbean coastal destinations to any other tourism destination vulnerable to environmental change.

TI INSIGHTS ON A PROPOSED MID-HOLOCENE HIGHSTAND ALONG THE NORTHWESTERN
   GULF OF MEXICO FROM THE EVOLUTION OF SMALL COASTAL PONDS
SO JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH
AB Small lakes and ponds along the margins of estuaries and lagoons contain valuable records of paleo-sea level, past storm frequencies, and climatic change. Critical to their use in such studies is an understanding of their evolution. Using aerial photos, surveyed elevation profiles, and vibracores, we describe the geomorphic and stratigraphic evolution of ponds whose sedimentary floors range in elevation from -0.8 to +0.8 m above sea level on the margins of Baffin Bay in semiarid south Texas. These ponds are in various stages of evolution providing an excellent opportunity to study their formation. We see a three-stage evolution of (1) eolian deflation and creation of pond, (2) creation of a pathway to the open bay via headward-eroding gullies, and (3) open communication with the bay via a small tidal inlet. Each of these stages of evolution has a unique sedimentary facies associated with it. Combined with elevation and age control, the sedimentary facies from these ponds and two other cores from adjacent Baffin Bay are used to evaluate a proposed mid-Holocene sea-level highstand within the Gulf of Mexico. Deposits from these cores suggest that Holocene sea level in the Gulf of Mexico did not reach above +0.4 in and did not reach above -1.2 m until sometime after 5.6 ka. Algal mats from cores in Baffin Bay suggest sea level was -7.6 +/- 1.1 m 5.6 ka. The sea-level constraints suggested by these ponds are in agreement with more traditional reconstructions of sea level since the mid-Holocene within the Gulf of Mexico. In addition to testing a higher-than-present mid-Holocene highstand within the northwestern Gulf of Mexico, we also provide an evolutionary model for the development of these ponds illustrating the important interaction between eolian and estuarine processes.

AB The changes in global climate, vegetation zones and sea level must have resulted in changes in the routes taken by migratory species. I consider whether populations are likely to be able to adapt to the accelerating change resulting from modification of the global environment. I summarise 43 cases in which birds have changed their migration routes in historical times. I also summarise 14 cases in which routes seem sub optimal, for example, species have spread from one continent to another but have persisted in using the migration route normally associated with the previous continent. Whether a particular migratory species can respond to global environmental change is likely to depend upon the details of the genetic or cultural system and this may be difficult to predict.

TI Linked Silurian carbon cycle perturbations, bursts of pinnacle reef
   growth, extreme sea-level oscillations, and evaporite deposition
   (Michigan Basin, USA)
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB Integration of sedimentologic, chemostratigraphic, biostratigraphic, and geochronologic data identifies the profound influence that sudden bursts of carbonate sedimentation, sea-level oscillation, and hypersalinity, associated with Ireviken and Mulde carbon cycle perturbations, had on the evolution of the Michigan Basin during the Silurian. Conodonts and carbon isotope (delta C-13(carb)) stratigraphy of the Lockport and Engadine Dolomites constrain the rapid build-up and progradation of a thick biohermal wedge along the basin margins to the Sheinwoodian-age Ireviken Excursion, a recently identified period of global reef growth. This event significantly changed the hydrologic architecture of the basin, ultimately resulting in restricted seawater exchange that drove evaporite deposition. Zircon U-Pb ages of similar to 428 Ma from bentonites near the base of the evaporite-bearing Salina Group, together with delta C-13(carb) profiles transecting the basin, constrain the onset of hypersalinity to initiation of the late Homerian Mulde Excursion. Importantly, the double delta C-13(carb) peak of this event parallels a complex pattern of dramatic sea-level oscillations, on the order of 100 m, recorded within the A-0 to A-2 evaporites and associated pinnacle reefs. Ascending delta C-13(carb) values were accompanied by sea-level fall, karstification, and the formation of evaporites in the basin center. Intra-excursion sea-level rebounds triggered exceptionally rapid upward pinnacle reef growth. Subsequent sea-level fall again exposed the ramp and pinnacle reefs resulting in basin-wide restriction and massive salt deposition that, ultimately, encased the reefs in salt. The return to baseline delta C-13(carb) values was accompanied by flooding and carbonate sedimentation.
   Our integrated approach, with high-resolution delta C-13(carb) stratigraphy from closely spaced (intra-basinal) sections as a central component, enables finely tuned chronostratigraphic correlation, recognition of unconformity-bound facies packages (i.e., systems tracts), and constrains variations in sea level and sedimentation rates. These findings have immediate applications to predictive static reservoir models for the evaluation of the reefs as repositories for anthropogenic CO2 sequestration, gas storage reservoirs, and hydrocarbon exploration. Ultimately, our findings demonstrate that a cascade of rapid environmental changes, including pulses of carbonate sedimentation, high-amplitude sea-level oscillations, and evaporite deposition, were associated with the Ireviken and Mulde perturbations of the Silurian carbon cycle.

TI Holocene mangrove dynamics and environmental change in the Rufiji Delta,
   Tanzania
SO VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY
AB Holocene mangrove dynamics are reconstructed from pollen, sediment and radiocarbon analyses of three cores (ANR, BNR, CNR) located across a 20 km transect in the Rufiji Delta, Tanzania. At the base of the sediment sequence, dated to about 5600 cal. year b.p., the mangroves which are present suggest a low intertidal ecosystem in response to wet conditions and a higher sea level than at the present day. After around 5600 cal. year b.p. in core BNR, mangroves retreated seaward probably due to a lower sea level and drier environmental conditions. At around 4640 cal. year b.p., mangroves shifted landward suggesting a phase of sea level rise. In the late Holocene, mangroves became established at higher elevations of the Rufiji Delta, which is now a paddy field. Mangrove taxa decreased after 1170 cal. year b.p., suggesting drier conditions and less inundation frequency, possibly due to a lower sea level. Marked vegetation changes from mangroves to terrestrial vegetation occurred after around 750 cal. year b.p., possibly related to sea level regression and/or a desiccation phase recorded during the late Holocene. Paddy fields replaced mangroves in the landward part of the transect, reflecting an increase in human settlement in this area, a trend that continues to the present day. The recent decrease of mangrove species, particularly Rhizophora mucronata, could suggest less inundation by saline water and a lower sea level, although these changes may also be due to human activities during the last millennia as indicated by charcoal analysis.

TI A diatom-based Holocene record of sedimentary and oceanographic
   environmental changes within the Beibu Gulf, NW South China Sea
SO MARINE GEOLOGY
AB A sediment core from a nearshore setting (10.8 m in water depth) of the inner Beibu Gulf, northwestern South China Sea, was analyzed in terms of diatom assemblage composition, grain size distribution and radiocarbon dating, with aim to describe sedimentary and oceanographic environmental changes during the Holocene. The fossil diatom record and changes in granulometry reveal that sea-level fluctuations had a strong influence on the evolution of hydrographic system, which changed significantly with rapid sea-level rise in the early Holocene ca. 10,000-7800 cal. yr. BP. These fluctuations continued in a series of stages dated to the middle Holocene ca. 7800-6200 cal. yr. BP, with sea-level increase, followed by a prolonged sea-level retreat during ca. 6200 to 3300 cal. yr. BP, and finally a relatively high sea level from ca. 3300 cal. yr. BP to the present. The resultant sedimentary facies could be divided into seven stages inferred by the diatom distribution and grain size characteristics: a river channel/beach environment at ca. 10000-9500 cal. yr. BP, a lagoonal environment at ca. 9500-7800 cal. yr. BP, a relatively broad embayment at ca. 7800-6200 cal. yr. BP, a bay at ca. 6200-3300 cal. yr. BP and a coastal environment setting up to present day. The coastal environmental setting has been subject to some shifts in climate and sea-level beginning with strong terrestrial influx at ca. 3300-1400 cal. yr. BP, which was then replaced by strong hydrological circulation at ca. 1400-800 cal. yr. BP, and a relative stable sedimentary environment approximate to the coast from ca. 800 cal. yr. BP to present.
   A very obvious increase in diatom abundance in the early and late Holocene reflected terrestrial influx transporting nutrients, driven by precipitation changes influenced by the Asian monsoon circulation pattern, particularly in the early Holocene. Increased anthropogenic impact, i.e. an enhanced nutrient condition, was inferred from higher abundances and reasonably high diatom diversity in this local record from 1400 cal. yr. BP, especially in the last 800 years. Rapid shifts in the diatom composition and grain size distribution at about 1400 and 1000 cal. yr. BP were observed that could be interpreted as overlapping influences of a global scale paleoclimate anomaly and local human activities. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of using diatom for understanding regional paleoenvironment change driven by both global climate changes and anthropogenic impact in coastal area of the Beibu Gulf, northwestern South China Sea.

SE Coastal Research Library
AB Because changes in sea level may have a great impact on the distribution of mineral resources, the exploration and exploiting of these resources should not ignore the changes in sea level that may have occurred in the past in the area considered. The study of relative sea-level changes is an essential element of ocean observation and technological advances are often necessary to improve this study that includes the determination of levels (elevation or depth), chronological estimations, and the identifi cation of appropriate sea-level indicators.
   Indicators of fossil or present-day sea-level positions are the most important elements for a sea-level reconstruction, because they provide information not only on the former level but also on the accuracy of the reconstruction.
   A classification is proposed of the main criteria that can be used to deduce appropriate sea-level indicators from geomorphological, stratigraphical, biological or archeological coastal data. Two cases studies are used as examples of sea-level reconstructions that may be useful to clarify the geology in certain areas, or to coastal engineering and coastal protection: (1) on the impact of the recent sea-level rise in the interpretation of sea-level indicators; and (2) on the foreseeable impacts of the predicted near-future sea-level rise on the coasts of NE Italy.

AB Intensive Paleoindian occupation of the Mesa site occurred between 10,300 and 9700 C-14 yr B.P. Was the timing of this occupation controlled by environmental changes? We investigated stratigraphic records of geomorphology and vegetation to describe how landscapes in the Arctic Foothills changed between 13,000 and 8000 C-14 yr B.P. Paleoindians were present during a time of rapid and sweeping changes in vegetation, slope erosion, floodplain dynamics, permafrost stability, and soil type. We speculate that Paleoindians moved into arctic Alaska to exploit population highs in large ungulates that in turn were triggered by landscape-scale, geomorphic disturbances caused by climate changes. Environmental changes slowed and rising sea levels flooded Alaska's continental shelves during the Early Holocene, causing summer temperatures to fall and precipitation to increase. A more stable climate and the prevalence of maritime air masses allowed the spread of tussock-tundra vegetation, which probably drove both the Paleoindians and their prey species out of the region.

TI The middle to Late Holocene environment on the Iturup Island (Kurils
   North Western Pacific)
SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
AB The Kuril Islands stretch southwest from Kamchatka, Russia, to Hokkaido, Japan and separate the Sea of Okhotsk from the northern Pacific Ocean. A series of transgressions and regressions linked to variations in climatically affected global ice volume are among the most important drivers of Holocene environmental changes in the region. Despite a long research history, reconstructions of the Holocene palaeoenvironment are sparse with inconsistent interpretations, arising from insufficient dating control, different temporal resolutions, and specific local geographical features, such as high tectonic activity and the isolated nature of the area. We have investi-gated a 550 cm lake sediment section from Iturup Island, the largest among the Kuril Islands. The 6600 year old sediment section was studied using sedimentological, geochemical, chironomid, diatom, and pollen analyses to reconstruct environmental and climatic changes and sea level fluctuations (transgression - regression stages). During the warm late phase of the Middle Holocene (6600-4400 cal BP) an open bay or lagoon with shallow overgrown littorals existed at the sampling site. The cooling between 5600 and 4400 cal BP can be correlated with Neoglacial cooling. The cool period between 4200 and 3200 cal BP was a transition towards the formation of a freshwater lagoon and can be related to a decline of the Japan Late Jomon transgression (Sakaguchi, 1983). Between 3200 and 2800 cal BP the lagoon separated from the marine environment in response to a further sea level decrease during the Japan Latest Jomon cold stage and regression. The following increase in the share of broad-leaved pollen indicated a slight warming (Yayoi transition stage) that was interrupted by a short-term cooling spell between 1500 and 1400 cal BP (cold Japan Kofun stage). The period between ca 1100 and 800 cal BP can be related to the European Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) or relatively dry Japan Nara-Heian-Kamakura warm stage. The Little Ice Age cooling and Edo regression were evident after ca 800 cal BP. Mod-ern warming however is not well seen in the investigated core.

TI Environmental changes since 14 ka BP in the southernmost Kuril islands
   (North-Western Pacific) and regional correlation of events
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
AB Despite considerable progress in understanding Late Pleistocene and Holocene palaeoenvironmental changes worldwide, there are still very few such data for the Far East, and Kuril islands, in particular. Here, the sea level rise during the Late Glacial-Holocene transition was accompanied by a loss of the land connectivity culminating into the development of isolated islands. The ecosystems evolution and importance of isolation for vegetation dynamics on islands are still insufficiently understood. We investigated a unique natural record of environmental change since 14 ka has been recently discovered in lake-mire complex on Kunashir Island. The sediments include 12 tephra layers from Kunashir and Hokkaido volcanoes. The lake level was highest during warmer and humid climate of the Allerod. Diatom assemblages indicated the higher lake level between 12 730-12 160 cal yr BP. The first half of Younger Dryas was characterized by heavy snowfalls. Cooling attributed to the Younger Dryas in the Southern Kurils was less distinct than on the continent. The pollen assemblages recorded changes in vegetation on the land bridge. At the end of the Pleistocene large areas were occupied by birch forests and shrub pine. The broadleaf species first appeared at the end of Allerod. Starting from the Pleistocene-Holocene transition and during the early Holocene, the role of conifers sharply increased. In the middle Holocene the proportion of broadleaf trees in forests increased. Coniferous forests became abundant during the Little Ice Age. Short-tern climatic fluctuations correlate well with regional pattern, particularly with fluctuations of the moisture supply.

TI Effects of sea-level rise and storm-enhanced flooding on Pacific harbour
   seal habitat: A comparison of haul-out changes at the Russian and Eel
   river estuaries
SO AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
AB Patterns and changes in the distribution of coastal marine mammals can serve as indicators of environmental change that fill critical information gaps in coastal and marine environments. Coastal habitats are particularly vulnerable to the effects of near-term sea-level rise.
   In California, Pacific harbour seals (Phoca vitulina richardii) are a natural indicator species of coastal change because of their reliance on terrestrial habitats, abundance, distribution, and site fidelity. Pacific harbour seals are marine top predators that are easily observed while hauled out at terrestrial sites, which are essential for resting, pupping, and moulting.
   Although increasing inundation from recent sea-level rise and storm-driven flooding has changed the Californian coastline, little is known about the effect of future sea-level rise and increased storm frequency and strength on harbour seal haulout site availability and quality in California.
   Harbour seal habitat was modelled at two sandbar-built estuaries under a series of likely sea-level rise and storm scenarios. The model outputs suggest that, over time, habitat at both estuaries decreased with increasing sea level, and storm-enhanced water levels contributed significantly to habitat flooding. These changes reflect pressures on coastal habitats that have an impact on human and natural systems.

TI Random fluctuations of snow accumulation over Antarctica and their
   relation to sea level change
SO CLIMATE DYNAMICS
AB Short-term changes in the volume of ice sheets as analyzed by radar altimetry may not be related to long-term climatic change. Indeed, the large relaxation time of an ice sheet induces a low-frequency response to random fluctuations of snow accumulation. However, the time scale of the response is big compared to the average human lifetime and the effect of these random fluctuations on sea level change may be important even if they are not linked to climatic change. In this study, the relaxation time of an ice sheet is expressed with respect to the ice thickness, surface slope and ice velocity. These parameters are deduced from the precise topography derived from the geodetic cycle of the ERS1 radar altimeter. The variance of the induced effect on ice elevation is found to be around 3 in over a 30-year scale and with a maximum of 10 in in Wilkes Land and in the western part of the West Antarctic ice sheet. Near the coast, this effect can mask a climatic signal and thus be critical for altimetric mass balance surveys. The estimated changes in Antarctica's elevation between the Seasat (1978) and ERS (1993) epochs could be explained at least partially by such processes. In terms of sea level change over the 30-year scale, the standard deviation of the induced effect is 8 2.8 cm. Finally, we show that the probability of a present-day, induced sea level rise of between 0.5 and 1 mm/year over a 30-year time scale is estimated at 10% +/- 10%, with coastal areas accounting for half of this signal.

CL Guangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB Origin of fine-grained terrigenous sediments and integrative interpretation of their detailed variations in the southeastern Yellow Sea (YS) since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) have not been well understood. We investigated the provenance and paleo-environmental changes of the southeastern YS by examining clay mineral changes from borehole HMB-102 and HMB-103. Down-core variations in these clay mineral compositions suggest a distinct change in the provenance of fine-grained sediments of the Heuksan Mud Belt (HMB). Before 13.32 ka, sediments were mostly derived from the Korean rivers, from the paleo-Huanghe during between 13.32 to 11.08 ka, and from the Korean rivers with minor contributions from the paleo-Huanghe during 11.08 to 6.77 ka. After 6.77 ka, when the sea level was high and the shoreline was near the Korean Peninsula, materials may come from the Korean rivers. The provenance change after LGM occurred due to an increase in water depth caused by climate change and evolution of Kuroshio Current (KC). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Sea level and turbidity controls on mangrove soil surface elevation
   change
SO ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
AB Increases in sea level are a threat to seaward fringing mangrove forests if levels of inundation exceed the physiological tolerance of the trees; however, tidal wetlands can keep pace with sea level rise if soil surface elevations can increase at the same pace as sea level rise. Sediment accretion on the soil surface and belowground production of roots are proposed to increase with increasing sea level, enabling intertidal habitats to maintain their position relative to mean sea level, but there are few tests of these predictions in mangrove forests. Here we used variation in sea level and the availability of sediments caused by seasonal and inter-annual variation in the intensity of La Nina-El Nino to assess the effects of increasing sea level on surface elevation gains and contributing processes (accretion on the surface, subsidence and root growth) in mangrove forests. We found that soil surface elevation increased with mean sea level (which varied over 250 mm during the study) and with turbidity at sites where fine sediment in the water column is abundant. In contrast, where sediments were sandy, rates of surface elevation gain were high, but not significantly related to variation in turbidity, and were likely to be influenced by other factors that deliver sand to the mangrove forest. Root growth was not linked to soil surface elevation gains, although it was associated with reduced shallow subsidence, and therefore may contribute to the capacity of mangroves to keep pace with sea level rise. Our results indicate both surface (sedimentation) and subsurface (root growth) processes can influence mangrove capacity to keep pace with sea level rise within the same geographic location, and that current models of tidal marsh responses to sea level rise capture the major feature of the response of mangroves where fine, but not coarse, sediments are abundant.

TI Regional sea level variability, total relative sea level rise and its
   impacts on islands and coastal zones of Indian Ocean over the last sixty
   years
SO GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
AB Indian Ocean is the home to many tropical low lying islands and highly populated coastal zones. Since a few recent decades, many of these zones have been gaining a lot of international attention due to fears of sea level rise and possible submersions of islands. In this study we estimate sea level rise and regional sea level variability in Indian Ocean (20 degrees E-140 degrees E, 30 degrees N-35 degrees S) over a period of 60 years from 1950 until 2009. We determine the climatic factors that influence the sea level change and variability in this region. We find that the changes in the Indian Ocean sea level are of steric origin and are also driven by short-term Indian Ocean Dipole events. The trend in this region over 60 years amounts to 1.5 mm/yr, a value lesser (although not statistically different) than the global mean sea level rise over the same period. There is also an east-west increase in sea level trend pattern below 15 S latitude which is more amplified since the two recent decades. Climate-related sea level changes are also studied at different sites in the Indian ocean corresponding to the existence of tide gauge records and has been found that over the long term period (60 years), the sea level trend at most of the individual locations are well within the global mean sea level rise. Total relative sea level change which is the sum of climate-related sea level change and vertical land motion is also estimated at 5 locations with the help of GPS and DORIS measures.

AB Extreme sea levels are likely to increase in the future with an expected accelerated rise in mean sea level and through possible changes in storminess. Society is becoming more vulnerable to extreme sea levels due to considerable growth in human populations and economy at the coastal zone and this is particularly true for Western Australia, the fastest growing Australian state or region. This paper describes a novel approach used to estimate future changes in extreme sea level around the southwest coastline of Western Australia. Probabilities of extreme sea level for the present climate have been estimated using a 60 year hindcast of sea levels. The impact of climate change has been explored by adding a range of mean sea level rise projections to these probabilities. Estimates of possible future changes in recurrence intervals every decade over the 21st century are presented, showing that climate change has the potential to significantly reduce current average recurrence intervals and that the amount of reduction varies significantly around the coastline.

TI New evidence of Hawaiian coral reef drowning in response to meltwater
   pulse-1A
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB Fossil coral reefs are valuable recorders of glacio-eustatic sea-level changes, as they provide key temporal information on deglacial meltwater pulses (MWPs). The timing, rate, magnitude, and meltwater source of these sea-level episodes remain controversial, despite their importance for understanding ocean-ice sheet dynamics during periods of abrupt climatic change. This study revisits the west coast of the Big Island of Hawaii to investigate the timing of the -150 m H1 d terrace drowning off Kawaihae in response to MWP-1A. We present eight new calibrated C-14-AMS ages, which constrain the timing of terrace drowning to at or after 14.75 + 0.33/-0.42 kyr BP, coeval with the age of reef drowning at Kealakekua Bay (U-Th age 14.72 +/- 0.10 kyr BP), 70 kms south along the west coast. Integrating the chronology with high resolution bathyrnetry and backscatter data, detailed sedimentological analysis, and paleoenvironmental interpretation, we conclude the Hid terrace drowned at the same time along the west coast of Hawaii in response to MWP-1A. The timing of H1d reef drowning is within the reported uncertainty of the timing of MWP-1A interpreted from the IODP Expedition 310 Tahitian reef record. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Organic Soils: Formation, Classification and Environmental Changes
   Records in the Highlands of Southeastern Brazil
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Soils constitute the largest terrestrial carbon (C) pool, representing more than the sum of carbon contained in the atmosphere and vegetation. In this context, organic soils stand out, storing 21% of the global soil organic C stock in only 3% of the Earth's land surface. Moreover, these soils are a key component in our climate system, biodiversity, water cycle and records of environmental changes. Organic soils require specific attention as they provide a large variety of ecosystem services, but also because of their vulnerability to climate change. In this paper, we present a review of terms and concepts related to organic soils, their formation, pedoenvironments, and taxonomic classification. We also present a synthesis of studies in the highlands of southeastern Brazil using these soils as records of environmental change.

TI MIS 21 and the Mid-Pleistocene climate transition: Climate and sea-level
   variation from a sediment core in Osaka Bay, Japan
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB We report climate and sea-level variation for the marine oxygen isotope stage (MIS) 21, encompassing the end of the Mid-Pleistocene climate transition (MPT), based on pollen, diatom, and sulfur records from a 50-m thick sequence in a core from Osaka Bay. An extremely warm climate coincided with the sea level highstand of substage 21.5, when the warm-temperate element Quercus (Cyclobalanopsis) exceeds 40% of total arboreal pollen. This was followed by a warm-temperate to temperate and humid climate that continued until the end of MIS 21. A linear age model shows that climate was dominated by precessional cyclicity, with an inverse correlation between temperature and precipitation. The postglacial sea-level rise reached its highest peak in substage 21.5, when paleo-Osaka Bay reached its maximum extent including Kyoto and Nara Basins. At this time pelagic diatoms were dominant in the central part of the bay. Sea level dropped below the Osaka Bay sill (about -60 m at present) during substage 21.4, followed by a rise above the sill in substage 21.3, and a drop at 21.2. Sea level remained below the sill during substage 21.1. The thermal maximum and sea level peak occurred just after the rapid postglacial sea level rise, after which there was a gradual decline in temperature and sea level accompanied by precession-related oscillations; these features are typical of the post-MPT interglacials dominated by 100-ka cyclicity. These features may be a sign of termination of the MPT. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
AB Global long-term sea-level variability trends and regional coherence patterns were mapped based on hourly sea-level time series data from the 29 longest operating tide gauge stations distributed worldwide. We split sea-level variability into three frequency bands: (1) small-scale synoptic bands (13 d), (2) large-scale synoptic bands (310 d) and (3) planetary-scale bands (10100 d). We then calculated seasonal and annual trends. The most coherent result obtained involved a significant decrease in sea-level variability over the tropical and subtropical Pacific, particularly at the synoptic scale frequencies. Several other coherent regions were found and linked to changes in the global atmosphere. Copyright (c) 2012 Royal Meteorological Society

TI Perspectives on a Seamless Marine-lake Sediment Coring Study in East
   Antarctica
SO JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY-CHIGAKU ZASSHI
AB The Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) is one of the largest potential contributors to future sea-level changes. Recently, an acceleration of AIS volume loss through basal melting and iceberg calving has been reported based on several studies using satellite observations, including radar altimetry, interferometer, and gravity measurements. A recent model that couples ice sheet and climate dynamics and incorporates hydrofracturing mechanism of buttressing ice shelves predicts a higher sea-level rise scenario for the next 500 years. However, the calibration and reproducibility of the sea-level rise projection from these models relies on geological sea-level reconstructions of past warm intervals. This suggests that a highly reliable reconstruction of the past AIS is essential for evaluating its stability and anticipating its contribution to future sea-level rise. In particular, a relative sea-level reconstruction in East Antarctica is the key to solving the problems and refining future projections. The current understanding of sea-level change along the East Antarctic margin is reviewed, including Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) effects, and a new strategy is proposed to address this topic based on seamless sediment coring from marine to lake in the East Antarctic margin. This project will provide essential data on AIS change since the last interglacial period.

TI Vulnerability assessment of southern coastal areas of Iran to sea level
   rise: evaluation of climate change impact
SO OCEANOLOGIA
AB Recent investigations have demonstrated global sea level rise as being due to climate change impact. Probable changes in sea level rise need to be evaluated so that appropriate adaptive strategies can be implemented. This study evaluates the impact of climate change on sea level rise along the Iranian south coast. Climatic data simulated by a GCM (General Circulation Model) named CGCM3 under two-climate change scenarios A1b and A2 are used to investigate the impact of climate change. Among the different variables simulated by this model, those of maximum correlation with sea level changes in the study region and least redundancy among themselves are selected for predicting sea level rise by using stepwise regression. Two Discrete Wavelet artificial Neural Network (DWNN) models and a Discrete Wavelet Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (DWANFIS) are developed to explore the relationship between selected climatic variables and sea level changes. In these models, wavelets are used to disaggregate the time series of input and output data into different components. ANFIS/ANN are then used to relate the disaggregated components of predictors and predictand (sea level) to each other. The results show a significant rise in sea level in the study region under climate change impact, which should be incorporated into coastal area management.

AB Kettle ponds in the Cape Cod National Seashore in southeastern Massachusetts differ in their evolution due to depth of the original ice block, the clay content of outwash in their drainage basins, and their siting in relation to geomorphic changes caused by sea-level rise, barrier beach formation, and saltmarsh development. Stratigraphic records of microfossil, carbon isotope, and sediment changes also document late-glacial and Holocene climatic changes.
   The ponds are separated into 3 groups, each of which follow different development scenarios. Group I ponds date from the late-glacial. They formed in clay-rich outwash, have perched aquifers and continuous lake sediment deposition. The earliest pollen and macrofossil assemblages in Group I pond sediments suggest tundra and spruce-willow parklands before 12 000 yr B.P., boreal forest between 12 000 and 10 500 yr B.P., bog/heath initiation and expansion during the Younger Dryas between 11 000 and 10 000 yr B.P., northern conifer forest between 10 500 and 9500 yr B.P., and establishment of the Cape oak and pitch pine barrens vegetation after 9500 yr B.P. Sedimentation rate changes suggest lowered freshwater levels between 9000 and 5000 yr B.P. caused by decreased precipitation on the Atlantic Coastal Plain. Lake sediment deposition began in the middle Holocene in Group II ponds which formed in clay-poor outwash. These ponds date from about 6000-5000 yr B.P. In these ponds sediment deposition began as sea level rose and the freshwater lens intersected the dry basins. The basal radiocarbon dates of these ponds and stable carbon isotope analyses of the pond sediments suggest a sea-level curve for Cape Cod Bay. Holocene topographic changes in upland and the landscape surrounding the ponds is reconstructed for this coastal area.
   Group III ponds in the late Holocene landscape of the Provincelands dunes originated as interdunal bogs about 1000 yr B.P. and became ponds more recently as water-levels increased. Feat formation in the Provincelands reflects climatic changes evident on both sides of the Atlantic region.

TI MILLENNIAL CYCLES OF MEAN SEA LEVEL EXCITED BY EARTH'S ORBITAL
   VARIATIONS
SO ACTA GEODYNAMICA ET GEOMATERIALIA
AB The millennial climate cycles are an important factor of global environmental changes. These cycles change the polar ice thickness during ice ages, what results in the Mean Sea Level (MSL) changes. The main cause of ice age periods are the so called Milankovich orbital cycles, generated by variations of climatic precession, eccentricity of the Earth's orbit and Earth's axial tilt with respect to its orbital plane with main periods of about 23 ka(1), 40 ka and 100 ka, respectively. The common millennial cycles of MSL and Earth's orbit variations are studied by means of reconstructed MSL time series for the last 800 ka and insolation data of the latest orbital solution of Laskar et al. (2011). The models of the common millennial cycles of MSL and insolation variations are based on partial Fourier approximations with different period bands around 23 ka, 18ka, 11.5 ka, 7.5 ka, 6 ka and 2.3 ka, respectively. These models may help to analyze the Earth's rotation cycles caused by millennial solar activity cycles, such as Hallstatt cycles, and to point out new possible millennial cycles of the solar activity.

TI Natural and anthropogenic aquatic environmental changes reconstructed by
   paleolimnological analyses in Lake Kitaura, central Japan
SO JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY
AB In order to assess the recent anthropogenic environmental changes in Lake Kitaura, central Japan, changes during the past few centuries were reconstructed from results of radiometric and tephrochlonological age determination, magnetic susceptibility measurements, total organic carbon analyses, total nitrogen analyses and fossil diatom analyses on a sediment core from the lake. A total of six major and sub-zones are recognized according to the diatom fossil assemblages, and we discuss aquatic environmental change in Lake Kitaura mainly based on these diatom assemblage change. Zone Ia and Zone Ib (older than AD 1707) are marine to brackish. In Zone IIa (AD 1707-AD 1836), most of the brackish diatoms disappeared, and were replaced by freshwater species indicating a decrease in salinity. We interpret the salinity decrease in Zone I-IIa as a sea-level fall during the Little Ice Age. The salinity of the lake decreased to near freshwater conditions in Zone IIb (AD 1836-AD 1970), which could arise from alteration in River Tone or development of a sandspit in the mouth of River Tone in addition to sea-level change. In Zone IIIa (AD 1970-AD 1987), the diatom assemblage indicates a freshwater environment, and sedimentation rates increase rapidly. These changes reflect sedimentary environment change and an ecosystem transition due to the construction of the tide gate. In Zone IIIb (AD 1987-AD 2002), the diatom flux (valves cm(-2) y(-1)) increased and species composition changed. The changes in Zone IIIb show a good agreement with limnological monitoring data gathered from the lake. These paleolimnological data suggest that the recent human-induced changes of the aquatic environment of the lake after the 1970s exceed rates during the period concerned in this study.

TI Last Glacial Cycle and seismic stratigraphic sequences offshore western
   Hainan Island, NW South China Sea
SO RIVER-DOMINATED SHELF SEDIMENTS OF EAST ASIAN SEAS
SE Geological Society Special Publication
AB In order to investigate the relationship between sea-level changes during the Last Glacial Cycle (LGC) and seismic stratigraphic sequences on the NW continental shelf of the South China Sea, a sparker single-channel high-resolution seismic profiling was correlated with a sediment core taken offshore western Hainan Island. Interpretation of the seismic stratigraphy in relation to local and global sea-level changes could be refined.
   According to the age model, developed from AMS (accelerator mass spectrometry)=C-14 and OSL (optically stimulated luminescence) dates, and delta O-18 (oxygen isotope) stratigraphy, the 88.3 m sediment core reflects environmental change since 110 ka. Correlation with a sediment core in the adjacent basin based on stable oxygen isotope records allows a zonation of the top 15 m of the sediment core and the identification of marine isotope stages (MIS) 1-5e.
   Seven seismic reflectors interpreted as unconformities were identified. These erosional surfaces have been dated by interpolation using an age-depth model compared to global eustatic curves. The results indicate that seven sea-level cycles can be distinguished in the study area during the LGC, and these are correlated with regional and global sea-level change models. Further research confirms that seismic stratigraphy in the NW South China Sea can be intimately related to LGC sea-level changes associated with regional surface uplift and sediment supply.

TI Subsistence continuity, change, and environmental adaptation at the site
   of Nugljanska, Istria, Croatia
SO ENVIRONMENTAL ARCHAEOLOGY
AB This paper investigates changes in subsistence strategies at the upland cave site of Nugljanska (Croatia) at the end of the last ice age, during a time of rapid sea level rise and changing environment. We analysed the faunal assemblage from archaeological levels spanning the Pleistocene Holocene transition (15,000-8000 years BP) and evaluated changes in relative abundance of species, measured species diversity, and compared the representation of terrestrial mammal and marine resources. We found a significant shift in the most abundant prey species exploited (from red deer, Cervus, to wild boar, Sus). There was some correlation between dietary diversification and periods of increased moisture availability and the spread of deciduous forest in the area. Our results suggest that there was a continuing reliance on terrestrial resources throughout time and that changes in dietary patterns were likely due to local environmental change and potentially, changing seasonal mobility strategies, at the Pleistocene Holocene transition.

Delay is dangerous because of system inertias that could create a situation with future sea level changes out of our control. I argue for calling together a panel of scientific leaders to hear evidence and issue a prompt plain-written report on current understanding of the sea level change issue.

TI Nonlinear Dynamics and Alternative Stable States in Shallow Coastal
   Systems
SO OCEANOGRAPHY
AB The dynamics of shallow-water coastal environments are controlled by external drivers-sea level rise, storms, and sediment and nutrient supplies-and by internal feedbacks. Interactions of biotic processes (vegetation growth, trophic dynamics) and abiotic drivers can lead to nonlinear responses to changing conditions and to the emergence of thresholds, hysteresis, and alternative stable states. We develop a conceptual framework for studying interactions between the dynamics of marshes and habitats in shallow coastal bays with unconsolidated sediments (seagrass, oyster reefs). Using examples primarily from the Virginia Coast Reserve Long Term Ecological Research site, we show that in the subtidal part of the landscape, two alternative stable states can exist-one dominated by seagrass up to a certain depth that represents a tipping point to the second, unvegetated stable state. The depth limit of the seagrass stable state is influenced by (1) the positive feedback of vegetation on reducing sediment suspension and improving the light environment for growth, (2) climate (e.g., temperature), and (3) water quality. Two stable states are also present in intertidal areas, with salt marshes lying above mean sea level and tidal flats below mean sea level. State transitions are driven by sediment availability, sea level rise, the relative strength of wind waves with respect to tidal currents, and the biotic feedback of vegetation on sediment stabilization and accretion. State-change dynamics in one system may propagate to adjacent systems, and this coupling may influence the landscape-scale response to environmental change. Seagrass meadows and oyster reefs affect adjacent marshes both positively (wave attenuation) and negatively (reduced sediment supply), and marsh-edge erosion could negatively influence the light environment for seagrass growth. Forecasting the resilience of coastal ecosystems and the landscape-scale response to environmental change in the next century requires an understanding of nonlinear dynamics, including the possibility of multiple stable states, the coupled evolution of adjacent systems, and potential early warning signs of thresholds of change.

TI Climatic changes documented by stable isotopes of sedimentary carbonate
   in Lake Sugan, northeastern Tibetan Plateau of China, since 2 kaBP
SO CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN
AB Lake Sugan at the northern edge of the Qaidam Basin was selected as the research object. The temporal sequence of sedimentary cores retrieved from Lake Sugan since 2 kaBP was reconstructed using the Pb-210, AMS C-14 and conventional 14 C dating methods. Carbon and oxygen isotopes of carbonate in the fine-grained lake sediments were analysed. Combined with the changes of delta(18)O values of surface water and air temperature observation data in the study area, it might be thought that the delta(18)O value of the carbonate indicates effective moisture, and the changes in delta(18)O values are related to annual freeze-up duration of the lake and indirectly indicate air temperature changes in winter half year. From the above, the sequence of climatic changes in the region since 2 kaBP was established. The climatic changes experienced five stages: Warm-dry climate during 0-190 AD; cold-dry climate during 190-580 AD; warm-dry climate during 580-1200 AD (MWP); cold-wet climate during 1200-1880 AD (LIA); cold-dry climate during 1880-1950 AD; and climate warming since 1950s. The air temperature changes in winter half year reflected by carbon isotope since 2 kaBP are in good agreement with the historical literature records and other geologic records, which shows that the climate changes recorded by the stable isotopes from Lake Sugan since 2 kaBP are of universal significance.

TI A multi-proxy record of the Latest Danian Event at Gebel Qreiya, Eastern
   Desert, Egypt
SO JOURNAL OF MICROPALAEONTOLOGY
AB The Latest Danian Event (LDE) is a proposed early Palaeogene transient warming event similar to the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, albeit of smaller magnitude. The LDE can be correlated with a carbon isotope excursion ('CIE-DS1') at Zumaia, Spain, and the 'top Chron C27n event' defined recently from ocean drilling sites in the Atlantic and Pacific, supporting a global extent. Yet, records of environmental change during the LDE (e.g. warming and sea-level fluctuations) are still rare. In this study, we focus on the micropalaeontology (calcareous nannofossils and benthic foraminifera), mineralogy and trace element geochemistry of the LDE in the Qreiya 3 section from the southern Tethyan margin in Egypt. In this section, the LDE is characterized by the occurrence of anomalous beds intercalated within upper Danian shales and marls. The event beds of the LDE are situated above an unconformity on top of a shallowing-upwards sequence deposited in a well-oxygenated outer neritic to upper bathyal marine palaeoenvironment. The lower LDE bed is barren of benthic foraminifera, but contains pyrite and fish remains, and is interpreted as an anoxic level formed during rapid relative sea-level rise. Incursion of a Neoeponides duwi (Nakkady, 1950) benthic assemblage in LDE bed II is interpreted as repopulation of the seafloor after anoxia. The sea-level cycle associated with the LDE is estimated at about 50 m maximum in the Qreiya 3 section. The environmental changes at Qreiya 3 are of supraregional extent, since a similar sequence of events has been observed at other southern Tethyan locations. J.

AB Recent excavations of Tel Yafo (Jaffa), Israel, underscore its role as an historically important Mediterranean port. In 2014, the Ioppa Maritima Project conducted a geological investigation determining that from ca. 5000-2000 years BP, a small estuarine system existed east and north of Tel Yafo that could have served as a harbour. The marine re-entrant formed through sea-level rise and flooding of a small valley, and the stream mouth was probably also partially blocked by coastal sands. Sediment aggradation, wetland development, and anthropogenic activity largely filled the embayment leaving only a depression east of Tel Yafo in the area of Bloomfield Stadium and Groningen Park.

AB It is considered that climate change has been increasing the global air temperature and rising sea level. Thus, the monitoring of sea level is necessary to mitigate the hazard risk. For estimating sea level change from various altimetric missions, attention must be taken to determine the bias of measurements between altimetric different missions. The aim of this study is to merge both of Jason series and Envisat satellite altimeters for estimating sea level variability around the Indonesian Seas. To create sea level time series, two adjustment methods are employed: tandem mission data and sea level anomaly differences at crossovers. The adjustment using tandem mission between Jason-1 and Jason-2 obtained a relative difference of 32.8 +/- 5.4 mm. The adjustment method at crossovers is applied for combining Envisat and Jason series which is already intercalibrated. The mean crossovers differences between Envisat and reference missions are less than 2.5 cm. By using merged datasets from all missions, it is discovered that the trend in the Indonesian seas for a period of 10 years is 11.9 mm years(-1). The map of sea level trends from all satellites data for that period is performed in 1 degrees x 1 degrees regular grids.

TI Middle and Late Pennsylvanian cyclothems, American Midcontinent: Ice-age
   environmental changes and terrestrial biotic dynamics
SO COMPTES RENDUS GEOSCIENCE
AB The Pennsylvanian portion of the Late Paleozoic Ice Age was characterized by stratigraphic repetition of chemical and siliciclastic rocks in the equatorial regions of the Pangean interior. Known as "cyclothems", these stratigraphic successions are a 10(5) yr-record of glacial waxing and waning, superimposed on longer term, 10(6) yr intervals of global warming and cooling and a still longer term trend of increasing equatorial aridity. During periods of maximum ice-minimum sea level, the interior craton was widely exposed. Epicontinental landscapes were initially subjected to dry subhumid climate when first exposed, as sea level fell, but transitioned to humid climates and widespread wetlands during maximum lowstands. During interglacials (ice-minima) seasonally dry vegetation predominated. The wetland and seasonally dry biomes were compositionally distinct and had different ecological and evolutionary dynamics.

TI TERRESTRIAL AND MARINE RECORDS OF CLIMATIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGES
   DURING THE PLIOCENE IN SUBTROPICAL FLORIDA
SO GEOLOGY
AB Pollen, ostracode, and benthic foraminifer assemblages deposited during sea-level high-stands in subtropical Florida record a climate change during the period 4.5-1.0 Ma. Before 3.5 Ma, open-shelf marine faunas and pollen assemblages with abundant Pinus, Quercus, Fagus, Carya, and nonarboreal pollen were present, indicating cooler conditions than today. From approximately 3.5 to 1.0 Ma, marine and terrestrial records indicate warmer conditions, similar to those existing in south Florida today. Combined with evidence for much warmer than modern conditions at high latitudes, these data suggest that increased poleward oceanic heat transport, possibly related to the emergence of the Central American isthmus between approximately 3.5 and 2.5 Ma, was a major influence on mid-Pliocene warmth.

TI Interaction of Sea-Level Pulses With Periodically Retreating Barrier
   Islands
SO FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
AB Submerged barrier deposits preserved on continental shelf seabeds provide a record of paleocoastal environmental change from the last glacial maximum through the Holocene. The formation of these offshore deposits is often attributed to intermittent periods of rapidly rising sea levels, especially glacial meltwater pulses, which are expected to lead to partial or complete drowning - overstepping - of migrating barrier islands. However, recent cross-shore modeling and field evidence suggests that even for constant sea-level rise and shelf slope, the internal dynamics of migrating barriers could plausibly drive periodic retreat accompanied by autogenic partial overstepping and deposition of barrier sediment. We hypothesize that the interaction of periodic retreat with changes in external (allogenic) forcing from sea-level rise may create novel retreat responses and corresponding relict barrier deposits. Specifically, we posit that autogenic deposits can be amplified by an increased rate of relative sea-level rise, while in other cases internal dynamics can disrupt or mask the production of allogenic deposits. Here, we model barriers through a range of autogenic-allogenic interactions, exploring how barriers with different inherent autogenic periods respond to discrete, centennial-scale sea-level-rise pulses of variable magnitude and timing within the autogenic transgressive barrier cycle. Our results demonstrate a diversity of depositional signals, where production of relict sands is amplified or suppressed depending on both the barrier's internal dynamic state and the pulse magnitude. We also show that millennial-scale autogenic periodicity renders barriers vulnerable to complete drowning for relatively low pulse rates of rise (<15 mm/year).

TI A statistical protocol for a holistic adjustment of global sea level
   budget
SO JOURNAL OF GEODETIC SCIENCE
AB Current studies in global mean sea level, GMSL, studies assess the closure/misclosure of the GMSL budget components and their uncertainties. Because Earth's hydrosphere conserves water, a closed global mean sea level budget with a consistent set of estimates and their statistics is necessary. An unclosed budget means that there are problems to be addressed such as biases in the budget components, unreliable error statistics about the estimates, unknown or known but unmodeled budget components. In a misclosed global mean sea level budget, as practiced in recent studies, the trend estimates for the budget components and their errors account only for the anomalies of each budget component in isolation. On the other hand, the trend of each series must consider the trends of the other series in tandem such that the global mean sea level budget is closed for a holistic assessment, which can only be achieved by adjusting global mean sea level budget components simultaneously. In this study, we demonstrate a statistical protocol to ameliorate this deficiency, which potentially have implications for future sea level science studies, including the future Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Reports, and the US Climate Assessment Reports.

TI Pathways, motivations and challenges: contemporary Tuvaluan migration to
   New Zealand
SO GEOJOURNAL
AB The global climate change literature suggests that at some point in the future it is possible that low-lying areas may be drowned due to rising sea levels, and a number of Pacific Ocean states could be particularly vulnerable. It is increasingly evident that the emerging scenario of environmental change has compounded more established push-pull factors leading to migration, and has provided a new imperative for migration decision-making. By interrogating the proposition that there is a clear distinction between the policy categories of 'migrants' and 'refugees,' we examine a hitherto un-defined group of Tuvaluan migrants whose movement is in response to environmental change and possible climate change effects. The paper examines Tuvaluan migration to New Zealand through various immigration schemes for permanent residency, with an emphasis on the International/ Humanitarian stream.

TI A 7000-year history of coastal environmental changes from Mexico's
   Pacific coast: A multi-proxy record from Laguna Mitla, Guerrero
SO HOLOCENE
AB The lack of multi-millennial multi-proxy paleoenvironmental reconstructions from Mexico's Pacific coast has limited our understanding of the regional response to climate change and sea-level rise. A 479-cm core covering the last 6900 years was extracted from Laguna Mitla in the state of Guerrero on Mexico's Pacific coast. Beginning as a Rhizophora-dominated salt pan 6900 yr BP, at 6500 yr BP, the site transitioned to a mangrove swamp dominated by Laguncularia, which lasted about 300 years. The beach barrier formed from 6200 to 5200 yr BP, during which time, the site existed as an intermittently sheltered bay, the result of large, rapid changes in wave energy associated with the shifting barrier location and changes in stability. After the beach barrier was stabilized at 5200 yr BP, water level at the coring site became a function of precipitation rather than sea level. Since that time, deposition has alternated between peat, laid down in a mangrove swamp, and clay intervals characterized by high concentrations of titanium and a predominantly regional pollen signal, representing open-water lagoon phases. Seven periods of increased water level, varying in duration, occurred during the backbarrier period, with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) likely the main climatic mechanism causing these periodic shifts in the paleo-precipitation levels. We suggest that the deepest water levels detected over the last 3200 years correlate with periods of increased ENSO activity. The spatial distribution of tropical cyclone rainfall, which represents a significant percentage of total annual precipitation along Mexico's Pacific coast, may explain the inconsistencies between our record and paleoclimatic records from Mexico's interior, but more work is needed to test this hypothesis.

TI Relict inland mangrove ecosystem reveals Last Interglacial sea levels
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Climatic oscillations during the Pleistocene played a major role in shaping the spatial distribution and demographic dynamics of Earth's biota, including our own species. The Last Interglacial (LIG) or Eemian Period (ca. 130 to 115 thousand years B.P.) was particularly influential because this period of peak warmth led to the retreat of all ice sheets with concomitant changes in global sea level. The impact of these strong environmental changes on the spatial distribution of marine and terrestrial ecosystems was severe as revealed by fossil data and paleogeographic modeling. Here, we report the occurrence of an extant, inland mangrove ecosystem and demonstrate that it is a relict of the LIG. This ecosystem is currently confined to the banks of the freshwater San Pedro Martir River in the interior of the Mexico- Guatemala El Peten rainforests, 170 km away from the nearest ocean coast but showing the plant composition and physiognomy typical of a coastal lagoon ecosystem. Integrating genomic, geologic, and floristic data with sea level modeling, we present evidence that this inland ecosystem reached its current location during the LIG and has persisted there in isolation ever since the oceans receded during the Wisconsin glaciation. Our study provides a snapshot of the Pleisto-cene peak warmth and reveals biotic evidence that sea levels sub-stantially influenced landscapes and species ranges in the tropics during this period.

TI Recent coastal sea-level variations and flooding events in the Nigerian
   Transgressive Mud coast of Gulf of Guinea
SO JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
AB Significant warming and sea-level rise that will greatly impact the coastal zone is expected to intensify the coastal flooding occurrence on low-lying coasts in the next few decades. This challenge necessitates improving understanding of the possible trends and contributions of different oceanic forcing to the local coastal sea-level change at different time-scales at different locations. The present study seeks to understand different processes responsible for sea-level variations and coastal flooding events along the low-lying Nigerian Transgressive Mahin Mud coast in the Gulf of Guinea. The contributions of astronomical tides, altimetry-derived sea level, meteorologically forced non-tide residuals and wave run-up to coastal sea-level variations were assessed over the period between 1993 and 2016. The results show a distinct seasonal cycle, with more occurrences during summer/wet season and fewer events in winter/dry season, typically connected to the annual cycles of swell-waves. The leading contributor to total sea-level variations along this mud coast, at daily, seasonal and inter-annual time-scales was wave run-up. However, the leading contributor to total sea-level variations at the monthly (subannual) time scale was astronomical tides. Results further show that while the altimetry-derived sea level was responsible for the trend in total sea-level variability, the wave run-up was the major forcing responsible for the extreme coastal flooding events. However, the interaction between wave run-up and astronomical tides further contributed to the extreme/coastal flooding events along the mud coast. It is concluded that the increase in the coastal flooding events in the last 12 years of the study may have rendered the study area vulnerable to chronic erosion and flood hazards, which may have triggered the accelerated rate of coastal degradation in the study area.

TI Physical impacts of climatic change on deltaic coastal systems .1. An
   approach
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
AB The evaluation of the impact of climate change on deltaic systems implies studying a multi-component system in which the complexity of links is high enough to present doing it as a whole. Because of this, it is a reasonable approach to study separately the behaviour of each element, to be afterwards linked into a general conceptual model for deltaic behaviour. Moreover, in the case of largely regulated deltas, the main impacts of climatic change will be marine-related since those related to the catchment areas will be severely damped by river regulation and management policies. This fact implies that coastal fringes may become the main frontier between the delta and climatic change effects. In this context, a methodology to study climatic change impacts on deltaic coastal fringes is here presented. It will be further developed on two companion papers dealing with the study of driving terms and coastal response. As coastal processes act at different time and space scales, determining the 'reference' - initial - situation must be done taking into account the inherent system dynamics. It is thus unrealistic to characterize the initial stage as a static one. In order to avoid this simplistic approach, a comprehensive approach to the coastal system must be employed, with three different scales (long-term/large scale, medium term/scale and episodic).

AB On the paraglacial coast of Northern Ireland the late Holocene sea level history involves a rise from a lowstand at 13ka to cross the present level by around 7kaBP reaching a few metres above present by 5ka BP and a Subsequent fall to present sea level. 'Raised' or 'stranded' beaches associated with the late Holocene highstand are distributed widely around the Northern Ireland Coast but have received little geomorphological or sedimentological study. In this paper we report on investigations at Millin Bay on the Ards Peninsula where a raised beach is exposed in a 3m-high scarp at the rear of the modern beach. Sedimentological analysis, coupled with GPR investigations provide insights into the development and preservation of the raised beach. A compressed basal peat on which the beach rests, represents a former back-barrier lagoon developed oil poorly drained underlying glacial clay. The raised beach itself comprises sand and gravel with occasional shell concentrations, similar to modern beaches in the locality and is topped by a relict aeolian dune deposit. However, the late Holocene beach is over 3m thick and over 50m wide whereas the contemporary beach comprises a thin (typically< 30cm) veneer overlying bedrock. This points to an abundance of sediment in the late Holocene compared to the modern sediment-starved condition. We attribute the reduction in sediment supply to stranding of sediment Sources (eroding glacial bluffs) as sea level fell. The implications for environmental change during future sea level rise are discussed.

TI Sea-level change as the driver for lake formation in the Yangtze Plain -
   A review
SO GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
AB The Yangtze Plain (floodplains in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River) is a region with numerous lakes, including the three largest freshwater lakes in China, i.e. Poyang Lake (PYL), Dongting Lake (DTL), and Taihu Lake (THL). The formation mechanism of these lakes offers insights into the ongoing debate concerning the interaction between tectonic activity, climate, sea-level, human impact, and Earth-surface processes. Previous studies have usually focused on individual lakes, so there remains no over-arching and consistent framework for lake formation in the region as a whole. Here we review published sedimentary and chronological records on the above three lakes and propose that sea-level change has determined their formation. During the last glacial maximum (LGM; ca 30-20 ka), with a sea-level > 120 m lower than present, a landscape of incised valleys and interfluves prevailed over the entire Yangtze Plain, including the DTL area, which is > 1400 km upstream from the modern river mouth, and there was no large lake on the plain. The lakes emerged in the Holocene, although more precise ages await further investigations. The glacial sea-level lowstand, with concomitant headward incision, was responsible for the extensive deeply incised landscape of the LGM, whereas the Holocene high sea-level, with resultant infilling of the incised valleys, accounted for the formation of lakes. This sea-level forcing hypothesis suggests a more far-reaching influence of sea-level change on the Yangtze Plain, and a closer relationship between Earth-surface processes and glacial interglacial cycles (global climate) than is commonly believed. According to our newly hypothesized climate-controlled geomorphological (CCG) model, it is very likely that similar lake-forming processes could have occurred multiple times during earlier glacial-interglacial cycles, and that this pattern might also have occurred in many other river systems in the eastern coastal areas of China, as well as in other similar river plains worldwide, thus having an important role in shaping modern coastal-plain landscapes. Further work is required to test this CCG model.

TI Geomorphological Signature of Late Pleistocene Sea Level Oscillations in
   Torre Guaceto Marine Protected Area (Adriatic Sea, SE Italy)
SO WATER
AB Morphostratigraphy is a useful tool to reconstruct the sequence of processes responsible for shaping the landscape. In marine and coastal areas, where landforms are only seldom directly recognizable given the difficulty to have eyewitness of sea-floor features, it is possible to correlate geomorphological data derived from indirect surveys (marine geophysics and remote sensing) with data obtained from direct ones performed on-land or by scuba divers. In this paper, remote sensing techniques and spectral images allowed high-resolution reconstruction of both morpho-topography and morpho-bathymetry of the Torre Guaceto Marine Protected Area (Italy). These data were used to infer the sequence of climatic phases and processes responsible for coastal and marine landscape shaping. Our data show a number of relict submerged surfaces corresponding to distinct phases of erosional/depositional processes triggered by the late-Quaternary interglacial-glacial cycles. In particular, we observed the presence of submerged marine terraces, likely formed during MIS 5-MIS 3 relative highstand phases. These geomorphic features, found at depths of similar to 26-30, similar to 34-38, and similar to 45-56 m, represent important evidence of past sea-level variations.

TI Long-term changes in sea-level components in Latin America and the
   Caribbean
SO GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
AB When considering the threat of rising sea-levels, one must take into account not only the changes in the Mean Sea-Level, but also storm surges and changes in extreme events which may also have a bearing on coastal problems. In this study, we combine different components of the total sea-level (astronomical tide, monthly mean sea-level and storm surges) to explain changes detected in the region of Latin America and the Caribbean. Methods based on non-stationary extreme value analysis were applied to storm surge and total sea elevations monthly maxima for the last six decades, while long-term trends in Mean Sea-level were computed from both local regression and a trend-EOF technique. In addition, the relative importance of each factor contributing to the total sea-level is explored by means of defining each statistical distribution. The analysis demonstrates that concerns should be focused on the different components of sea-level in the various areas of the region. For example, changes in the storm surge levels are a key stressor in the Rio de la Plata area, while the increase in the extreme total sea-levels in the tropical region and the influence of inter-annual variability on its western coast are the prominent factors. Results show that a clear correspondence between Mean Sea-Level and the Nino3 climate index can be found through a simple regression model, explaining more than 65% of the variance for a representative location on the Peruvian coast.

AB Sea level rise is a common problem for many coastal communities. It is crucial that they plan for the future and determine how to best protect themselves. Sea level planning is currently left to states and local communities to outline how they can mitigate or adapt to the changing sea level. Without a coordinated effort, many communities must independently write their sea level plans based on publicly available information. These communities would benefit from a national coordinated effort, led by the Federal Government, to offer expert information for better planning. An assessment of current state and local plans provides a baseline to understand sea level mitigation needs. This study categorized the different sea level plans of states, counties, and communities along the Gulf Coast and Mid-Atlantic to determine how Federal Agencies can best assist local communities in sea level rise planning.

TI Late Cretaceous (Campanian) carbon isotope events, sea-level change and
   correlation of the Tethyan and Boreal realms
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB Carbon stable-isotope stratigraphy provides unique insights into environmental change during the Campanian, the longest (83.5-71.3 Ma), but least well-understood stage of the Late Cretaceous. A new carbon isotope (delta(13)C) profile for a 500-m-thick Campanian-basal Maastrichtian Tethyan pelagic-hemipelagic section near El Kef, northern Tunisia, is calibrated using data from a biostratigraphically well-constrained succession at Kalaat Senan. The general shapes of the Tunisian delta(13)C reference curve and published Tethyan delta(13)C profiles from Elles (Tunisia) and Bidart (SW France), and a Boreal curve for the Trunch borehole (eastern England), are remarkably similar in all three areas. A positive carbon isotope event of +0.2parts per thousand delta(13)C in the mid-Campanian dated at 78.7 Ma and a negative excursion of -0.4 parts per thousand in the upper Campanian at 74.8 Ma can be correlated between Tunisia and England. A positive excursion of +0.3 parts per thousand at 83.7 Ma spans the Santonian-Campanian boundary. These isotope events enable precise inter-regional correlations that are consistent with published nannofossil data. Review of Campanian sea-level data from North Africa, the Middle East and northern Europe indicates that major shifts in delta(13)C profiles coincide with changes in eustatic sea-level. Relatively stable delta(13)C values in the lower Campanian and their long-term fall through the upper Campanian reflect high and then falling eustatic sea-levels, and increased carbonate production. Short-term (similar to600 kyr) positive excursions record greater organic productivity and/or organic matter preservation, and decreased carbonate fluxes during periods of rapid sea-level rise and the drowning of carbonate platforms. Excursions were terminated by falling nutrient supply and increased carbonate deposition associated with epicontinental sea expansion and renewed carbonate platform growth during the late transgression and highstand. Negative excursions are linked principally to reworking of marine and terrestrial organic matter during rapid sea-level fall. Carbon isotope stratigraphy is a powerful tool for correlation which can be used to test the validity of Campanian global biostratigraphic frameworks, and improve our understanding of the nature and timing of Late Cretaceous sea-level change.

TI Climatic Changes and Their Impacts in the Mediterranean during the First
   Millennium AD
SO ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIETY IN THE LONG LATE ANTIQUITY
AB Many events and developments in human history have been suspected to be, at least partly, influenced by climate and environmental changes. In order to investigate climate impacts on societies, reliable palaeoclimatic data of adequate dating precision, resolution, spatial representativeness, and so on, are needed. This paper presents a survey and analysis of published palaeoclimatic data of the Mediterranean for the 1st millennium AD, and identifies regional patterns of hydroclimate variability, useful for comparison with archaeological/historical studies. It also provides general guidelines to palaeoclimatic data for archaeologists/historians interested in climatic change. We conclude with a discussion of how the emerging patterns of regional climate histories may have had an impact on Mediterranean societies in Late Antiquity.

TI Incorporating sediment compaction into a gravitationally self-consistent
   model for ice age sea-level change
SO GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
AB Sea-level changes are of wide interest because they regulate coastal hazards, shape the sedimentary geologic record and are sensitive to climate change. In areas where rivers deliver sediment to marine deltas and fans, sea-level changes are strongly modulated by the deposition and compaction of marine sediment. Deposition affects sea level by increasing the elevation of the seafloor, by perturbing crustal elevation and gravity fields and by reducing the volume of seawater through the incorporation of water into sedimentary pore space. In a similar manner, compaction affects sea level by lowering the elevation of the seafloor and by purging water out of sediments and into the ocean. Here we incorporate the effects of sediment compaction into a gravitationally self-consistent global sea-level model by extending the approach of Dalca et al. (2013). We show that incorporating compaction requires accounting for two quantities that are not included in the Dalca et al. (2013) analysis: the mean porosity of the sediment and the degree of saturation in the sediment. We demonstrate the effects of compaction by modelling sea-level responses to two simplified 122-kyr sediment transfer scenarios for the Amazon River system, one including compaction and one neglecting compaction. These simulations show that the largest effect of compaction is on the thickness of the compacting sediment, an effect that is largest where deposition rates are fastest. Compaction can also produce minor sea-level changes in coastal regions by influencing shoreline migration and the location of seawater loading, which perturbs crustal elevations. By providing a tool for modelling gravitationally self-consistent sea-level responses to sediment compaction, this work offers an improved approach for interpreting the drivers of past sea-level changes.

TI Late Quaternary (Marine Isotope Stage 3 to Recent) sedimentary evolution
   of the Basque shelf (southern Bay of Biscay)
SO BOREAS
AB Late Quaternary (MIS 3 to Recent) oceanographic evolution of the Basque shelf has been analysed for the first time based on the sedimentological analysis of three cores obtained from the middle and outer shelves. The cores are located in two interfluves separated by the San Sebastian canyon. The variability of the percentage of the planktonic foraminifera species Neogloboquadrina pachyderma sin. and of O-18(bull) allowed us to identify the influence of colder and warmer waters in the Basque shelf during the late Quaternary. From approximate to 56cal. ka BP to the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (19cal. ka BP) the sedimentary record shows a decreasing trend in the mean grain size that correlates with the eustatic sea-level fall. The last Deglaciation (19-11.5cal. ka BP) is characterized by a sea-level rise that produced an important hiatus in the western outer shelf. During the Holocene, the middle and outer shelves present different behaviours. From 11.5 to 6.7cal. ka BP, in the outer shelf the sea-level rise that started during the Deglaciation produced a hiatus, whereas in the middle shelf the sedimentary succession records the presence of warm to temperate waters. Between 6.7-4.9cal. ka BP, the entrance of cold surface water-masses that only affected the middle shelf has been identified, and temperate to warm waters occurred in the outer shelf. The cold surface water-masses retreated during 4.9-4.3cal. ka BP in the middle shelf. Finally, from 4.3cal. ka BP to Recent, the middle shelf registers a hiatus due to sea-level stabilization after a generalized transgression, synchronous to a decrease in the energy of the water-masses in the outer shelf. In conclusion, the environmental changes detected in the Basque shelf are attributed to both regional and eustatic sea-level changes.

TI Evidences of Late Quaternary neotectonic activity and sea-level changes
   along the western continental margin of India
SO CURRENT SCIENCE
AB The offshore data on sea-level changes along the western margin of India have been reviewed and evidences of Late Quaternary neotectonic activity and subsidence are documented, based on the diagenetic textures of limestones from deeper submarine terraces and from the Fifty Fathom Flat off Saurashtra-Bombay, authigenic clays from the Kerala continental and onshore data. Offshore sea-level data to the eustatic sea-level show about 40m subsidence sometime in the Holocene. Existing sea-level curves may not reflect the true sea-level changes. As there are several gaps in the data base, it is suggested that more systematically collected offshore data is an immediate requirement to chart the accurate sea-level changes and construct a regional sea-level curve for the Late Quaternary.

TI CLIMATIC-CHANGE AND THE FUTURE OF ATOLL STATES
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB The combination of rising sea level and increased storminess that is expected to accompany changes in global climate due to the greenhouse effect may well have severe impacts on low-lying coral islands in tropical oceans.  This paper deals principally with the atoll island states of Kiribati, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Tokelau and Tuvalu which comprise only coral-rubble islands with land rarely rising more than 3 m above present sea level.  Their combined populations are about 300,000, and since colonial times, island economies have not achieved self-sufficiency.  Presently they are substantially dependent on foreign aid and remittances from islanders who work overseas.  The situation is worsening as natural resources decline, populations grow, aspirations for better living standards increase and the terms of trade worsen.  Atoll island ecology and the ability to sustain human habitation depend in large part on fresh ground water reserves which are related to island size.  Ground water degradation due to greenhouse-induced coastal erosion and inundation of low-lying ground will further reduce agricultural productivity and other island resources.  The economic and social viability of atoll island states in the future is therefore doubtful; their people may become the first environmental refugees of the greenhouse era.

TI Microbioerosion in Tahitian reefs: a record of environmental change
   during the last deglacial sea-level rise (IODP 310)
SO LETHAIA
AB The main motivation for Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 310 to the Tahitian Archipelago was the assumption that the last deglacial sea-level rise is precisely recorded in the coral reefs of this far-field site. The Tahitian deglacial succession typically consists of coral framework subsequently encrusted by coralline algae and microbialites. The high abundance of microbialites is uncommon for shallow-water coral reefs, and the environmental conditions favouring their development are still poorly understood.
   Microbioerosion patterns in the three principal framework components (corals, coralline algae, microbialites) are studied with respect to relative light availability during coral growth and subsequent encrustation, in order to constrain the palaeobathymetry and the relative timing of the encrustation. Unexpectedly for a tropical, light-flooded setting, ichnotaxa typical for the deep-euphotic to dysphotic zone dominate. The key ichnotaxa for the shallow euphotic zone are scarce in the analysed sample set, and are restricted to the base of the deglacial succession, thus reflecting the deglacial sea-level rise.
   At the base of the deglacial reef succession, the ichnocoenoses present in the corals indicate shallower bathymetries than those in the encrusting microbialites. This is in agreement with radiocarbon data that indicate a time gap of more than 600 years between coral death and microbialite formation. At the top of the deglacial reef succession, in contrast, the microbioerosion patterns in the three framework components indicate a uniform palaeobathymetry, and radiocarbon ages imply that encrustation took place shortly after coral demise.
   An enigma arises from the fact that the ichnocoenoses imply photic conditions that appear very deep for zooxanthellate coral growth. During the deglacial sea-level rise increased nutrients and fluvial influx may have led to (seasonal?) eutrophication, condensing the photic zonation. This would have exerted stress on the coral ecosystem and played a significant role in initiating microbialite development.

TI Holocene sea level and environmental change on the west coast of South
   Africa: evidence from plant biomarkers, stable isotopes and pollen
SO JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY
AB We present an 8000-year biomarker and stable carbon isotope record from the Verlorenvlei Estuary, South Africa. We assessed how leaf wax lipids, insoluble macromolecular organic matter, bulk C/N data and compound-specific stable carbon isotopes were linked to the site's palynological record and to evidence for regional sea level and environmental change. Down-core trends in bulk delta C-13 are closely coupled to trends in pollen types from saline-tolerant taxa. These trends are mirrored by variations in the incorporation of reduced sulphur into macromolecular organic matter. This process, quantified with the thiophene ratio, is closely associated with periods of higher sea level 8,000-4,300 cal yr BP. We propose the thiophene ratio is a proxy for relative marine influence within (peri) estuarine sediments. All measured variables indicate differences between early-middle Holocene (8,000-4,300 cal BP) and late Holocene conditions at Verlorenvlei. The former period was more saline and preserves more labile macromolecular organic matter. Marine influence declined after 4,300 cal yr BP, and although the abundance of short-chain-length n-alkanes suggests continued presence of wetland flora until 2,500 cal yr BP, organic matter preservation became poorer and a drying trend was inferred, most notably for the interval 2,500-900 cal BP. Increasing freshwater inundation is apparent during the last 700 cal yr, consistent with several records from this region. Leaf wax n-alkane distributions are largely uncorrelated with bulk organic matter variables, with the exception of the abundance of C-31 and C-33 n-alkanes, which are negatively correlated with delta C-13(TOC). Furthermore, C-31-C-33 n-alkane delta C-13 values are uncorrelated with C-23-C-29 delta C-13 and delta C-13(TOC). They are also higher than our newly measured terrestrial (C-3) vegetation C-29 and C-31 end-member values of -35 +/- A 2 and -34 +/- A 1 aEuro degrees, respectively. These patterns are best explained by a dominant contribution of local riparian vegetation to the C-23-C-29 n-alkanes, but time-varying contributions of non-local leaf waxes to the C-31-C-33 signals. This renders inferences concerning regional environmental change from long-chain leaf waxes potentially challenging in this setting.

TI The Danube Delta: The Achilles Heel of Danube River-Danube Delta-Black
   Sea Region Fish Diversity under a Black Sea Impact Scenario Due to Sea
   Level Rise-A Prospective Review
SO FISHES
AB The Danube Delta is one of Earth's biodiversity hotspots and includes many endemic, rare, and important species of both major conservation and economic value. This unique complex of ecosystems also plays a key role for Danube River and Black Sea fish fauna through its role as a natural safe buffer, shelter, feeding, reproduction, and smooth transitional area for a large number of fish species. Climate change is inducing a progressive sea level rise in the Black Sea, a fact that is expected to impact the delta's key complex and dynamic habitats, biocoenoses, and associated biota, and last but not least the key taxonomic group, namely, fish. Around one-third of the fish species of this delta will be greatly affected, sometimes negatively, by this climate change scenario, another one-third to a lesser extent, and the final one-third not at all. The ecological positive feedback of fish can stimulate environmental change and is expected to be responsible for changes within Danube Delta ecosystems, and also for the near Danube River and Black Sea diverse matrix of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems. Sea level rise in the Black Sea is considered to have been one of the main stress factors of the Danube Delta fish fauna in the past, and is likely to be the case in the future. In this spatio-temporal dynamic context, for the fish species under threat and risk, in situ-adapted management measures are highly required. The current work brings for the first time such a prospective knowledge about the potential impact on Danube River-Danube Delta-Black Sea coast fish diversity in the potential climate change-sea level rise scenario.

TI Holocene filling of a narrow estuary in a regressive coast: The
   Paleo-Kinu Bay region, central Japan
SO MARINE GEOLOGY
AB Estuaries are typical depositional systems of transgressive coasts; however, depositional systems with similar geometry also occur on regressive coasts. Such "regressive estuaries " are found in areas of Asia, South America, and Australia that have experienced relative sea-level lowering since the middle Holocene. Regressive estuaries form in incised valleys that were drowned by the last deglacial sea-level rise and receive relatively little riverine sediment discharge. The largest estuary in Japan, with a length of 120 km and a width of 10 km, is in the Paleo-Kinu Bay region. A partly unfilled wave-dominated estuary developed in this region prior to the artificial diversion of the Tone River during the 17th century. In this study, we document the Holocene filling of the Paleo-Kinu Bay on the basis of 14 sediment cores and 171 radiocarbon dates. Unfilled wave-dominated estuary at 7-4 ka has more pronounced wave-built morphologic elements than at 4-0 ka. As a result of sea-level lowering and weakening of tidal currents at 4-0 ka, the bay mouth became narrowed by lateral accretion of sandy tidal river sediments and the central basin was filled by progradation of muddy bayhead delta sediments. The acceleration of the bay mouth narrowing and central basin infilling similar to what happened during 4-0 ka in the Paleo-Kinu Bay region have not been identified in transgressive estuaries, but are common features of regressive estuaries.

TI Influence of the site altitude on strawberry phenolic composition and
   quality
SO SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE
AB Altitude is associated to general climatic trends, such as temperature reduction, increasing radiation under a cloudless sky, decreasing atmospheric pressure and other environmental changes. Against this background, there is a limited knowledge on the effects of these climatic changes along the altitudinal range on quality characteristics of fruits such as strawberry. Thus, this research aimed to characterize the quality of Elsanta strawberries samples, harvested at altitudes ranging from 900 to 1.500 m above sea level, during two consecutive years (2011 and 2012). Strawberry samples were collected once from the four cultivation sites located at 900 m, 1.100 m, 1.200 m and 1.500 m above sea level in each year, when the yield per pick was the highest. Anthocyanins concentration correlated negatively with the increase of altitude in both years (R = -0.55; p <= 0,01). Consistently, the strawberry antioxidant potential, measured with an electrochemical method, was lower in fruits grown at higher altitude (36% less when fruits from 900 and 1.500 m asl were compared). Strawberries collected at 1.500 m asl presented an higher average fruit weight, whereas other physico-chemical parameters such as soluble solids and titratable acidity did not change according to the altitude. This research consistently confirm the role of altitude as effective factor on the phenolic synthesis and final accumulation in strawberry fruits, as well as on their antioxidant activity.

TI Stratigraphic variability of Upper Holocene marginal marine sediments
   along the Al Qahmah Coast of Red Sea, Saudi Arabia
SO SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY
AB The stratigraphic architecture of Upper Holocene sediments along the coast of Al Qahmah in southern Red Sea, Saudi Arabia, provides a high-resolution analog of marginal marine carbonate and siliciclastic sedimentation under variable climatic, tectonic, and sea-level conditions. The sediments include a basal shallow marine limestone and overlying beach, deltaic, fluvial, eolian, and sabkha siliciclastic deposits, comprising four stratigraphic units ranging from 10s to 100 s cm thick. A lithostratigraphy is established using subsurface stratigraphic and petrographic data from 64 trenches and three shallow refraction seismic sections. A chronostratigraphy is established using four age points and sedimentation rates. The entire interval has been deposited in the last-4000 years. Significant stratigraphic variability is reflected by vertical and lateral changes in the thickness, type, and stratal geometry of the four units. Five major geological events are interpreted: Initial shallow marine carbonate deposition during a relative sea-level highstand was terminated by seaward progradation of deltaic-beach sediments during a slow shoreline regression. This is followed by a major stream channel incision during the maximum regression and a relative sea-level fall. The ensuing fluvial channel filling, transgressive ravinement, and deposition of beach sediments signify a relative sea-level rise. Finally, eolian, sabkha, and beach sediments have been deposited in a stabilized and diversified environmental setting under an arid climate. The lacuna associated with stream erosion and transgressive ravinement is up to-400 years long, resulting in a stratigraphic completeness of-88%. The sedimentation rate of the siliciclastic sediments is-0.1 cm/year estimated at a scale of 1000s of years. Episodic syn-depositional faulting in the source area and depositional site, relative seal-level change, autogenic environmental shift, and/or climatic changes between humid and arid conditions have collectively played variable roles in the formation of the stratigraphic variability. The interpreted tectonic, relative sea level, and climatic trends offer an important data point for future studies in the Red Sea region and beyond for the Late Holocene. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI A Matter of Scale: Responses to Landscape Changes in the Oslo Fjord,
   Norway, in the Mesolithic
SO OPEN ARCHAEOLOGY
AB Present-day global warming has great consequences, both for individuals and on a larger scale for society as a whole. However, environmental changes also affected everyday life in the past. The purpose of this article is to apply perspectives developed in studies of how contemporary societies adapt to shore-level changes and to use this insight in a study of the way Mesolithic populations handled a situation of large land uplift. More specifically, the author discusses four common adaptation strategies devised to cope with changing sea level, both on a site level and on a regional scale - to accommodate, relocate, protect, or not respond to the changing environment. In the Oslo Fjord in Norway, the shorelines moved from approximately 200-40 m above the present-day sea level in the period 9300-3900 cal BC, caused by the strong post-glacial rebound. Along the shores lived populations that based much of their life on the local marine resources. Building on information from the large habitation area Haysjodalen and a statistical analysis of 529 critically selected sites in the region, the author concludes that single sites were systematically accommodated or relocated when the distance to the shores receded. However, sea level changes caused more dramatic regional landscape transformation and a less bountiful environment c. 5000 cal BC, with a period of maladaptation and a subsequent population collapse as a result. Like modem societies facing human-caused climate changes, the Mesolithic population had difficulties in handling the need for large-scale shifts in their society.

TI Quantifying the patterns and dynamics of river deltas under conditions
   of steady forcing and relative sea level rise
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
AB Understanding deltaic channel dynamics is essential to acquiring knowledge on how deltas respond to environmental changes, as channels control the distribution of water, sediment, and nutrients. Channel-resolving morphodynamic models provide the basis for quantitative study of channel-scale dynamics, but they need to be properly assessed with a set of robust metrics able to quantitatively characterize delta patterns and dynamics before being used as predictive tools. In this work we use metrics developed in the context of delta formation, to assess the morphodynamic results of DeltaRCM, a parcel-based cellular model for delta formation and evolution. By comparing model results to theoretical predictions and field and experimental observations, we show that DeltaRCM captures the geometric growth characteristics of deltas such as fractality of channel network, spatial distribution of wet and dry surfaces, and temporal dynamics of channel-scale processes such as the decay of channel planform correlation. After evaluating the ability of DeltaRCM to produce delta patterns and dynamics at the scale of channel processes, we use the model to predict the deltaic response to relative sea level rise (RSLR). We show that uniform subsidence and absolute sea level rise have similar effects on delta evolution and cause intensified channel branching. Channel network fractality and channel mobility increase with higher-RSLR rates, while the spatial and temporal scales of avulsion events decrease, resulting in smaller sand bodies in the stratigraphy. Our modeling results provide the first set of quantitative predictions of the effects of RSLR on river deltas with a specific focus on the distributary channel network.

AB Recently, a lot of effort has been put into estimating possible near-future changes (say, 10100 years) in the Earth's abiotic system, especially changes induced by human activities. One of the most studied issues is the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming and the corresponding change in sea-level around the world due to the associated deglaciation. This study focuses at projections of global sea-level changes on geological time scales. The University of Victoria's (Canada) coupled Earth System Climate Model of intermediate complexity was implemented. Two different greenhouse-warming scenarios were studied on timescales from hundreds to thousands years. The model was used to predict sea level variations under the combined influence of changes in sea ice coverage, global precipitation and evaporation, seawater salinity and temperature. Long-term projections show unequal water mass distribution over the globe: a sea-level rise of order of decimetres in equatorial and mid-latitude regions and a sea-level fall of up to 2 metres in polar regions, mostly around Antarctica.

TI Evaluating use of rock-hewn features for sea level measurement, Israeli
   coast
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB Israel's Mediterranean coast, positioned on a structurally active margin, shifted vertically to some extent during the late Holocene. Consequently, changes of relative sea-level that account for both eustatic sea level and land motion are subtle and generally difficult to measure. This study evaluates the value of pools and other anthropogenic rock-cut features used to measure changes of sea level during the late Holocene. A number of these depressions, originally formed to retain fish and for other purposes, still function at present sea level. Most rock-hewn pools and channels on the Israeli margin have been dated to Roman, Byzantine and Crusader periods, usually through indirect association with archaeological sites and other structures in the vicinity. In fact only a few of these features, such as the piscina at Caesarea with affixed mosaics, are accurately dated. It is proposed here that some rock-cut features on broad flat platforms, or trottoirs, at elevations close to present sea level, were formed in more recent time, possibly in association with quarry operations and removal of coastal rock material for construction during the past few centuries. Unless a rock-cut feature can be reliably dated, it should not be used to determine sea level or land motion on this geologically complex margin.

TI Postglacial sediment deposition along a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic
   margin: New constraints from the drowned shelf -edge reefs of the Great
   Barrier Reef, Australia
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB A seismic stratigraphy analysis was conducted at two sites, Hydrographers and Noggin passages, separated by about 540 km on the shelf-edge of the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. We used recently available seismic and bathymetry data and a new synthesis of downhole logs and lithological, petrophysical and radiometric data from cores recovered by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 325 (Great Barrier Reef Environmental Changes). We compared the stratigraphy of both sites, identifying a full depositional sequence with deposits from at least 28 ka BP to similar to 71 a BP, bounded by two marine flooding surfaces. Within this sequence, each systems tract is represented by unique depositional features characteristic of the shelf-edge systems. Despite the broad environmental and geomorphic similarities between the two sites, differences in postglacial reef development were remarkable. These contrasts can be explained as a result of: (1) local antecedent substrate variations and (2) the interplay of shelf physiography with Late Quaternary sea level fluctuations, which favoured changes in biological production and sediment flux as the palaeo-shoreline evolved from linear to complex during intermediate sea levels. During these intermediate sea levels, the northern estuarine coast and its steep substrate at shelf-edge locations contrasted strongly with the protected palaeo-lagoons and the extensive, gentle marginal terraces found at the southern central GBR. This setting enhanced the regional differences in sediment transport and reef development through the last transgression. The conceptual model presented here provides a broader depositional framework and improves the understanding of the main processes controlling the spatial and temporal depositional patterns on the shelf-edge of mixed siliciclastic-carbonate margins.

TI Permanent closure of the Tethyan Seaway in the northwestern Iranian
   Plateau driven by cyclic sea-level fluctuations in the late Middle
   Miocene
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB The opening and closure of marine gateways have been suggested to substantially affect ocean current circulations and global climatic changes. In the Miocene, the closure of the Tethyan Seaway, which connected the proto-Mediterranean Sea with the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, blocked thermohaline exchanges between them and possibly caused a major climate change in the Middle Miocene Climatic Transition. However, the timing, process, and forcing mechanism of the closure of this seaway are controversial. To address this question, we focus on the chronology and sedimentary facies of Miocene strata in the Zagros foreland basin in the Western Iranian Plateau. Based on magnetostratigraphy and biostratigraphy, we establish a chronology of 17 to 10 Ma for the studied Miocene strata and constrain the timing of the permanent closure of the northwestern segment of the Tethyan Seaway to 12.8 Ma. By comparison with global sea-level fluctuations, we suggest that middle Miocene marine transgressions and regressions in the studied region were mainly driven by global climatic change through its control on the growth and decay of ice sheets and thus sea level changes. Our detailed depositional sequence analysis exhibits 100-kyr Earth's eccentricity cycles of marine transgressions and regressions between 15.0 and 12.8 Ma implying they were controlled by astronomical factors. Moreover, the Tethyan Seaway experienced stepwise evolution changing from partially opened seaway, restricted marine connection, intermittent connections, to permanent closure in its northwestern segment during the early and middle Miocene.

TI GREENHOUSE-EFFECT AND SEA-LEVEL RISE - THE COST OF HOLDING BACK THE SEA
SO COASTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Previous studies suggest that the expected global warming from the greenhouse effect could raise sea level 50 to 200 cm (2 to 7 ft) in the next century.  This article presents the first nationwide assessment of the primary impacts of such a rise on the United States:  (1) the cost of protecting ocean resort communities by pumping sand onto beaches and gradually raising barrier islands in place; (2) the cost of protecting developed areas along sheltered waters through the use of levees (dikes) and bulkheads; and (3) the loss of coastal wetlands and undeveloped lowlands.  The total cost for a 1-m rise would be between $270 and $475 billion, ignoring future development.
   We estimate that if no measures are taken to hold back the sea, a 1-m rise in sea level would inundate 30,000 sq km (14,000 sq mi), with wet and dry land each accounting for about half the loss.  The 1500 sq km (600-700 sq mi) of densely developed coastal lowlands could be protected for approximately $1000 to $2000 per year for a typical coastal lot.  Given high coastal property values, holding back the sea would probably be cost-effective.
   The environmental consequences of doing so, however, may not be acceptable.  Although the most common engineering solution for protecting the ocean coast, pumping sand, would allow us to keep our beaches, levees and bulkheads along sheltered waters would gradually eliminate most of the nation's wetland shorelines.  To ensure the long-term survival of coastal wetlands, federal and state environmental agencies should begin to lay the groundwork for a gradual abandonment of coastal lowlands as sea level rises.

TI When the Land Sings: Reconstructing Prehistoric Environments Using
   Evidence from Quaternary Geology and Geomorphology, with Examples Drawn
   from Fluvial Environments in the Nile and Son Valleys
SO QUATERNARY
AB Geomorphic evidence from rivers and lakes can help explain past changes in the locations of archaeological sites as well as environmental and climatic changes in their catchment areas. Examples drawn from the Blue and White Nile valleys in northeast Africa and from the Son and Belan valleys in north-central India reveal how Quaternary climatic fluctuations in the headwaters of these rivers are reflected in changes in river channel patterns downstream as well as in the type of sediment transported. Soils and sediments that contain prehistoric and historic artefacts can be analysed to show the type of environment in which the artefacts accumulated. Beds of volcanic ash may preserve former landscapes and their fossil remains and can provide a synchronous time marker against which to assess changes in the archaeological record. The pattern and tempo of past sea level fluctuations has controlled the distribution of coastal archaeological sites and helps to explain the absence of certain Holocene Neolithic sites in southeast Asia. Disturbance of archaeological sites by plants and animals, especially termites in tropical regions, can affect the stratigraphic and chronological integrity of the site.

TI The sea level rise impact on four seashore breeding birds: the key study
   of Seovlje Salina Nature Park
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
AB Climate change is expected to result in an acceleration of current rates of sea level rise, inundating many low-lying coastal and intertidal landscapes. This could have important implications for many coastal habitat types and related organisms that depend on these habitats, including shorebirds that rely on them for feeding, overwintering and breeding. Potential change in the availability of suitable breeding area according to linear and model-based sea level rise scenarios was modeled for four breeding birds (Kentish Plover, Little Tern, Common Tern and Black-winged Stilt) in Seovlje Salina Nature Park, based on precise mapping of nests over a period of 10 years and on present environmental predictors. Different breeding niches for the studied bird species in SSNP were identified, which indirectly indicates different responses to environmental change, in this case triggered by climate change induced sea level rise. Future breeding suitability maps indicate that the Little Tern and the Common Tern could potentially face a drastic decrease of adequate breeding grounds in SSNP later than the Kentish Plover and the Black-winged Stilt. However, these individual species responses to sea level rise, as a climate change driver, is a step forward for conservation biologists and landscape planners in protected areas, as they prepare cost-effective plans for mitigating negative impact on these ecosystems. This study also illustrates an important general point about the likely effects of climate change on ecological resources, which is that climate change does not happen in a vacuum; its impact will interact with pre-existing stress factors.

TI Holocene mountain forest changes in central Mediterranean: Soil charcoal
   data from the Sila Massif (Calabria, southern Italy)
SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
AB Soil charcoal analysis was performed on soil profiles excavated in the area of Cecita Lake on the Sila Massif (Calabria, southern Italy). Charcoals identification, combined with a good number of radiocarbon dating and the pedological analysis of the soils, allowed drawing a detailed history of the Holocene vegetation changes in the area. Five periods characterised by high concentration of radiocarbon dates - mirroring increased fire activity - are documented at ca. 10400-9000 BP, 8200-7200 BP, 5100-3700 BP, 3300-2400 BP and 600 BP to the present. Furthermore, a severe environmental change took place between the Middle Bronze Age and the Final Bronze Age/Iron Age (ca. 3600 to 3000 BP), when the mixed deciduous oak-silver fir woodland, which dominated the landscape until the Early Bronze Age, declined and was substituted by a Calabrian pine forest or by an open landscape. Available climate, pollen and historical/archaeological data are taken into account to investigate the possible causes of the detected environmental change and of the periods of increased fire activity. If climate seems to play a role in the fire regime during the first part of the Holocene, human action seems to be the triggering factor in the environmental change and the fire regime during the Late Holocene.

TI Diagenetic salinity cycles: a link between carbonate diagenesis and
   sequence stratigraphy
SO LINKING DIAGENESIS TO SEQUENCE STRATIGRAPHY
SE Special Publications of the International Association of
   Sedimentologists
AB In shallow-water carbonates, the position of the water table and the chemistry of early diagenetic fluids are controlled in large part by sea level and climate fluctuations. Understanding the diagenetic responses of carbonate rocks to sea-level and climatic changes may help predict diagenesis and ultimately reservoir quality in a sequence stratigraphic framework. This study expands on a conceptual model, the concept of diagenetic salinity cycles (DSCs; Csoma et al., 2004), for predicting early near-surface diagenetic processes and products given a record of relative sea-level rise and fall.
   DSCs of three study areas (Cretaceous carbonates of Monte Camposauro, Italy; The Plio-Pleistocene Hope Gate Formation of Jamaica; and The Pleistocene karstic aquifers of Mallorca, Spain) have been described and evaluated on the basis of integrated field observations, transmitted light petrography, cathodoluminescence, X-ray diffraction, major element, delta C-13, delta O-18 and fluid inclusion data.
   Four DSCs have been identified at Monte Camposauro, one half in the Hope Gate Formation of Jamaica and five in the Sa Bassa Blanca cave of Mallorca. Evaluation of these cycles reveals the following: (1) Secular variation of sea water chemistry plays a role in the mineralogy of marine and mixing-zone precipitates of the DSCs. Marine precipitates of the Cretaceous Monte Camposauro were high-Mg calcite and aragonite opposed to calcite that is expected for green-house marine cements (Fuchtbauer & Hardie, 1976, 1980). Low-Mg calcite mixing-zone cements in the Cretaceous example and high-Mg calcite and aragonite Plio-Pleistocene marine and mixing-zone precipitates are in accord with mineralogies predicted. (2) The diagenetic responses to climate and sea-level change can be identified. DSCs of Sa Bassa Blanca cave suggest that acicular aragonite and aragonite plates and microporous and dendritic calcite have both precipitated during sea-level highstands. A change from aragonite to calcite precipitation is the result of climate change with increasing rainfall. (3) DSCs preserved along unconformities can be used to interpret relative changes of sea-level and to predict the presence of depositional sequences in downdip positions. On the other hand, downdip depositional sequences, tectonic history and sea-level history can be used to predict some aspects of diagenetic alteration updip. DSCs can be used as a framework to predict diagenetic responses to sea-level change and climate variations in a sequence stratigraphic framework.

SO MARINE ISOTOPE STAGE 3 IN SOUTHERN SOUTH AMERICA, 60 KA B.P.-30 KA B.P.
SE Springer Earth System Sciences
AB Marine Isotopic Stage 3 (MIS 3) was a period of rapid climatic changes and sea level fluctuations. Regarding these fluctuations some doubts were based on the limit of the radiocarbon dating method (about 50,000 years B.P.). However, the modelling of the isotopic oxygen ratios is also indicating sea level fluctuations. In this sense, only at certain depths it is possible to accept these ages at stable coasts, and taking note about the taphonomic conditions within the sequence. Shells located at depths higher than 60 m on stable and wide continental shelves as that of the Northern Patagonia have been analyzed here in that sense.

TI Climatic versus geomorphologic changes: Influence on landing processes
   in eastern coasts of North America
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB Since Bruun's rule, which linked shoreline regressions and coastal erosions due to them, "sea level rise" has increasingly drawn the attention of different fields of knowledge, particularly coastal sciences and engineering. Certainly, it has been taken into consideration more for future climatic estimations than for analysis of the past climate. Climatic changes must have had a strong influence on the development of sailing routes. They must also have affected the access to land through their effect on beach slopes and on the configuration of bays, estuaries, lagoons and inlets, all of them linked to sheltered harbor areas. They could also be significant factors in landing and settling processes as well as other climatic and environmental considerations have affected life conditions, especially in low and wet lands. Columbus' "obsessive" search for a pass towards Cipango and China cannot explain the delay of the European settlements on the whole east coast of North-America. This paper also deals with other types of climatic impacts on coastal evolution. The possibility of identifying those impacts which are really due to the "sea level rise" is critically analyzed.

TI Sedimentary record of late-Holocene relative sea-level change and
   tectonic deformation from the Guerrero Seismic Gap, Mexican Pacific
   Coast
SO HOLOCENE
AB Studies of the coastal sedimentary record have allowed both the reconstruction of relative sea-level changes and the determination of local rates and magnitudes of tectonic deformation, particularly in tectonically active areas. Despite their Successful use elsewhere, Studies of this type are much less common for the Mexican Pacific coast, which parallels the Cocos-North America subduction plate boundary. Stratigraphic, geochemical and microfossil data from sediments in Laguna Mitla, the Pacific coast of Guerrero, Mexico, document late-Holocene sea-level changes induced by tectonic activity in the Mexican subduction zone. Three major events are identified. First, file formation of the lagoon by c. 4630 yr BP, as indicated by a freshwater to brackish peat. Second, a relative sea-level rise, or land subsidence, as indicated by a shift from a freshwater marginal lagoon environment to a marine setting, preceded by a marine inundation represented by a sand unit (possibly a tsunami deposit), by c. 3400 yr BP. And finally, a return to lagoonal conditions indicating a drop in relative sea level or coastal Uplift by e. 2300 yr BP. The Laguna Mitla stratigraphy indicates general coastal subsidence or relative sea level rise of c. 1 mm/yr. We argue that these relative sea-level (land-level) changes have been induced by tectonic activity associated with the Mexican megathrust. A plausible explanation for the 3400 yr BP marine inundation is probably a tsunami produced by a large seismic event accompanied by coastal subsidence. Discrete fining upward, fine to coarse, sand units with an erosional basal contact, medium to poor sorting, and clay/mud rip-up clasts; all increase in Na and Sr elemental concentrations, indicative of a marine origin; and the landward extent of the sands support a tsunamigenic source for these deposits. However, these apparent tsunami deposits require further Study to determine their lateral extent and to assess whether they call be correlated from one site to another. This study demonstrates the applicability of a multiproxy sedimentary approach in interpreting relative sea-level (land-level) changes and to derive data on related earthquake and tsunami events in tropical coastal lagoons.

TI Global Quaternary Carbonate Burial: Proxy- and Model-Based
   Reconstructions and Persisting Uncertainties
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF MARINE SCIENCE
AB Constraining rates of marine carbonate burial through geologic time is critical for interpreting reconstructed changes in ocean chemistry and understanding feedbacks and interactions between Earth's carbon cycle and climate. The Quaternary Period (the past 2.6 million years) is of particular interest due to dramatic variations in sea level that periodically exposed and flooded areas of carbonate accumulation on the continental shelf, likely impacting the global carbonate budget and atmospheric carbon dioxide. These important effects remain poorly quantified. Here, we summarize the importance of carbonate burial in the ocean-climate system, review methods for quantifying carbonate burial across depositional environments, discuss advances in reconstructing Quaternary carbonate burial over the past three decades, and identify gaps and challenges in reconciling the existing records. Emerging paleoceanographic proxies such as the stable strontium and calcium isotope systems, as well as innovative modeling approaches, are highlighted as new opportunities to produce continuous records of global carbonate burial.

TI A Holocene record of environmental change from Rio Zeballos, central
   Patagonia
SO HOLOCENE
AB There are few continuous palaeoenvironmental records spanning the Holocene in Andean Southern Patagonia near the Northern Patagonian Ice Field (similar to 47 degrees S). Insights into the environmental context for human-landscape interactions have relied mostly on data extrapolated from distant extra-Andean locations that suggest limited environmental change during the Holocene. La Frontera (46 degrees 52'S), a high altitude site on the southern beech forest-steppe ecotone boundary in the Rio Zeballos valley, provides lithostratigraphical and palaeoecological evidence, constrained by C-14 dating and tephrochronology, for dynamic environmental change during the last similar to 8000 years. An initial amelioration in environmental conditions after c. 8210 cal. BP was followed by a reversal to colder conditions between c. 7420 and 6480 cal. BP, coincident with initial human occupation within the Paso Roballos and Lago Pueyrredon basin. Between c. 6480 and 3700 cal. BP, the woodland/steppe composition continued to fluctuate in response to climatic change. After c. 3700 cal. BP, a gradual shift to more stable and temperate conditions, punctuated by increased fire activity, is contemporary with the later phases of human occupation extending up into the Paso Roballos-Rio Zeballos corridor.

TI Holocene environmental change inferred from multiple proxies in the
   mouth of Gomso Bay on the west coast of South Korea
SO QUATERNARY RESEARCH
AB A sediment core (14DH-C01) obtained from the mouth of Gomso Bay, on the west coast of South Korea, was used to obtain high-resolution palynomorph, grain-size, and C-14 age data to investigate the Holocene sedimentary environment. The results indicated a transgressive depositional process with four stages controlled by sea-level change, as follows: river-dominated fluvial deposition from the early Holocene to 8.48 cal ka BP; tide-dominated tidal channel fill transgression from 8.48 to 8.08 cal ka BP; tide- to wave-dominated tidal channel fill transgression from 8.08 to 6.98 cal ka BP; and wave-dominated marine transgression from 6.98 cal ka BP to the present. Tidal channel filling was the primary mid-Holocene depositional process, accounting for the high sedimentation rate observed. The different hydrodynamics of the river-dominated, tide-dominated, tide- to wave-dominated, and wave-dominated processes following the changes in sea level may have controlled the transgressive depositional process. This transgressive sedimentary model differs from those of other large river mouth areas (e.g., the Changjiang River) since the mid-Holocene, perhaps resulting from the limited sediment supply in the study area.

TI Mass extinctions and sea-level changes
SO EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB Review of sea-level changes during the big five mass extinctions and several lesser extinction events reveals that the majority coincide with large eustatic inflexions. The degree of certainty with which these eustatic oscillations are known varies considerably. Thus, the late Ordovician and end Cretaceous extinctions are associated with unequivocal, major regressions demonstrated from numerous, widespread regions. In contrast, the multiple, high frequency sea-level changes reported for the Frasnian-Famennian crisis (based on the supposed depth-preferences of conodont taxa) have little support from sequence stratigraphic analyses, which reveals the interval to be one of highstand. The end Permian mass extinction has long been related to a severe, first order lowstand of sea level [Newell, N.D., 1967. Revolutions in the history of life, Geol. Sec. Am. Spec. Pap. 89, 63-91.] based primarily on the widespread absence of latest Permian ammonoid markers, but field evidence reveals that the interval coincides with a major transgression. Newell's hypothesis that marine extinctions are related to shelf habitat loss during severe regression remains tenable for the end Guadalupian and end Triassic extinction events but not for other crises. Rapid high amplitude regressive-transgressive couplets are the most frequently observed eustatic changes at times of mass extinction, with the majority of extinctions occurring during the transgressive pulse when anoxic bottom waters often became extensive. The ultimate cause of the sea-level changes is generally unclear. A glacioeustatic driving mechanism can only be convincingly demonstrated for the end Ordovician and end Devonian events. At other times, it is speculated that they may relate to the widespread regional doming (and subsequent collapse) caused by the impingement of superplumes (and ultimate eruption) on the base of the lithosphere.

TI A comparison of sea level projections based on the observed and
   reconstructed sea level data around the Korean Peninsula
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
AB In an attempt to estimate accurate local sea level change, "sea level trend" modes are identified and separated from natural variability via cyclostationary empirical orthogonal function (CSEOF) analysis applied to both the tide gauge data (1965-2013) and the reconstruction data (1950-2010) around the Korean Peninsula. For the tide gauge data, ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method is also used to estimate sea level trend to understand an uncertainty from different analysis tools. The three trend models-linear, quadratic, and exponential-are fitted to the amplitude time series of the trend mode so that future projection of sea level can be made. Based on a quadratic model, the rate of local sea level rise (SLR) is expected to be 4.63 +/- 1.1 mm year(-1) during 2010-2060. The estimates of "local" sea level trend vary up to similar to 30%. It should be noted that, although the three trend models estimate similar sea level trends during the observational period, the projected sea level trend and subsequent SLR differ significantly from one model to another and between the tide gauge data and the reconstruction data; this results in a substantial uncertainty in the future SLR around the Korean Peninsula.

TI Mid-Holocene coastal hydrology and salinity changes in the east Taihu
   area of the lower Yangtze wetlands, China
SO QUATERNARY RESEARCH
AB During the mid-Holocene the eastern Taihu area, on China's Yangtze delta plain, was populated by advanced late Neolithic cultures supported by intensive domesticated rice cultivation. This agricultural system collapsed around 4200 cal yr BP, with severe population decline, the end of the Liangzhu culture, and about half a millennium of very low-scale human activity in the area before the re-establishment of agricultural production. Microfossil analyses from six sedimentary sequences, supported by AMS C-14 dating, has allowed reconstruction of mid-Holocene hydrological conditions and salinity changes which would have had a major influence on agricultural viability and cultural history in the coastal wetlands. These data, allied to existing stratigraphic and sea-level records, show that chenier ridges that developed after ca. 7000 cal yr BP in the east of the area sheltered it from marine inundation and, although still connected to the sea through tidal creeks, low-salinity conditions persisted throughout the Neolithic period. There is no evidence that marine flooding caused the collapse of Liangzhu culture. Marine influence was stable and evolved slowly. Social and cultural causes may also have been important, but if environmental change triggered the collapse of Neolithic agricultural society here, other natural forces must be sought to explain this event.

TI Classification of coasts
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB The simplest description of a given coast requires a minimum of three terms, embracing the following: (1) material (hard/soft; soluble or otherwise); (2) agencies (erosive/constructive; physical, chemical, biological, and geographic setting [latitude, exposure, fetch]), and (3) historical factors (time scale: geotectonic, glacioisostatic, eustatic, steric, anthropic). Deductive reasoning based on instrumental data such as tide gauges frequently lead to misleading conclusions, in that most are located in the northern hemisphere (land-dominated), near river mouths (variable runoff), sediment compaction, crustal lowering, coriolis effect of geostrophic current variation, and excessively short data spans (< 100 yr). Climatic oscillation influences sea level on all scales from ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) and NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) up to 1500 yr or more. Satellite observations furnish only the briefest "snap-shots."
   Classifications based on perceived "relative" relationships such as submergence or emergence are useful as generalizations, but only when provided with the time scale. Similar constraints apply to subsidence and uplift, and always subject to the three fundamental criteria.

TI Pleistocene reduction of polar ice caps: Evidence from Cariaco Basin
   marine sediments
SO GEOLOGY
AB Sea level is projected to rise between 13 and 94 cm over the next 100 yr due to continued climate warming. The sea-level projections assume that polar ice sheets will remain stable or even increase on time scales of centuries, but controversial geologic evidence suggests that current polar ice sheets have been eliminated or greatly reduced during previous Pleistocene interglacials indicating that modern polar ice sheets have become unstable within the natural range of interglacial climates. Sea level may have been more than 20 m higher than today during a presumably very warm interglacial about 400 ka during marine isotope stage 11. Because of the implications for future sea level rise, additional study of the conflicting evidence for warmer conditions and higher sea level during marine isotope stage 11 is needed. Here we present microfossil and isotopic data from marine sediments of the Cariaco Basin supporting the interpretation that global sea level was 10-20 m higher than today during marine isotope stage 11. The increased sea level requires reduction in modern polar ice sheets and is consistent with the interpretation that the West Antarctic ice sheet and the Greenland ice sheet were absent or greatly reduced during marine isotope stage 11. Our results show a warm marine isotope stage 11 interglacial climate with sea level as high as or above modern sea level that lasted for 25 to 30 k.y. Variations in Earth's orbit around the sun (Milankovitch cycles) are considered to be a primary external force driving glacial-interglacial cycles. Current and marine isotope stage 11 Milankovitch forcing are very similar, suggesting that the present interglacial (Holocene) that began ca. 10 ka will continue for another 15 to 20 k.y. Therefore any anthropogenic climate warming will accelerate the natural process toward reduction in polar ice sheets. The potential for increased rates of sea level rise related to polar ice sheet decay should be considered as a potential natural hazard on centennial time scales.

TI Palaeosols on a fluvial terrace at Driekop, Northern Province, South
   Africa as indicators of climatic changes during the Late Quaternary
SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
AB A study of an exposed fluvial terrace at Driekop (30 degrees 11'E, 24 degrees 38'S and 800 m above sea level) consisting of palaeosols, Stone Age implements and Iron Age fragments provides indicators of climatic changes during the Late Quaternary. This terrace, at least 12 m thick, with 15 stratigraphic layers (14 of these qualify as palaeosols on the basis of being buried) was analysed according to various methods. Layers were classified according to the diagnostic horizons and properties of the FAO-Unesco system. The genesis of the terrace and layers is ascribed to distinct events including periodicities involving deposition and erosion, as well as various intensities of pedogenesis. Whereas the evidence suggests that the cyclic pattern of erosion and deposition cannot be correlated with climatic changes of the past, it was ascertained that certain soil features (calcareousness, vertic, gleyic, etc.) could provide significant information in this regard. Some of the latter correlations are in agreement with present documented evidence on climatic changes during the Late Quaternary while others are of a contradictory nature. Radiocarbon dates for the calcareous materials, for example, range in age from c. 29.8, 24.1, 12.2 to 4.2 ka and have been regarded as representing conditions drier than present.

TI How vulnerable is Acropora cervicornis to environmental change? Lessons
   from the early to middle Holocene
SO GEOLOGY
AB The coral Acropora cervicornis is considered a modern environmental indicator species, vulnerable to anthropogenic stress and rapidly disappearing throughout the Caribbean. Causes for its decline have been attributed to both natural and anthropogenic factors. Physical and geochemical data are used to explore conditions under which this species thrived in early to middle Holocene reef deposits (ca. 9.4-5.4 ka) of the Enriquillo Valley, southwestern Dominican Republic. This study shows that A. cervicornis flourished during a 4000 yr period spanning the Holocene Thermal Maximum, and high-resolution radiocarbon dating reveals continuous growth for at least 2000 yr. Holocene A. cervicornis survived large-scale climate and environmental changes that included high temperatures, variable salinity, hurricanes, and rapid sea-level rise with remarkable resilience. Our data suggest that the recent decline in A. cervicornis is anomalous and likely tied to ecosystem change beyond natural causes.

TI Possible changes in hydrodynamic regime in the Estonian coastal waters
   (the Baltic Sea) as a result of changes in wind climate
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB The objective of the paper is to investigate the effects of changes in wind climate on sea level and current regime in a nearly tideless, semi-enclosed sub-basin of the Baltic Sea. The paper presents a statistical analysis of sea level data obtained from the Estonian tide gauges over the period 1842-2005 and a hydrodynamic modeling study as a way to explain past sea level developments and to project probable future changes in sea level and current regime. After adjusting the historical sea level time series to take into account land uplift rates, the series display an upward trend of between 1.5 and 2.7 mm/yr, which in some windward tide gauges exceeds the global sea level rise estimate. The excessive rise in mean sea level, and particularly in maxima, can be explained by the local response to the changing regional wind climate and increasing storminess. The relevant hydrodynamic mechanisms are studied on the basis of sensitivity and scenario runs which are performed with a 2D model. The simulations prove that a relatively modest (2 m/s) mean wind speed increase can yield a mean sea level increase of up to 2-5 cm in the study area. It can also lead to increased water exchange through the straits, which in turn can lead to a strengthening of the basin scale circulation, greater vertical mixing, and an up to twofold increase in bottom stresses near coasts.

TI Sea-level reconstructions from the Peri-Vocontian Zone (South-east
   France) point to Valanginian glacio-eustasy
SO SEDIMENTOLOGY
AB The Valanginian is a period of global environmental change as illustrated by sedimentary, palaeontological, geochemical and climatic perturbations. A production crisis in most of the carbonate platforms suggests important changes in palaeoenvironmental conditions. During the same time interval, a major positive excursion in delta 13C, the Weissert Event, suggests perturbations of the carbon cycle from the latest Early Valanginian to the Early Hauterivian. In order to better understand the link between these changes, sea-level fluctuations have been reconstructed in detail from the Middle Berriasian to the earliest Hauterivian. Sections from the Peri-Vocontian Zone (South-east France) have been investigated because of the good quality of outcrops on the carbonate platforms, their margins and in the Vocontian Basin. Sections ranging from the most proximal zone (Swiss Jura) to the basin were interpreted in terms of sequence stratigraphy and cyclostratigraphy, and correlated at high resolutions. Using the identified small, medium and large-scale sequences as well as depositional geometries, sea-level fluctuations were reconstructed. Two main trends are evidenced during the studied interval: (i) the peak amplitude (magnitude) of the sea-level fluctuations increased gradually from the Middle Berriasian to the Early Valanginian, and reached a maximum (more than 50 m) from the middle Early Valanginian to the Valanginian/Hauterivian boundary; and (ii) sea-level variations were quite symmetrical during the Late Berriasian, slightly asymmetrical during the Early Valanginian and strongly asymmetrical (fast sea-level rise, slow fall) from the latest Early Valanginian to the earliest Hauterivian. Moreover, three orders of sea-level fluctuations were recognized in the sedimentary rocks of the Peri-Vocontian Zone. Platform-basin correlations and cyclostratigraphic interpretations of the basinal sections evidence an astronomical control on the sea-level variations, mainly by the two eccentricity cycles of 100 and 400 kyr. The increase in the amplitude of the sea-level fluctuations and their change from symmetrical to asymmetrical can be related to the onset of a major cooling event in the Early Valanginian. Fast transgressions followed by slower regressions would correspond to waxing and waning of high-latitudinal ice during most of the Valanginian, especially from the latest Early Valanginian to the latest Late Valanginian. Glacio-eustatic sea-level fluctuations in tune with the 100 and 400 kyr eccentricity cycles are in agreement with glaciations during the Valanginian.

At four tide-gauge stations the difference of the sea level trends from tide gauge and co-located satellite altimetry is greater than 3 mm/yr. Land subsidence is found in Jakarta, Surabaya and Benoa. At Enggano and Tanjung Lesung the vertical rates correspond with GPS-derived rates between 2007 and 2009, indicating land subsidence at the first station.

TI SEA-LEVEL CHANGES SINCE THE EARLY 1920S FROM THE LONG RECORDS OF 2 TIDAL
   GAUGES IN SHANGHAI, CHINA
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB This paper reports on sea-level changes at the Changjiang river mouth since the early 1920's, with a special emphasis on recent local tectonic movement, ground subsidence, and river discharge.  Historical studies and mathematical correlations are used to examine the establishment and historical changes of tidal gauges and related bench markers as well as to establish the reliability of tidal records.  In the past, some Chinese scientists proposed that sea-level has declined since 1950 while other foreign scientists attributed sea-level rise in the East China Sea to crustal and isostatic sinking.  This study concludes that sea-level is rising at a rate about 1.0 mm a year, which is comparable to that of global sea-level rise.  Meanwhile, it is found that the increase of the annual mean high tide level is remarkably greater, reflecting the estuarine morphological and hydro-dynamic effect on sea-level rise.  The evidence suggests that the component of tectonic sinking accounts for only 1/3 or less of the relative sea level (RSL) rise.  In contrast to the viewpoint of sea-level declining since 1950, this study shows a rising trend from 1951 to 1987, which is a continuation of sea-level rise since the beginning of this century.

TI No landward movement: examining 80 years of population migration and
   shoreline change in Louisiana
SO POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Louisiana lost nearly 5,000 km(2) of its coastal land area due to relative sea level rise (including local, regional, and global factors driving relative sea level change) since 1932, mirroring both the hazards associated with sea level rise and the time horizons of sea level rise impacts expected this century. This represents an opportunity to examine the relationship between long-term population changes and shoreline change. Based on detailed land change data for the period 1932-2010 and a small area population estimation technique for the period 1940-2010, we examine intra-parish population changes in relation to shoreline changes for the one million plus residents living in the ten coastal parishes of Louisiana. We find that since 1940, only two of the ten coastal parishes exhibited landward population movement, which we define as movement perpendicular to the shoreline, exceeding 1 km. Three parishes exhibited seaward population movement in excess of 1 km. Overall, we find very little net intra-parish landward population movement for the region. Our findings suggest that coastal Louisiana's historical population has not moved in concert with observed shoreline encroachment. We also find a potential tipping point related to population migration when a neighborhood loses at least 50% of its land area. Our findings suggest that this lack of landward population movement could be attributable to either localized adaptation strategies or migrations to other landward areas.

AB Analyzing the ecological and physiological properties and processes of mangrove forests. as well as the physical environment where they occur, and including knowledge of their responses to sea-level changes in the Quaternary, a conceptual model for the response of mangroves to sea-level changes was developed. The model considered the rate of sea-level rise, the balance of sedimentation, regional oceanographic properties, and coastal geomorphology. The local topography determines the availability of areas for mangrove migration landward. The rate of sediment input determines the capacity of mangrove forests to resist a sea-level rise. This compensation process will depend not only on sediment input but also on the deposition rate, which will be influenced by marine forces that are responsible for sediment transport. The efficiency of sediment accumulation in keeping pace with rising sea level will also depend on the area and geology of the drainage basin, in addition to the geomorphology and coastal dynamics, all of which will determine the rate of sediment retention in the intertidal zone. If the rate of sediment deposition is smaller than the rate of sea-level rise, an erosion process can take place, which may lead to the local extinction of the ecosystem, or to the persistence of part of the ecosystem as a refuge mode. Another possible response, if there is no compensation process, is the migration of mangrove forests landward. This migration is only possible if the topography is suitable for mangrove colonization, and if the rate of relative sea-level rise is compatible with the mangrove life cycle. Following this retraction process, a maintenance mode can be attained, when a new equilibrium is reached and the ecosystem persists. Two scenarios might lead to the loss of the ecosystem: (a) if the rate of sea-level rise is greater than the rate at which the mangroves are able to migrate landward; (b) if after an initial retraction, the mangroves encounter an obstacle that prevents their further migration. Despite the current knowledge about mangrove responses to environmental changes, the fully validation of the proposed model will only be possible with the incorporation of new data, through the maintenance of monitoring networks.

   extensions and its relation with climatic evolution
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB Marine oxygen isotope stage (MIS) 11 has been described as a super-interglacial because of its long duration, more than 30 ka, but this view is often refuted by the observation that the peak sea level and maximum temperature did not surpass other interglacials, including the last interglacial. We address this problem using data from coastal sediments; we conducted diatom and sulfur analyses on two cores of high accumulation rate (0.52 m/ka) sediments from Osaka Bay, Japan. A linear age model applied to the diatom data shows that sea-level variations with precession cycles are correlated with oxygen isotopic events 11.3, 11.24, 11.23, 11.22, and 11.1. Diatom abundances reveal sea level increases and falls because of environmental changes caused by stepwise extension of the bay. This extension can be verified and mapped using data from 15 other drill cores. Sea level was above the sill for Osaka Bay during the marine interval in Osaka Bay, spanning 60 ka. It was above the sill for Kawachi Bay during the marine interval in Kawachi Plain for a duration of 44 ka, including events 11.3 and 11.23. The highest sea level was above the sill for Kyoto Bay during an interval of 16 ka centered at event 11.3. Estimates of sill elevations together with geological data suggest that the sea level of MIS 11 changed within a range from 60 m to +20 m. Palynological data from the same core show that the MIS 11 climate around Osaka Bay was divided into early warm-temperate and late cool-temperate times, with a boundary between events 11.3 and 11.24. During the marine interval in Kyoto, the climate was an extremely warm hypsithermal, almost coincided with the warmest interval in Antarctica where temperatures are >0 degrees C.

TI Sea level rise risks and societal adaptation benefits in low-lying
   coastal areas
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Sea level rise (SLR) will increase adaptation needs along low-lying coasts worldwide. Despite centuries of experience with coastal risk, knowledge about the effectiveness and feasibility of societal adaptation on the scale required in a warmer world remains limited. This paper contrasts end-century SLR risks under two warming and two adaptation scenarios, for four coastal settlement archetypes (Urban Atoll Islands, Arctic Communities, Large Tropical Agricultural Deltas, Resource-Rich Cities). We show that adaptation will be substantially beneficial to the continued habitability of most low-lying settlements over this century, at least until the RCP8.5 median SLR level is reached. However, diverse locations worldwide will experience adaptation limits over the course of this century, indicating situations where even ambitious adaptation cannot sufficiently offset a failure to effectively mitigate greenhouse-gas emissions.

TI Interaction of tectonics, eustasy, climate and carbonate production on
   the sedimentary evolution of an early/middle Jurassic extensional basin
   (Southern Provence Sub-basin, SE France)
SO BASIN RESEARCH
AB This paper describes the evolution of an extensional basin in regard to the nature and sequence stratigraphic arrangement of its carbonate deposits. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the respective effects of tectonism, eustasy, climate and oceanography on a carbonate sedimentary record. The case study is the early to mid-Jurassic age carbonate succession of the Southern Provence Sub-basin (SE France), located within the southern part of the extensional Western European Tethyan Margin. This work is based on sedimentologic, biostratigraphic (using ammonites and brachiopods) and sequence stratigraphic analysis of the carbonate facies of the Cherty Reddish Limestone Formation (late Sinemurian to earliest Bajocian). These strata were deposited in shoreface to lower offshore depositional environments. The succession of the various environments together with the recognition of key stratigraphic surfaces allow us to define four second-order depositional sequences; of late Sinemurian to earliest Pliensbachian, early Pliensbachian to late Pliensbachian, earliest Toarcian to middle Aalenian and late Aalenian to early Bathonian ages. The architecture of the depositional sequences (thickness and facies variations within the systems tracts, wedge-shaped geometries) reflects a strong tectonic control. The sub-basin was structured by extensional faults (oriented approximately 070-090/250-270). Sea-level variations, fluctuations in carbonate production and preservation, and environmental changes were also significant controlling factors of the carbonate deposition. The interplay of the tectonic control with the other factors resulted in five main phases in the sedimentary evolution of the sub-basin: (1) dominant tectonic control during the initial rifting stage (late Sinemurian to early Pliensbachian); (2) increasing extensional tectonics (mid-Pliensbachian); (3) global climato-eustatic sea-level fall (latest Pliensbachian) and global climato-eustatic sea-level rise plus hypoxia/anoxia (early Toarcian); (4) relative sea-level fall linked to tectonic uplift related to the 'Mid-Cimmerian phase' (mid-Aalenian) and (5) oceanographic events (upwelling) and reduction in carbonate production (hypoxia/anoxia) plus tectonic downwarping (late Aalenian/earliest Bajocian).

TI Sedimentary proxies of the sea-level and Southeast Asian monsoon
   variations in the South China Sea over the last 450 kyr
SO COMPTES RENDUS GEOSCIENCE
AB In order to reconstruct the past variations of the Southeast Asian monsoon intensity and estimate the sedimentary system reactivity to climatic changes in Southeast Asia over the last 450 kyr, mineralogical and sedimentological analyses have been performed on the terrigenous fraction of the South China Sea sediment. End-member modelling coupled with grain size data discriminates three end-members that determine the nature and intensity of the main sediment transport vectors. Low sea-level stands are characterized by sediment reworking that allows transportation of a coarse end-member (20-40 mu m) to the deep-basin. By contrast, the other end-members (4-6 mu m; 9-13 mu m) are controlled by the shoreline position (sea level) and/or by changes of the rivers capacity transport (monsoon). Finally, aeolian input to the northern margin of the South China Sea can be considered negligible compared to the massive fluvial input and the reworking of the sediments.

TI Cyclic sedimentation patterns in Lower Lias mudstones of Yorkshire (GB)
SO TERRA NOVA
AB Distinct stratification patterns in Lower Liassic mudstones are due to the regular occurrence of shell beds, silty/sandy layers and concretionary horizons. The mudstones formed in four depositional environments: (1) a storm dominated shallow marine system; (2) a hemipelagic system; (3) a shallow marine system influenced by climatic changes at astronomical frequencies; and (4) a pro-deltaic offshore transition/shallow marine system. The tectonic setting played an important role in determining the facies sequence, whereas eustatic sea-level changes were of lesser influence.

TI A study of the longest tide gauge sea-level record in Greenland
   (Nuuk/Godthab, 1958-2002)
SO GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
AB We study the longest tide gauge record available from Greenland, that is the Nuuk/Godthab site in southwest Greenland, for the time period 1958-2002. Standard regression methods and the application of the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition technique reveal a rate of sea-level rise of approximate to 2 mm yr(-1), two complete cycles of the 18.6-years lunar nodal tide, and a negligible acceleration. Using previous assessments for the globally averaged sea-level rise during that period, glacial isostatic adjustment modeling and sea-level "fingerprinting" of the mass loss of continental ice sources, terrestrial water sources and oceanic steric effects, we evaluate the various contributions to local sea-level rise at the tide gauge location. The misfit between the observed and the modeled sea-level trend is unlikely to reflect tectonic deformations but, more intriguingly, may indicate that the mass balance of the Greenland ice sheets was, during the second half of the last century, somehow closer to balance than suggested by previous investigations.

TI Holocene coastal environmental changes inferred by multi-proxy analysis
   from Lago Formoso sediments in Maranhao State, northeastern Brazil
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB Little is known about the history of the coastal environment in the northern part of northeastern Brazil and the role of sea level and climate change, as well as the human impact during the past. In order to shed more light on coastal ecosystem dynamics and its influencing factors, a 300 cm long sediment core has been taken from Lago Formoso (LF), located around 150 km distance from the present-day coast in Maranhao State. The core has been radiocarbon dated and analyzed by pollen, spores, charcoal, X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD), LOI, and sedimentary characteristics. During the period from 7520 to 6230 cal yr BP occurred a dominance of mangrove vegetation, and a high relative sea level (RSL), indicating that the coast of the Atlantic Ocean was very close to the study area. The following period is characterized by an increased input of marine sediment into LF and vegetational succession, indicating a highstand of RSL between 5500 and 5020 cal yr BP. From 5020 to 2580 cal yr BP, dominant sandy sediments show chemical and mineralogical characteristic typical of continental sources. The study area was represented mainly by herbaceous and arboreal vegetation, while mangroves were absent, indicating an RSL decrease. The period between 2580 and 1350 cal yr BP is marked by the lower water table and the stronger presence of rainforest vegetation, and an increasing presence of palm trees, indicating the beginning of the human settlement. The last period, after 1350 cal yr BP, is marked by an even stronger anthropogenic influence in the study area, as the records of the stilt-house settlements also evidence it. These records together with others from the same region are the only evidence of stilts-houses from the pre-colonial period in South America. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Methodologies for measuring and modelling change in coastal saline
   lagoons under historic and accelerated sea-level rise, Suffolk coast,
   eastern England
SO HYDROBIOLOGIA
AB Thorough assessment of vulnerable coastal habitats, impacted by sea-level rise and anthropogenic pressures, requires both the accurate establishment of the evidence base for current status and scientifically-informed forward planning of expected future status. Coastal saline lagoons are transitional, ephemeral habitats of considerable conservation interest; under European legislation their status requires on-going maintenance of 'favourable status'. Over decadal timescales, the seaward barriers that enclose saline lagoons migrate progressively landwards. Geo-referenced and digitised historic maps and aerial photographs are used to create a detailed trajectory of barrier migration and loss of lagoon area for three saline 'broads' on the rapidly retreating coastline of Suffolk, eastern England. The SCAPE shoreline response model is then employed to extend this trajectory, under a range of sea-level rise scenarios, to 2050 and 2095 and to predict saline lagoon 'time to extinction'. Loss rates are likely to accelerate considerably after 2015 and a fundamental revision of UK saline lagoon creation targets is urgently required. The approach is generic and could be used to assess the evolutionary trajectories for other vulnerable coastal habitats, under a range of near-future environmental change scenarios.

TI Facies distribution and coral-microbialite reef development on a
   low-energy carbonate ramp (Chay Peninsula, Kimmeridgian, western France)
SO SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY
AB The Chay Peninsula (western France) succession corresponds to a Kimmeridgian shallow and low-energy ramp system that developed in the northeast of the Aquitaine Basin. The sedimentation shows a transition from a carbonate-dominated to a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic depositional environment that takes place at the base of a major, third-order sea-level transgression. Facies partitioning and coral-microbialite reef levels (i.e., reef windows) suggest higher-frequency (fourth-order) sea-level oscillations. Reef-growth phases (i.e., high-frequency reef windows) are interpreted to have been controlled by fifth-order sea-level oscillations. In the mixed siliciclastic-carbonate system, successive prograding units of shoreface sediments pass into thick marl-limestone alternations over a distance of tens of metres. Such remarkable short-distance lateral facies variations suggest a complex sedimentary system made of juxtaposed deposits that rapidly shift through time. Terrigenous fluxes, in modifying the light intensity and the nutrient level in the water column strongly controlled the facies distribution and notably the reef composition and growth. Identified coral genera suggest mixed photo-heterotrophic mode of nutrition and low-mesotrophic conditions in marine waters. For each reef-growth phase, nutrient increase favoured large amounts of microbialites to develop, forming a crust that entirely capped the coral reef surface. Thus, high-frequency fluctuations in nutrient input in tune with fifth- (or higher) order sea-level fluctuations controlled the reef development at a millennial scale. The Chay Peninsula reef distribution and development provide insight into understanding the response of reef communities under climatically-induced environmental changes. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

TI THE IMPACT OF HOLOCENE CLIMATE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF PREHISTORIC
   SOCIETIES IN SOUTHERN SIBERIA
SO RADIOCARBON
AB Geochemical data of Be-10, C-14, delta O-18 obtained from natural archives (tree rings, ice sheets, varves, corals) indicates that the climate during the Holocene was not stable. The cosmogenic isotope fluctuations are bound by the periodicity on solar activity and climatic changes. The sharpest and most abrupt climatic deteriorations are registered in the Early and Middle Holocene at 8200, 5800, 5400, 4300, and 2800 cal BP. These events are characterized by cold conditions. The impact of climate on human communities in steppe depressions in southern Siberia (Nazarovo, Minusinsk, and Turano-Uyuk) was noticeable. The differences of local landscape-climatic conditions in these depressions were connected with global climatic changes to determine the processes of occupation, development, and migrations of ancient societies during the Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. The chronology of archaeological cultures was also correlated with the local and global climatic changes during the Early and Middle Holocene in southern Siberia. Here, we generalize the literature data about Holocene climatic changes and archaeological cultures in the southern Siberia region.

TI Distribution, morphology and triggers of submarine mass wasting in the
   Sea of Marmara
SO MARINE GEOLOGY
AB An overview is given of mass wasting features along the slopes of the Sea of Marmara, Turkey, based on new data and previously published information. The Sea of Marmara is characterized by active tectonics along the North Anatolian Fault and by eustatic sea level changes controlling the connections both to the Mediterranean and Black Sea (i.e. lacustrine and marine conditions during sea-level low and high stands, respectively). High resolution bathymetric data, subsurface echo-sounder and seismic reflection profiling, seafloor visual observations, as well as stratigraphic analysis of sediment cores have been used to identify, map and date submarine slope failures and mass wasting deposits. Gravity mass movements are widespread on the steep slopes of the Sea of Marmara, and range from small scale slope failures, mainly located within the canyons, to wider unstable areas (20 to 80 km(2)). The largest mass wasting features, i.e. the Tuzla, Ganos and Yalova complexes, have been analyzed in connection with crustal deformation. These gravitational gliding masses are probably induced by the transtensional deformation within the crust. Moreover, age determination of landslides and debris flows indicate that they were more frequent during the last transgressive phase, when the rate of terrigenous sediments supplied by the canyons to the deep basin was higher. We discuss these results taking into account activity, pre-conditioning and trigger mechanisms for slope instability with respect to tectonics and paleo-environmental changes induced by sea-level oscillations.

AB Biotic effects of the Chicxulub impact, the K-T event and sea level change upon planktic foraminifera were evaluated in a new core and outcrops along the Brazos River, Texas, about 1000 km from the Chicxulub impact crater on Yucatan, Mexico. Sediment deposition occurred in a middle neritic environment that shallowed to inner neritic depths near the end of the Maastrichtian. The sea level fall scoured submarine channels, which were infilled by a sandstone complex with reworked Chicxulub impact spherules and clasts with spherules near the base. The original Chicxulub impact ejecta layer was discovered 45-60 cm below the sandstone complex, and predates the K-T mass extinction by about 300,000 years.
   Results show that the Chicxulub impact caused no species extinctions or any other significant biotic effects. The subsequent sea level fall to inner neritic depth resulted in the disappearance of all larger (>150 mu m) deeper dwelling species creating a pseudo-mass extinction and a survivor assemblage of small surface dwellers and low oxygen tolerant taxa. The K-T boundary and mass extinction was identified 40-80 cm above the sandstone complex where all but some heterohelicids, hedbergellids and the disaster opportunistic guembelitfids went extinct, coincident with the evolution of first Danian species and the global delta C-13 shift. These data reveal that sea level changes profoundly influenced marine assemblages in near shore environments, that the Chicxulub impact and K-T mass extinction are two separate and unrelated events, and that the biotic effects of this impact have been vastly overestimated.

TI Using n-alkanes as a proxy to reconstruct sea-level changes in Thale
   Noi, the west coast of the Gulf of Thailand
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
AB The n-alkanes content in the sedimentary sequence from Thale Noi, on the west coast of the Gulf of Thailand, was analyzed and used to reconstruct the past sea-level fluctuations. The results were further compared with those based on sediment characteristics, loss on ignition, grain size distribution, and pollen analysis from the same core to investigate the efficiency of n-alkanes as a paleoenvironmental proxy. The analysis of n-alkanes indicated the likely periods of regression and transgression from c. 8300?7950 cal. a BP and from c 7950?7665 cal. a BP that agrees well with the reconstructed sea-level changes from the sediment characteristics and pollen records. The steady abundance of mangrove pollen taxa in the sediment core points to a standstill in the sea-level from 7650?6870 cal. a BP. However, the results from the n-alkanes analysis further suggested a sea-level fall at c. 7650?7610 cal. a BP and at c. 7400?6870 cal. a BP, and a sea-level rise at c. 7610?7400 cal. a BP. Furthermore, these sea-level changes were intervened by short intervals of regression centered at c.7590 and 7470 cal. a BP.

TI HOLOCENE SEDIMENTARY SEQUENCE, FORAMINIFERA AND OSTRACODA IN WEST
   COASTAL LOWLAND OF BOHAI SEA, CHINA
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB The Holocene sedimentary sequences in the west coastal lowland of the Bohai Sea consists in ascending order of: pre-transgression river and lake sediments, transgressive tidal flat and estuarine sediments, shelf sediments, and prograding delta and river deposits. The delta deposits are the thickest and are typically composed of two imbricating Yellow River delta super-lobes that acted at different periods. There are three marker horizons in the sequence at: (1) the bottom of marine sediments; (2) the bottom of shelf deposits; and (3) the boundary between two imbricating delta superlobes. Environmental changes were mainly controlled by a rising sea level prior to 6000 BP and by delta progradation after 6000 BP. Stratigraphic distribution of foraminifera and ostracoda vary according to variations in salinity and sedimentation rate. There is no evidence that the Yellow River delta developed during the Holocene transgression but rather during a later prograding phase. An understanding of the shelly ridges in the coastal lowland indicates that the ridges were formed at a similar level to the present and there is no evidence for Holocene sea levels 1-2 m higher than the present sea level.

TI Climate and sea-level variations along the northwestern Tethyan margin
   during the Valanginian C-isotope excursion: Mineralogical evidence from
   the Vocontian Basin (SE France)
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB A high resolution mineralogical study (bulk-rock and clay-fraction) was carried out upon the hemipelagic strata of the Angles section (Vocontian Basin, SE France) in which the Valanginian positive C-isotope excursion occurs. To investigate sea-level fluctuations and climate change respectively, a Detrital Index (DI: (phyllosilicates and quartz)/calcite) and a Weathering Index (WI: kaolinite/(illite + chlorite)) were established and compared to second-order sea-level fluctuations. In addition, the mineralogical data were compared with the High Nutrient Index (HNI, based on calcareous nannofossil taxa) data obtained by Duchamp-Alphonse et al. (2007), in order to assess the link between the hydrolysis conditions recorded on the surrounding continents and the trophic conditions inferred for the Vocontian Basin. It appears that the mineralogical distribution along the northwestern Tethyan margin is mainly influenced by sea-level changes during the Early Valanginian (Pertransiens to Stephanophorus ammonite Zones) and by climate variations from the late Early Valanginian to the base of the Hauterivian (top of the Stephanophorus to the Radiatus ammonite Zones). The sea-level fall observed in the Pertransiens ammonite Zone (Early Valanginian) is well expressed by an increase in detrital inputs (an increase in the DI) associated with a more proximal source and a shallower marine environment, whereas the sea-level rise recorded in the Stephanophorus ammonite Zone corresponds to a decrease in detrital influx (a decrease in the DI) as the source becomes more distal and the environment deeper. Interpretation of both DI and WI, indicates that the positive C-isotope excursion (top of the Stephanophorus to the Verrucosum ammonite Zones) is associated with an increase of detrital inputs under a stable, warm and humid climate, probably related to greenhouse conditions, the strongest hydrolysis conditions being reached at the maximum of the positive C-isotope excursion. From the Verrucosum ammonite Zone to the base of the Hauterivian (Radiatus ammonite Zone) climatic conditions evolved from weak hydrolysis conditions and, most likely, a cooler climate (resulting in a decrease in detrital inputs) to a seasonal climate in which more humid seasons alternated with more arid ones. The comparison of the WI to the HNI shows that the nutrification recorded al: the Angles section from the top of the Stephanophorus to the Radiatus ammonite Zones (including the positive C-isotope shift), is associated with climatic changes in the source areas. At that time, increased nutrient inputs were generally triggered by increased weathering processes in the source areas due to acceleration in the hydrological cycle under greenhouse conditions This scenario accords with the widely questioned palaeoenvironmental model proposed by Lini et al., (1992) and suggests that increasing greenhouse conditions are the main factor that drove the palaeoenvironmental changes observed in the hemipelagic realm of the Vocontian Basin, during the Valanginian positive C-isotope shift. This high-resolution mineralogical study highlights short-term climatic changes during the Valanginian, probably associated to rapid changes in the C-cycle. Coeval Massive Parana-Etendeka flood basalt eruptions may explain such rapid perturbations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI LATE HOLOCENE NEOGLACIAL EPISODES IN SOUTHERN SOUTH-AMERICA AND SOUTHERN
   AFRICA - A COMPARISON
SO HOLOCENE
AB Palaeoenvironmental evidence from existing late-Holocene palaeoenvironmental sequences suggests that important atmospheric and oceanographic changes took place during the last 5000 years in southern South America and southern Africa. Several oscillations were contemporary with three well-known Neoglacial episodes that occurred between about 4500 and 4000 BP, between 3000 and 2000 BP and during the last 1000 years. The scale of change involved during these climatic episodes consisted of temperature departures of 1-2 degrees C, and sea-level oscillations of +/- 1-2 m. In at least two winter rainfall regions, an increase in precipitation was concomitant with most of these Neoglacial episodes. Minor northward latitudinal shifts of frontal systems, and relatively strong atmospheric circulation, were probably involved in the detected climatological trends. Minor, but significant, expansions of polar waters into the Humboldt and Benguela Currents are probably additional, and important, role players during these Neoglacial phases. Further establishment of more palaeoenvironmental sequences is needed in order to generate and test explanatory models.

TI Long-term effect of the Kardla crater (Hiiumaa, Estonia) on Late
   Ordovician carbonate sedimentation
SO DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Kardla impact crater, 4 km in diameter, was formed in the early Caradoc (Late Ordovician) in the Baltoscandian shelf sea, a sediment-starved temperate-water carbonate basin. The Upper Ordovician post-impact sediments that cover the Kardla crater are 15-275m thick. The crater rimwall is composed of three separate basement rises that formed islands or shoals in the Late Ordovician shelf sea and influenced the sedimentation in the surrounding area. The rises provide the means to study the shallow-water sedimentary environments and sea-level history. This may be one of the few cases, where shore environments of the Baltoscandian Ordovician palaeobasin are preserved in the geological record. Lithofacies distribution was studied in the crater area from data of about 100 drillcores. Grain size distribution and composition of the non-carbonate material were analyzed in six core sections in order to reconstruct the history of crater erosion.
   The post-impact marine deposits lie on a partly redeposited and mixed ejecta layer derived from the Cambrian to Lower Ordovician silici-clastic deposits in the target area. Beds of marine carbonate sediments of Caradoc age, wackestones and mudstones, on-lap on the slope of the crater rim. A shift of sedimentation towards the crater rim. during the Caradoc is evidence of a relative sea-level rise, which was a combination of early Caradoc eustatic rise, crater area subsidence, and compaction of pre-impact and impact sediments. The occurrences of coarse sand and gravel in specific stratigraphic intervals reflect the intensity of wave action and sea-level changes in the area. A detailed curve of sea-level changes during Late Ordovician has been constructed and different post-impact sedimentation models are presented for the crater area. The sedimentation pattern changed during the Caradoc as a result of sea-level rise and climatic change. The synchronous appearance of echinoderm bioclastic accumulations in shoal areas in Estonian mainland and in the Kardla rim dates the climatic change in the basin area as late Keila (middle Caradoc) time.
   Assuming that the Caradoc lasted about 11 million years, infilling of the Kardla crater required about 7 million years, and influence of the crater structure on sedimentation was obvious even 10 million years after the impact event. The tectonic stability of the region, the low rate of sedimentation, and long lasting differential compaction of sediments in the crater area account for this extraordinary long influence of crater. The Kardla crater is an example of the astrobleme, formed in ancient shelf sea, which may be used to reconstruct basin history of post-impact times. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI Rising waters: New geoarchaeological evidence of inundation and early
   agriculture from former settlement sites on the southern Yangtze Delta,
   China
SO HOLOCENE
AB New pollen, phytolith, charcoal and diatom data from C-14 AMS-dated sediments from three clusters of former occupation sites on the southern Yangtze Delta - Liangzhu, Majiabang and Chuodun - reveal that hydrological conditions were a key factor influencing early food production on the southern Yangtze Delta. At least two episodes of inundation are recognized, the first occurring at c. 7200-5700 cal. yr BP and a second from c. 4700 cal. yr BP. The first involved increasing salinity of surface waters, likely associated with marine intrusion linked to post-glacial sea-level change (meltwater pulse (MWP) 2). The second appears to have been freshwater in nature and driven at least in part by extreme meteorological events of high levels of precipitation in combination with impeded drainage. These two episodes had profound impacts on Neolithic settlement and farming. Further hydrological changes, presumably linked to changes in sedimentary regime, geomorphology and drainage of the Taihu depression, recorded at the Chuodun site after c. 3000 cal. yr BP, appear to have had a major effect on technologically relatively advanced food production systems. While environmental pressures appear to have played an important role in shaping human activities and settlement on the southern Yangtze Delta, people responded by adopting strategies that included an increased reliance on food production, migration to more clement locations and implementation of new technologies, which possibly included the construction of flood defence works.

TI Tracking the Holocene evolution of Sabine Lake through the interplay of
   eustasy, antecedent topography, and sediment supply variations, Texas
   and Louisiana, USA
SO RESPONSE OF UPPER GULF COAST ESTUARIES TO HOLOCENE CLIMATE CHANGE AND
   SEA-LEVEL RISE
SE Geological Society of America Special Papers
AB The Sabine-Neches fluvial-estuary system is composed of deposits that represent fluvial, deltaic, central-basin, tidal inlet/delta, and chenier depositional systems. The Holocene deposits and associated environmental changes preserved in the drowned Sabine-Neches alluvial valley provide a valuable analog for present and future environmental changes. These deposits are bounded by flooding surfaces that record episodes of dramatic environmental reorganization during the Holocene. The most dramatic environmental changes are manifested as stratigraphic back stepping in which central-basin sediments overlie deltaic sediments. The magnitude of flooding varies from a few tens of kilometers to less pronounced back stepping followed by rapid progradation.
   Initial flooding of the onshore Sabine-Neches incised valley occurred around 9800 cal yr B.P., and by ca. 8900 cal yr B.P., a vast bayhead delta occupied the southern half of the valley. This delta backstepped up the valley during the relatively rapid sea-level rise of the early to middle Holocene, and by ca. 7100 cal yr B.P., it occupied the entire valley. After ca. 7100 cal yr B.P., the bayhead delta shifted up the valley again, and a central-basin setting existed in the lower half of the valley. The middle basin expanded episodically between ca. 5500 cal yr B.P. and 1700 cal yr B.P., and a brief period of delta growth occurred similar to 300 yr ago.
   Controlling mechanisms for flooding surface formation include sea-level rise, changes in the antecedent topography of the incised valley, and sediment supply variations. Antecedent topography was influential in controlling estuarine evolution between ca. 7800 and 7500 cal yr B.P., when an extensive fluvial terrace was inundated. The fact that some flooding surfaces appear to be synchronous, within a few centuries, in several estuaries across the northern Gulf of Mexico suggests a eustatic rather than local control. Flooding events at ca. 8900 cal yr B.P. and ca. 8400-8000 cal yr B.P. were likely caused by rapid, sub-meter-scale sea-level rise events. Sediment supply variations controlled by climatic forcing appear to have been the main cause of other flooding events. Unfortunately, the Holocene climate record for the east Texas-west Louisiana coastal region is poorly documented, and a direct relationship to central and western Texas climate records may be complex. So the exact nature of climate control on sediment flux to the estuary system remains elusive.

TI Caspian Sea levels over the last 2200 years, with new data from the S-E
   corner
SO GEOMORPHOLOGY
AB A revision of the data used to build the Caspian Sea level curve over the last 2200 years BP has been made based on a combination of geological and archaeo-historical data, using only those for which sufficient metadata were available. This compilation is completed by new sedimentological and palynological data from the south-east corner of the Caspian Sea, especially close to the known termini of the Sasanian Gorgan and Tammisheh Walls. A new calibration of the radiocarbon dates was used, i.e. with a freshwater offset reservoir of 351 +/- 33 years. A literature survey of the Derbent lowstand indicated that this term has different definitions, depending on authors; it is thus to be used with caution. Here we therefore prefer to distinguish the mid-Sasanian lowstand and the later Medieval moderate lowstand. The "2600 years BP highstand" has not been found, mostly due to the calibration or recalibration of the datapoints used; data are indeed lacking at that time. Instead, a younger Parthian highstand (around 50 BC-50 AD) is clearly defined. The maximal amplitude and speed of change of the Caspian Sea level were respectively of >15 m and 14 cm per year. Compared to last century, the latter rate is 25% higher, but the amplitude is more than five times larger. The climatic causes of the Caspian Sea level changes are discussed. It is far from a simple case of temperature forcing; temperature forcing may result in several effects, that may impact the Caspian Sea level variations in opposite ways. Moreover, human intervention on river diversion and natural hazards were likely, for several time periods.

TI Wet Dune Slacks, Sea-level and Coastal Evolution in the South-western
   Portuguese Facade
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB Dune slacks are peculiar features of the Portuguese coast with evident scenic, ecological and geological value and yet the existing knowledge on their origin, evolution and dynamics is poor. A number of wet dune slacks in the South-western Iberian coast (Pops do Barbaroxa and Lagoa da Sancha) have been studied using sedimentological and geochemical proxies which, coupled with radiocarbon dating, were allowed to establish major steps of coastal evolution, environmental changes and relations with sea-level throughout the Holocene. The Barbaroxas basins are blind freshwater lakes while Lagoa da Sancha is, at present, connected with a small rivulet. The size and shape of interdune depressions reflect a palaeotopography inherited from a ridge and swale complex that accreted seaward in the Pleistocene. The interdune infill consists essentially of peat resting upon dune sand; accumulation of organic material initiated diachronically in the different slacks, between circa 7700 and 4160 cal BP, in dependence of piezometric level. At Barbaroxas this organic facies persisted until present, whereas at Lagoa da Sancha it was replaced circa 670 cal BP by minerogenic sedimentation. At the present state of knowledge it is unclear if this change represents a capture of the tributary stream, either natural or man-induced, or a massive release of top soil due to contrasting land-use in the watershed. At present, the peat surface in Barbaroxas stands 1 to 2 m above mean sea level and is fairly horizontal. Assuming similar relation in the past, then sea level should have been positioned at -3/-4 m and -0.5/-1.5 m by 7400 and 4100 cal BP, respectively. These figures are consistent with the most recent sea-level data published for the Portuguese coast.

TI Simulated extreme sea levels at Helsinki
SO BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
AB We present an assessment of the exceedance probabilities of sea levels at Helsinki, on the coast of the Gulf of Finland in the Baltic Sea, based on an 850-year numerical sea-level simulation. The internal sea-level variations in the Baltic Sea are calculated with a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model, whereas the variations in the Baltic Sea water volume are evaluated using a statistical model based on the geostrophic wind speeds near Bornholm. The atmospheric data used for the sea-level simulation is taken from downscaled regional climate scenario simulations. The simulated sea-level extremes at Helsinki in the current climate are slightly smaller than the previous estimates which were based on measured data only. The extrapolation of simulated data gives an estimate of sea level 227 cm at Helsinki for the exceedance frequency of 10(-4) events per year. The sum of the maxima of the model components during a short 30-year verification period indicates that sea level 225 cm is possible at Helsinki if all the components simultaneously attain their maxima.

Here, based on a new analysis of the fossil record, we identify a previously unrecognized extinction event among marine megafauna (mammals, seabirds, turtles and sharks) during this time, with extinction rates three times higher than in the rest of the Cenozoic, and with 36% of Pliocene genera failing to survive into the Pleistocene. To gauge the potential consequences of this event for ecosystem functioning, we evaluate its impacts on functional diversity, focusing on the 86% of the megafauna genera that are associated with coastal habitats. Seven (14%) coastal functional entities (unique trait combinations) disappeared, along with 17% of functional richness (volume of the functional space). The origination of new genera during the Pleistocene created new functional entities and contributed to a functional shift of 21%, but minimally compensated for the functional space lost. Reconstructions show that from the late Pliocene onwards, the global area of the neritic zone significantly diminished and exhibited amplified fluctuations. We hypothesize that the abrupt loss of productive coastal habitats, potentially acting alongside oceanographic alterations, was a key extinction driver. The importance of area loss is supported by model analyses showing that animals with high energy requirements (homeotherms) were more susceptible to extinction. The extinction event we uncover here demonstrates that marine megafauna were more vulnerable to global environmental changes in the recent geological past than previously thought.

TI Chronology of a Holocene Core From the Pearl River Delta in Southern
   China
SO FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
AB Establishing a reliable chronological framework for sediments is crucial to the reconstruction of evolution process of estuarine delta, and the study of regional paleoenvironmental history, e.g., sea level fluctuations due to global climatic changes. High resolution chronology is still very limited for Holocene sediments in the Pearl River delta (PRD) in southern China. This study tries to construct a detailed chronology for core DA of 37.7 m in depth by using luminescence (seven samples) and radiocarbon (fourteen samples) dating techniques. Our results indicate that both luminescence and radiocarbon dating methods are suitable for the Holocene sediments in the PRD and that sediments of core DA were deposited during 7.3-0.18 ka. The(14)C age is generally older than the OSL age for the sediment at the similar depths, and the age difference increased from 0.45 ka at the depth of 21 m to 0.98 ka at the depth of 35 m. The reason that(14)C ages are relatively older might be caused by the carbon-reservoir effect which requires further study. The sedimentation rate increased from 3.74 m/ka during 7.3-2 ka to 7.92 m/ka in the last 2 ka. The appearances of rusty stains in upper unit of the core revealed that the water level was gradually falling. After the formation of underwater sand body at about 2 ka, the sediment was subject to continuous shifting between submergence and exposure.

TI Holocene lake development of two Dalmatian lagoons (Malo and Veliko

   climate
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB Within the Austrian IGBP/PAGES project "Palaeolimnology of Adriatic-Alpine Lakes" (PAAL), geochemical and diatom analyses were performed on sediment cores of Male and Veliko Jezero, two karstic coastal lakes on the island Mljet, Croatia. Combined with diatom calibration, they provide evidence of remarkable environmental changes during the Holocene, The formation of the lakes in the early Holocene was triggered by a rise in the Adriatic sea level from approximately -50 to -30 m, which resulted in the transmission of seawater through karat, and by a temporary increase in precipitation. The onset of this pluvial period was dated in Male Jezero at 8.4 kyr B.P. and had its maximum approximately 7-6 kyr B.P. It was briefly interrupted by a dryer episode from about 7.2 until 7.1 kyr B.P. Between 6 and 5.5 kyr B.P,, a transition to the present Mediterranean climate occurred. The marine ingression into Veliko Jezero through the Soline channel, with a present depth of 2.5 m, took place about 5 kyr B.P, From 5 to 4 kyr B.P., the oscillating sea level gradually approached the present value. A tephra layer at 7.3 kyr B.P. in both lakes was related to sudden environmental changes that were probably caused by tectonic movements accompanying Italian volcanism. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB The sediment record of the fauna of Ace Lake, a saline meromictic lake in the Vestfold Hills, Antarctica, consists of copepod eggs, spermatophores and exoskeletal fragments, rotifer and tintinnid loricae, and foraminiferal and folliculinid tests. The relative abundance of these remains, along with other characteristics of the core, allows the development of a coherent picture of the progress of Ace Lake from a species-poor, freshwater lake early in the Holocene to a biodiverse marine basin following a marine transgression. Subsequent sea level fall reformed Ace Lake as a saline lake and productivity initially increased after isolation. After a major event, possibly associated with overturn of the meromictic lake, biodiversity and productivity decreased, and have continued to do so until the present. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

TI Interannual sea level variability in the Pearl River Estuary and its
   response to El Nifio-Southern Oscillation
SO GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
AB The South China coast, especially the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) region, is prosperous and densely populated, but vulnerable to sea level changes. Sea level anomalies (SLA) during 1954-2012 from tide gauge station data and regional SLAs during 1993-2012 from satellite altimetry are analyzed and compare to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Results show that sea level declines during El Nino events and rises during La Nina. Sea level in the PRE responds to ENSO with 3 month lag. The ENSO can cause sea level in the PRE to fluctuate from -8.70 to 8.11 cm. Sea level cycles of 3 and 5 years are related to ENSO. The ENSO mechanism affecting sea level in the PRE was analyzed by identifying dominant regional and local forces. Weak/strong SLAs in most El Nino/La Nina events may be attributed to less/more seawater transport driven by anomalously weak/strong north winds and local anomalously high/low sea level pressure. Wind-driven coastal current is the predominant factor. It generated coastal seawater volume transport along a 160 km wide cross section to decrease by 21.07% in a typical El Nifio period (January 2010) and increase by 44.03% in a typical La Nina period (January 2011) as compared to an ENSO neutral situation (January 2013). Results of sea level rise and its potential mechanism provide insight for disaster protection during extreme El Nifio/La Nina events.

TI Resilience of Infrastructure Systems to Sea-Level Rise in Coastal Areas:
   Impacts, Adaptation Measures, and Implementation Challenges
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Expansive areas of low elevation in many densely populated coastal areas are at elevated risk of storm surges and flooding due to torrential precipitation, as a result of sea level rise. These phenomena could have catastrophic impacts on coastal communities and result in the destruction of critical infrastructure, disruption of economic activities and salt water contamination of the water supply. The objective of the study presented in this paper was to identify various impacts of sea level rise on civil infrastructures in coastal areas and examine the adaptation measures suggested in the existing literature. To this end, a systemic review of the existing literature was conducted in order to identify a repository of studies addressing sea level rise impacts and adaptation measures in the context of infrastructure systems. The study focused on three infrastructure sectors: water and wastewater, energy, and road transportation. The collected information was then analyzed in order to identify different categories of sea level rise impacts and corresponding adaptation measures. The findings of the study are threefold: (1) the major categories of sea level rise impacts on different infrastructure systems; (2) measures for protection, accommodation, and retreat in response to sea level rise impacts; and (3) challenges related to implementing adaptation measures.

TI Evidence of recent sea-level rise and the formation of a classic Maya
   canal system inferred from Boca Paila cave sediments, Sian Ka'an
   biosphere, Mexico
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB Cave sediments along the eastern coast of the Yucataan Peninsula contain important records of paleo-environmental change that have not been fully explored. Reconstructing environmental changes in Boca Paila lagoon reveals details about sea level, flooding of the Sian Ka'an Biosphere, and the timeline of occupation at Muyil, an important Classic Maya maritime trading site. Three sediment cores (BP1, BP2, and BP3) were collected from a cave system beneath Boca Paila lagoon in the Sian Ka'an Biosphere. Radiocarbon dating, geochemical (X-Ray Fluorescence Core Scanning, delta C-13, C/N), and microfossil (foraminifera, diatoms, pollen) analyses were performed. The combined results show three distinct phases of coastal evolution. Phase 1 (1157 BCE or earlier), an upland area with mangrove associate Conocarpus erectus, grasses, and ferns, is characterized by: organic-rich detrital peat; a relative absence of foraminifera and diatoms; organic geochemistry results within terrestrial ranges (delta C-13 values of -28 parts per thousand to -26 parts per thousand); and low Sr/Ca, Si/Ti, and Ti/K ratios. These indicate dry conditions at the karst surface. Phase 2 (1157 BCE - 312 CE), a shallow wetland, is represented by: an increase in weathering products (Ti/K) and diatom productivity (Si/Ti); more positive delta C-13 values (-27 parts per thousand to -22 parts per thousand) and decreasing C/N ratios; and increased marine foraminifera (e.g., Ammodiscus sp.). These indicate more openwater conditions. Phase 3 (>312 CE), a wetland/lagoon environment, is characterized by: carbonate-rich marl; a greater diversity of foraminifera (Ammonia spp., Elphidium spp., Rosalina spp., and Bolivina spp.), diatoms (Cyclotella meneghiniana, Craticula spp., Amphora spp., Hyalosynedra laevigata, and Grammatophora spp.) and pollen (from mangroves, ferns, grasses, palms, and pine); increased Si/Ti and Sr/Ca values; and mixed marine and terrestrial organic geochemistry values (delta C-13 values of -22 parts per thousand to -20 parts per thousand). These indicate increased input of marine organic sediment during sea-level rise. Sea-level and climate records support the interpretation of a dry upper karst environment prior to -1157 BCE, with sea-level rise forming shallow (<50 cm) wetlands by -312 CE. Previous archaeological analysis estimates that the first settlers arrived at Muyil -350 BCE, but that population expansion and construction of most structures occurred during the Postclassic (925-1550 CE). Sea-level rise would have been an important factor in the expansion of coastal settlements and trade routes; continued sea-level rise after -312 CE allowed for the formation of deeper lagoons and channels connecting the coast to Muyil and other inland sites which would likely not have been navigable prior to the Early Classic period (250-600 CE) as they would be too shallow. This study highlights the impacts of environment on society, as well as the importance of karst cave systems for obtaining paleoenvironmental records. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   2005-2015
SO GEODESY AND GEODYNAMICS
AB Global mean sea level budget is rigorously adjusted during the period 2005-2015. The emphasis is to provide the best estimates for the linear rates of changes (trends) of the global mean sea level budget components during this period subject to the constraint: Earth's hydrosphere conserves water. The newly simultaneously adjusted trends of the budget components suggest a larger correction for the global mean sea level trend implicated by the other budget components' trends under the budget constraint. The simultaneous estimation of the linear trends of the budget components subject to the constraint for closure improves their uncertainties and enables a holistic assessment of the global mean sea budget, which has implications for future sea level science studies, including the future Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Reports, and the US Climate Assessment Reports.

TI High resolution climate and environmental changes of the northern Japan
   (East) Sea for the last 40 kyr inferred from sedimentary geochemical and
   pollen data
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB High-resolution lithological and isotope-geochemical analyses were made on a well age constrained sediment from the northeastern Japan (East) Sea which recorded 10 dark layers (DL) over the last 40 ka BP. Pollen analysis of the core allows us to reconstruct the history of surrounding landmass vegetation and to determine pronounced vegetation/climate changes. We found that DL 10 which correlated with a DO/Chinese interstadial 8 was forced by increased East Asian humidity and influx of the nutrient-rich water into the sea. DL 5 formed during the cold Heinrich event 3 (HE), at 30-31 ka BP, was most likely to be initiated by the global sea level descent and reduction of seawater exchange with the North Pacific. High resolution of delta O-18(pf) records reflects a unique sensitivity of the Japan (East) Sea to input of the North Pacific water through the shallow Tsushima and Tsugaru Straits. This led us to the important evidence of the eustatic-sea level changes during the last 40 ka BP. Since 29 ka BP, delta O-18(pf) curve shows a continuous descending sea level interrupted by sharp drops of HE 2 with a following rise of DO interstadial 2. A sharp delta O-18(pf) increase since 18.6 ka BP is consistent with coral results which indicate abrupt termination of LCM low stand by a rapid sea level rise initiated at 19.0 ka BP.

TI Anthropogenic forcing dominates global mean sea-level rise since 1970
SO NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
AB Sea-level change is an important consequence of anthropogenic climate change, as higher sea levels increase the frequency of sea-level extremes and the impact of coastal flooding and erosion on the coastal environment, infrastructure and coastal communities(1,2). Although individual attribution studies have been done for ocean thermal expansion(3,4) and glacier mass loss(5), two of the largest contributors to twentieth-century sea-level rise, this has not been done for the other contributors or total global mean sea-level change (GMSLC). Here, we evaluate the influence of greenhouse gases (GHGs), anthropogenic aerosols, natural radiative forcings and internal climate variability on sea-level contributions of ocean thermal expansion, glaciers, ice-sheet surface mass balance and total GMSLC. For each contribution, dedicated models are forced with results from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate model archive(6). The sum of all included contributions explains 74 +/- 22% (+/- 2 sigma) of the observed GMSLC over the period 1900-2005. The natural radiative forcing makes essentially zero contribution over the twentieth century (2 +/- 15% over the period 1900-2005), but combined with the response to past climatic variations explains 67 +/- 23% of the observed rise before 1950 and only 9 +/- 18% after 1970 (38 +/- 12% over the period 1900-2005). In contrast, the anthropogenic forcing (primarily a balance between a positive sea-level contribution from GHGs and a partially offsetting component from anthropogenic aerosols) explains only 15 +/- 55% of the observations before 1950, but increases to become the dominant contribution to sea-level rise after 1970 (69 +/- 31%), reaching 72 +/- 39% in 2000 (37 +/- 38% over the period 1900-2005).

TI Sensitivity of Baltic Sea salinity to large perturbations in climate
SO CLIMATE RESEARCH
AB Potential future changes in the salinity of the Baltic Sea must be included in safety assessments of nuclear waste repositories. The salinity affects the potential recipient ecosystems water turnover along the coast, as well as the groundwater hydrology, and groundwater chemistry The time-scales of nuclear waste repositories are extremely long, and climate forecasts must therefore encompass extreme variations. This study presents a model that enables computation of Baltic Sea salinity for different sea level positions and freshwater supplies, thus making it possible to assess the impact of a given climatic change. A modest rise in global sea level (+ 1 m) would le,id to a salinity increase from 8 to 9 in the southern Baltic Proper. An increase in the freshwater supply by about 2000 m(3) s(-1) (approximately +10%) would result in a similar salinity change. Further. a sea level drop of about 5 m or an increase in the freshwater supply by a factor of 3 would reduce the salinity in the southern Baltic Proper to <1, i.e. large parts of the Baltic would become limnic. A 50% decrease in freshwater supply would double the salinity in the southern Baltic Proper to about 15; the effect is more pronounced in the Bothnian Sea and Bothnian Bay, where the salinity would increase from 6 to 13 and from 3.5 to 10, respectively.

TI Evidence of climatic control on hydrocarbon seepage in the Miocene of
   the northern Apennines: The case study of the Vicchio Marls
SO MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY
AB The Vicchio outcrop in the Tuscan Apennines contains excellent exposures of a Miocene methanederived carbonate system, made up of more than 80 carbonate bodies enclosed in marly sediments. Fades analysis, composition and a detailed biostratigraphic study of the carbonates and enclosing Vicchio Marls allowed us to document the role of climatic changes and eustasy on seepage in these ancient deposits. Results of our study indicate that the stratigraphic horizon bearing seep-carbonates is constrained by two planktonic foraminiferal events, the Acme End (AE) of Turborotalita cf. T. quinqueloba (13.75 Ma) and the Acme(1) Beginning (A(1)B) of Paragloborotalia siakensis (13.32 Ma), encompassing about 400,000 years. The AE of T. cf. T quinqueloba approximates the mid-Miocene global cooling event (Mi3b), as defined by the delta O-18 maxima (13.78 Ma). The glacio-eustatic sea level drop associated with this cooling event is estimated to be approximately 60 m. Assuming that the highest rates of glacio-eustatic sea level fall coincide with delta O-18 maxima, the timing of the seepage onset (at about 13.75 Ma) is concomitant with the phase of sea level-lowering. The ascent and emission of methane-rich fluids may have been triggered by pressure drop due to the eustatic fall associated with the Mi3b event. The moderate intensity of fluid expulsion is suggested by the lack of brecciation, by the scarcity of detrital particles in the carbonates and by the pervasive occurrence of carbonate in the enclosing marls. This type of seepage differs from focused fault-confined fluid flows, typical of other tectonically controlled Apenninic seep-carbonates. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Stratigraphic, morphologic and radiocarbon data from Puerto Deseado coastal area (Santa Cruz Province, Argentina) indicate that the Holocene coastline formed in response to the discontinuous aggradation of coarse gravely beaches since c. 6300 cal. yr BP related to a progressive falling of relative sea level. Beach ridge crests crudely approximate to the sea level showing at least three steps of aggradation and relative sea-level lowering. Two inactive abrasive notches at c. 7.9 and 3.4 m a.s.l. have recorded this sea-level trend, suggesting two important phases when sea level was stationary. This allows the estimation of a rate of relative sea-level fall in the last c. 3500 years of c. 1.8 mm/yr. Moreover, notches and morphological data indicate that the crest of the beach ridges exceeded the sea-level height by c. 2 +/- 0.5 m. This value provides a reasonable regional estimate to be applied to produce comparable relative sea-level curve for Atlantic Patagonia coast.

TI Seasonal and long-term sea-level variations and their forcing factors in
   the northern Bay of Bengal: A statistical analysis of temperature,
   salinity, wind stress curl, and regional climate index data
SO DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERES AND OCEANS
AB In the northern Bay of Bengal, mechanisms of seasonal sea-level variation have not previously been examined, and the understanding of longer-term inter-annual sea-level variation is also not concrete. These parameters are addressed in this study utilizing available tide gauge and satellite altimetry data. The contribution of steric sea level to seasonal and longer-term inter-annual sealevel variations is quantified, and statistical analysis is performed to determine the correlations of various atmospheric and oceanic factors with sea level. This study suggests that the trend of sealevel rise in this bay (4 +/- 1.33 mm/year) is higher than the global average (3.32 +/- 0.46 mm/year) for the studied period 1993 to 2018. The rate of sea-level rise is higher along the coast than in the offshore area and the highest in the central part of the coast. Sea level shows a strong seasonal variation: sea level is the lowest in the winter but the highest in autumn. The contribution from the thermosteric sea level is higher to the observed sea level from winter to early summer, whereas contributions from the halosteric sea level and wind stress curl are higher during autumn. Long-term variations in sea level show strong positive correlations with thermosteric sea level, indicating that temperature is a major local controlling factor for sea-level change. In addition to local factors, long-term sea level also varies by remote forcing (equatorial zonal wind stress), which explains approximately 36 % of the sea-level variation in this bay. Sea level is low during the combined events of positive Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) and El Nino, whereas the sea level is high during the combined events of negative IOD and La Nina. This study provides an improved understanding of seasonal and longer-term inter-annual variations of sea level and the necessary gmundworks for a dedicated model study to further quantify all the components of the sea-level budget in the study areas.

TI Late Holocene environmental change in Celestun Lagoon, Yucatan, Mexico
SO JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY
AB Epikarst estuary response to hydroclimate change remains poorly understood, despite the well-studied link between climate and karst groundwater aquifers. The influence of sea-level rise and coastal geomorphic change on these estuaries obscures climate signals, thus requiring careful development of paleoenvironmental histories to interpret the paleoclimate archives. We used foraminifera assemblages, carbon stable isotope ratios (delta C-13) and carbon:nitrogen (C:N) mass ratios of organic matter in sediment cores to infer environmental changes over the past 5300 years in Celestun Lagoon, Yucatan, Mexico. Specimens (> 125 mu m) from modern core top sediments revealed three assemblages: (1) a brackish mangrove assemblage of agglutinated Miliammina and Ammotium taxa and hyaline Haynesina (2) an inner-shelf marine assemblage of Bolivina, Hanzawaia, and Rosalina, and (3) a brackish assemblage dominated by Ammonia and Elphidium. Assemblages changed along the lagoon channel in response to changes in salinity and vegetation, i.e. seagrass and mangrove. In addition to these three foraminifera assemblages, lagoon sediments deposited since 5300 cal yr BP are comprised of two more assemblages, defined by Archaias and Laevipeneroplis, which indicate marine Thalassia seagrasses, and Trichohyalus, which indicates restricted inland mangrove ponds. Our data suggest that Celestun Lagoon displayed four phases of development: (1) an inland mangrove pond (5300 BP) (2) a shallow unprotected coastline with marine seagrass and barrier island initiation (4900 BP) (3) a protected brackish lagoon (3000 BP), and (4) a protected lagoon surrounded by mangroves (1700 BP). Stratigraphic (temporal) changes in core assemblages resemble spatial differences in communities across the modern lagoon, from the southern marine sector to the northern brackish region. Similar temporal patterns have been reported from other Yucatan Peninsula lagoons and from cenotes (Nichupte, Aktun Ha), suggesting a regional coastal response to sea level rise and climate change, including geomorphic controls (longshore drift) on lagoon salinity, as observed today. Holocene barrier island development progressively protected the northwest Yucatan Peninsula coastline, reducing mixing between seawater and rain-fed submarine groundwater discharge. Superimposed on this geomorphic signal, assemblage changes that are observed reflect the most severe regional wet and dry climate episodes, which coincide with paleoclimate records from lowland lake archives (Chichancanab, Salpeten). Our results emphasize the need to consider coastal geomorphic evolution when using epikarst estuary and lagoon sediment archives for paleoclimate reconstruction and provide evidence of hydroclimate changes on the Yucatan Peninsula.

TI Variation and response to experimental warming in a New Zealand cushion
   plant species
SO AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
AB Cold adapted plants, such as cushion plants, may be particularly sensitive to climate warming because of their compact growth form and high branch density. In the oceanic southern hemisphere, cushion communities tend to have large range distributions at low latitudes (sea level to low alpine), thus providing an opportunity to test the effects of temperature on plant morphology and reproduction across gradients. Using Donatia novae-zelandiae as a model species, we compared the leaf morphology, reproduction and responses to warming. Two low-alpine sites (Maungatua (880m a.s.l.), Blue Mountains (1000m a.s.l.)) and two sea-level sites (Waituna 1 (0m a.s.l.), Waituna 2 (0m a.s.l.)) in South Island, New Zealand were used. Donatia novae-zelandiae cushions differed significantly between the high-elevation and sea-level sites both morphologically and in terms of reproduction. High-elevation cushions produced more flowers (threefold more flowers per plant) and seeds (sevenfold more seeds per capsule) than at sea level, but leaves were larger at sea level (in length and specific leaf area). The cushions were also twice as compact at the high-elevation sites. After two growing seasons of artificial warming, seed production (35%), leaf length (7%) and width (13%), and specific leaf area (63%) significantly decreased in D.novae-zelandiae plants; flower production was not significantly affected. Cushion plant morphology and reproduction were significantly affected by environmental drivers at their establishment sites, but all populations responded negatively to artificial warming of 1-3 degrees C. Many cushion plants are considered keystone species because of their propensity to facilitate the growth and establishment of other plant species, the inferred negative effects of global warming on cushion plant species may have a cascading effect on other alpine plant groups.

TI Contrasting records of sea-level change in the eastern and western North
   Atlantic during the last 300 years
SO EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
AB We present a new 300-year sea-level reconstruction from a salt marsh on the Isle of Wight (central English Channel, UK) that we compare to other salt-marsh and long tide-gauge records to examine spatial and temporal variability in sea-level change in the North Atlantic. Our new reconstruction identifies an overall rise in relative sea level (RSL) of c. 0.30 m since the start of the eighteenth century at a rate of 0.9 +/- 0.3 mm yr(-1). Error-in-variables changepoint analysis indicates that there is no statistically significant deviation from a constant rate within the dataset. The reconstruction is broadly comparable to other tide-gauge and salt-marsh records from the European Atlantic, demonstrating coherence in sea level in this region over the last 150-300 years. In contrast, we identify significant differences in the rate and timing of RSL with records from the east coast of North America. The absence of a strong late 19th/early 20th century RSL acceleration contrasts with that recorded in salt marsh sediments along the eastern USA coastline, in particular in a well-dated and precise sea-level reconstruction from North Carolina. This suggests that this part of the North Carolina sea level record represents a regionally specific sea level acceleration. This is significant because the North Carolina record has been used as if it were globally representative within semi-empirical parameterisations of past and future sea-level change. We conclude that regional-scale differences of sea-level change highlight the value of using several, regionally representative RSL records when calibrating and testing semi-empirical models of sea level against palaeo-records. This is because by using records that potentially over-estimate sea-level rise in the past such models risk over-estimating sea-level rise in the future. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Sea level and climate: measurements and causes of changes
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE
AB We review present-day observations of sea level change and variability at global and regional scales, focusing on the altimetry era starting in the early 1990s. Over the past similar to 18-years, the rate of global mean sea level rise has reached 3.3 +/- 0.4 mm/year, nearly twice that of the previous decades, although the observed larger sea level rise rate may be influenced by decadal or longer variations in the ocean. Moreover, sea level rates are not geographically uniform; in some regions like the tropical western Pacific, rates are up to 3-4 times higher than the global mean rate. We next discuss the climate-related components of the global mean sea level rise. Over the last similar to 18-years, ocean thermal expansion contributes about one third to the observed rise while total land ice (glacier melting plus ice sheet mass loss) contribute the other two third. The spatial trend patterns evidenced over the altimetry period mostly result from nonuniform steric sea level changes (effects of ocean temperature and salinity), largely caused by wind-driven ocean circulation changes. Such patterns are not stationary but oscillate through time on decadal/multidecadal time scale, in response to natural modes of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system. We close up this review by briefly discussing future (21st century) sea level rise. Current limited knowledge of the future evolution of the mass balance of the Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets leads to high uncertainty on the global mean sea level rise expected for the next 50-100 years.

TI Climatic changes during the last deglaciation recorded in sediment cores
   from the northeastern Brazilian Continental Margin
SO GEO-MARINE LETTERS
AB Detailed C-14 AMS data and isotope based stratigraphies from high-resolution paleoceanographic records for the last 22 ka of cores from the upper continental slope off NE Brazil reveal sedimentation rates of up to 100 cm per 1000 yr. Variations in the sediment composition relate to changes in the input of terrigenous material. The sedimentation is controlled by sea level and by the climatic regime of the hinterland. Short-term changes in the tropical wind field may act as a climatic trigger. The zonality of the SE trades was probably increased and the monsoonal activity over Africa reduced during the Younger Dryas period.

TI Coastal sea level monitoring in the Mediterranean and Black seas
SO OCEAN SCIENCE
AB Employed for over a century, the traditional way of monitoring sea level variability by tide gauges - in combination with modern observational techniques like satellite altimetry - is an inevitable ingredient in sea level studies over the climate scales and in coastal seas. The development of the instrumentation, remote data acquisition, processing, and archiving in the last decades has allowed the extension of the applications to a variety of users and coastal hazard managers. The Mediterranean and Black seas are examples of such a transition - while having a long tradition of sea level observations with several records spanning over a century, the number of modern tide gauge stations is growing rapidly, with data available both in real time and as a research product at different time resolutions. As no comprehensive survey of the tide gauge networks has been carried out recently in these basins, the aim of this paper is to map the existing coastal sea level monitoring infrastructures and the respective data availability. The survey encompasses a description of major monitoring networks in the Mediterranean and Black seas and their characteristics, including the type of sea level sensors, measuring resolutions, data availability, and existence of ancillary measurements, altogether collecting information about 240 presently operational tide gauge stations. The availability of the Mediterranean and Black seas sea level data in the global and European sea level repositories has been also screened and classified following their sampling interval and level of quality check, pointing to the necessity of harmonization of the data available with different metadata and series in different repositories. Finally, an assessment of the networks' capabilities for their use in different sea level applications has been done, with recommendations that might mitigate the bottlenecks and ensure further development of the networks in a coordinated way, a critical need in the era of human-induced climate changes and sea level rise.

SO JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN EARTH SCIENCE SOCIETY
AB Molluscan shells were sampled from the continental shelf of South Sea: 19 stations in the southeast continental shelf and 5 in the southwest sea, in order to understand characteristics of sea level changes and time-averaging since the last glacial age. Radiocarbon dates were made on 42 dominant and specific species which were sampled from 24 stations. Time-averaging was observed and showed to be 11,939 years in age difference. The sea-level ranged from 150 to 160 m below sea level during the LGM (about 15,000 yrs B.P). The sea-level significantly rose to 60 m at around 9,000 yrs B.P. and became stable at 50 to 60 m between periods between 4,000 and 5,000 yrs B.P. Between 3,000 and 4,000 yrs B.P, the sea-level rapidly rose to a depth of 10(similar to)20 m below todays present sea level.

TI Ring width and vessel features of the mangrove Excoecaria agallocha L.
   depend on salinity in the Sundarbans, Bangladesh
SO DENDROCHRONOLOGIA
AB The Bangladesh Sundarbans is the largest continuous mangrove in the world that providing crucial environmental services, particularly related to coastal protection and livelihoods of millions of people. However, anthropogenic disturbances, diseases infestation and environmental changes including sea level rise (SLR) and fresh-water flux into the delta are threatening the Sundarbans and other mangrove ecosystems worldwide. Protection of mangrove ecosystems requires knowledge on factors that mainly drive growth and vitality of tree species to evaluate which consequences can be expected from, mainly hydrology-related, environmental changes. In this study, we assessed the nature and periodicity of tree rings in Excoecaria agallocha, a wide spread mangrove species in the Bangladesh Sundarbans. We also analysed the influence of climatic factors, such as precipitation, temperature and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and river discharge, as a proxy of salinity on ring width (RW) and vessel features, such as mean vessel area (MVA) and mean vessel density (MVD). E. agallocha forms distinct tree-ring boundary that characterized by a narrow (2-4 cells wide) band of radially flattened fibres. The RW as well as the MVA and MVD are crossdatable. The RW is mainly driven by salinity which is influenced by freshwater inputs through precipitation during monsoon along with river discharge January to April. The MVA and MVD responded to similar seasons and months as RW, but mostly with opposite signs in MVD. The results suggest that fresh water inputs through precipitation and river discharge positively influence the radial growth of E. agallocha in the Sundarbans. The RW and vessel features can be used as proxies to explore the growth dynamics of this species, especially in relation to global environmental changes.

TI Impact of Quaternary climatic changes and interspecific competition on
   the demographic history of a highly mobile generalist carnivore, the
   coyote
SO BIOLOGY LETTERS
AB Recurrent cycles of climatic change during the Quaternary period have dramatically affected the population genetic structure of many species. We reconstruct the recent demographic history of the coyote (Canis latrans) through the use of Bayesian techniques to examine the effects of Late Quaternary climatic perturbations on the genetic structure of a highly mobile generalist species. Our analysis reveals a lack of phylogeographic structure throughout the range but past population size changes correlated with climatic changes. We conclude that even generalist carnivorous species are very susceptible to environmental changes associated with climatic perturbations. This effect may be enhanced in coyotes by interspecific competition with larger carnivores.

AB Recent increases in archaeobotanical and genetic evidence offer insights into agricultural origins and plant domestication, which suggest a protracted process taking thousands of years that began by 10,000 cal a BP or in the late Pleistocene. Compared to the cereal domestication that was accomplished in the early Holocene in Southwest Asia and Mesoamerica, the reasons for the delay in rice domestication in China until the middle Holocene remain unclear. In the present study, the dynamic influence of environmental change on rice domestication was revealed by evidence from sedimentary facies and phytolith analysis of the high-resolution HMD1602 core from the Hemudu site. Rice phytoliths were recovered from beneath the neritic sediment at this site for the first time, which pushes the history of human activities and the process of rice domestication in the Yaojiang Valley back to 8200-7600 cal a BP. The process of rice domestication at the Hemudu site developed discontinuously with an obvious interruption during 7600-7100 cal a BP, which was significantly influenced by marine transgression and palaeo-typhoon events. Furthermore, synthesis of palaeoenvironmental and archaeobotanical records suggests that rice exploitation and domestication was interrupted three times during 13,000-10000, 7900-7400 and 6400-5600 cal a BP, respectively. The first interruption of rice exploitation was induced by the Younger Dryas, which triggered the onset of cultivation at approximately 10,000 cal a BP in Southwest Asia and China, while the second two interruptions of rice domestication were caused by marine transgressions, which postponed the domestication of only rice. Therefore, the delayed accomplishment of rice domestication until the middle Holocene resulted from an unstable climatic environment and sea-level fluctuations, which ultimately led to the discontinuous process of rice domestication.

TI Microtidal Marshes: Can These Widespread and Fragile Marshes Survive
   Increasing Climate-Sea Level Variability and Human Action?
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB Microtidal organic marshes, where mineral inputs are low to negligible and the dominant organic inputs to vertical accretion are subject to substantial losses from decomposition, may be particularly at risk from future environmental change. Generally occurring along coasts with small tidal frames (<2-m tidal range, or microtidal), these marshes are characterized by average flood velocities too low to import appreciable mineral sediment into marsh interiors. Their reliance on organic accumulation makes them vulnerable to any factor that affects annual biomass inputs, whether by animal (e.g., waterfowl or snails) overgrazing, damage to physiological functioning (substrate anoxia, excess hydrogen sulfide, and nutrient concentrations), or erosion from coastal storms. The sudden dieback phenomenon highlights differences between microtidal marshes and those in larger tidal frames. Despite a number of proposed causes, dieback in microtidal systems can resemble classic interior pond formation from rapid sea level rise. By comparison, in marshes where tidal ranges exceed 2 m, it commonly involves wholesale plant loss across a wide area, whether in shoreline areas only or across the breadth of the marsh. Increasing sea level variability, with more frequent accelerations and decelerations, along with exceptional high and low stands, could add a critical element to the matrix of stressors (many of human origin) to fragile microtidal marshes. These marshes, therefore, could be lost at faster rates than expected from future sea level rise scenarios. Society should be rightly concerned about whether microtidal marshes can endure future sea level rise, as well as whether they can survive our stewardship now.

TI A sporomorph ecogroup model for the Northwest European Jurassic - Lower
   Cretaceousi: concepts and framework
SO NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES-GEOLOGIE EN MIJNBOUW
AB Based on recent vegetation distribution and an integration of macropalaeobotanical and palynological information, a palaeo-community model is explored that may permit detailed interpretations of quantitative sporomorph distribution patterns in the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous of NW-Europe in terms of changes in palaeoenvironment (sea-level, climate). The conceptual model is based on the recognition of Sporomorph Ecogroups (SEGs) that reflect broad co-existing plant communities, viz. upland, lowland, river, pioneer, coastal, and tidally-influenced SEGs. In successive palynological assemblages, shifts in the relative abundance of SEGs are thought to be indicators of sea-level changes. Climatic changes may be recognised through significant shifts within the quantitative composition of individual SEGs.

TI 'The future looks empty': embodied experiences of distress triggered by
   environmental and climatic changes in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
SO GEOJOURNAL
AB Environmental and climatic changes have become issues of global concern partly because of their ability to disrupt activities connected to people's livelihood. Yet, the emotional distress caused by these changes and the factors responsible for place-based attachment, especially in the Global South, have received scant attention to date. Drawing on the theories of 'solastalgia'-sadness caused by environmental change and the ensuing emotions it evokes-and place-based attachment, this article analysed the embodied experiences of climatic and environmental changes on rural households in KwaMaye, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Primary data was obtained qualitatively. Findings indicate that environmental and climatic changes, which have manifested in the form of increased soil infertility, soil erosion, mole and termite infestations and increased drought conditions, have undermined farmers' ability to produce food and engage in livestock production effectively. These circumstances evoked frustrations, increased anxiety, sadness, reduced self-value and self-worth as well as helplessness. Nonetheless, place-based attachment is underpinned by kinship bonds and ancestral heritage. These issues have been discussed within the wider theoretical debates revolving around solastalgia and place-based attachment.

TI Absolute Baltic Sea Level Trends in the Satellite Altimetry Era: A
   Revisit
SO FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB The absolute sea level trend from May 1995 to May 2019 in the Baltic Sea is analyzed by means of a regional monthly gridded dataset based on a dedicated processing of satellite altimetry data. In addition, we evaluate the role of the North Atlantic Oscillation and the wind patterns in shaping differences in sea level trend and variability at a sub-basin scale. To compile the altimetry dataset, we use information collected in coastal areas and from leads within sea-ice. The dataset is validated by comparison with tide gauges and the available global gridded altimetry products. The agreement between trends computed from satellite altimetry and tide gauges improves by 9%. The rise in sea level is statistically significant in the entire region of study and higher in winter than in summer. A gradient of over 3 mm/yr in sea level rise is observed, with the north and east of the basin rising more than the south-west. Part of this gradient (about 1 mm/yr) is directly explained by a regression analysis of the wind contribution on the sea level time series. A sub-basin analysis comparing the northernmost part (Bay of Bothnia) with the south-west reveals that the differences in winter sea level anomalies are related to different phases of the North-Atlantic Oscillation (0.71 correlation coefficient). Sea level anomalies are higher in the Bay of Bothnia when winter wind forcing pushes waters through Ekman transport from the south-west toward east and north. The study also demonstrates the maturity of enhanced satellite altimetry products to support local sea level studies in areas characterized by complex coastlines or sea-ice coverage. The processing chain used in this study can be exported to other regions, in particular to test the applicability in regions affected by larger ocean tides.

TI Sea-level fluctuations during the historical period in Gomso Bay, Korea
SO MARINE GEOLOGY
AB Historical sea-level changes in Gomso Bay, the tectonically stable "far-field" area, in the midwestern Korean Peninsula were inferred based on old documents concerning salt production and shipping routes. The sea-level in the 570s CE was similar to that at present, fell at some time around the 1530s CE, rose in the 1750s CE, and rose more in the 1790s CE. The 1-m-long sediment core QJB-30 recovered from the Gomso Bay area shows a marine unit, paleosol unit, and another marine unit in stratigraphic order, supporting this interpretation. The soil formation in the paleosol unit appeared to progress at the location of the core while sea-level was lowered around the 1500s and 1600s CE. Given that the tidal flat is widely distributed in this bay, subtle sea-level fluctuations could appear largely due to the local differences in topographic gradients and the overall shape of the bay. This study also shows that sea-level rise began earlier than the end of the Little Ice Age (1850 CE). The most likely explanation for this is that meltwater from the Greenland Ice Sheet in the early 1700s CE caused sea-level rise around the Korean Peninsula due to sea-level fingerprint effects. Old documents describing coastal areas are important sources for reconstructing historical sea-levels, and they inform us about changes both in the natural environment and in human activity.

TI ACCRETION RATES OF LOW INTERTIDAL SALT MARSHES IN THE PACIFIC-NORTHWEST
SO WETLANDS
AB Salt-marsh accretion rate was investigated at sites that spanned a gradient in relative rate of sea-level rise in Washington and Oregon. Mean accretion rate over all sites was 3.6 mm yr-1 (95% CI = 2.4 to 4.8 mm yr-1), which exceeded present mean sea-level-rise rate (1.3 mm yr-1; sd = 0.6). However, a mean rise rate of 5.5 mm yr-1 (sd = 1.9) predicted by a moderate sea-level-change scenario to occur by the year 2050 exceeds mean accretion rate. Marshes with adequate sediment input seemed to have the capacity to keep pace with an increased sea-level-rise rate. Lowest accretion rates were recorded at sites with the least sediment supply. Accretion rate showed a weak negative correlation with sediment organic matter (measured as volatile solids) and marsh standing stock. The data suggest that moderate and high rise-rate scenarios would threaten the existence of salt marshes in the region in the absence of increased sediment supply. A better understanding is required of marsh accretion and predicted rate of sea-level rise to refine predictions of the effects of sea-level rise on Pacific Northwest salt marshes.

TI Climate and sea-level controls on turbidity current activity on the
   Tanzanian upper slope during the last deglaciation and the Holocene
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB Turbidity current is one of the most important mechanisms for rapid transportation of terrigenous sediments from the continental margin to the deep sea. Although extensive work on turbidite systems has been carried out globally, the Tanzanian margin, off East Africa, is poorly understood. This paper will therefore use a well-dated high-resolution marine core (GeoB12624-1), obtained during RV Meteor Cruise M75/2, from the upper Tanzanian continental slope, offshore the Rufiji River delta, to demonstrate which environmental parameters, e.g., climate versus sea level, control the temporal distribution of the turbidite deposits during the last deglaciation and the Holocene. Results show that the turbidite deposits are composed of coarser-grained sediments with normally graded bedding. The thickness, mean grain size and frequency of the turbidite beds were estimated to detect turbidity current activity since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). A total of 12 turbidite beds (T1-T12) was recognized and divided into three intervals, based on the presence and intensity of the turbidite deposits. (I) a glacial sea-level lowstand (LGM and Heinrich Stadial 1; 19.3-14.6 ka): suppressed turbidity current activity due to arid conditions in the hinterland and sea-level lowstand. (II) A deglacial sea-level rise period (Bolling-Allerod interval to the early Holocene; 14.6-8 ka): turbidity current activity started to be strengthened during the Bolling-Allerod warming interval (T1), followed by a first increase in turbidite frequency, thickness and mean grain-size during the Younger Dryas (T2-T4) and a second increase during the early Holocene (T5-T10). (III) An interglacial sea-level highstand period (mid-to late Holocene; 8-2.5 ka): turbidity current activity diminished from the mid- (T11, T12) to late Holocene. This temporal distribution of turbidite deposits indicates that turbidity currents were most active during the last sea-level rise, synchronous with more humid climate in the hinterland, than during a sea-level lowstand (e.g., LGM) when climate was more arid. Thus, we propose that it is the climate conditions in the hinterland that form the primary controlling factor for turbidity current activity of Tanzanian slope. The remobilization of lowstand sediments on the Tanzanian continental margin during a sea-level rise, combined with shedding sediments towards the study area from the main canyon/channel, also plays a role in supplying new sediments to the turbidite system. These new data demonstrate that, in specific continental margin, high fluvial discharge will promote sediment transfer along the shelf and slope even during sea-level rise and highstand.

TI Mangrove vegetation responses to Holocene climate change along Konkan
   coast of south-western India
SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
AB The pollen signatures preserved in the mangrove sediments provided records of species variation over a period of time with past climate and sea level changes. The Airoli profile has a Late Pleistocene sequence, and all the other studied profiles and intervals cover the Holocene only. The absence of mangrove signatures during the Late Pleistocene interval is attributed to a relatively low sea level. The ideal conditions for mangrove development along Konkan prevailed during Middle Holocene, when the first extensive mangrove swamps appeared in Sindhudurg (Dhamapur-Hadi) area particularly between 7220 and 4770 yrs BP. This period coincides with the Holocene Climate Optimum (HCO) when Monsoon Asia witnessed much higher precipitation. However, the mangroves responded to environmental changes due to relative abundance of fresh water leading to change in species composition. Two different scenarios of mangrove response during the Late Holocene, one in Dhamapur and the other in Palm Beach, are found to be significant. The Rhizophora-Sonneratia transition from Early Mid-Holocene to Late Holocene is considered to be the most distinctive feature. The decline of mangroves since 3500 yrs BP and further degradation has been attributed to the prevailing arid climate and weakening trends of the monsoon until 1500 yrs BP. However, there seems to be a positive trend in emergence of mangroves in the least disturbed areas of south Konkan, attributed to strengthening of summer monsoon in the recent past.

AB A review is given of geomorphological evidence suggesting the nature of environmental changes in South America during the Last Glaciation Maximum (LGM). The data are from glacial, geocryogenic, alluvial, colluvial and aeolian systems and span 68-degrees of latitude, making the most complete land transect of major climatic systems in the Southern Hemisphere.
   Glaciers in the northern and central Andes may have reached their maximal extent by 27,000 yr B.P.; reduced precipitation at the LGM, caused by lower temperatures and lower atmospheric humidity, probably led to slight glacier recession in the tropical Andes. Icefields in the Southern Andes were most expansive when global temperature and sea level were lowest, because Pacific westerlies supplied abundant moisture, and western outlets advancing across the continental shelf were constrained by sea level.
   Low-gradient river networks became incised by at least 100 m into narrow channels as global sea level fell by 120 m during the LGM. ''Draw-down'' of water-tables possibly impacted the forest cover, enhancing the drying influence of reduced sea surface temperature and atmospheric humidity. As forest and grass covers diminished in extent, effecting greater atmospheric cooling because of reduced evapotranspiration and convective condensation, colluvial and aeolian processes became more active and widespread. Almost 25% of the continent is covered with palaeo-aeolian features, presumed to have been active when airflow was stronger due to steeper atmospheric pressure and temperature gradients at the LGM.
   Substantial changes in precipitation totals and incidence, and in ground-water availability, probably eliminated modern-type tropical rainforest except in areas currently receiving ca. 5000 mm of annual rainfall. Equivalent changes in vegetation cover spread across much of the Guyana and Brazilian highlands and throughout the southern temperate regions.

TI Holocene sea-level change and estuary infill in North West Nelson,
   central New Zealand
SO HOLOCENE
AB The sedimentary sequences found within estuaries in the north west Nelson region of central New Zealand are investigated in order to quantify the timing of the end of the Post Glacial Marine Transgression. This region has been identified as being relatively stable in terms of vertical tectonic movement during the Holocene, but is yet to yield any reconstructions of eustatic sea level. In this study, we investigate the Holocene infill of a barrier estuary (Parapara Inlet) through sedimentological analysis and radiocarbon dating of 18 vibracores up to 4.2 m in length. It is found that the estuary infilled through a combination of lateral flood tide and fluvial delta progradation as well as vertical central basin infill. The central basin infilled at a consistent rate of 0.4 mm/year in both the mid (7.0-6.0 ka) and late-Holocene (2.5-1.5 ka). By the time of early human (Maori) settlement (c. 1 ka), the estuary surface was at low intertidal elevations with sediment being transported from the fluvial to tidal delta. A discernible change in sedimentation rates could not be associated with Maori settlement; however, infill rates increased to at least 12.5 mm/year in the past 150 years due hydraulic sluicing associated with mining. The sedimentary history of Parapara Inlet is compared to nearby Whanganui Inlet, d'Urville Island and Nelson to establish the character of regional Holocene sea level movement. It is found that relative sea level reached modern elevations between 8 and 7 ka in the region. The similarity between sea level curves for the end of the post glacial marine transgression (PMT) to other tectonically stable sites in northern New Zealand suggests that this curve can now be considered a true eustatic signal for the New Zealand archipelago.

Journal of Coastal Research, 28(6), 1617-1626. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. The results from analyses of cores and pits carried out during two research campaigns in the littoral lagoon of Albufereta d'Alacant (Western Mediterranean) shed light on the sedimentary dynamics of this area. The erosive sequence and stages recorded in periods prior to the Middle Holocene bear witness to the environmental changes that occurred in the littoral zone between isotope stages 2 and 1 in relation to the rise in sea level during the Holocene. As the rise in the sea level slowed, a freshwater lagoon environment formed around 4000 YBP. After that time, the changes in the littoral environment became less pronounced and were caused by atmospheric circulation in the Northern Hemisphere. Around 3000 YBP, a lagoon open to the sea emerged as the result of a relative change in the sea level. This environment lasted approximately until 1500 YBP. The prolonged survival of the lagoon created by this event and the increase in the marine influence during the later stages of the lagoon's development may be connected with human management of the environment in the Roman era. It was followed by a restricted lagoon environment characterized by cyclical changes in the environment lasting hundreds of years.

TI Hydrological and temperature change in Arctic Siberia during the
   intensification of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation
SO EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
AB The Pliocene epoch represents an analog for future climate, with atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and continental configurations similar to present. Although the presence of multiple positive feedbacks in polar regions leads to amplified climatic changes, conditions in the Pliocene terrestrial Arctic are poorly characterized. High latitude sedimentary records indicate that dramatic glacial advance and decay occurred in the Pliocene Arctic, with attendant effects on global sea-level. Understanding these deposits and their implications for Earth's future requires developing a sense of climatic evolution across the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition and during the intensification of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation (iNHG) similar to 2.7 million yr ago (Ma). Here we reconstruct Arctic terrestrial environmental change from 2.82-2.41 Ma (Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) G10-95) using the distribution of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) and the isotopic composition of plant leaf waxes (delta D-wax) in a sedimentary archive from Lake El'gygytgyn, Northeast Russia. Our records reveal changes in proxy behavior across this interval that we attribute to changing boundary conditions, including sea level, sea ice, vegetation and pCO(2) during different MISs. We find that brGDGT temperatures and delta D-wax are decoupled for most of the record, although both show an increasing range of glacial-interglacial variability following iNHG. delta D-wax is stable from MIS G10-G4 despite changes in vegetation and temperature, suggesting different sources or pathways for moisture to Lake El'gygytgyn during the Late Pliocene.

TI High-resolution records of the response of coastal wetland systems to
   long-term and short-term sea-level variability
SO ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
AB While it is well known that coastal systems respond to long-term sea-level changes, the importance of short-term sea-level dynamics is often overlooked. Year-to-year variability in annual mean sea level along the North American Atlantic coast is part of a regionally consistent pattern that is coupled to low atmospheric pressure and high wind field anomalies persisting over 100s to 1000s of km. These short-term sea-level dynamics, along with long-term sea-level changes are shown to be closely coupled to a set of high resolution excess Pb-210 geochronologies from four physiographically distinct salt marsh estuaries surrounding Long Island, NY, USA. However, the degree to which a marsh responds to either forcing depends on its physiographic setting. Accretion and mineral deposition rates in marshes situated in embayments with long fetches and low-tidal ranges are shown to respond most to the short-term dynamically driven changes in sea level. On the other hand, accretion and mineral deposition in a marsh in an embayment with a high-tidal range and reduced fetch best track the long-term changes in mean sea level, presumably because the physiography limited the meteorological drivers of short-term sea-level change. The close coupling between marsh accretion, physiographic setting and indices of sea-level change indicates that these coastal system respond both differently and rapidly (2-5 yr) to climate variability.

TI Millstone quarries along the Mediterranean coast: Chronology,
   morphological variability and relationships with past sea levels
SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
AB The coast of the Mediterranean provide several remnants of ancient coastal quarries, which are now useful to study sea level change occurring during the last millennia. Millstones quarries were exploited with same quarrying techniques from rocks like beachrocks, sandstones or similar lithologies, were shaped to be suitable to grind olives, seeds and wheat, to produce oil and flour, or to break apart soft rocks.
   In this study we integrated historical sources, aerial photography, field surveys and palaeo sea-level modelling to investigate a number of millstones quarries with the aim to asses the intervening sea level change that occurred since the quarries were abandoned.
   We investigated on their chronology, spatial distribution and spatial relationship to the sea-level. Our results indicate that most of these were carved close to sea level between 1.45 ka and 0.25 ka cal BP, but mainly around 0.45 cal ka BP. Despite the uncertainties associated with the chronology in, we found good agreement between their lowest elevation (between 0.33 m and -0.06 m) and the paleo sea-levels, as predicted by the GIA models.

TI A dual model for emulation of thermosteric and dynamic sea-level change
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
AB Future thermosteric and dynamic sea-level changes are often projected by process-based climate models. Emulation of such computationally expensive models helps enable model intercomparison over a range of forcing scenarios and thus enables additional analysis of sea-level rise projection uncertainty. Current emulation methods use linear response functions to estimate global mean sea-level response. Here, we introduce a novel dual model to emulate global mean thermosteric sea-level rise that incorporates short- and long-term responses to climate forcing. This nonlinear response function outperforms existing linear response functions over six illustrative general circulation models and the four representative concentration pathways. To emulate dynamic sea-level projections, we introduce a linear pattern scaling model that relates regional sea-level changes to global mean thermosteric sea-level rise. Pattern scaling is shown to reproduce strongly forced sea-level trends. Our results demonstrate effective emulation of global and regional sea-level rise, which can facilitate the consideration of sea-level rise projection uncertainty critical to the analysis of sea-level rise hazard.

TI CROSS-BASIN VARIATIONS IN MAGNETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY INFLUENCED BY CHANGING
   SEA LEVEL, PALEOGEOGRAPHY, AND PALEOCLIMATE: UPPER DEVONIAN, WESTERN
   CANADA SEDIMENTARY BASIN
SO JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH
AB Upper Devonian rocks in western Canada were deposited as carbonate-platform and surrounding slope and basinal rocks during a second-order sea-level cycle, characterized by long-term climatic warming, that ended with cooling associated with the Frasnian-Famennian mass-extinction event. In this contribution, we assess the hypothesis that high-resolution magnetic susceptibility (MS) data records cross-basin variations that are intimately tied to sea level and associated climatic change, the depositional environment, and the paleogeographic location of siliciclastic sediment sources. Four main trends are apparent in the MS data: (1) the magnitude of the MS signature increases from west to east across western Canada; (2) platform fades generally have low MS signatures compared with off-platform facies; (3) the overall MS signature increases and then decreases throughout the stratigraphic profile, largely in response to changes in depositional setting (i.e., item 2); (4) MS is generally high during third- and fourth-order sea-level lowstand and early transgression and lower during late transgression and highstand.
   During the late Middle (Givetian) to early Late (Frasnian) Devonian, siliciclastic sediments (silt and fine sand size) sourced from the west Alberta arch and Peace River arch, contributed to relatively high MS signatures in facies deposited proximal to these source areas. Other important detrital sediment sources were the Ellesmerian orogenic belt in northern Canada and the Laurussian continental landmass to the east. These latter sources supplied fine-grained sediments that were dispersed basin-wide and resulted in a nearly order-of-magnitude increase in MS values to the east. This trend and fine grain size implies that some detrital sediment was delivered from the east as eolian dust from the "Old Red Continent."
   By the early Frasnian, the west Alberta arch was submerged, and by middle to late Frasnian time the Peace River arch was large!) covered. During the late middle Frasnian a pronounced rise in MS signatures can be tied directly to deposition of the clay- and locally silt-rich Mount Hawk Formation. During the late middle to late Frasnian, carbonate-ramp fades prograded from east to west, resulting in seaward migration of the shoreline and increased siliciclastic input to the ramp slope that influenced the pronounced increase in MS signatures to the east. By the late Frasnian, cross-basin MS profiles record uniformly low susceptibilities indicating that high MS siliciclastic detritus was either bypassed seaward, was swamped by carbonate input, or was dominated by diamagnetic quartz.
   Individual MS events can be accurately correlated across much of the basin at a resolution that is higher than single conodont zones despite the local influences on variability of the signature. Variations in the MS signature can thus be explained partly by depositional environment (platforms with low MS, basins with higher MS) and partly by third- and fourth-order sea-level and associated climatic changes. Fourth-order changes in sea level are routinely interpreted to result from variations in paleoclimate in the Milankovitch band and recent work indicates that third-order sea-level changes may be linked to longer-term modulation of Milankovitch-band orbital variations. The increase in MS during prolonged Frasnian warming thus appears to be directly linked to paleoclimatic change, and comparison of the MS signature with more direct measures, like oxygen isotopes, would serve as a test of its utility as a paleoclimate proxy.

AB Missing data is a common problem in sea level records, and yet gappy records may hinder estimates of sea level trend and variability. Sea level may be affected by various scale phenomena, ranging from global climate change to interannual sea level pattern caused by coupled ocean-atmosphere oscillations, as well as by many other regional phenomena. It could be expected that such complexity make sea level analysis more difficult; however, if relationships between the above phenomena and sea level values are established for continuous parts of the record, they can be used for reconstruction of the gappy parts. In this study, we derive simple and robust method of reconstruction of the gappy data in the Singapore Strait using established relationships of sea level on the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Asian monsoon. The reconstructed mean sea level is verified against observations, and allows for more accurate estimation of sea level trend and variability in the Singapore Strait.

AB Potential sea level rise poses a significant threat to low-lying areas. Considering present and future of coastal areas, scientific study of sea level rise is an essential for adapting to sea level extremes. In this study, the relative sea level change in the Black Sea were investigated using data of 12 tide-gauge and 6 GNSS stations. Results generally indicated sea level rise along the Black Sea coast. Only at Bourgas tide-gauge station, a sea level fall was detected. A significant sea level change were not determined at Sinop tidegauge station. On the other hand, at some stations such as Poti and Sile, ground subsidence contribution to relative sea level changes were observed.

TI Palynological evidence for Neogene environmental change in the foreland
   basin of the southern Tianshan range, northwestern China
SO GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
AB In this paper, we report 3780-m-thick Neogene deposits accumulated in the Kuqa foreland basin of southern Tianshan range, providing great potential for studying both tectonics and paleoclimatic changes. Based on palynological evidence, we discuss the paleoenvironmental changes as well as the interplay between regional uplift and climatic change in the region studied. Our results indicate that the vegetation and climatic changes from 13.3 to 7 Ma were response to global climatic changes. After 7 Ma, the uplift of the southern Tianshan range partially affects vegetation and climatic changes. Both global cooling and the rainshadow effect of uplifted high mountains affect the enhanced arid climate initiated ca. 5.23 Ma ago. Such climatic changes are important archives in reconstructing paleoclimate of the Asian interior. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Late Pleistocene and Holocene palaeogeography of the Lower Tagus Valley
   (Portugal): effects of relative sea level, valley morphology and
   sediment supply
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB Because of the deep glacial incision, the Lower Tagus Valley hosts a sedimentary record since similar to 20 000 cal BP, making this a unique site along the European Atlantic margin with respect to palaeogeographic and sea level changes. Based on nine cross-sections and 55 radiocarbon dates together with a newly created relative sea level curve, we constructed five palaeogeographic maps of the infill of the Lower Tagus Valley since similar to 20 000 cal BR We illustrate that relative sea level rise and fluvial sediment supply were the prime forcing factors determining the depositional history and palaeogeographic changes. Around 20 000 cal BP a deeply incised braided river existed, which was directly connected to the ocean across the narrow continental shelf. After that (similar to 12 000 cal BP) the gradually moister and warmer climate caused a change to a single-channel river. During the following period (12 000-7000 cal BP) relative sea level rise resulted in a transgression in the Lower Tagus Valley and the establishment of extensive tidal environments. After relative sea level rise had ended (similar to 7000 cal BP) the valley was progressively filled by a fluvial wedge and tidally influenced bayhead delta. Since similar to 1000 cal BP the valley-fill history was dominated by increased sediment input due to human-induced degradation of catchment slopes. Generally, climate was of subordinate importance during the entire studied period, merely causing a single-channel river resulting from the change from the cold Heinrich event I to the temperate Bolling-Allerod interstadial. Despite the tectonic activity in the region, neotectonic uplift or subsidence was limited, as supported by the horizontal relative sea level curve since similar to 7000 cal BP. Neotectonics played a minor role due to the large distance from the Fennoscandian ice sheet and the narrow continental shelf, which prohibited strong glacio- and hydro-isostatic movements.

TI Revisiting extreme precipitation amounts over southern South America and
   implications for the Patagonian Icefields
SO HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
AB Patagonia is thought to be one of the wettest regions on Earth, although available regional precipitation estimates vary considerably. This uncertainty complicates understanding and quantifying the observed environmental changes, such as glacier recession, biodiversity decline in fjord ecosystems and enhanced net primary production. The Patagonian Icefields, for example, are one of the largest contributors to sea-level rise outside the polar regions, and robust hydroclimatic projections are needed to understand and quantify current and future mass changes. The reported projections of precipitation from numerical modelling studies tend to overestimate those from in situ determinations, and the plausibility of these numbers has never been carefully scrutinized, despite the significance of this topic to our understanding of observed environmental changes. Here I use simple physical arguments and a linear model to test the plausibility of the current precipitation estimates and its impact on the Patagonian Icefields. The results show that environmental conditions required to sustain a mean precipitation amount exceeding 6.09 +/- 0.64 m yr(-1) are untenable according to the regional moisture flux. The revised precipitation values imply a significant reduction in the surface mass balance of the Patagonian Icefields compared to previously reported values. This yields a new perspective on the response of Patagonia's glaciers to climate change and their sea-level contribution and might also help reduce uncertainties in the change of other precipitation-driven environmental phenomena.

TI Holocene sea levels in Southeast Asia, Maldives, India and Sri Lanka:
   The SEAMIS database
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB We assembled a database of Holocene relative sea-level index points (n = 213) and marine (n = 211) and terrestrial (n = 122) limiting points for the broader South and Southeast Asian region including the Maldives, India and Sri Lanka. The standardized review of published age-elevation information from corals, deltaic, estuarine and mangrove deposits, beachrocks and tidal notches, yielded a new suite of relative sea-level index and limiting points produced according to a standardized protocol. Expected spatial variability in Holocene relative sea-level change due to glacial isostatic adjustment was accounted for, by first subdividing the study area into ten geographic sub-regions from the Central Indian Ocean to the Western Tropical Pacific, and second by comparing sub-regional relative sea-level data to model predictions of glacial isostatic adjustment. Results show that some of the regionally constrained relative sea-level data are characterized by significant inconsistencies that cannot be explained by glacial isostatic adjustment. Such inconsistencies of standardized relative sea-level data become particularly obvious in areas around the Red River Delta in Vietnam, the Gulf of Thailand, the northwest coast of Malaysia and the Spermonde Archipelago in Indonesia. Based on a critical evaluation of the reviewed relative sea-level indicators, we discuss possible sources of local divergence and identify regions where data are currently insufficient to constrain glacial isostatic adjustment predictions. The remaining quality-controlled and consistent relative sea-level data show that glacial isostatic adjustment and syn-/post-formational influences such as tectonic uplift, subsidence and compaction were the dominant local drivers of Holocene relative sea-level change. Collectively, the results of this review suggest that Holocene sea levels in South and Southeast Asia and surrounding regions have been controlled by a variety of global and local drivers and imply that additional index points from the Java Sea in Indonesia would be valuable to better assess the spatial variability, and to calibrate geophysical models of glacial isostatic adjustment.

TI Changing structure of benthic foraminiferal communities: implications
   from experimentally grown assemblages from coastal Georgia and Florida,
   USA
SO MARINE ECOLOGY-AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE
AB Environmental changes such as ocean warming or sea-level rise have a profound impact on shallow-water coastal environments. Benthic foraminifera have long been successfully used as indicators for ecologic responses. The propagule method is a useful tool to evaluate the reactions of entire assemblages of foraminifera when exposed to different environmental conditions. Here we present results from growth experiments of foraminiferal assemblages from three sites in coastal Georgia and Florida (USA) under different temperatures (18, 24 and 30 degrees C) and salinities (15 and 35). Results show that assemblages grown at the higher temperatures had greater abundances of foraminifera, whereas salinity was the primary factor in shaping the composition of the experimentally grown assemblages from the three sites. We also show that experimentally grown assemblages contain high numbers of exotic' species that result from successful propagule recruitment from outside of the original environments (e.g. the open shelf). Overall, opportunistic and previously termed pioneer species' proved to be the most successful constituents of the experimental assemblages, showing that reactions of foraminiferal assemblages to environmental changes can appear remarkably quickly (e.g. in the course of several weeks). Our observations on the faunal reactions to different temperatures and salinities indicate that ongoing environmental alterations of coastal areas will likely result in significant changes in the shallow-water foraminiferal assemblages of the coasts of Georgia and Florida. As such, our study provides general insights into the ecologic effects of current climate change.

AB Long-term sea level change is important for a variety of environmental and socio-economic reasons, especially for the large portion of the world's population who lives in coastal zones. Satellite altimetry now offers a unique opportunity for improving our knowledge about global and regional sea level change.
   TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P) sea level observations and Reynolds AVHRR sea surface temperature observations over the most recent 8 years have qualitatively been used to study regional correlations between long-term changes in sea level and sea surface temperature. Long-term is here taken to be linear signals in the 8-year time period.
   Consistent increases in both sea level and sea surface temperatures are found in most parts of the Atlantic Ocean over this period. In the Indian Ocean and particularly the Pacific Ocean, the trends in both sea level and temperature are still dominated by the large changes associated with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
   Sea level changes over the most recent 8 years detected by T/P sea level observations are correlated with changes in the Reynolds AVHRR sea surface temperature observations with a global averaged correlation of 0.62. On regional scales this number becomes higher. Specifically, in the tropical part of the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean where the correlation computed over 20degrees latitude bands increases to 0.89.

AB Climate and sea level constrain the abundance of primary producers (plants) and habitat size. These directly affect the seasonal density and distribution of animal species, which inevitably have implications for human decisions regarding what to eat, where to live, how long to stay there, and when to move. Are diversification strategies such as the inclusion of low-ranked terrestrial resources and marine species in the diet effective coping mechanisms for climate-driven environmental change and habitat loss due to sea level rise? Is intensification of resource exploitation indicative of dietary stress? How might these adaptations affect the seasonal round? Our paper discusses these questions, spanning the transition from post-glacial foraging lifestyles at the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary (12,000 BP) to the introduction of pastoralism during the early Neolithic (7,000 BP), using zooarchaeological material from the upland cave site of Vela Spilja on the island of Losinj in the Kvarner Gulf of Croatia.

TI Arctic Sea Level and Surface Circulation Response to the Arctic
   Oscillation
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB The Arctic Oscillation (AO) is the leading mode of extratropical northern hemisphere atmospheric variability, affecting surface pressure, winds, temperature, and precipitation. Here we use an altimeter sea level record spanning 2003-2014, covering the ice-covered and ice-free ocean, to examine the influence of the AO on Arctic sea level and surface geostrophic circulation. AO-driven alongshore wind anomalies drive cross-shelf Ekman transport and opposing barotropic sea level anomalies between the shelf seas and deep basins of the Arctic Ocean, with maximum sea level anomaly differences across the shelf-break of similar to 3 cm per unit AO index. This pattern of sea level variability generates topographically steered (generally along-shelf) current anomalies of around 0.5 cm/s per unit AO index. AO-driven wind variability modulates surface currents associated with Atlantic and Pacific water inflow, with opposing inflow anomalies between the Barents Sea Opening and Bering Strait.
   Plain Language Summary The Arctic Oscillation dominates large-scale changes in atmospheric pressure, wind, temperature, and precipitation north of 20 degrees N. This study uses satellite measurements to investigate the impact the Arctic Oscillation has on sea level and upper ocean currents in the Arctic Ocean. Winds associated with the Arctic Oscillation cause sea levels to rise in the shallow coastal shelf seas, and drop in the deeper ocean, or vice versa, depending if the Arctic Oscillation is in a positive or negative phase. These sea level patterns drive currents which generally follow the edge of the continental shelf. The Arctic Oscillation also influences the strength of the currents associated with the inflow of Atlantic Water through the Barents Sea and the inflow Pacific Water through the Bering Strait.

AB Important geochemical evidence reflecting Quaternary climatic changes was obtained by evaluating geochemical data from 51 samples and datings from 3 samples by ESR method from sediments of a 7-m-deep trench in Great Konya lake area at the southwest of Adakale village (Konya, Turkey). The geochemical data indicate that the study area was influenced, four times, by a climate having strong precipitation, which caused strong erosion and high detrital input between 25,276 +/- 1732-year BP and approximately 50,000-year BP. These periods correspond to climatic changes during the last glacial periods, the warm climate of D-O-2, D-O-5, D-O-6 and D-O-14 events and the cold climate of H2, H3, H4 or H5 and H6 events.

TI Sea-Level Trend at the Southernmost Region of South America
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB Tide gauge data were used to estimate the sea-level trend at the Ushuaia tidal station (54 degrees 49' S, 68 degrees 13' W), located at the southernmost city in the world. The Ushuaia tidal station began working in 1951 but was relocated in 1970 approximately 900 m from its original location. Special care was taken in linking both data series to compose a single and reliable sea-level record gathered from 1952 to 2005. The least-square regression line for annual mean sea level (relative to the benchmark) was fitted, and the computed slope that resulted was not significantly different from zero. A low-pass filter was applied to the annual sea-level data series to smooth the constituents of tide longer than 1 year, which could mislead the trend of the mean sea level. The trend of the best fit line computed from the filtered data was -0.2 mm y(-1), which was not significantly different from zero. Taking into account the Peltier glacial isostatic adjustment prediction, a corrected sea-level trend was estimated in +1 mm y(-1) for the Ushuaia tidal station. The sea-level trend was also estimated by processing the altimetry data series gathered at five satellite track crossings located in the adjacent ocean (analyzed period 1992-2011). Resulting sea-level trends computed from altimetry data presented high spatial variability (from -0.9 to +3.1 mm y(-1)), which is likely associated with the rather short length of the processed data series. The authors of this technical communication foresee that these results will contribute to our knowledge of sea-level change in the Southern Hemisphere, especially southward of 50 degrees S, where long sea-level data series are considerably scarce.

TI Developed barrier island adaptation strategies to hurricane forcing
   under rising sea levels
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
AB Global sea levels have risen at a rate of 1.7 mm/year over the last century and are projected to rise an additional 0.2 to 2.0 m by 2100 with some regions experiencing higher rise in relative sea level due to localized processes. As sea levels rise, low-lying, narrow barrier islands are threatened by episodic flooding and wave impact and are particularly vulnerable during storm events. These types of islands are ubiquitous along the U.S. East and South coasts and other coasts worldwide. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of several adaptation strategies, including combinations of nature-based and hard structures, on developed barrier islands to hurricane forcing under future sea levels. Interpreting the results of a morphological numerical model, beach nourishment from the toe of the dune to the depth of closure (i.e., active beach only) provides only a slight increase in protection for the island from hurricane forcing as sea levels rise. Raising elevations of the existing dune or existing buried seawall effectively reduces overall volumetric erosion but, under extreme sea level rise, does not protect against bay-side flooding and severe back-barrier erosion. Raising the elevation of the entire island, particularly the back-barrier region, offered the greatest protection from severe erosion on the developed barrier island under future sea level states and hurricane forcing. Using these results, an adaptation pathway based on level of sea level rise is created to illustrate the effectiveness of an adaptive approach in managing the accelerating risk posed by sea level rise.

TI Taihu Lake, lower Yangtze drainage basin: evolution, sedimentation rate
   and the sea level
SO GEOMORPHOLOGY
AB The present study focuses on two Holocene sediment boreholes in Taihu Lake, sunk to examine the lake sediment including sedimentary texture and structure, microfossils, magnetic susceptibility and radiocarbon-dated Holocene stratigraphy. Results demonstrate that the early Taihu Lake area consisted primarily of West Taihu Lake depression and a low floodplain in the East Taihu Lake area. No hydraulic connection existed between the two sectors during the early Holocene when sea level stood at lower level. Core sediments, microfossil and magnetic evidence records that West Taihu Lake be.-an to be inundated by brackish water prior to 6000 years ago, while East Taihu Lake still remained a freshwater setting. After 6000 B.P., a further rise in freshwater table in response to sea-level fluctuation progressively drowned the entire lake, coalescing the two parts after 4600-3500 B.P.
   Our coring revealed that the lacustrine sediment began to form in West Taihu Lake as early as 11,000 years ago, while it happened much later (only after 5700 B.P.) to form in East Taihu Lake. High sedimentation rates (0.42-0.35 mm/year) in lacustrine deposits of West Taihu Lake occurred between similar to 11,000 and 5000 B.P. In contrast, the high sedimentation rates (1.54 mm/year) in East Taihu Lake occurred only within a very short time period, from similar to 6500 to 5500 B.P. Since then, sedimentation rates have decelerated to a very low value (< 0.10 mm/year) in both West and East Taihu Lakes. The low sedimentation rate of West and East Taihu Lake of the middle and late Holocene explains the deceleration of the sea-level rising after 5500 B.P. and the rapid coastal progradation seaward.

TI Prehistoric human migration between Sundaland and South Asia was driven
   by sea-level rise
SO COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY
AB Rapid sea-level rise between the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the mid-Holocene transformed the Southeast Asian coastal landscape, but the impact on human demography remains unclear. Here, we create a paleogeographic map, focusing on sea-level changes during the period spanning the LGM to the present-day and infer the human population history in Southeast and South Asia using 763 high-coverage whole-genome sequencing datasets from 59 ethnic groups. We show that sea-level rise, in particular meltwater pulses 1 A (MWP1A, similar to 14,500-14,000 years ago) and 1B (MWP1B, similar to 11,500-11,000 years ago), reduced land area by over 50% since the LGM, resulting in segregation of local human populations. Following periods of rapid sea-level rises, population pressure drove the migration of Malaysian Negritos into South Asia. Integrated paleogeographic and population genomic analysis demonstrates the earliest documented instance of forced human migration driven by sea-level rise.

TI Tracking the sea-level signature of the 8.2 ka cooling event: New
   constraints from the Mississippi Delta
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB The ever increasing need for accurate predictions of global environmental change under greenhouse conditions has sparked immense interest in an abrupt, century-scale cooling around 8200 years ago, with a focal point in the North Atlantic and with hemispheric teleconnections. Despite considerable progress in the unraveling of this striking feature, including a conceivable driving mechanism (rapid drainage of proglacial Lake Agassiz/Ojibway and a resulting reduced strength of North Atlantic thermohaline circulation), several key questions remain unanswered. One salient aspect concerns the total amount of freshwater released during this catastrophic event, likely echoed by a near-instantaneous eustatic sea-level rise. So far, no attempts have been made to perform high-resolution sea-level studies that explicitly focus on this critical time interval. Here, we present new data from the Mississippi Delta suggestive of abrupt sea-level rise associated with the 8.2 ka event. However, the amount of sea-level rise was likely less than similar to1.2 m, corresponding to a meltwater volume of less than similar to4.3 10(14) m(3); values lower than estimates used by several recent studies.

In particular, accurately characterizing millennial sea-level changes is important in evaluating vertical movements of the Earth's crust that happen in response to the advances and retreats of ice sheets during long-term climatic cycles. In this paper, we analyze sea-level data from several Maine salt marshes previously reported in a paper from the geological literature.

TI Middle Holocene humidity increase in Florida: climate or sea-level?
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB Florida climate in highly sensitive to both high and low latitude climate perturbations due to its latitudinal position surrounded by water masses that transport heat northward. A well-studied aspect is that middle Holocene conditions became significantly wetter in Florida, initiating widespread peat accumulation in the Everglades. This environmental change has been attributed to various climate forcings, such as migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), increases in tropical storm intensity, position of the Bermuda High, intensification of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and post glacial sea level rise (SLR). Discerning between these forcings is only possible with quantitative reconstructions from a transect of sites that are affected differentially. Application of a transfer function on a north-to-south gradient of pollen records from Florida lakes here shows that the pattern of increasing precipitation during the middle Holocene cannot be explained by SLR, but that ENSO intensification is an important contributing factor. Seasonal-resolved proxy records with improved age models are urgently needed to further solve these issues. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

CL Athens, GREECE
AB Water, under the climatic conditions of the Earth, is found in three natural states, as a solid, as a liquid and as a gas. Since the quantities of water on the Earth's surface are constant, at least for the last few million years, then the entire historic evolution of human society, and especially since the appearance of Homo sapiens, is directly depended on the climatic changes and their consequences on the natural state of water. It has been calculated that the available water in nature will not be enough to cover the human needs, when the Earth population doubles. Water, in the future, will formulate a "new world order". Lots of characters of Greek Mythology are related to water. People had created their Gods in order to help them with their fears, their necessities, trying to explain the inexplicable for them natural phenomena. The use of Mythology in the environmental education could help the student to better understand that (i) the environment does not remain static; (ii) the environmental changes have led "Homo sapiens" to create myths in order to understand and to explain the phenomena that provoked them; (iii) the balance of the Earth ecosystem is easy to disturb; (iv) the human intervention causes unexpected consequences; (v) the knowledge of the environmental changes of the past leads to environmental realization, resulting in a more rational usage of natural resources.

TI Influences of sea level changes and volcanic eruptions on Holocene
   vegetation in Tonga
SO BIOTROPICA
AB Here, we investigate Mid- to Late-Holocene vegetation changes in low-lying coastal areas in Tonga and how changing sea levels and recurrent volcanic eruptions have influenced vegetation dynamics on four islands of the Tongan archipelago (South Pacific). To investigate past vegetation and environmental change at Ngofe Marsh ('Uta Vava'u), we examined palynomorphs (pollen and spores), charcoal (fire), and sediment characteristics (volcanic activity) from a 6.7-m-long sediment core. Radiocarbon dating indicated the sediments were deposited over the last 7700 years. We integrated the Ngofe Marsh data with similar previously published data from Avai'o'vuna Swamp on Pangaimotu Island, Lotofoa Swamp on Foa Island, and Finemui Swamp on Ha'afeva Island. Plant taxa were categorized as littoral, mangrove, rainforest, successional/ disturbance, and wetland groups, and linear models were used to examine relationships between vegetation, relative sea level change, and volcanic eruptions (tephra). We found that relative sea level change has impacted vegetation on three of the four islands investigated. Volcanic eruptions were not identified as a driver of vegetation change. Rainforest decline does not appear to be driven by sea level changes or volcanic eruptions. From all sites analyzed, vegetation at Finemui Swamp was most sensitive to changes in relative sea level. While vegetation on low-lying Pacific islands is sensitive to changing sea levels, island characteristics, such as area and elevation, are also likely to be important factors that mediate specific island responses to drivers of change.

AB Considered was the low sea level at the polish coast of the Baltic Sea as a factor influencing the navigation safety, the off shore engineering and in general the maritime management. The range of the actually met sea level oscillations may grow in face of the expected global warming. The level of 440 cm is defined as the upper limit of low sea level. This value is also accepted as the warning level for navigation, according to the NAVTEX (The NAVTEX system is used for the automatic broadcast of localised Maritime Safety Information using Radio Telex). Extreme values of the lowest sea level met in the presented paper, ranging from 366 cm in Swinoujscie western area, to 414 cm in Gdansk - eastern part of the southern coast (that means 134 cm below the mean sea level and 74 cm below the NAVTEX warning level), point at the importance of the warnings against very low level.

The high-est SFI occurred between ca. 21.0 ka and 16.6 ka and indicates the presence of a relatively dry climate and large areas of forest-steppe in the region. Boreal forests covered the mountain slopes. The broad-leaved trees survived in refugia located in lower mountain belts. Begin-ning ca. 16.6 ka, SFI decreases, while Tp increases, especially between ca. 11.0 ka and 5.7 ka. However, variations in these indices indicate fluctuating climates during the deglaciation. Significant vegetation changes occurred in the Holocene. Mixed deciduous forests with a predominance of Quercus became widely present beginning ca. 9.8 ka. The area of forest-steppe was reduced occurring only in local habi-tats. Pinus became one of the most common taxa in the forest ca. 5.3 ka. The geographic features of the coring area have determined in the past the persistence throughout the record of cold-water diatom flora. Cold-water diatoms have dominated in both cool and warm intervals; however, a small increase in the percentage and species diversity of warm-water diatoms was noted for warming. Low sea level during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and early Holocene changed the general patterns in the sea circulation and in the vectors of the longshore currents, which transported the waters formed in the shallow areas of the northeastern and northern parts of the Japan Sea. A slight increase in sublittoral benthic diatoms indicates a lowered sea level during the LGM. The increase in sublittoral planktonic diatoms reflects a gradual rise in sea level during the Bolling-Allerod (BA) and Younger Dryas (YD). A greater component of oceanic diatom species at Holocene indicates the inflow of Pacific waters across both the Tsushima and Tsugaru straits. This study of pollen and diatom records demonstrates a clear response to climatic fluctuations and sea level changes in the Japan Sea during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. and Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, CAS.

TI Growth responses of the intertidal seagrass Zostera japonica to
   manipulated sea level rise conditions
SO BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE
AB Although most seagrasses inhabit subtidal areas, a few species occur in the intertidal zone. The seagrass, Zostera japonica Asch. & Graebn., is an intertidal seagrass species, and thus this species may be vulnerable to environmental changes associated with sea level rise due to climate change. We examined the effects of continuous submergence conditions, which might be caused by sea level rise, on the growth of the intertidal seagrass, Z. japonica. In the present study, submerged conditions were generated in a Z. japonica meadow in the intertidal zone using transparent cylindrical cores, and the growth responses to the inundation conditions were examined. Daily photon flux density and temperature were not significantly different between the manipulated submerged and the control intertidal conditions during the experimental period. Increases in shoot height, biomass, and leaf productivity were among the acclimatory responses of Z. japonica to the inundation conditions. Shoot density, however, decreased rapidly in the submerged conditions as a result of the self-shading induced by taller and larger shoot sizes. Thus, prolonged inundation, which would be induced by a rise in sea level, had both positive and negative effects on the growth of the intertidal seagrass, Z. japonica, which exhibited plasticity at the individual and population levels. According to the results of our study, the restricted distribution of Z. japonica in the intertidal zone may not be a consequence of tidal inundation stress in the subtidal zone.

TI Evolution and demise of a mid-Cretaceous carbonate shelf: the Altamira
   Limestones (Cenomanian) of northern Cantabria (Spain)
SO SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY
AB In northern Cantabria, the Cenomanian transgression is pulsatory in character and progressively onlaps onto deltaic siliciclastics of latest Albian to earliest Cenomanian age. This pronounced 2nd-order sea-level rise can be subdivided into an earlier (constructive) phase and a later (destructive) phase, separated by a significant low sea-level stand at the Early/Mid-Cenomanian boundary. in the first phase, the flooding of the north Iberian continental margin in the early Early Cenomanian caused the sources of terrigenous sediments (located on the Iberian Meseta) to retreat, thus promoting the development of a carbonate ramp. This ramp evolved into a shelf-attached platform (Altamira Platform) during the course of the Early Cenomanian. Pronounced sea-level, fall in the Early/Mid-Cenomanian boundary interval exposed the platform, increased fluvial input and terminated the constructive phase. The destructive phase started in the early Mid-Cenomanian and lasted until the Late Cenomanian. Carbon and oxygen stable isotopes, microfacies analysis, palaeontological criteria, and sequence stratigraphy are used to elucidate the complex interplay of climatic changes, sea-level history, nutrient supply, and platform drowning. Three 3rd-order sea-level, rises (early and late Mid-Cenomanian, early Late Cenomanian) resulted in a westward-backstepping and final drowning of the Altamira Platform. The drowning succession is accompanied by a negative shift of delta(18)O and a positive delta(13)C excursion interpreted to reflect progressive climatic warming and elevated nutrient levels. The resulting eutrophication is represented by the biotic community of the drowning succession and negatively influenced the carbonate budget of the depositional system. As a result, the stressed platform was readily drowned during the Mid- and earliest Late Cenomanian 3rd-order sea-level rises. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Future Response of the Wadden Sea Tidal Basins to Relative Sea-Level
   rise-An Aggregated Modelling Approach
SO WATER
AB Climate change, and especially the associated acceleration of sea-level rise, forms a serious threat to the Wadden Sea. The Wadden Sea contains the world's largest coherent intertidal flat area and it is known that these flats can drown when the rate of sea-level rise exceeds a critical limit. As a result, the intertidal flats would then be permanently inundated, seriously affecting the ecological functioning of the system. The determination of this critical limit and the modelling of the transient process of how a tidal basin responds to accelerated sea-level rise is of critical importance. In this contribution we revisit the modelling of the response of the Wadden Sea tidal basins to sea-level rise using a basin scale morphological model (aggregated scale morphological interaction between tidal basin and adjacent coast, ASMITA). Analysis using this aggregated scale model shows that the critical rate of sea-level rise is not merely influenced by the morphological equilibrium and the morphological time scale, but also depends on the grain size distribution of sediment in the tidal inlet system. As sea-level rises, there is a lag in the morphological response, which means that the basin will be deeper than the systems morphological equilibrium. However, so long as the rate of sea-level rise is constant and below a critical limit, this offset becomes constant and a dynamic equilibrium is established. This equilibrium deviation as well as the time needed to achieve the dynamic equilibrium increase non-linearly with increasing rates of sea-level rise. As a result, the response of a tidal basin to relatively fast sea-level rise is similar, no matter if the sea-level rise rate is just below, equal or above the critical limit. A tidal basin will experience a long process of 'drowning' when sea-level rise rate exceeds about 80% of the critical limit. The insights from the present study can be used to improve morphodynamic modelling of tidal basin response to accelerating sea-level rise and are useful for sustainable management of tidal inlet systems.

TI The roles of coastlines, people and fire in the development of
   heathlands in northeast Tasmania
SO JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB Pollen analysis of a core taken from a reed marsh in northeastern Tasmania near Bass Strait highlights the interplay between climatic changes, sea level rises and the effects of Aborigines during the Holocene. Prior to 10,000 BP the region formed part of the Bassian landbridge which connected Tasmania to the Australian mainland. Vegetation at that time was characterized by shrubby grasslands with a very sparse tree cover. After 9000 sp, Eucalyptus forests prospered until about 6000 sp. A combination of salt spray from a stabilizing mid-Holocene coast, the progressive effects of soil podsolization and burning by Aborigines, eventually favoured the replacement of grassy Eucalyptus forests by Allocasuarina with an increasingly heathy understorey. The treeless heaths dominated by dwarfed Allocasuarina which presently dominate the area are regarded as part of a degradation sequence in which the above factors are implicated.

TI Minimum record length for detecting a prospective uniform sea level
   acceleration at a tide gauge station
SO ALL EARTH
AB The unambiguous detection of a uniform sea level acceleration at a tide gauge station is important under an increasingly warmer Earth for the long-term coastal risk assessments. Although the timescales needed for detecting mean sea level trends at tide gauges were well investigated in the past, very few studies addressed the same issue for the sea level accelerations in depth. In this study, we demonstrate that the ability to discern a uniform sea level acceleration at a tide gauge station depends on its magnitude, systematic and random sea level variations, the degree of autocorrelation of the random variations, the length of its historical record and the desired statistical significance level of its estimate. We offer a formulary to estimate the required minimum record lengths needed to detect a statistically significant prospective uniform acceleration at a coastal or Island tide gauge station based on the retrospective analyses of its sea level record. To demonstrate its effectiveness, the minimum record lengths required to detect statistically significant prospective uniform accelerations were calculated at 19 globally distributed tide gauge stations with long records.

TI Holocene environmental changes inferred from sedimentary records in the
   lower reach of the Yeongsan River, Korea
SO HOLOCENE
AB Multidisciplinary paleoproxy data from three sedimentary cores (9.05-m-long MW-2, 16.50-m-long IL-3, and 11.88-m-long JD-1) recovered from the Yeongsan River Estuary of Korea are presented. A marine influence can be observed at 10,400 yr BP (-21 m) and 8600 yr BP (-14 to -12 m) around the Yeongsan River Estuary. However, if we take the macro-tidal setting of the Yeongsan River Estuary into consideration, actual sea level could differ from the depositional surfaces, and might be higher or lower than the sediment elevation. Precipitation at around 6300-5000 yr BP is estimated to have been higher or stronger than in earlier and later periods. The core sites received increased terrigenous sediment input during this period because of intensified rainfall and consequent river activity. Although sea level was estimated to be high enough to have a strong influence on the study area during the mid-Holocene, the sedimentary features suggest that riverine activity was the dominant factor controlling the sedimentation patterns. This implies that even during the Holocene Climate Optimum in Korea, roughly 7000-5000 yr BP, the wetter condition has occurred within the interval of 6300-5000 yr BP. After the Holocene Climate Optimum, sea level decreased to 0 to -1 m around 5000 yr BP and increased again starting around 4000 yr BP. The time-series results presented in this study are coincident with global trends, and show the potential for developing geomorphological and climate histories for this region.

TI Acceleration of the Extreme Sea Level Rise Along the Chinese Coast
SO EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
AB Using high-frequency tide gauge observations from 1980 to 2017, we analyzed changes in extreme sea levels (ESLs) along the Chinese coast to examine whether extreme sea-level rise acceleration could be observed. The results indicated that the ESL has risen with fluctuations along the Chinese coast. The ESL also featured significant decadal variabilities. The ESL rise was accelerated at most tide gauges throughout the whole study period, especially after the 1980s, while the acceleration patterns varied with station location. The mean sea level (MSL) change was confirmed as the major driver of the ESL change according to the analysis. However, the skew surge may also have affected the extremes at many of the tide gauges, which was observed after detrending. The extreme/MSL had a significant positive correlation with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, which is supposed to affect the MSL through a combination of variation in sea surface temperature, pressure system, and wind. That sea level oscillation is dominated by Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation should be taken into consideration when studying accelerations in the rate of ESLs and of MSLs along the Chinese coast.

TI Reef island evolution in a turbid-water coral reef province of the
   Indo-Pacific
SO DEPOSITIONAL RECORD
AB Coral reef islands are vulnerable landforms to environmental change. Constructed of largely unconsolidated reef-derived sediments, they are highly sensitive to variations in metocean boundary conditions, raising global concern about their future resilience and stability in the face of increased natural hazards, sea-level rise and anthropogenic climate change. This study examines the evolution of an inshore turbid reef island from the southern Pilbara region of Western Australia (Indo-Pacific) using detailed analyses of island chronostratigraphy (composition, texture) and geochronology (21 in-situ radiometric dates) from Eva Island. Downcore, composition of island-grade (reef-derived) sediments were homogenous, dominated by molluscan (37%-42%) and coral (32%-37%) constituents. The C-14 radiometric dating of island sediments, beachrock and coral microatolls identified five stages of island formation across changing sea-level regimes over the mid to late Holocene: (1) limestone platform accretion at ca 6,000 cal yr BP, coinciding with reef decline or 'give-up' on neighbouring Exmouth Gulf reefs; (2) sand cay (i.e. core) initiation and vertical aggregation at ca 5,000 cal yr BP during the point of sea-level regression to current levels; (3) major accretion and lateral progradation of the island between 3,500 cal yr BP and 2,500 cal yr BP including the modification of island shorelines through alongshore reworking of sediment; (4) lateral accretion and minor expansion to the north and formation of beachrock pavement between 2,500 and 650 cal yr BP; and (5) planform adjustment (erosion of the north-west island) and backstepping under stabilised sea levels over the past 650 years. While this model is comparative to studies on island formation following incremental sea-level fall following the mid-Holocene highstand, it demonstrates active landform readjustment under stabilised sea levels over the past 2,000 years, probably the influence of local-scale metocean boundary conditions within climate windows across the mid to late Holocene period (i.e. independent of sea-level fluctuations). Importantly, while sediment production rates are predicted to be lower in turbid-water reef systems than clear water, Eva Island shows no change in carbonate producers (i.e. proportion of mollusc and coral) over the course of island building, indicating the carbonate factory has not experienced significant adjustments in reef ecology, but has remained stable despite low water quality.

TI Facies analysis and correlation of high-order sequences in middle-outer
   ramp successions: variations in exported carbonate on basin-wide delta
   C-13(carb) (Kimmeridgian, NE Spain)
SO SEDIMENTOLOGY
AB Carbonate mud that accumulated in the deep parts of a late Kimmeridgian carbonate ramp (Iberian Basin, NE Spain) was partly derived by resedimentation from shallow water production areas. High-frequency sea-level changes, probably driven by climatic changes in tune with precession and short-eccentricity cycles, affected carbonate production and the amount of exported sediment. Facies analysis and correlation of three outcrops located in middle and outer ramp settings allows a comparison of high-order sequences (bundles of beds and sets of bundles) across a ramp transect and an assessment of the carbonate factory. Analysis of the storm deposits found in middle ramp settings identifies deepening to shallowing high-frequency cycles based on the level of exported carbonate. In outer ramp areas, many of the bundles exhibit a thinning trend, indicating a progressive decrease of carbonate production and hence, carbonate export during periods of high-frequency sea-level rise. delta(13)C(carb) values show a gradual increase through the studied long-term transgressive interval ranging from 1.5 parts per thousand to 2.8 parts per thousand. Within this long-term evolutionary trend, short-term delta(13)C(carb) fluctuations occur that correspond with some of the high-order cycles defined from sedimentary facies analysis. These short-term delta(13)C(carb) shifts are interpreted as shifts in carbonate export from shallow reef regions to the outer ramp. A consequence of this study is that variation in delta(13)C(carb) can be used for correlation in outer ramp successions, at least on a basin-wide scale.

TI A review of volume-area scaling of glaciers
SO REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS
AB Volume-area power law scaling, one of a set of analytical scaling techniques based on principals of dimensional analysis, has become an increasingly important and widely used method for estimating the future response of the world's glaciers and ice caps to environmental change. Over 60 papers since 1988 have been published in the glaciological and environmental change literature containing applications of volume-area scaling, mostly for the purpose of estimating total global glacier and ice cap volume and modeling future contributions to sea level rise from glaciers and ice caps. The application of the theory is not entirely straightforward, however, and many of the recently published results contain analyses that are in conflict with the theory as originally described by Bahr et al. (1997). In this review we describe the general theory of scaling for glaciers in full three-dimensional detail without simplifications, including an improved derivation of both the volume-area scaling exponent gamma and a new derivation of the multiplicative scaling parameter c. We discuss some common misconceptions of the theory, presenting examples of both appropriate and inappropriate applications. We also discuss potential future developments in power law scaling beyond its present uses, the relationship between power law scaling and other modeling approaches, and some of the advantages and limitations of scaling techniques.

TI SPECULATIONS ON THE CONTROLS ON CYCLIC PERITIDAL CARBONATES - ICE-HOUSE
   VERSUS GREENHOUSE EUSTATIC CONTROLS
SO SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY
AB Metre-scale peritidal cyclothems, which are distinctive components of Lower Palaeozoic and many Mesozoic platform carbonates, are not common in Carboniferous sequences.  In their place the platform sequences are characterized by 5-10 m thick, largely subtidal limestones, with prominent exposure surfaces.  The former type of platform cyclothems developed during 'greenhouse' phases when, in the absence of major continental ice sheets, sea-level oscillations were caused by small-scale, obliquity and precession Milankovitch rhythms.  Under such conditions platforms rapidly aggraded with the deposition of peritidal cyclothems.  The Carboniferous was an 'ice-house' phase when the waxing and waning of Gondwanan ice sheets, caused by eccentricity rhythm-generated climatic changes, created high-amplitude, rapid falls and rises in sea level.  The resulting carbonates reflect such changes with 'catch-up', subtidal-dominated sequences and pronounced subaerial exposure surfaces capping the cyclothems.

TI Coastal plain evolution in southern Hainan Island, China
SO CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN
AB The coast of southern Hainan Island is characterized by wide sandy embayments, which consist of (i) drowned valleys bounded by steep bedrock hills and only locally receiving sediments, and embayments of various dimensions covered either by (ii) alluvial-deltaic deposits or by (iii) sands of coastal beach ridges/barriers and associated elongated lagoons. During the late Tertiary-Pleistocene the area has experienced isostatic and eustatic movements associated with neotectonics and climatic changes. Such history is recorded in terraces at various altitudes (80, 40, 20 m asl) and sequences of coastal sand ridges/baymouth bars. The Holocene variations in sea level and climate are recorded in the dated coastal ridges, coral reef and beachrock. Conditions suitable for reef development started about 8000 a BP. The GPR profiles also show that the internal structures of the sand ridges have composite nature being formed by several superimposed secondary ridges.

TI PleistoDist: A toolbox for visualising and quantifying the effects of
   Pleistocene sea-level change on island archipelagos
SO METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB Pleistocene sea-level change played a significant role in the evolution and assembly of island biotas. The formation of land bridges between islands during Quaternary glacial maxima, when sea levels were more than 120 metres below present-day sea levels, often facilitated historical dispersal and gene flow between islands that are today geographically disconnected. Despite the importance of Pleistocene sea-level change, few software packages exist that model the effects of this phenomenon in a standardised and generalised manner. Here, we present PleistoDist, an R package that allows users to visualise and quantify the effects of Pleistocene sea-level change on islands over time, and test multiple temporally explicit hypotheses of inter-island dispersal and community assembly. Re-analysing published datasets, we demonstrate how using PleistoDist to account for historical sea-level change can provide greater explanatory power when analysing extant island communities, and show how population genetic simulations can be used to generate spatiotemporally explicit neutral expectations of population genetic structure across island archipelagos.

TI Simulations of Hurricane Katrina (2005) under sea level and climate
   conditions for 1900
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
AB Global warming may result in substantial sea level rise and more intense hurricanes over the next century, leading to more severe coastal flooding. Here, observed climate and sea level trends over the last century (c. 1900s to 2000s) are used to provide insight regarding future coastal inundation trends. The actual impacts of Hurricane Katrina (2005) in New Orleans are compared with the impacts of a similar hypothetical hurricane occurring c. 1900. Estimated regional sea level rise since 1900 of 0.75 m, which contains a dominant land subsidence contribution (0.57 m), serves as a 'prototype' for future climate-change induced sea level rise in other regions. Landform conditions c. 1900 were estimated by changing frictional resistance based on expected additional wetlands at lower sea levels. Surge simulations suggest that flood elevations would have been 15 to 60 % lower c. 1900 than the conditions observed in 2005. This drastic change suggests that significantly more flood damage occurred in 2005 than would have occurred if sea level and climate conditions had been like those c. 1900. We further show that, in New Orleans, sea level rise dominates surge-induced flooding changes, not only by increasing mean sea level, but also by leading to decreased wetland area. Together, these effects enable larger surges. Projecting forward, future global sea level changes of the magnitude examined here are expected to lead to increased flooding in coastal regions, even if the storm climate is unchanged. Such flooding increases in densely populated areas would presumably lead to more widespread destruction.

TI Sedimentary responses to the East Asian monsoon and sea level variations
   recorded in the northern South China Sea over the past 36 kyr
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
AB Sediment grain size is an important proxy to detect sedimentary process and record paleoenvironmental variations in continental slopes. Grain size measurements were performed for 298 samples of the 5.96-m-long core PC338 spanning the past 36 kyr recovered from the northern South China Sea (SCS). Results show that sea level and climatic influences on grain size distributions are crucial. A turbidite formed during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is ascribed to the favorable topography close to the Red River estuary induced by the low sea level. Four end-member (EM) components for the normal sediment layers were unmixed using a lognormal parametric end member modeling (EMM). With the sea level decreasing, more EM4 ( similar to 15-100 mu m) and less EM1 ( similar to 0-2 mu m) supplied the SCS slope. Because EM2 ( similar to 2-10 mu m) consisted of fluvial suspension is dominated by the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) precipitation, it has the potential to substitute for the EASM intensity. EM2 varied in-phase with many south China paleoclimate records and the 30 degrees N July insolation over the past 36 kyr, and cooling climate events (including the LGM, Heinrich events H1 and H3, Younger Dryas, 8.2 ka and 10.3 ka) lowered the EM2 content. Our results further confirm the synchronous EASM evolution in the South China continent mainly forced by the Northern Hemisphere summer insolation.

TI Can eustatic charts go beyond first order? Insights from the
   Permian-Triassic
SO LITHOSPHERE
AB First-order variations of eustatic charts (200-400 m.y.) are in agreement with our understanding of the geodynamic processes that control sea level. By extrapolation, second-order (10-100 m.y.) and third-order (1-10 m.y.) variations are also thought to follow the same rules. However, this assumption may be jeopardized by a closer examination of the Permian-Triassic example, for which climatic and tectonic eustasy fails to explain the variations of the eustatic charts. During this period, eustatic charts peak down to their lowermost Phanerozoic values and display second-order variations at rates of up to 3 m/m.y., which is inconsistent with the expected eustatic signal during the early fragmentation of the Pangean supercontinent and the late Paleozoic melting of ice sheets. Here, we review the possible mechanisms that could explain the apparent sea-level variations. Some of them do modify the eustatic sea level (ESL). In particular, dynamic deflections of Earth's surface above subduction zones and their locations with respect to continents appear to have been the primary controls of absolute sea level as the Pangean supercontinent formed and broke up. Other mechanisms instead only locally or regionally produced vertical ground motions, either uplifting continents or tilting the margins where the control points were located. We show that (1) the thermal uplift associated with supercontinent insulation and (2) the dynamic uplift associated with the emplacement of a superplume both give rates of sea-level change in the range of long-term changes of ESL. We also show that (3) the dynamic tilt of continental margins not only produces apparent sea-level changes, but it also modifies the absolute sea level, which in turn may end up in the paradoxical situation wherein fingerprints of ESL drop are found in the geological record during actual ESL rise. We conclude that second-order absolute sea-level changes may remain elusive for some time.

TI Palaeogeography and relative sea-level history forcing eco-sedimentary
   contexts in Late Jurassic epicontinental shelves (Prebetic Zone, Betic
   Cordillera): An ecostratigraphic approach
SO EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB The analysis of macroinvertebrate and foraminiferal assemblages from Upper Jurassic (Middle Oxfordian to Lower Kimmeridgian) epicontinental shelf deposits in the Prebetic (Betic Cordillera, southern Spain) reveals the influence of environmental changes. They are expressed as selected parameters in palaeogeographic and stratigraphic trends (litho- and microfacies, faunal composition, taphonomy), which are interpreted in the context of relative sea-level histories.
   Middle Oxfordian to early Kimmeridgian (Transversarium to Planula Chrones) rocks and faunal assemblages in comparatively distal sectors (distal shelf) show lower sedimentation rates (lumpy lithofacies), and higher proportions of ammonoids, planktic foraminifera, corrasion degree, microboring and encrustation. Landwards, towards the mid-shelf, eco-sedimentary conditions resulted in spongiolithic limestones and marl-limestone rhythmites with local development of microbial-sponge buildups.
   Greater distance from shore during relative sea-level highs accords with greater: (1) stratigraphic condensation; (2) abundance in ammonoids, planktic foraminifera and nubeculariids; and (3) degrees of corrasion, microboring and encrustation. These trends in faunal composition and taphonomy agree with backstepping phases, increasing ecospace and a longer exposition of shelly remains on the sea bottom.
   Decreasing distance from shore during relative sea-level lows relates to opposite trends, as evidenced by: (4) increasing terrigenous input and decreasing stratigraphic condensation; (5) impoverishment in ammonoids and planktic foraminifera; and (6) diminution of corrasion, microboring and encrustation. Phases of forestepping/progradation and aggradation, a reduction of ecospace for nekto-planktic organisms, and comparatively rapid burial of shell remains are interpreted to force the recorded trends.
   An ecostratigraphic approach is used here to correlate and characterise sea-level changes, applying high resolution stratigraphy to sections where the identification of relevant surfaces is more difficult. The changes in distance from shore and ecospace, triggered by relative sea-level fluctuations, are considered prime factors forcing trade-offs in faunal communities of the studied fossil assemblages. Ecostratigraphy was used as a template for the characterization, correlation and interpretation of relative sea-levels and associated sedimentary packages in a time span from just above the Milankovitch band to the million-year scale.

TI Holocene morpho-sedimentary evolution of Marambaia Barrier Island (SE
   Brazil)
SO QUATERNARY RESEARCH
AB Barrier islands are sedimentary bodies susceptible to changes in sediment supply, dominant physical processes, and sea level. The aim of this work was to study the sedimentary processes that established Marambaia Barrier Island (SE Brazil) as an elongated sandy body that created Sepetiba Bay. For this purpose, barrier and back-barrier bay environments were analyzed using high-resolution satellite imagery, geophysical and topographic surveys, surface sediment samples and short cores, and radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating techniques. Seven morpho-sedimentary domains were identified: coastal beach ridges, overland flow features, inter-ridge paleo lagoon, bayside beach ridges, marshlands, dune field and tidal wetlands. The results show that Marambaia Barrier Island evolved throughout the Holocene, first under normal regression conditions during sea-level rise, and then by forced regression as sea level lowered to its present position. Concurrent processes related to longshore drift, onshore transport, reworked barrier deposits, eolian transport, bay circulation, and pedogenesis influenced its morpho-sedimentary evolution. Morphological features such as truncated beach ridges, flying spits, and filled channels attest to the occurrence of alternating periods of erosion and accretion, evincing how the morphology of barrier island systems preserves an important archive of environmental changes.

TI Holocene environmental changes as recorded in sediments of a paleodelta,
   southwest coast of India
SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
AB Sedimentary record of a 40 m deep borehole drilled in a paleodelta region of southwest coast of India has been studied for sedimentary proxies - texture, clay minerals, geotechnical parameters, and pollens. The sedimentary record, spanning from 12 ka to Recent in age, exhibits two different sedimentary environments of deposition. Sediments record high values of moisture content, organic carbon and plasticity index. Sediment texture and geotechnical properties indicate a distinct change in depositional environment from marine to fluvial during the sea level fall i.e., after similar to 7 ka. It also suggests that major rise of sea level from similar to 11 to similar to 7 ka and regression from similar to 7 ka to similar to 5 ka contributed to the changes in the environment of deposition. The downcore increase of illite and decrease of kaolinite at 12 m depth (similar to 6 ka), and an upward increase of smectite and kaolinite, and decrease of illite concentration support the major fall in sea level in the region that accounted for the change of depositional environment. The pollen records reveal the abundant occurrence of semi-evergreen type of mangroves during early-to mid-Holocene. Thus, the multi proxy record provides an evidence of change in the environment of deposition from marine to fluvial, which might have been influenced by neotectonics, sea level variations, and monsoonal intensity in the region.

TI Correlation between rate of sea-level change and frequency of explosive
   volcanism in the Mediterranean
SO NATURE
AB Volcanic activity has frequently been linked to Quaternary environmental change, either by driving climate modification(1,2) or in response to environmental changed(3). Although a link has been established between large explosive eruptions and small (0.5 degrees C), brief (1-2 years) falls in global temperatures(4), both the evidence and mechanisms responsible for longer episodes of eruption-induced planetary cooling remain questionable(1,2,5,6,). In contrast, recent research based on ice-core data suggests that rapid climate changes during the past 110,000 years increased explosive volcanic activity(7). Here we present a statistical analysis relating the frequency of explosive activity of Mediterranean volcanoes-based on dated(8-11) tephra layers in deep-sea sediment cores-to the rate of late Quaternary sea-level change. The nonlinear correlation between the two is tentatively explained in terms of dynamic responses of the volcanoes to stress-related influences on various spatial scales. The correlation supports a mechanism or mechanisms by which the climate-driven growth and decay of large ice sheets can influence the eruptive chronologies of distant volcanic edifices via changes in global sea level.

TI Extracting wealth from a land of starvation by creating social
   complexity: A dialogue between archaeology and climate?
SO COMPTES RENDUS GEOSCIENCE
AB Arid areas are often considered as places where the emergence of complex societies and economies is unlikely to happen, due to the environmental restrictions they impose on land use, food production and settlement patterns. Archaeological data collected during 30 years in the Oman peninsula are used to analyze the relationship between human societies and climate change during the Early Bronze Age (3rd millennium BC/5th millennium BP). It is suggested that establishing a direct chronological correlation between indicators of climatic change and social evolution is unrewarding and a deterministic approach irrelevant. Societies perceive climatic change and react to it according to their representations of nature and to their history. Modeling social evolution in conjunction with environmental changes by using non-linear multi-agent models is a much more fruitful way to understand the relationship between Man and climate.

TI Tidal Variability Related to Sea Level Variability in the Pacific Ocean
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB Ocean tides are changing worldwide for reasons unrelated to astronomical forcing. Changes in tidal properties coupled with altered mean sea level (MSL) may yield higher peak water levels and increased occurrence of short-term exceedance events, such as storm surge and nuisance flooding. Here we investigate the hypothesis that changes in relative sea level are correlated with alterations in tidal amplitudes. Our approach focuses on the correlation between short-term (monthly to interannual) fluctuations in sea level with changes in tidal properties of major ocean tides (M-2, and K-1; S-2 and O-1) at 152 gauges. Results suggest that sea level variability is correlated to interannual tidal variability at most (92%) of tide gauges in the Pacific, with statistically significant rates between 10 and 500 mm per meter sea level rise observed. These tidal anomalies, while influenced by basin-scale climate processes and sea level changes, appear to be locally forced (in part) and not coherent over amphidromic or basin-wide scales. Overall, the Western Pacific shows a greater concentration of tide/sea level correlations at interannual time scales than the Eastern Pacific; 44% and 46% of gauges are significant in K-1 and O-1 in the west compared to 29% and 30% in the east, and 63% and 53% of gauges in the west are significant in M-2 and S-2 versus 47% and 32% in the east. Seasonal variation in tidal properties is less apparent in the empirical record, with statistically significant seasonal variations observed at only 35% of all gauges, with the largest concentrations in Southeast Asia.
   Plain Language Summary It is common knowledge that sea level are rising worldwide, due to climate change. Less known, and less studied, is the variability of ocean tides that has also been occurring in past decades. Tidal changes are unexpected, since the tides are based on predictable astronomical motions. Nevertheless, these changes are observed worldwide. Sea level changes along with tidal changes, when combined, can have serious implications for future coastal flooding. This study performs a survey of Pacific Ocean tidal variability to understand which regions are experiencing the greatest tidal changes.

TI Perturbation of the carbon cycle at the Middle/Late Jurassic transition:
   Geological and geochemical evidence
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
AB A compilation of new and published stratigraphic, paleontological and geochemical data is used to detect the reciprocal influences of carbon cycling and global environmental changes in the Jurassic. A major perturbation of the surface carbon cycling accompanied by pronounced climate and sea level fluctuations (waxing and waning of continental ice?) affected Earth history around the Middle/LateJurassic transition (MLJT). We establish the respective timing of changes of carbonate and organic matter sedimentation, and global fluctuations of sea surface temperatures (paleobiogeography and O-isotope paleothermometry) and sea level (sequence stratigraphy), so that causative mechanisms and feedback effects can be considered. It is apparent that the global sea level rise and warming initiated in the Late Bathonian led to a constriction of carbonate platforms to low latitudes and enhanced marine organic deposition. Sea level and temperature optima were achieved several million-years later during the Middle Callovian. A detailed record of sea surface temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere based on migration of marine fauna and isotopic thermometry indicates that a drastic climatic decline set in during the early Late Callovian, just post-dating the increased capture of organic matter by marine sediments. This decline in temperature is interpreted in terms of an inverse greenhouse effect, triggered by drawdown of CO2 consequent upon excess carbon burial. The magnitude of refrigeration and its coincidence in time with an abrupt global-scale fall of sea level are both suggestive of continental ice formation at this time. Carbonate sedimentation was jeopardized at the MLJT as a result of both global cooling and presumed PCO2 lowering, and resumed abruptly during the Middle Oxfordian by spreading again over mid-latitude zones. Salient conclusions are that (1) the pattern of excess carbon burial, coincident with elevated temperature but followed by climatic deterioration supports the general hypothesis that a major control on Mesozoic climate was the abundance of atmospheric CO2; (2) significant masses of continental ice may have formed during this part of the Jurassic and correlatively, high CO2 levels were certainly not sustained throughout this period; (3) the global carbonate sedimentation budget correlated with the surface temperature and sea level, but the latitudinal spreading of type-tropical carbonates was not simply related to the thermal status of seawaters; (4) on a global scale, the C-org and C-inorg burial rates were coupled, apparently through the correlation existing between the CO2 level and surface temperature.

TI The impact of sea level rise on Singapore
SO ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB Global climate change is expected to cause sea level rise, which will have major effects on Singapore because it is a small, low-lying island state. With the high degree of urbanization and industrialization on the island, land is scarce and very valuable. Examining three sea level rise scenarios for the next century, we explore whether Singapore should defend their coast or allow it to be inundated. Across ten coastal sites representing all market land in Singapore, we found that protection was the lowest cost strategy. The annual cost of protecting the coasts of Singapore will rise over time as the sea level rises and will range from 0.3 to 5.7 million US$ by 2050 to 0.9 to 16.8 million US$ by 2100. The present value of these costs ranges from 0.17 to 3.08 million US$ depending on the sea level rise scenario.

TI SEMIEMPIRICAL AND PROCESS-BASED GLOBAL SEA LEVEL PROJECTIONS
SO REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS
AB We review the two main approaches to estimating sea level rise over the coming century: physically plausible models of reduced complexity that exploit statistical relationships between sea level and climate forcing, and more complex physics-based models of the separate elements of the sea level budget. Previously, estimates of future sea level rise from semiempirical models were considerably larger than those from process-based models. However, we show that the most recent estimates of sea level rise by 2100 using both methods have converged, but largely through increased contributions and uncertainties in process-based model estimates of ice sheets mass loss. Hence, we focus in this paper on ice sheet flow as this has the largest potential to contribute to sea level rise. Progress has been made in ice dynamics, ice stream flow, grounding line migration, and integration of ice sheet models with high-resolution climate models. Calving physics remains an important and difficult modeling issue. Mountain glaciers, numbering hundreds of thousands, must be modeled by extensive statistical extrapolation from a much smaller calibration data set. Rugged topography creates problems in process-based mass balance simulations forced by regional climate models with resolutions 10-100 times larger than the glaciers. Semiempirical models balance increasing numbers of parameters with the choice of noise model for the observations to avoid overfitting the highly autocorrelated sea level data. All models face difficulty in separating out non-climate-driven sea level rise (e.g., groundwater extraction) and long-term disequilibria in the present-day cryosphere-sea level system.

TI Monitoring the inter-decade spatial-temporal dynamics of the Sundarban
   mangrove forest of India from 1990 to 2019
SO REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB The space borne remote sensing satellite systems are increasingly used in ecological monitoring, growth dynamics, and mapping of mangrove extent worldwide. Sundarban is the largest, diverse contiguous productive mangrove ecosystem and is increasingly threatened by both environmental changes and anthropogenic forces. The study focuses on the spatio-temporal dynamics in the Indian Sundarban mangrove ecosystem using time-series Landsat satellite imagery during the periods from 1990 to 1999, 1999 to 2009, and 2009 to 2019. The maximum likelihood classifier approach has been applied for image classification and post-classification comparison techniques for change detection analysis over the study period. The findings revealed a decline of 3.76% areal extent of mangroves forest between 1990 and 2019. The areal extent of the Indian Sundarban mangrove areas has been maintained at a relatively constant despite the high population density in its immediate surrounding region. The overall accuracies of 72%, 83%, 79%, and 85.9% were recorded for the classified satellite image of 1990, 1999, 2009, and 2019, respectively. The present study is of great significance to the restoration and conservation of the mangrove forests in response to global climatic change. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Holocene mangrove dynamics from Unguja Ukuu, Zanzibar
SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
AB Sediment, pollen and charcoal data, set within a radiocarbon chronological framework, from Unguja Ukuu, Zanzibar are used to reconstruct mangrove ecosystem dynamics during the Holocene. Changes in mangrove ecosystem composition were driven by a combination of sea level and environmental changes, anthropogenic interaction and geomorphological activity. The high occurrence of Rhizophora mucronata, accompanied by other mangrove species, suggests that the headland of Unguja Ukuu supported a mangrove community from about 7000 cal BP. During the mid-Holocene, mangroves migrated landward, probably in response to a sea level highstand. After the mid-Holocene a short term decrease in Sonneratia alba, with an increase in more terrestrial mangrove species, the appearance of Poaceae and increase in the quantity of charcoal all indicate a lower sea level and relatively dry environmental conditions. This is likely to be coincident with the appearance of the earliest habitation of Zanzibar. The increase in S. alba pollen until prior to 530 cal BP is likely to reflect a sea level rise. The increase in charcoal after about 1400 cal BP is likely to relate to drier conditions and may reflect early human settlement at Unguja Ukuu. A recent decrease in R. mucronata, combined with an increase in S. alba, is likely to result from sea level rise and decreased moisture availability. Recent human-ecosystem interactions are characterized by a reduction in mangrove extent, possibly associated with the mangrove pole trade and rising fuel wood consumption in Zanzibar, particularly from around 530 cal BR (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL

CY AUG 20-28, 2004
CL Florence, ITALY
AB New geomorphologic investigations and new U-Th series dates from Haiti (Northwestern Peninsula) confirm the age of coral reef terraces assigned to M IS 5.5 (130 ka). MIS 5.3 (107 ka) and MIS 5.1 (83 ka) sea level peaks. They also provide evidence for a second high sea level occurring some thousand years before 118 ka, and indicate a second M I S 5.1 sea level stand at about 76 ka. These results are in agreement with the raised terraces of Barbados' although the staircase of Haiti consists of four steps compared to eight. The Haitian sequence can be compared with the maximal number of distinct MIS 5 sea-level highstands recorded in the world, from coral reef tracts, and their relative height above or below present sea level. Three MIS 5.5 sea-level changes have been recognized, with sea level oscillating above or near the present level until 122 ka only, dropping, then rising to -11 in below present sea level at 120 ka. Three high-frequency sea-level oscillations occurred during MIS 5.3 and a fourth during MIS 5.3-5.2. Two or three events may have occurred during MIS 5.1, according to whether the 73 ka event is considered to belong to MIS 5.1. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

TI Mechanics and Historical Evolution of Sea Level Blowouts in New York
   Harbor
SO JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Wind-induced sea level blowouts, measured as negative storm surge or extreme low water (ELW), produce public safety hazards and impose economic costs (e.g., to shipping). In this paper, we use a regional hydrodynamic numerical model to test the effect of historical environmental change and the time scale, direction, and magnitude of wind forcing on negative and positive surge events in the New York Harbor (NYH). Environmental sensitivity experiments show that dredging of shipping channels is an important factor affecting blowouts while changing ice cover and removal of other roughness elements are unimportant in NYH. Continuously measured water level records since 1860 show a trend towards smaller negative surge magnitudes (measured minus predicted water level) but do not show a significant change to ELW magnitudes after removing the sea-level trend. Model results suggest that the smaller negative surges occur in the deeper, dredged modern system due to a reduced tide-surge interaction, primarily through a reduced phase shift in the predicted tide. The sensitivity of surge to wind direction changes spatially with remote wind effects dominating local wind effects near NYH. Convergent coastlines that amplify positive surges also amplify negative surges, a process we term inverse coastal funneling.

AB Late Devonian history is explained through event stratigraphy comprising a sequence of 18 sea-level changes, catastrophic events, and mass extinctions. Generally rising sea level during the initial Frasnian Stage, beginning with the Taghanic onlap and ending with a sea-level fall and major mass extinction, was interrupted by several exceptionally rapid, very high rises of sea level. These rises may be related to a series of comet showers, as suggested by the coincidence of the Alamo Impact in Nevada and the older Anidnau Event in Germany with two of the sea-level rises. The subcritical, off-platform marine Alamo Impact is demonstrated to have produced greatly different effects in deep water from those previously recorded on the carbonate platform.
   The series of comet showers, most notably those around the Frasnian-Famennian boundary, evidenced by microtektites in widely separated regions, not only produced the late Frasnian mass extinction, but also induced global cooling. This cooling resulted in Southern Hemisphere glaciation. Generally falling sea level during the later Famennian Stage was interrupted by several warmer, interglacial episodes, evidenced by glacio-eustatic rises. Another, less severe mass extinction occurred during an abrupt sea-level fall near the end of the Famennian. This glacio-eustatic fall is interpreted to have resulted from a severe, terminal glacial episode.
   Interpretation of Late Devonian history suggests that impacts and comet showers coincided with sea-level rises, whereas mass extinctions occurred during, not at the start of, sea-level falls.

TI The Sundarban and Its Environment
SO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE, LIVELIHOOD ISSUES AND MIGRATION: SUNDARBAN
   BIOSPHERE RESERVE, INDIA
AB The Sundarban is the UNESCO designated World Biosphere Reserve (in 2001) and inscribed as the Natural World Heritage Site in 1987. It is the largest halophytic mangrove forest in a single block, famous for in-situ conservation of endangered endemics and magnificent biodiversity of flora and fauna. The mangrove forest and associates, marsh grass, phytoplankton, molluscs and other coastal vegetation in the Sundarban sequester a huge amount of 'Blue Carbon' that reduces the global warming. Nowadays, low-lying coastal areas and islands like the Sundarban are in the limelight of climate change. Sea level rise, sea surface temperature, both the intensity and frequency of tropical cyclones, air temperature, rainfall, salinity, surface water pH and water transparency, all the environmental indicators in the Sundarban, are increasing in trend. This chapter provides insights into the detailed examination of the environment in the Sundarban based on the existing literatures.

TI The trough-system algorithm and its application to spatial modeling of
   Greenland subglacial topography
SO ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY
AB Dynamic ice-sheet models are used to assess the contribution of mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet to sea-level rise. Mass transfer from ice sheet to ocean is in a large part through outlet glaciers. Bed topography plays an important role in ice dynamics, since the acceleration from the slow-moving inland ice to an ice stream is in many cases caused by the existence of a subglacial trough or trough system. Problems are that most subglacial troughs are features of a scale not resolved in most ice-sheet models and that radar measurements of subglacial topography do not always reach the bottoms of narrow troughs. The trough-system algorithm introduced here employs mathematical morphology and algebraic topology to correctly represent subscale features in a topographic generalization, so the effects of troughs on ice flow are retained in ice-dynamic models. The algorithm is applied to derive a spatial elevation model of Greenland subglacial topography, integrating recently collected radar measurements (CReSIS data) of the Jakobshavn Isbrae, Helheim, Kangerdlussuaq and Petermann glacier regions. The resultant JakHelKanPet digital elevation model has been applied in dynamic ice-sheet modeling and sea-level-rise assessment.

TI Characterization of global mean sea level variations observed by
   TOPEX/POSEIDON using empirical orthogonal functions
SO SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS
AB The TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P) satellite altimeter mission has provided estimates of global mean sea level since late 1992 with a precision of approximately 4 mm. Over the first 3.5 years of the mission, TIP has observed a mean sea level rise of +0.5 mm/year when on-board estimates of the instrument drift are employed (and after correcting for a recently discovered software error), and +2.8 mm/year when an additional external tide gauge-based calibration estimate is used. A preliminary estimate of the error in the latter estimate is 1.3 mm/year, however this issue requires more research. Characterization of the observed sea level variations using Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) indicates that most of the mean sea level rise can be described by a single mode of the EOF expansion. The spatial characteristics of this mode suggests it is related to the El Nine Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomena. EOF analysis of sea level variations from the Semtner/Chervin ocean circulation model reveal a nearly identical mode, although its effect on mean sea level is unknown due to a constant volume constraint used in the model. EOF analysis of measured sea surface temperature (SST) variations also show a mode with similar temporal and spatial structure. However, the concentration of the observed sea level rise in this mode does not preclude the possibility that multiple phenomena have contributed to this mode, thus a link between the observed sea level rise and the ENSO phenomena is only weakly suggested. The absolute value of the observed mean sea level rise will depend on refinements currently being made in the instrument calibration techniques. In addition, the possibility of interannual and decadal variations of global mean sea level requires that a much longer time series of satellite altimetry be collected before variations caused by climate change can be unambiguously detected.

TI The Caranto Paleosol and Its Role in the Early Urbanization of Venice
SO GEOARCHAEOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB As rising sea level threatens Venice, there is a need to construct a historical framework for interpreting modern environmental changes. Environmental conditions that would later help support Venice's urbanization were established during the Late Glacial period when calcic soils began to develop in the Venetian alluvial paleoplain. A calcic paleosol, buried by Middle to Late Holocene marine transgressive deposits, represents a subsurface layer long known in the Venice area as "caranto." Referenced in the ancient chronicles of architects and builders, the caranto exhibits relatively high compressive and shear strength, making it an important substrate for supporting building foundations, some dating back to the Gothic era (12th-15th centuries A.D.). Hence, the caranto paleosol documents local post-glacial environmental changes while playing an important role in Venetian building construction and human settlement. Here we provide geochemical, sedimentological, paleoecological, and chronological analyses of the caranto paleosol and related deposits based on recent coring of the Venetian Lagoon.

TI Multidecadal variations of Fremantle sea level: Footprint of climate
   variability in the tropical Pacific
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Coastal sea level at Fremantle, Western Australia is strongly influenced by trade wind variations in the tropical Pacific, due to the existence of equatorial and coastal wave guides. Corroborated with low-pass filtered Southern Oscillation Index (SOI-M), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) causes high Fremantle sea levels during positive SOI-M regimes ( with more frequent La Nina events) and low sea levels during negative SOI-M regimes ( with more frequent El Nino events), due to enhanced and slackened trade winds. The multidecadal variation of the Fremantle sea level obscures its long-term rising trend during the 1950's to mid 1990's. Statistical regression models are used to describe relationships between the multidecadal sea level variation and SOI-M, in an attempt to separate natural climate variability and climate change effects. A nonparametric regression model reveals a nonlinear relationship, likely due to different responses of the sea level (upper-ocean) to the El Nino and La Nina events.

CL Liege, BELGIUM
AB The recent drop of sea level in the Aral Sea of about 0.6 in year(-1) during the last 40 years represents one of the most dramatic example globally about the possible consequences of man-induced environmental changes. This extremely strong signal, as well as the constantly changing hydrological and meteorological fluxes in this area are missing from the seaborne observations in the 1990s because the observational network developed by the Former Soviet Union has almost not been operating during one decade in the new independent states. Fortunately, the Aral Sea level has been regularly monitored from space.. in particular by satellite altimetry. In this study, we present observations of the Aral Sea level and analyze the observed trends and shorter term variability based on TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter data. This data set (available since early 1993) is complemented by hydrometeorological data and gauge data (since 1950) allowing to quantify the evolving water balance of the Aral Sea. It is shown that even though the river runoff almost ceased recently, the rapid drawing of the Aral Sea is substantially reduced by the compensating discharge of ground water. The analysis of the available data makes it possible to address the changing salt balance and to identify the major control on this balance exerted by ground water discharge. The major event of ground water discharge is identified in the period 1993-1994 and resulted in a substantial increase of the salt content. The rapid drop of salt content thereafter could indicate an increase of salt precipitation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The diatom algae from sediments of a paleolake serve as records of changes to environments over the last 7500 cal yr. The lagoon lake formed when the sea level approximately corresponded to the present-day position. Evolution of the paleolake was controlled by sea-level oscillations and humidity changes. Eight stages have been distinguished. During a dry episode in 7330-7090 cal yr BP the lake size decreased. The salinity reached maximal values at the Holocene transgression peak. Three stages of a higher salinity are recognized (6750-6500, 6080-5830, 5420-5090 cal yr BP). A severe flood occurred in 6080-6000 cal yr BP. The brackish-water lake existed in similar to 5090 cal yr BP and the freshwater lake in similar to 4090 cal yr BP. A prolonged phase of decreasing humidity, associated with a weakening of summer monsoons, led to a drop in sedimentation rates in similar to 3510 cal yr BP. Peat accumulation started at the Little Ice Age. The lake was transformed into a swamp during drop in precipitations in similar to 270 cal yr BP. Presence of marine diatoms typical in bay and deepwater forms are evidence of influence of extreme storms and tsunami. The age of the paleotsunami coincides well with the regional data.

TI Late Holocene palaeo-environmental change in the Banni Plains, Kachchh,
   Western India
SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
AB The effect of the environmental change during the Middle to Late Holocene period, on the demise of the mighty Harappan civilization has remained a topic of debate. The western India, especially the coastal regions, hosted a cluster of Harappan settlements near the shoreline. The present study attempts to reconstruct the evolution of Banni Plains of the Kachchh region, which has remained a hotspot for Harappan civilization. We employed a host of multi-proxy techniques viz., sedimentology, sediment geochemistry, magnetic susceptibility along with OSL chronology, to deduce the palaeo-environmental changes experienced by the Banni Plains from a shallow 4.05 m deep trench. The four OSL chronology of the sediments suggests the time span of 2.9 ka to 0.2 ka, revealing a first hand estimate of average sedimentation rate of 1.5 mm per annum. The enhanced chemical weathering intensities suggest that the last two millennia witnessed two phases of relatively warm and humid climatic conditions, which probably coincide with the Roman Warm Period (?) and the Medieval Warm Period (?). The Banni Plains was evolved owing to the Middle Holocene high sea stand and subsequent relative fall during the last 2 ka period. The extent of the relative high sea stand upto 2 m above msl also corroborated well by ancient port settlements of the Late Harappan period. This implies that the Harappan civilization was indeed influenced and affected by the past sea level change; nevertheless, this cannot be the sole reason for demise of the mighty civilization, but remained an auxiliary mechanism along with aridity which severed the human adaptation.

TI Early to mid-Holocene rapid sea-level rise and coastal response on the
   southern Yangtze delta plain, China
SO JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE
AB We used accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C-14-dated sediments of the Holocene basal supratidal flat to upper tidal flat facies in 11 cores on the southern Yangtze delta plain to reconstruct relative sea levels of 8.5-8.0 cal ka BP. Three cores were further AMS C-14 dated and used to examine the evolution of sedimentary geomorphological environments in response to the rapid sea-level rise during the early to mid-Holocene. Results demonstrate relative sea-level rise of around 30mm a(-1) from 8.5 to 8.3 cal ka BP and around 10mm a(-1) from 8.3 to 8.0 cal ka BP. Retrogradation from supratidal to lower tidal flat environments occurred in response to the rapid sea-level rise at 8.5-8.3 cal ka BP, and aggradation from middle to upper tidal flat occurred at 8.3-7.9 cal ka BP. Further retreat of the tidal flat at 7.9-7.2 cal ka BP implies a mean sea-level rise rate exceeding 5mm a(-1) at this time. We suggest that the rapid relative sea-level rise during 8.3-8.5 cal ka BP and subsequent slower rise caused drastic changes in the coastal zone and that these changes are key phenomena for understanding the coastal response to future sea-level rise.

TI The sedimentary record of palaeoenvironments and sea-level change in the
   Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia, through the last glacial cycle
SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
AB Environmental evolution of the Gulf of Carpentaria region, the world's largest tropical epicontinental seaway, through the last glacial cycle has been determined from a series of six sediment cores. These cores form the focus of a multi-disciplinary study to elucidate sea level, climate and environmental change in the region. The sedimentary record reveals a series of facies including open shallow marine marginal marine, estuarine, lacustrine and subaerial exposure, throughout the extent of the basin during this period.
   The partial or complete closure of the central basin from marine waters results from sea level falling below the height of one or both of the sills that border the Gulf-the Arafura Sill to the west (53 in below present sea level (bpsl)) and Torres Strait to the east (12 in bpsl). The extent and timing of these closures, and restriction of the shallow waterbody within, are intrinsic to local ocean circulation, available latent heat transport and the movement of people and animals between Australia and New Guinea.
   Whilst the occurrence of the palaeo-Lake Carpentaria has previously been identified, this study expands on the hydrological conditions of the lacustrine phases and extends the record through the Last Interglacial, detailing the previous sea-level highstand (MIS 5.5) and subsequent retreat.
   When sea levels were low during the MIS 6 glacial period, the Gulf was largely subaerially exposed and traversed by meandering rivers. The MIS 5 transgression (similar to 130 ka BP) led to marine then alternating marine/estuarine conditions through to MIS 4 (similar to 70ka BP) when a protracted lacustrine phase, of varying salinity and depth/area, and including periods of near desiccation, persisted until about 12.12cal ka BP. The lake expanded to near maximum size (similar to 190 000km(2)) following the intensification/restoration of the Australian monsoon at 14 ka BP. This lake-full phase was short-lived, as by 12.2cal ka BP, marine waters were entering the basin, coincident with the progressive sea-level rise. Fully marine conditions were restored by about 10.5 cal ka BP by westward connection to the Arafura Sea (Indian Ocean), whereas connections to the Pacific Ocean (Coral Sea) did not occur until about 8cal ka BP.

TI Cyclicity and sequence stratigraphy of the Neoproterozoic uppermost Haut
   Shiloango-Lukala carbonate ramp system in the Lower Congo region
   (Democratic Republic of the Congo): Example of tectonostratigraphic
   control versus climatic changes
SO JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
AB During the Cryogenian-Ediacaran, tectonically- and climatically-driven perturbations created sea level changes. Snowball Earth-type glaciations suggest similar to 500-800 m sea level fall or at least 1,000-1,500 m in eustatic sea-level change as a result of severe climate changes. However, in Central Africa, geologic evidence of such processes is lacking. In the Lower Congo region (Democratic Republic of the Congo), detailed facies analysis and sequence stratigraphy of the Neoproterozoic uppermost Haut Shiloango-Lukala carbonate ramp system allowed to reconstruct the multiple order relative sea-level changes. Two hundred twenty-three fifth-order elementary parasequences, grouped into eleven fourth-order depositional sequences or parasequence sets, recorded a severe sea-level fall up to 15 m for slope-outer-to-outer ramp facies of the uppermost Haut Shiloango Subgroup-Upper Diamictite Formation followed by two distinct sea-level rises for the slope-outer-to-inner ramp facies of the Lukala Subgroup. First marine transgression shows a cumulative similar to 60 m of sea-level rise throughout C1 to C3 (Lukala Subgroup) sediment accumulations. Second marine transgression shows a cumulative similar to 50 m sea-level rise throughout C4 to C5 sediment accumulations. The transition from uppermost Haut Shiloango to Upper Diamictite ramp system points to an isostatic rebound and uplift of the rift flanks of the Congo Craton, creating paleoreliefs, potentially allowing local glaciation and periglacial sedimentation. This rebound can be ascribed to a diachronous far-field effect of similar to 660 Ma Macaubas Basin opening in Brazil. First marine transgression is interpreted as a consequence of syn-to post-rifting related to sea-floor spreading, which initiated the subsidence of the basin. A similar to 30 m of sea-level rise drowned the C1 formation carbonate ramp, which turned on the oversupply and progradation of offshore to nearshore marine deposits on the wedges of the basin. An abrupt change from both marine transgressions points to similar to 25 m of sea-level rise that is interpreted as the consequence of the development of similar to 585-560 Ma Aracual-West Congo Orogen, which significantly increased the siliciclastic supply in the basin. Our results show that no anomalous climatic or eustatic events such as those proposed in the Snowball Earth model are recorded in DRC. On the contrary, relative sea-level changes result from long-term overriding regional tectonic processes controlling diachronous sedimentation along the western passive margin of the Congo Craton.

TI Understanding Socio-Ecological Vulnerability to Climatic Change through
   a Trajectories of Change Approach: A Case Study from an Indigenous
   Community in Panama
SO WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY
AB This paper identifies and characterizes vulnerability to climatic change in the Ngobe-Bugle Indigenous community of Playitas, Panama, using a "trajectories of change" approach. Playitas is a community composed of swidden forest farmers that is undergoing rapid rates of change as a result of demographic shifts, regional development, and climate change. Working in collaboration with a community organization, various methods were used to identify and characterize livelihoods, social-ecological dynamics, environmental change, and behavioral responses to change, with the aim of informing future planning in the community. Qualitative methods included semistructured interviews (n = 26), community workshops, and participant observation. Causal-loop diagrams based on field data and the perceptions of community members were created to model trajectories of change. The research reveals that change is driven by both internal and external factors and that the responses of community members create both reinforcing and balancing feedback loops that overall generate increased stress in agricultural systems, social structures, and environmental components. Although community members historically relied on social relationships, Indigenous knowledge, and remoteness as sources of resilience to external disturbances, climate change is acting as a "multiplier" of their existing vulnerabilities and is undermining their capacity to adapt to current and future climatic changes.

TI Western Boundary Sea Level: A Theory, Rule of Thumb, and Application to
   Climate Models
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
AB To better understand coastal sea level variability and changes, a theory that predicts sea levels along a curved western boundary using interior ocean sea level information is proposed. The western boundary sea level at a particular latitude is expressed by the sum of contributions from interior sea levels propagating onto the western boundary by long Rossby waves between that latitude and a higher latitude, and from the western boundary sea level at the higher latitude. This theory is examined by using a linear, reduced gravity model. A comparison between the theory and the model shows good agreement. A simple scaling law (or rule of thumb) derived from the theory provides a measure of the higher-latitude sea level and ocean interior sea level contributions. The theory is then tested using data from 34 climate models in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) for dynamic sea level changes between the end of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The theory captures the nearly uniform sea level rise from the Labrador Sea to New York City (NYC), with a reduction in the increase of sea level farther south toward the equator, qualitatively consistent with the CMIP5 multimodel ensemble, even though the theory underestimates the equatorward reduction rate. Along the South American east coast, the theory successfully reproduced the spatial pattern of the sea level change. The theory suggests a strong link between a sea level rise hot spot along the northeastern coast of North America and the sea level increase in the Labrador Sea, consistent with the result that rates of NYC sea level rise are highly correlated to those in the Labrador Sea in CMIP5 models.

TI Evaluating a Steady-State Model of Soil Accretion in Everglades
   Mangroves (Florida, USA)
SO ESTUARIES AND COASTS
AB To determine whether mangrove soil accretion can keep up with increasing rates of sea level rise, we modeled the theoretical, steady-state (i.e., excluding hurricane impacts) limits to vertical soil accretion in riverine mangrove forests on the southwest coast of Florida, USA. We measured dry bulk density (BD) and loss on ignition (LOI) from mangrove soils collected over a period of 12 years along an estuarine transect of the Shark River. The plotted relationship between BD and LOI was fit to an idealized mixing model equation that provided estimates of organic and inorganic packing densities in the soils. We used these estimates in combination with measures of root production and mineral deposition to calculate their combined contribution to steady-state, vertical soil accretion. On average, the modeled rates of accretion (0.9 to 2.4 mm year(-1)) were lower than other measured rates of soil accretion at these sites and far less than a recent estimate of sea level rise in south Florida (7.7 mm year(-1)). To date, however, no evidence of mangrove "drowning" has been observed in this region of the Everglades, indicating that assumptions of the linear accretion model are invalid and/or other contributions to soil accretion (e.g., additional sources of organic matter; feedbacks between physical sedimentation processes and biological responses to short-term environmental change) make up the accretion deficit. This exercise highlights the potential positive impacts of hurricanes on non-steady-state soil accretion that contribute to the persistence of neotropical mangroves in regions of high disturbance frequency such as the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean region.

TI Synthesizing long-term sea level rise projections - the MAGICC sea level
   model v2.0
SO GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
AB Sea level rise (SLR) is one of the major impacts of global warming; it will threaten coastal populations, infrastructure, and ecosystems around the globe in coming centuries. Well-constrained sea level projections are needed to estimate future losses from SLR and benefits of climate protection and adaptation. Process-based models that are designed to resolve the underlying physics of individual sea level drivers form the basis for state-of-the-art sea level projections. However, associated computational costs allow for only a small number of simulations based on selected scenarios that often vary for different sea level components. This approach does not sufficiently support sea level impact science and climate policy analysis, which require a sea level projection methodology that is flexible with regard to the climate scenario yet comprehensive and bound by the physical constraints provided by process-based models. To fill this gap, we present a sea level model that emulates global-mean long-term process-based model projections for all major sea level components. Thermal expansion estimates are calculated with the hemispheric upwelling-diffusion ocean component of the simple carbon-cycle climate model MAGICC, which has been updated and calibrated against CMIP5 ocean temperature profiles and thermal expansion data. Global glacier contributions are estimated based on a parameterization constrained by transient and equilibrium process-based projections. Sea level contribution estimates for Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are derived from surface mass balance and solid ice discharge parameterizations reproducing current output from ice-sheet models. The land water storage component replicates recent hydrological modeling results. For 2100, we project 0.35 to 0.56m (66% range) total SLR based on the RCP2.6 scenario, 0.45 to 0.67m for RCP4.5, 0.46 to 0.71m for RCP6.0, and 0.65 to 0.97m for RCP8.5. These projections lie within the range of the latest IPCC SLR estimates. SLR projections for 2300 yield median responses of 1.02m for RCP2.6, 1.76m for RCP4.5, 2.38m for RCP6.0, and 4.73m for RCP8.5. The MAGICC sea level model provides a flexible and efficient platform for the analysis of major scenario, model, and climate uncertainties underlying long-term SLR projections. It can be used as a tool to directly investigate the SLR implications of different mitigation pathways and may also serve as input for regional SLR assessments via component-wise sea level pattern scaling.

TI The sea-level fingerprints of ice-sheet collapse during interglacial
   periods
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB Studies of sea level during previous interglacials provide insight into the stability of polar ice sheets in the face of global climate change. Commonly, these studies correct ancient sea-level highstands for the contaminating effect of isostatic adjustment associated with past ice age cycles, and interpret the residuals as being equivalent to the peak eustatic sea level associated with excess melting, relative to present day, of ancient polar ice sheets. However, the collapse of polar ice sheets produces a distinct geometry, or fingerprint, of sea-level change, which must be accounted for to accurately infer peak eustatic sea level from site-specific residual highstands. To explore this issue, we compute fingerprints associated with the collapse of the Greenland Ice Sheet, West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and marine sectors of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet in order to isolate regions that would have been subject to greater-than-eustatic sea-level change for all three cases. These fingerprints are more robust than those associated with modern melting events, when applied to infer eustatic sea level, because: (1) a significant collapse of polar ice sheets reduces the sensitivity of the computed fingerprints to uncertainties in the geometry of the melt regions; and (2) the sea-level signal associated with the collapse will dominate the signal from steric effects. We evaluate these fingerprints at a suite of sites where sea-level records from interglacial marine isotopes stages (MIS) 5e and 11 have been obtained. Using these results, we demonstrate that previously discrepant estimates of peak eustatic sea level during MIS-5e based on sealevel markers in Australia and the Seychelles are brought into closer accord.

AB Palaeoecological analyses of raised peat bog deposits in northwest Europe show the naturalness, antiquity and robust response of these ecosystems to environmental changes from c. 7800 years ago to the present. A review of the techniques used to identify these long-term features is presented and the role of climate change, autogenic change processes and human disturbance is discussed. Millennial records of vegetation changes recorded in peat deposits demonstrate the response (often rapid) of raised peat bog vegetation to climatic changes during the mid-Holocene, Bronze Age/Iron Age transition and the Little Ice Age. Greenhouse warming scenarios exceed the reconstructed Holocene record of climatic changes (c. the last 11, 500 years), and bog-water tables may fall considerably. A combination of centennial palaeoecological analyses of bogs affected by human disturbance and experimental manipulations have been used as analogues for the potential response of raised peat bog vegetation to these changes. These show that possible greenhouse gas climate forcing scenarios may exceed the ability of Sphagnum- dominated raised peat bogs to respond to projected increases in summer temperature and decreases in summer precipitation. In combination with increasing N deposition, a loss of their Sphagnum-rich vegetation and increases in the abundance of vascular plants could occur on decadal timescales.

TI Adaptation strategies to maintain dunes as flexible coastal flood
   defense in The Netherlands
SO MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB Coastal dunes play an important role in coastal defense along sandy shorelines of the world. The majority of the shorelines experience erosion and this erosion is expected to accelerate under anthropogenic climate change and subsequent sea level rise. This paper investigates the impact of climate change, sea level rise and current management for coastal dunes in the Netherlands. Furthermore the paper discusses the implications of climate change projections for adaptation strategies into the future. Recent climate change scenarios for the Netherlands highlight rising temperature and accelerated sea-level rise. Their combined effects on dune-building processes are expected to be manifested through an increase in erosive forces at the expensive of accretive forces. In the Netherlands, a negative sand balance and inland migration of the beach-dune system has been successfully counteracted in the last decades through the application of sand nourishments. These have enhanced accretion on the one hand and limited erosion on the other hand. Generally, coastal protection has improved despite rising sea levels. Important preconditions that make this sand nourishment strategy possible are: a readily available sand resource that makes exploitation technically and economically feasible; a sound monitoring system supported by solid science; political consensus and a good institutional structure to implement the strategy. In the Netherlands, the necessary preconditions are already in place to successfully adapt to sea level rise. Given the expected accelerated rise in sea level and its potential effects on the dune-beach sediment balance, the annual sand nourishment will need to be intensified to ensure the preservation and integrity of the coastal zone.

TI Late Quaternary environmental changes in Hong Kong
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB The offshore Quaternary deposits of Hong Kong include a wide range of elastic sediments that accumulated in a variety of settings including lacustrine. channel, overbank, coastal and marine environments. Detailed studies of the sedimentology and diatoms of several long, continuously-sampled cores, combined with seismic reflection profiles, has enabled the reconstruction of Late Pleistocene and Holocene palaeoenvironments in Hong Kong. The Quaternary sediments comprise several informal seismic units that are separated by marine planation, tidal scour and fluvial erosion surfaces. Seismic Unit 1 represents pre-Quaternary bedrock and weathered bedrock, which is separated from a complex assemblage of Pleistocene channel. floodplain, backswamp and lacustrine deposits (seismic Unit 2) by a major erosion surface (U1). Sediments that represent the basal part of Unit 2 have been dated at about 248.000 yr B.P. Well preserved laminations at several horizons suggest periodic deposition and probably seasonal flooding. The presence of kaolin indicates strong chemical weathering and warm, humid conditions at the time of deposition. Seismic Unit 3 consists of marine mud that unconformably overlies a fluvial erosion surface (FE1) cut into deposits represented by seismic Unit 2. The sediments comprising Unit 3 are tentatively correlated with oxygen isotope stage 5e and high sea levels at about 128,000-105,000 yr B.P. A marine planation surface (R1) terminates Unit 3 and is overlain by coastal and nearshore deposits comprising seismic Unit 4 at about 95,000 to 80,000 yr B.P. This phase of marine deposition was terminated by a major fall in sea level that caused widespread fluvial incision across Hong Kong and produced surface FE2. A subsequent rise in sea level after about 18,000 yr B.P. led to deposition of a complex succession of marine sediments and erosion surfaces. Initially, homogeneous mud (seismic Unit 5A) was laid down. Tidal currents, perhaps related to base level changes, then caused incision and the formation of surface TS1 at several localities. Further shallow marine mud, comprising Unit 5B, was laid down between about 9500 and 8000 yr B.P. A planar erosion surface (R2), with local palaeosols and minor incision, cuts across earlier deposits, The overlying seismic Unit 5C represents diatomaceous marina mud and a basal sand. At one coring sire, these sediments have been divided into five major diatom zones that reflect changes in salinity and sea level. Modern sea level was attained by about 6000 yr B.P. In broad terms, the late Quaternary record is one of two periods of marine flooding separated by a major regressive episode, with no evidence of older Quaternary marine sediments being present.

TI Migration induced by sea-level rise could reshape the US population
   landscape
SO NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
AB Many sea-level rise (SLR) assessments focus on populations presently inhabiting vulnerable coastal communities(1-3), but to date no studies have attempted to model the destinations of these potentially displaced persons. With millions of potential future migrants in heavily populated coastal communities, SLR scholarship focusing solely on coastal communities characterizes SLR as primarily a coastal issue, obscuring the potential impacts in landlocked communities created by SLR-induced displacement. Here I address this issue by merging projected populations at risk of SLR1 with migration systems simulations to project future destinations of SLR migrants in the United States. I find that unmitigated SLR is expected to reshape the US population distribution, potentially stressing landlocked areas unprepared to accommodate this wave of coastal migrants-even after accounting for potential adaptation. These results provide the first glimpse of how climate change will reshape future population distributions and establish a new foundation for modelling potential migration destinations from climate stressors in an era of global environmental change.

TI Total volume and temporal variation of meltwater from last glacial
   maximum inferred from sea-level observations at Barbados and Tahiti
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB It is very important to determine the temporal variation of meltwater volume from the last glacial maximum (LGM) for studying climate changes and for constraining mantle rheology. Sea-level observations have been obtained at Barbados (at the LGM and in late-glacial phase) and Tahiti (in late-glacial phase), and suggest that two events of rapid sea-level rise existed at about 14,000 and 11,000 calendar years before present. We examine the total meltwater volume and temporal variation of meltwater volume by comparing sea-level observations and predictions at Barbados and Tahiti. Comparison between observations and predictions for Barbados indicates that the total meltwater volume from the LGM is 103-117 m for eustatic sea-level rise. The predicted sea-level variations at Tahiti based on the ice model satisfying observations for Barbados are, however, inconsistent with late-glacial sea-level observations at Tahiti. Thus two events of rapid sea-level rise are not supported from the comparison between observations and predictions at Tahiti. More in situ observational data are required for the period from the LGM to late-glacial phase in order to study the relationship between rapid sea-level rise and climate change.

TI Coastal engineering evolution in low-lying areas and adaptation practice
   since the eleventh century, Jiangsu Province, China
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
AB Coastal engineering is an important measure in coping with coastal risks. With global warming and sea level rising, the sustainable adaptation of the low-lying areas becomes urgent. An in-depth understanding of the relationship between coastal engineering and environmental changes can help improve the adaptation capability for climate change. Here, we use historical documents and synthesis approach to examine coastal engineering evolution on the Jiangsu coast, the largest lowland area along China's coastlines, and explore its response to local sea level and land use changes. The results show that coastal engineering here experienced a long-term period centered on sea-dike construction, with a shift from primary function of storm surge prevention since the eleventh century, towards a green coastal engineering approach in recent years. On the century scale, there was a close connection between local sea level change and coastal engineering change, while on the ten-year scale, population dynamics and land use changes were the key driving factors. Since the future climate and sea level change magnitude will be beyond what has been observed on the Jiangsu coast, it would be sensible to define a "critical time" that divides the near future and remote future. On such a basis, a strategic plan for the remote future may be formulated to prepare for the critical time when inevitable inundation occurs, and a second strategic plan may be adopted for the near future, to buy time for the coastal communities to make necessary preparations and at the same time to continue to use the resources. For the "near future," a green coastal engineering approach (in combination with the experiences gained from the Jiangsu coast) should be developed to provide a low cost, high efficiency technique for coastal defense schemes. The thoughts outlined above may be applicable also to a number of low-lying coastal regions of developing countries.

TI Modeling longitudinal-profile development in response to Late Quaternary
   tectonics, climate and sea-level changes: the River Meuse
SO GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
AB We present a forward-modelling case study for the development of the longitudinal profile of a basin-marginal fluvial system (River Meuse, NW Europe) responding to Late Quaternary tectonics, climate and sea-level changes.
   Modelling results show that river reaches in different tectonic domains will respond differently to isochronous events of climate and sea-level change. Climatic change dominates river-valley development in the long-term uplifting upper and middle Meuse reaches (NE Paris Basin, Ardennes, terrace flight area). An alternation of stadial depositional and interstadial erosional phases causes net aggradation of the river valley during glacials, but the river valley considerably degrades during interglacials. The long-term trend in these upper and middle reaches is river-valley degradation.
   Continuous aggradation leads to long-term deposition during glacials in the subsiding lower Meuse reaches, including the greater part of the Venlo-Block area, the western Roer Valley Graben and the southern part of the West Netherlands Basin. However, decreasing sediment supply combined with increasing discharges at the start of interglacials favours discharge controlled (kinetic) incision in these net-depositional areas. Post-glacial sea-level rise and the subsequent interglacial highstand strongly influence the subsiding graben areas and the southern West Netherlands Basin. Rising sea level generates a zone of gradient-backfilling that migrates upstream with time. Consequently, the terrace intersection migrates upstream too and a coastal prism is built up during the interglacial highstand. The present case study indicates that the Meuse terrace intersection may migrate to at least 113 km upstream from the modelled coastline. The model also suggests post-interglacial incision of the Eemian highstand coastal prism during the subsequent relative sea-level fall in the Early Weichselian. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Mid-Holocene mangrove succession and its response to sea-level change in
   the upper Mekong River delta, Cambodia
SO QUATERNARY RESEARCH
AB Middle Holocene vegetation and mangrove successions are clearly evident in the palynological records of two cores from the upper Mekong River delta in Cambodia. Spanning from similar to 9.4 to 6.3 cal ka BP, the cores mainly record a transgressive sequence from floodplain freshwater marsh to tidal flat, which was overlain by mangrove. Corresponding to the decelerated sea-level rise at similar to 8.3 cal ka BP, pioneer mangrove species Sonneratia alba and Sonneratia caseolaris appeared in the sediments, and then was replaced by regressive mangrove succession containing upward-increasing abundances of Rhizophora apiculata and Bruguiera spp. High salinity- and flooding-tolerant community S. alba was developed at the western core site PSG at similar to 8.2 cal ka BP, and the eastern core site PK at similar to 7.5 cal ka BP. The time difference of S. alba appearance between the two sites might be resulted from the complexity of sedimentary environment, where a higher sediment supply was provided to the western floodplain than to the eastern floodplain. After 7.5 cal ka BP, aggradational stacking of intertidal sediments, of which the thickness is larger than the present maximum tidal range, may have resulted from continuous sea-level rise during 7.5-7.0 cal ka BP.

TI Indicators and mechanisms of stability and resilience to climatic and
   landscape changes in a remnant calcareous grassland
SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB When considering the development of conservation strategies for threatened plant communities it is crucial to understand their resilience to environmental change, taking into account current decline and the occurrence of further habitat fragmentation and climatic changes. Many recent works describe resilience character and elements, but there is little focus on the metrics and indices that describe elements of stability and specific resistance or resilience over the community composition matrix. Communities with strong niche selection might be restricted to specific resistance strategies to cope with environmental changes. This would result in a community at greater risk from increasing fragmentation and climatic changes.
   In a 35 years survey of relic calcareous grasslands, we looked at measures to identify the resilience mechanisms for stability in the presence and abundance of species. We used techniques of partitioning of temporal beta diversity in nestedness and turnover components, analysis of functional strategy changes and dissimilarity analysis to detect changes in between -plot diversity and exchanges.
   Contrary to expectations, we observe strong resilience with different stabilizing mechanisms both at plot level and exchanges between plots. At the scale of our grassland complex, response diversity and environmental stochasticity allow for the maintenance of high biodiversity under natural perturbations and gradual human -induced environmental changes. This highlights the importance of dispersal, recruitment dynamics and microsite diversity.
   Community resilience is more than just the sum of species resilience strategies; adaptive management strategies need more emphasis on the variability of conditions, as this can enable or disrupt important community resilience mechanisms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Rates of Holocene isostatic uplift and relative sea-level lowering of
   the Baltic in SW Finland based on studies of isolation contacts
SO BOREAS
AB Southwestern Finland was covered by the Weichselian ice sheet and experienced rapid glacio-isostatic rebound after early Holocene deglaciation. The present mean overall apparent uplift rate is of the order of 4-5 mm/yr, but immediately after deglaciation the rate of crustal rebound was several times higher. Concurrently with land uplift, relative sea level in the Baltic basin during the past more than 8000 years was also strongly affected by the eustatic changes in sea level. There is ample evidence from earlier studies that during the early Litorina Sea stage on the southeastern coast of Finland around 7000 yr BP (7800 cal. yr BP), the rise in sea level exceeded the rate of land uplift, resulting in a short-lived transgression. Because of a higher rate of uplift, the transgression was even more short-lived or of negligible magnitude in the southwestern part of coastal Finland, but even in this latter case a slowing down in the rate of regression can still be detected. We used evidence from isolation basins to obtain a set of 71 C-14 dates, and over 30 new sea-level index points. The age-elevation data, obtained from lakes in two different areas and located between c. 64 m and 1.5 m above present sea level, display a high degree of internal consistency. This suggests that the dates are reliable, even though most of them were based on bulk sediment samples. The two relative sea-level curves confirm the established model of relatively gradually decreasing rates of relative sea-level lowering since c. 6100 yr BP (7000 cal. yr BP) and clearly indicate that the more northerly of the two study areas experienced the higher rate of glacio-isostatic recovery. In the southerly study area, changes in diatom assemblages and lithostratigraphy suggest that during the early Litorina Sea stage (8300-7600 cal. yr BP) eustatic sea-level rise exceeded land uplift for hundreds of years. Evidence for this transgression was discovered in a lake with a basin threshold at an elevation of 41 m above sea level, which is markedly higher than any previously known site with evidence for the Litorina transgression in Finland. We also discuss evidence for subsequent short-term fluctuations superimposed on the main trends of relative sea-level changes.

TI Sea-level rise caused by climate change and its implications for society
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE JAPAN ACADEMY SERIES B-PHYSICAL AND BIOLOGICAL
   SCIENCES
AB Sea-level rise is a major effect of climate change. It has drawn international attention, because higher sea levels in the future would cause serious impacts in various parts of the world. There are questions associated with sea-level rise which science needs to answer. To what extent did climate change contribute to sea-level rise in the past? How much will global mean sea level increase in the future? How serious are the impacts of the anticipated sea-level rise likely to be, and can human society respond to them? This paper aims to answer these questions through a comprehensive review of the relevant literature. First, the present status of observed sea-level rise, analyses of its causes, and future projections are summarized. Then the impacts are examined along with other consequences of climate change, from both global and Japanese perspectives. Finally, responses to adverse impacts will be discussed in order to clarify the implications of the sea-level rise issue for human society.

TI Geochemical Records Reveal Protracted and Differential Marine Redox
   Change Associated With Late Ordovician Climate and Mass Extinctions
SO AGU ADVANCES
AB The Ordovician (Hirnantian; 445 Ma) hosts the second most severe mass extinction in Earth history, coinciding with Gondwanan glaciation and increased geochemical evidence for marine anoxia. It remains unclear whether cooling, expanded oxygen deficiency, or a combination drove the Late Ordovician Mass Extinction (LOME). Here, we present combined iodine and sulfur isotope geochemical data from three globally distributed carbonate successions to constrain changes in local and global marine redox conditions. Iodine records suggest locally anoxic conditions were potentially pervasive on shallow carbonate shelves, while sulfur isotopes suggest a reduction in global euxinic (anoxic and sulfidic) conditions. Late Katian sulfate-sulfur isotope data show a large negative excursion that initiated during elevated sea level and continued through peak Hirnantian glaciation. Geochemical box modeling suggests a combination of decreasing pyrite burial and increasing weathering are required to drive the observed negative excursion suggesting a similar to 3% decrease of global seafloor euxinia during the Late Ordovician. The sulfur datasets provide further evidence that this trend was followed by increases in euxinia which coincided with eustatic sea-level rise during subsequent deglaciation in the late Hirnantian. A persistence of shelf anoxia against a backdrop of waning then waxing global euxinia was linked to the two LOME pulses. These results place important constraints on local and global marine redox conditions throughout the Late Ordovician and suggest that non-sulfidic shelfal anoxia-along with glacioeustatic sea level and climatic cooling-were important environmental stressors that worsened conditions for marine fauna, resulting in the second-largest mass extinction in Earth history and the only example during an icehouse climate.

CL VENICE, ITALY
SP Battelle Geneva Res Ctr, Azienda Multiservizi Ambientali Veneziana
AB The study investigated whether tidal mudflats in the Ribble estuary, UK, should be considered sinks or sources for contaminants. Analysis of the signature of Cs-137, Cs-134 in mud cores taken from the estuary at specific locations determined an average annual rate of deposition. A simple hydrodynamic and sediment model calculated a monthly deposition rate for the same locations. The values obtained were compared, and the sediment deposition model adjusted by the addition of climatic parameters based on the a 25 year historical record of climatic data for the area. The initial results indicated that the deposition rates calculated for the estuary from the sediment deposition model were higher than those observed from field analysis. Climatic influences in this estuary reduce the level of deposition from the pure sediment deposition model value. Future climatic conditions were then modelled to test the effect of climatic change and sea level rise on deposition patterns in the estuary. Erosion at the study site was increased with an increase in 'bad' weather events, only in one scenario, in which extreme weather events were taken consecutively, was general erosion simulated. It is concluded that the Ribble estuary can be regarded as a sink for contaminants under predicted climatic change conditions.

Results show the average rising rate of all the stations is 2.3mm/a. The rising rate of the sea level in the north area is a little larger than the south area, and large rising rate appears on the island or at the big river mouth. The annual range of the sea level along the coast of China seas shows larger values in the north than in the south. The months when the highest or lowest sea levels occur in the south area lag the north area. River runoff can influence the annual range of the nearby sea level prominently. Monsoon, sea surface air pressure and SST are three important factors that cause the sea level variation along the coast of the China seas.

TI Impact of global seismicity on sea level change assessment
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
AB [1] We analyze the effect of seismic activity on sea level variations by computing the time-dependent vertical crustal movement and geoid change due to coseismic deformations and postseismic relaxation effects. Seismic activity can affect both the absolute sea level, changing the Earth's gravity field and hence the geoid height, and the relative sea level (RSL), i.e., the radial distance between seafloor and geoid level. By using comprehensive seismic catalogs we assess the net effect of seismicity on tidal relative sea level measurements as well as on the global oceanic surfaces, and we obtain an estimate of absolute sea level variations of seismic origin. We modified the approach adopted in our previous analysis, considering the issue of water volume conservation by applying the sealevel equation, and we improved our computational methods, enabling us to evaluate the effect of an extremely large number of earthquakes on large grids covering the whole oceanic surface. These new potentialities allow us to perform more detailed investigations and to discover a quantitative explanation for the overall tendency of earthquakes to produce a positive global relative sea level variation. Our results confirm the finding of a previous analysis that on a global scale most of the signal is associated with a few giant thrust events and that RSL estimates obtained using tide gauge data can be sensibly affected by the seismically driven sea level signal. The recent measures of sea level obtained by satellite altimetry show a wide regional variation of sea level trends over the oceanic surface, with the largest deviations from the mean trend occurring in tectonically active regions. While our estimates of average absolute sea level variations turn out to be orders of magnitude smaller than the satellite-measured variations, we can still argue that the mass redistribution associated with aseismic tectonic processes may contribute to the observed regional variability of sea level variations. A detailed study of these tectonic contributions is important to acquire a complete understanding of the global sea level variations and will be the subject of future investigations.

TI Sea-level changes and crustal movements recorded along the east Adriatic
   coast
SO NUOVO CIMENTO DELLA SOCIETA ITALIANA DI FISICA C-GEOPHYSICS AND SPACE
   PHYSICS
AB Sea-level changes in the Adriatic are investigated on the basis of monthly mean sea levels registered at Croatian tide-gauge stations Rovinj, Bakar, Split and Dubrovnik since the beginning of the 1950s. A comparison of sea-level anomalies with air-pressure anomalies recorded simultaneously at Pula, Rijeka, Split and Dubrovnik reveals a statistically significant relationship: a 1 mbar air-pressure change corresponds to a 1.8-2.0 cm sea-level change. The relationship enables sea-level anomalies to be corrected and, consequently, long term sea-level changes to be determined more reliably. A 20-year cycle observed in both the uncorrected and corrected anomalies is interpreted in terms of the global bidecadal signal and its regional manifestation in the Mediterranean. In order to minimize the effects of the bidecadal cycle, trends are analysed over a 30-year sliding window. The procedure reveals that the trends vary along the Croatian coast from ca. 1 mm/a in the North to zero in the South, with deceleration being visible at all the stations during the early 1970s. The finding is interpreted in terms of a) global sea-level rise, b) regional multidecadal sea-level variability, and c) local tectonic movements. Multidecadal sea-level changes are believed to be related to the natural variations observed in the atmosphere above Europe and/or to the anthropogenic changes of the Mediterranean freshwater budget. Tectonic movements bring about a rising of the middle and south Adriatic coast relatively to the north Adriatic coast at a 1 mm/a speed, with the Bakar area being characterized by anomalous crustal motions.

TI Tracking Late Cretaceous environmental change: Geochemical environment
   of the upper Campanian to lower Maastrichtian chalks at Kronsmoor,
   northern Germany
SO CRETACEOUS RESEARCH
AB This high-resolution study (210 samples/44 m) of the uppermost Campanian-lower Maastrichtian chalk at Kronsmoor (northern Germany) intends to define the inorganic depositional setting of Late Cretaceous chalk deposition as well as to reconstruct contemporaneous sea-level fluctuations and palae-oenvironmental changes. A latest Campanian event associated with significantly decreased carbonate contents and palaeotemperatures is reflected in most geochemical palaeoproductivity proxies and indicates reduced marine fertility across the Campanian-Maastrichtian boundary. Sr/Ca and delta C-13 remain low afterwards while other productivity proxies show a significant rebound, indicating recovery and a potential qualitative change in marine productivity during the early Maastrichtian. Redox-sensitive proxies indicate overall well oxygenated conditions. The %terrigenous proxy tracks an argillaceous chalk depositional event related to an inferred glacio-eustatic latest Campanian sea-level fall followed by a low sea-level stand until the earliest Maastrichtian. It decreases and stays low up-section, reflecting an early Maastrichtian sea-level rise and highstand, parallelled by increasing and consistently high carbonate contents. However, the concomitant conspicuous variability and increase in other terrigenous input proxies indicate more strongly fluctuating and higher aeolian supply. Time-series analysis of selected geochemical proxies demonstrates the presence of the obliquity (similar to 40 kyr) the long-eccentricity (similar to 400 kyr) cycles of the Milankovitch Band. The covariance of productivity proxies and indicators of aeolian input suggests that obliquity forcing of dust input exerted control on (surface) water productivity, CaCO3 flux and the end -Cretaceous carbon cycle.

TI Assessment the Impacts of Sea-Level Changes on Mangroves of Ceara-Mirim
   Estuary, Northeastern Brazil, during the Holocene and Anthropocene
SO PLANTS-BASEL
AB Predictions of the effects of modern Relative Sea-Level (RSL) rise on mangroves should be based on decadal-millennial mangrove dynamics and the particularities of each depositional environment under past RSL changes. This work identified inland and seaward mangrove migrations along the Ceara-Mirim estuary (Rio Grande do Norte, northeastern Brazil) during the mid-late Holocene and Anthropocene based on sedimentary features, palynological, and geochemical (delta C-13, delta N-15, C/N) data integrated with spatial-temporal analysis based on satellite images. The data indicated three phases for the mangrove development: (1 degrees) mangrove expansion on tidal flats with estuarine organic matter between >4420 and similar to 2870 cal yrs BP, under the influence of the mid-Holocene sea-level highstand; (2 degrees) mangrove contraction with an increased contribution of C-3 terrestrial plants between similar to 2870 and similar to 84 cal yrs BP due to an RSL fall, and (3 degrees) mangrove expansion onto the highest tidal flats since similar to 84 cal yr BP due to a relative sea-level rise. However, significant mangrove areas were converted to fish farming before 1984 CE. Spatial-temporal analysis also indicated a mangrove expansion since 1984 CE due to mangrove recolonization of shrimp farming areas previously deforested for pisciculture. This work mainly evidenced a trend of mangrove expansion due to RSL rise preceding the effects of anthropogenic emissions of CO2 in the atmosphere and the resilience of these forests in the face of anthropogenic interventions.

TI The Potential of Organic Sediments in Florida Spring Runs as Records of
   Environmental Change
SO SOUTHEASTERN GEOGRAPHER
AB The origin of modern spring flow in Florida is generally presumed to correspond with sea-level stabilization at or near present levels during the Middle Holocene. Low sea level and associated karstic aquifer drawdown have been assumed to have prevented artesian flow in current Florida spring systems throughout the Terminal Pleistocene. However, little paleoenvironmental work has been undertaken to test these assumptions. Substantial ecological changes within many of Florida's spring runs over the past two decades have raised interest in the use of sediment core analyses to characterize the nature, extent, timing, and potential triggers of these changes. We evaluated the extent and age of organic material accumulation in a broad sample of fifteen spring runs in central Florida. Radiocarbon dating of sediment cores indicated that many of these runs have accumulated organic material for thousands of years; five of the fifteen spring runs contain organic material that pre-dates Holocene sea-level stabilization. Therefore, either saturation or inundation of Florida's artesian spring runs was much more geographically and temporally variable than has been previously assumed. It is likely that paleoenvironmental reconstructions of those runs with lengthy sediment records will produce new knowledge about paleoclimate, paleobiology, and more recent ecological change.

TI Tectonic vs climatic control on the sequence development, examples from
   the Paleogene succession in the Eastern North Sea area
SO BULLETIN OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF DENMARK
AB A sequence stratigraphic subdivision of the upper Paleocene and the Oligocene is used to exemplify the influence of regional tectonism, local tectonism and climatic changes onto sedimentation in an epicontinental basin. The analysis shows that the low sedimentation rate and the condensed character of the Paleocene sediments disable any identification of climatic changes, whereas the Oligocene sequence boundaries are controlled by glacio-eustatic sea level changes. Regional tectonism played a major role in generating areas exposed for erosion located east of the present North Sea Basin. These exposed areas generated sand rich mass flows during the late Paleocene and generated the large amount of sediments which prograded into the Norwegian-Danish Basin during the Oligocene. Local tectonics controlled generation of topographic depressions ill the western part of the Norwegian-Danish Basin. The Subtle depressions controlled the location of the sand rich mass flow deposits both during the late Paleocene and the latest Oligocene.

TI Digitising historical sea level records in the Thames Estuary, UK
SO SCIENTIFIC DATA
AB London is one of the world's most important coastal cities and is located around the Thames Estuary, United Kingdom (UK). Quantifying changes in sea levels in the Thames Estuary over the 20th century and early part of the 21st century is vital to inform future management of flood risk in London. However, there are currently relatively few long, digital records of sea level available in the Thames. Here we present a new extensive sea level dataset that we have digitised from historical hand-written tabulated ledgers of high and low water, from the Port of London Authority (PLA). We captured 463 years of data, from across 15 tide gauge sites, for the period 1911 to 1995. When these historical datasets are combined with digital records available from the PLA since 1995, the sea level time-series span the 111-year period from 1911 to 2021. This new dataset will be of great importance for ongoing monitoring of mean sea-level rise, and changes in tidal range and extreme sea levels in the Thames Estuary.

TI Of marsh and mangrove: coupled biophysical and anthropogenic drivers of
   20th century wetland conversion in Tampa Bay Estuary, Florida (USA)
SO ANTHROPOCENE
AB Dense mangrove swamps currently dominate tidal wetlands of the Tampa Bay Estuary System on the central peninsular Gulf Coast of Florida (USA). Late-19th century Coast and Geodetic Survey topographical charts and Government Land Office surveys, however, depict wetland systems dominated by salt marsh-therefore suggesting mangrove dominance as a product of 20th century encroachment. To clarify the primary drivers of ecosystem change, this study integrates sedimentological, paleobotanical, and radiometric analyses of sediment cores collected in 2018 with analyses of aerial photography taken between 1940 and 1997. Results empirically ground truth the wetland conversions inferred through analytical comparisons of historical and modern mapping and establish a high-resolution chronology for coastal environmental change. These results showed that salt marsh and salt prairie habitats persisted within Tampa Bay study areas until the mid-20th century. Mangrove forest rapidly encroached the study areas over a 20 year interval, between 1960 and 1980, immediately following intensive ditching for mosquito control. The findings demonstrate how coastal geoengineering, mangrove autoecology, and sea-level rise interacted across the late-20th century to accelerate the creation of novel seascapes.

TI Projections at sea-level change in Hudson and James Bays, Canada, due to
   global warming
SO ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
AB The potential impact of global warming on sea-level rise in the Hudson Bay area was examined. Land-based ice melt and thermal expansion of ocean waters were compared to isostatic rebound rates. Thermal expansion was estimated using a one-dimensional analysis and a three-dimensional world ocean general circulation model. It was found that the combined impact on sea-level rise of land-based ice melt and thermal expansion of the world ocean was the same order of magnitude as the sea-level fall rates due to isostatic rebound. Thus, there is the possibility of a cessation or reversal of sea-level fall in the Hudson Bay area in the next 100 yr.

   Well-Being in an Era of Dynamic Climate Risk
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF PUBLIC HEALTH, VOL 42, 2021
SE Annual Review of Public Health
AB With accelerating climate change, US coastal communities are experiencing increased flood risk intensity, resulting from accelerated sea level rise and stronger storms. These conditions place pressure on municipalities and local residents to consider a range of new disaster risk reduction programs, climate resilience initiatives, and in some cases transformative adaptation strategies (e.g., managed retreat and relocation from highly vulnerable, low-elevation locations). Researchers have increasingly understood that these climate risks and adaptation actions have significant impacts on the quality of life, well-being, and mental health of urban coastal residents. We explore these relationships and define conditions under which adaptation practices will affect communities and residents. Specifically, we assess climate and environmental stressors, community change, and well-being by utilizing the growing climate change literature and the parallel social science literature on risk and hazards, environmental psychology, and urban geography work, heretofore not widely integrated into work on climate adaptation.

TI A scaling approach to project regional sea level rise and its
   uncertainties
SO EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS
AB Climate change causes global mean sea level to rise due to thermal expansion of seawater and loss of land ice from mountain glaciers, ice caps and ice sheets. Locally, sea level can strongly deviate from the global mean rise due to changes in wind and ocean currents. In addition, gravitational adjustments redistribute seawater away from shrinking ice masses. However, the land ice contribution to sea level rise (SLR) remains very challenging to model, and comprehensive regional sea level projections, which include appropriate gravitational adjustments, are still a nascent field (Katsman et al., 2011; Slangen et al., 2011). Here, we present an alternative approach to derive regional sea level changes for a range of emission and land ice melt scenarios, combining probabilistic forecasts of a simple climate model (MAG-ICC6) with the new CMIP5 general circulation models.
   The contribution from ice sheets varies considerably depending on the assumptions for the ice sheet projections, and thus represents sizeable uncertainties for future sea level rise. However, several consistent and robust patterns emerge from our analysis: at low latitudes, especially in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific, sea level will likely rise more than the global mean (mostly by 10-20 %). Around the northeastern Atlantic and the northeastern Pacific coasts, sea level will rise less than the global average or, in some rare cases, even fall. In the northwestern Atlantic, along the American coast, a strong dynamic sea level rise is counteracted by gravitational depression due to Greenland ice melt; whether sea level will be above-or below-average will depend on the relative contribution of these two factors. Our regional sea level projections and the diagnosed uncertainties provide an improved basis for coastal impact analysis and infrastructure planning for adaptation to climate change.

TI Cultural response to Middle Holocene sea-level fluctuations in eastern
   China: a multi-proxy approach
SO BOREAS
AB The Middle Holocene period witnessed significant environmental and cultural transitions regarding the deceleration of sea-level rise and the emergence of early agriculture, which profoundly moulded human-environment interactions in coastal regions. The Hemudu Culture (7000-5000 cal. a BP) is primarily distributed in eastern China coastal plains and marks a milestone in the origin of rice agriculture, and thus serves as an ideal case for examining these dramatic transitions. However, most existing studies have only focused on one particular aspect of the interactions amongst cultural evolution, subsistence strategies and sea-level fluctuations in the Yaojiang Valley, and comprehensive understanding of cultural responses to Middle Holocene sea-level fluctuations across the Ningshao Plain remains ambiguous. In this multi-proxy study, pollen, phytolith and diatom remains from a high-resolution profile of the Xiawangdu site (Hangzhou Bay, eastern China), along with a systematic collection of archaeological sites and radiocarbon dates for the Hemudu and Liangzhu cultures, were employed to assess human adaptation to the coastal environment. Coinciding with the cultural interruption between 6200 and 5600 cal. a BP, induced by Middle Holocene sea-level transgression, Hemudu Culture diffused from the Yaojiang Valley northward to the Zhoushan Islands and southward to the Ningbo Plain, e.g. the Xiawangdu site. The regional ecological environment has experienced an evolutionary sequence from marine transgression (6200-5600 cal. a BP), to coastal lagoon (5600-5300 cal. a BP), through to freshwater wetland (5300-4300 cal. a BP). Settlements of pile dwellings and terraces were constructed to adapt to the hydrological transition from coastal lagoon to freshwater wetland around 5300 cal. a BP. In addition, evidence of both rice phytoliths and Poaceae pollen suggests that rice had already been domesticated by 5600 cal. a BP. Thus, the dispersal, settlement and subsistence of Hemudu Culture in the coastal lowlands of eastern China were largely dependent upon sea-level fluctuations.

TI Episodic coastal dune development in the Taean Peninsula and Anmyeon
   Island, Korea, during the mid to late Holocene
SO JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE
AB The episodic nature of coastal dune development has been widely identified in many dune areas over the world. What causes such episodicity is still hotly debated. Sea-level change, climatic change and human impact have widely been reported as the main forcings, though there is no agreement yet upon which factors are critical. This research provides some evidence that sea-level fluctuation and climatic factors controlled the episodic dune building together, based upon optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dune ages on the west coast of Korea. The newly obtained and published OSL dune ages on the west coast of the Taean Peninsula and Anmyeon island, Korea, indicate the six main periods of dune building: 5.5, 4.3, 1.5, 1.3, 1.1 and 0.7 ka. They correlate with evidence of colder climate in East Asia that imply stronger dune-forming winds during the winter under the influence of a more intense Siberian High. They also correlate with periods of higher sea level over the present one with fluctuations. Thus, episodic dune activity along the west coast of the Korean Peninsula during the mid to late Holocene appears to be linked to stronger winter winds capable of moving sand from the beach to the foredune ridges with short-term fluctuations during the high stands.

TI Dead land walking: the value of continued conservation efforts in South
   Florida's imperiled pine rocklands
SO BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB Pine rocklands are deeply imperiled habitats restricted to South Florida and the Caribbean. In South Florida, more than 98% of pine rockland habitat has been destroyed in the past century (outside of Everglades National Park). Due to their proximity to human populations, management options in the remaining fragments are sometimes limited, and fires that are necessary to maintain healthy habitat structure are often excluded. Despite these pressures, conservation initiatives in pine rocklands have been surprisingly successful, and plant extinction has been avoided. In the coming decades, however, sea-level rise threatens to all but eliminate the pine rocklands, and efforts to preserve their many endemic species will likely fail. We synthesize the results of numerous ecological studies and review the successes and failures of conservation in South Florida's pine rocklands. Further, we illustrate the value of continued conservation efforts, and provide direction in the light of the habitats long-term fate. We advocate the increased use of prescribed fire and, as the effects of climate change become more apparent, the translocation of some endemic species. Finally, we acclaim pine rocklands as a model system for studying how plant communities respond to environmental change. South Florida's fragmented landscape, with shifting gradients of elevation, salinity, inundation and nutrient availability, should continue to inspire ecologists to address important questions, and better prepare the region, and the world, for the challenges of the coming decades.

TI Spatial and temporal ways of knowing sea level rise: Bringing together
   multiple perspectives
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE
AB Sea level rise presents risks to ecosystems, populations, and infrastructure in low-lying areas. This article considers diverse ways of knowing, understanding, and experiencing these risks. It explores differences and connections between knowledge produced through the technological methods of scientific research and that which emerges through the experiences and insights of local people. For example, while scientific assessments measure and forecast, among other things, the height and rate of vertical change in the sea level using instruments such as tide gauges and radar-firing satellites, for local populations sea level rise is largely perceived and knowable through everyday processes and lived experiences of coastal changes as sea waters encroach onto the land. The review article reveals this diversity of knowledge and how it is produced. It considers how these different forms of knowledge might coalesce in ways that can more effectively inform understandings of, and responses to, the varied effects of sea level rise. Focusing specifically on spatial and temporal understandings of sea level rise-as the vertical rise of sea levels and inward encroachment of sea water, and timescales from the everyday to the decadal and centennial-this article concludes by arguing for the importance of integrating scientific measurement and modeling with local knowledge. It suggests that local and Indigenous knowledge should not merely represent an enrichment of scientific facts, but rather that bringing together local/Indigenous and scientific knowledge can provide significant ways of knowing and sensing the world that can build the resilience of social-ecological systems.

TI Assessing future risk: quantifying the effects of sea level rise on
   storm surge risk for the southern shores of Long Island, New York
SO NATURAL HAZARDS
AB Sea level rise threatens to increase the impacts of future storms and hurricanes on coastal communities. However, many coastal hazard mitigation plans do not consider sea level rise when assessing storm surge risk. Here we apply a GIS-based approach to quantify potential changes in storm surge risk due to sea level rise on Long Island, New York. We demonstrate a method for combining hazard exposure and community vulnerability to spatially characterize risk for both present and future sea level conditions using commonly available national data sets. Our results show that sea level rise will likely increase risk in many coastal areas and will potentially create risk where it was not before. We find that even modest and probable sea level rise (.5 m by 2080) vastly increases the numbers of people (47% increase) and property loss (73% increase) impacted by storm surge. In addition, the resulting maps of hazard exposure and community vulnerability provide a clear and useful example of the visual representation of the spatial distribution of the components of risk that can be helpful for developing targeted hazard mitigation and climate change adaptation strategies. Our results suggest that coastal agencies tasked with managing storm surge risk must consider the effects of sea level rise if they are to ensure safe and sustainable coastal communities in the future.

TI Ecosystem Resilience and Threshold Response in the Galapagos Coastal
   Zone
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides a conservative estimate on rates of sea-level rise of 3.8 mm yr(-1) at the end of the 21(st) century, which may have a detrimental effect on ecologically important mangrove ecosystems. Understanding factors influencing the long-term resilience of these communities is critical but poorly understood. We investigate ecological resilience in a coastal mangrove community from the Galapagos Islands over the last 2700 years using three research questions: What are the 'fast and slow' processes operating in the coastal zone? Is there evidence for a threshold response? How can the past inform us about the resilience of the modern system?
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Palaeoecological methods (AMS radiocarbon dating, stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13)) were used to reconstruct sedimentation rates and ecological change over the past 2,700 years at Diablas lagoon, Isabela, Galapagos. Bulk geochemical analysis was also used to determine local environmental changes, and salinity was reconstructed using a diatom transfer function. Changes in relative sea level (RSL) were estimated using a glacio-isostatic adjustment model. Non-linear behaviour was observed in the Diablas mangrove ecosystem as it responded to increased salinities following exposure to tidal inundations. A negative feedback was observed which enabled the mangrove canopy to accrete vertically, but disturbances may have opened up the canopy and contributed to an erosion of resilience over time. A combination of drier climatic conditions and a slight fall in RSL then resulted in a threshold response, from a mangrove community to a microbial mat.
   Conclusions/Significance: Palaeoecological records can provide important information on the nature of non-linear behaviour by identifying thresholds within ecological systems, and in outlining responses to 'fast' and 'slow' environmental change between alternative stable states. This study highlights the need to incorporate a long-term ecological perspective when designing strategies for maximizing coastal resilience.

TI Implications of sea-level rise and extreme events around Europe: a
   review of coastal energy infrastructure
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
AB Sea-level rise and extreme events have the potential to significantly impact coastal energy infrastructure through flooding and erosion. Disruptions to supply, transportation and storage of energy have global ramifications and potential contamination of the natural environment. On a European scale, there is limited information about energy facilities and their strategic plans for adapting to climate change. Using a Geographical Information System this paper assesses coastal energy infrastructure, comprising (1) oil/gas/LNG/tanker terminals and (2) nuclear power stations. It discusses planning and adaptation for sea-level rise and extreme events. Results indicate 158 major oil/gas/LNG/tanker terminals in the European coastal zone, with 40 % located on the North Sea coast. There are 71 operating nuclear reactors on the coast (37 % of the total of European coastal countries), with further locations planned in the Black, Mediterranean and Baltic Seas. The UK has three times more coastal energy facilities than any other country. Many north-west European countries who have a high reliance on coastal energy infrastructure have a high awareness of sea-level rise and plan for future change. With long design lives of energy facilities, anticipating short, medium and long-term environmental and climatic change is crucial in the design, future monitoring and maintenance of facilities. Adaptation of coastal infrastructure is of international importance, so will be an ongoing important issue throughout the 21(st) century.

TI Diatom-based paleoenvironmental reconstruction from the coast of
   Northern Patagonia, Argentina
SO JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
AB Estuaries and deltas are common along modern coasts and are well represented in the geologic record because of the high preservation of their deposits. Worldwide, estuaries are more abundant than deltas because of the relatively short time available for Holocene coastal sedimentation due to sea level variations. The evolution of estuaries and deltas during the recent geological past can be reliably reconstructed. Among others, paleostudies in estuaries aim to reconstruct sea level and freshwater input variations, and the timing and frequency of extreme events (e.g., tsunamis). A significant number of studies have been published in the past 20 years, which used preserved remains of microorganisms accumulated during long intervals in sediments. The preserved record of fossil remains evidences the response of microorganisms to environmental changes at the time of their deposition. Among the proxies preserved in sediments, diatoms are one of the most reliable bioindicators to trace environmental changes. Due to rapid reproduction rate under favourable conditions and their siliceous frustule, they are abundant in recent and older sediments from estuaries and deltas. In this manuscript, results from previous studies were reviewed, integrated and statistically analyzed with the aim to reconstruct Holocene coastal changes in relation to sea level curves. These studies were conducted along a latitudinal transect on four estuarine mesotidal systems from Northern Patagonia, Argentina: Colorado River delta (39 degrees 40 ' S; 62 degrees 08 ' W), San Blas Bay (40 degrees 33 ' S; 62 degrees 13 ' W), Negro River (40 degrees 57 ' S; 62 degrees 49 ' W) and Chubut River estuaries (43 degrees 22 ' S; 65 degrees 03 ' W). The focus is on the preserved diatom assemblages and the paleoecological information they represent. Seven coastal sedimentary cores were correlated. Based on multivariate analysis (NMDS), fossil and modern diatom assemblages were integrated and compared. These estuary systems are dominated by littoral drift, where the plains became flooded by the sea about 7000 14C years BP ago. When the sea transgression occupied the area, Colorado delta and San Blas Bay evolved from tidal channels flooded to tidal flats, sand flats and marshes during the late Holocene regression. At Colorado River, the gradually increase of the fluvial influence is associated with the eastward progradation of the deltaic lobe during the last ca. 7000 14C years BP. At the Negro River estuary, a shallow vegetated brackish/freshwater environment evolved into marine conditions, tidal channels and marshes during the last 2000 14C years BP. A marine coastal environment (estuary) at ca. 4400 14C years BP that evolved into a salt marsh was inferred at the inlet of the Chubut River. Diatom salinity-preferences showed how connections between the wetland and the sea varied over time with sea level changes and gradual infilling. Diatominferred paleoenvironments and radiocarbon dates allowed reconstruction of the coastline position to the east in the Early Holocene and to the west during transgressive-regressive events.

TI Potential for bias in 21st century semiempirical sea level projections
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
AB We examine the limitations of a semiempirical model characterized by a sea level projection of 73 cm with RCP4.5 scenario by 2100. Calibrating the model with data to 1990 and then simulating the period 1993-2009 produces sea level in close agreement with acceleration in sea level rise observed by satellite altimetry. Nonradiative forcing contributors, such as long-term adjustment of Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets since Last Glacial Maximum, abyssal ocean warming, and terrestrial water storage, may bias model calibration which, if corrected for, tend to reduce median sea level projections at 2100 by 2-10 cm, though this is within the confidence interval. We apply the semiempirical approach to simulate individual contributions from thermal expansion and small glacier melting. Steric sea level projections agree within 3 cm of output from process-based climate models. In contrast, semiempirical simulation of melting from glaciers is 26 cm, which is twice large as estimates from some process-based models; however, all process models lack simulation of calving, which likely accounts for 50% of small glacier mass loss worldwide. Furthermore, we suggest that changes in surface mass balance and dynamics of Greenland ice sheet made contributions to the sea level rise in the early 20th century and therefore are included within the semiempirical model calibration period and hence are included in semiempirical sea level projections by 2100. Antarctic response is probably absent from semiempirical models, which will lead to a underestimate in sea level rise if, as is probable, Antarctica loses mass by 2100.

TI Late Triassic to Early Jurassic palaeogeography and eustatic history in
   the NW Tethyan realm: New insights from sedimentary and organic facies
   of the Csovar Basin (Hungary)
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB Sedimentary and organic facies of a continuous Late Triassic-Early Jurassic toe-of-slope to basin succession of the NE Transdanubian Range (N Hungary) was studied in order to reconstruct the palaeogeographical and eustatic evolution of the Csovar Basin, an intraplatform basin of the NW Neotethys margin. Characteristic facies successions point to sea-level changes of different hierarchies. Cyclic patterns, inferred to result from orbital eccentricity forcing, are also reflected in the stratigraphical distribution of sedimentary organic matter. Furthermore, both palaeontological and isotope data document drastic climatic changes around the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. Detecting sea-level changes leads to a more accurate interpretation of the Late Triassic palaeogeographic setting and evolution of the Transdanubian Range's carbonate platform. Our integrated sedimentological and palynological data suggest a complex topography and dynamic sea-level history, which contradicts a previous model of broad, uniform platform setting and lack of any major drowning and emersion events during the Late Triassic.

TI Holocene environmental changes on the east coast of Korea
SO JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY
AB We present a record of Holocene environmental change on the east coast of Korea, inferred using pollen, carbon-isotopic composition (delta C-13), total organic carbon, total sulfur, carbon/nitrogen ratios, particle size analysis and major element geochemistry in a sediment core from Soonpogae Lagoon. A multi-proxy paleoenvironmental approach had not previously been applied in Korea and allowed us to reconstruct climate and vegetation change, sea-level rise, lagoon development, and human impact on the east coast of Korea over the last 8,000 years. Evidence from Soonpogae Lagoon supports the following three conclusions: (1) As a drying trend prevailed on the east coast of Korea after similar to 5,900 cal yr BP, chemical weathering weakened and herbaceous plants became more important than during the previous humid phase (Holocene Climate Optimum), (2) Sea-level rise on the east coast slowed dramatically about 6,800 cal yr BP, resulting in low rates of sedimentation in Soonpogae Lagoon, and (3) Soonpogae Lagoon was almost completely isolated from the sea by sand barriers when human impact intensified similar to 2,100 BP.

TI Palynological evidence for Early to Mid-Holocene sea-level fluctuations
   over the present-day Ningshao Coastal Plain in eastern China
SO MARINE GEOLOGY
AB Sea-level fluctuation in a coastal plain setting was crucial for Neolithic human occupations of the Ningshao Coastal Plain in eastern China. In this study, we carry out analyses using detailed palynological records of dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts), freshwater algae and foraminiferal organic linings from two sediment cores (HMD1501 and HMD1502) at the Tianluoshan archaeological site, Zhejiang Province, eastern China. Brief sea-level fluctuations and environmental changes on the Ningshao Coastal Plain during the Early to Mid-Holocene were recovered by using radiocarbon chronology. The results show the Tianluoshan site underwent marine transgression processes, and experienced warm and humid climatic conditions during the ca. 10, 7085850 cal. yr BP. After that, there was a relatively cold and dry climate, marine regression processes occurred at the Tianluoshan site during the ca. 5850-5655 cal. yr BP, indicated by an abrupt increase in the cold-water species of dinoflagellates (especially O. centrocarpum), freshwater algae concentration and the ratio of pollen to dinoflagellates (P/D), with an abrupt decrease appeared in foraminifer linings concentration. Marine regression processes provided an opportunity for Hemudu ancestors to enter the Tianluoshan site, which helped create a brilliant Hemudu-Tianluoshan Culture on the Ningshao Coastal Plain.

AB An effort has been made to assemble a data set on the evolution of coastal morphology of the West Iberian Continental Margin in Portugal, which has occur-red since the Last Glacial Maximum. In this integrated review a particular attention was given to the analyses of coastline shaping phenomena on different time scales. Several overlapping processes such as shore erosion, local sediment supply rate, climatic changes, anthropic impacts and mean sea level rise (MSLR) were identified and their combined effects assessed. The eustatic see level rise appears as a principal factor in shaping the shore line contour until mid Holocene. Since then, the non eustatic factors namely the terrigenous sediment supply rate and the dynamics of barriers and spits systems became dominant in the evolution of the near shore morphology. Since the 15th century AD, the anthropogenic activities, namely deforestation and land cultivation contributed decisively to the positive sedimentary balance in the Portuguese coastal zone. Finally, the multiple damming of the major rivers in 20th century and exploitation of sand and gravel from the river beds led to the sediment starving of the coastal zone and generalized shore line retreat.

TI Holocene Elevated Sea Levels on the North Coast of Vietnam
SO AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHICAL STUDIES
AB We present evidence of elevated Holocene sea levels on the north coast of Vietnam, comprising radiocarbon dating of raised coastal geomorphological and palaeobiological features at localities on the margins of the Bac Bo (Red River) Plain. This evidence indicates that by ca. 5500 cal yr B. P. mid-tide lay approximately 5.4 m above national datum, that is 3.25 m above present local mid-tide. By c. 3500 cal yr B. P., sea level was lowering and, by ca. 2000 cal yr B. P., mid-tide lay at or above 1.5 m above present local mid-tide. It is not yet possible to infer patterns of sea-level fluctuation other than an overall lowering of elevation, although the separation of the raised and modern erosion notches does suggest two dominant mid to late Holocene periods of erosion - probably periods of sea-level still-stand or relatively slow sea-level change. The intervening period of relatively rapid sea-level change and associated reduced erosion probably dates to after ca. 2000 cal yr B.P..

TI Review on the Relative Sea-level Changes in the Yellow Sea during the
   Late Holocene
SO ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY
AB In this paper, we review previous studies on the relative sea-level changes in the Yellow Sea during the Holocene to comprehensive understand the various research results. Currently, it is reported two theories : 1) the Holocene sea-level has never been higher than the present-day level; and 2) sea-level have reached highstand during midHolocene, followed by slow lowering to that of the present. The first theory yields a curve that is similar to a climate-change-related eustatic sea-level curve. However, in reality, most of the relative sea-level fluctuation resulted from land uplift or subsidence. The second theory yields a curve that is fairly coincident with a relative sea-level curve indicative of continental margins being located away from the ice sheets(i.e., far-field), and is considered as an effect of GIA(Glacio Isostatic Adjustment) and gravitational attraction. Based on detailed review of previous researches, we realized that they sourced the same papers, but obtained different results because they selectively chose and added the data. The data used to derive the second theory pertain to the northern Gunsan region, which is located within the western area of the Chugaryeong fault. Thus, we believe that the sea-level curve for the second theory is only representative of the area north of Gunsan, which is subject to GIA and tectonic deformation. Although the relative sea-level curve for the west coastal area is comparable to that for the far-field continental margin region, it is necessary to evaluate local tectonic activities as suggested by active seismicity in the west coastal area and the more than 400 faults currently existing in on the Korean Peninsula.

TI Preliminary identification of key coral species from New Caledonia
   (Southwest Pacific Ocean), their significance to reef formation, and
   responses to environmental change
SO ISLAND ARC
AB The recognition of key coral species (KCS) in the geological record, i.e. those that contribute to reef formation and maintenance of coral reef ecosystems, is important for understanding the development and evolution of reef ecosystems and for forecasting their responses to climate change and anthropogenic impacts in the near future. This study examined the contribution to reef formation and maintenance of KCS from Pleistocene and Holocene barrier reefs in New Caledonia, based on analyses of six cores retrieved from three different reefs: Islets Kendec, Amedee, and Bayes. Our results indicate that at least 19 genera and 33 species of corals contributed to reef formation and maintenance during the Holocene in New Caledonia. Among them, Goniastrea retiformis, Isopora palifera, Dipsastraea pallida/speciosa complex, corymbose Acropora sp., massive Porites sp., and encrusting Porites sp. were KCS during the Holocene. This observation suggests that KCS will potentially contribute to the formation and persistence of reefs in the near future under conditions of estimated global sea-level rise of 0.2-0.6m/100 years. However, the distributions and abundances of these species are currently decreasing. This study emphasizes the need for further research on the restoration and conservation of potential KCS.

Current evidence is reviewed for the timing of the arrival of humans along PEP II, their subsequent expansion through the region and their concurrent development or acquisition of increasingly sophisticated technologies for resource exploitation. Particular emphasis is placed on assessing the role of environmental change in the observed trajectories of human dispersal and technological development. It is concluded that rapid environmental change events may have influenced at least some of these trajectories. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

TI Simulation of Sea Level Rise and its Impacts on the Western Coastal Area
   of Saudi Arabia
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES
AB Climate change has always been one of the most detailed issues of the environment and will remain so in the coming decades. Among the impacts of the climate change are the global warming that will lead to increased temperature and Sea Level Rise. Rising sea level inundates low relief coastal areas, causes server damages including shorelines erosion, and increases the salinity of shallow bays. Mediterranean countries are principally exposed to sea level rise due to their long offshore lines. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is one of the most vulnerable country with large coastal in the region. Sea Level Rise is one of the most perceptible changes induced by the global warming and climate change. Coastal areas and islands are always sensitive to the climatic changes variation especially in arid and semi-arid environments where temperature is the keystone element of sea level rising. Western coast of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia contains mountainous relief at the southern part and plain relief at the northern part considering city of Jeddah the midpoint. Northern coastal areas characterized by plain and low relief are considered to be extremely endangered in response to sea level rise. Potential Sea Level Rise hazards are numerous and involves both of human populations and natural resources. Results achieved during the current study expressed that the designated study area is extremely sensitive to sea level variations.

TI Projected land ice contributions to twenty-first-century sea level rise
SO NATURE
AB Efficient statistical emulation of melting land ice under various climate scenarios to 2100 indicates a contribution from melting land ice to sea level increase of at least 13 centimetres sea level equivalent.
   The land ice contribution to global mean sea level rise has not yet been predicted(1) using ice sheet and glacier models for the latest set of socio-economic scenarios, nor using coordinated exploration of uncertainties arising from the various computer models involved. Two recent international projects generated a large suite of projections using multiple models(2-8), but primarily used previous-generation scenarios(9) and climate models(10), and could not fully explore known uncertainties. Here we estimate probability distributions for these projections under the new scenarios(11,12) using statistical emulation of the ice sheet and glacier models. We find that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius would halve the land ice contribution to twenty-first-century sea level rise, relative to current emissions pledges. The median decreases from 25 to 13 centimetres sea level equivalent (SLE) by 2100, with glaciers responsible for half the sea level contribution. The projected Antarctic contribution does not show a clear response to the emissions scenario, owing to uncertainties in the competing processes of increasing ice loss and snowfall accumulation in a warming climate. However, under risk-averse (pessimistic) assumptions, Antarctic ice loss could be five times higher, increasing the median land ice contribution to 42 centimetres SLE under current policies and pledges, with the 95th percentile projection exceeding half a metre even under 1.5 degrees Celsius warming. This would severely limit the possibility of mitigating future coastal flooding. Given this large range (between 13 centimetres SLE using the main projections under 1.5 degrees Celsius warming and 42 centimetres SLE using risk-averse projections under current pledges), adaptation planning for twenty-first-century sea level rise must account for a factor-of-three uncertainty in the land ice contribution until climate policies and the Antarctic response are further constrained.

TI SEA-LEVEL TRENDS AND PHYSICAL CONSEQUENCES - APPLICATIONS TO THE
   UNITED-STATES SHORE
SO EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB As our knowledge of the potential for future global warming increases, our understanding of the imminent dangers associated with continued, possibly accelerated, sea-level rise increases. Several independent research groups have predicted future sea-level rise on the order of 15 to 50 cm by the middle of next century, and between 30 and 110 cm by 2100. Considering the concentration of coastal populations, and dollar value of industries and developments, these increases in mean sea level pose significant hazards. A linkage exists between sea-level history and climate history, but research has demonstrated that sea level is controlled by a complex interaction of geologic, hydrologic and climatologic factors. Because of insufficient data describing global-scale hydrological phenomena, we lack understanding of the components of sea-level change. Present estimates of the various contributions to trends in sea level do not agree with physical measurements of sea-level history. This hampers our ability to make accurate predictions of sea-level behavior. Sea-level rise implies the future threat of accelerated coastal erosion, increased frequency and severity of structural damage resulting from storms which make landfall, salinization of groundwater resources and estuarine and other aquatic ecosystems, destruction of coastal wetlands leading to severe impacts on coastal marine biologic communities, and significant damage to the infrastructure of coastal cities and other population centers. Federally sponsored study groups have completed a series of specific recommendations dealing with the threat of sea-level rise and appropriate responses by parties concerned with the coastal zone. These describe a policy of planned retreat from the coast on a schedule dictated by natural events and processes. The Federal Emergency Management Agency would delineate coastal hazard zones and provide appropriate planning policies governing future development. Compliance with hazard zone standards would determine landowner participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. Federal, state, local and private interests in coastal lands should respond to the threat of sea-level rise and coastal erosion with innovative land management policies and practices that encourage the establishment of coastal high-risk zones and conversion of these lands to low-risk usage.

TI Teleconnection between the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation
   and Sea Level in the Mediterranean Sea
SO JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
AB The Mediterranean Sea can be viewed as a "barometer'' of the North Atlantic Ocean, because its sea level responds to oceanic-gyre-scale changes in atmospheric pressure and wind forcing, related to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The climate of the North Atlantic is influenced by the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) as it transports heat from the South Atlantic toward the subpolar North Atlantic. This study reports on a teleconnection between the AMOC transport measured at 26.58N and the Mediterranean Sea level during 2004-17: a reduced/increased AMOC transport is associated with a higher/lower sea level in the Mediterranean. Processes responsible for this teleconnection are analyzed in detail using available satellite and in situ observations and an atmospheric reanalysis. First, it is shown that onmonthly to interannual time scales theAMOC and sea level are both driven by similar NAO-like atmospheric circulation patterns. During a positive/negative NAO state, stronger/weaker trade winds (i) drive northward/southward anomalies of Ekman transport across 26.58N that directly affect the AMOC and (ii) are associated with westward/eastward winds over the Strait of Gibraltar that force water to flow out of/into theMediterranean Sea and thus change its average sea level. Second, it is demonstrated that interannual changes in theAMOC transport can lead to thermosteric sea level anomalies near the North Atlantic eastern boundary. These anomalies can (i) reach the Strait of Gibraltar and cause sea level changes in the Mediterranean Sea and (ii) represent a mechanism for negative feedback on the AMOC.

AB The relationship between environmental variation and subsistence practices is a central point of discussion in much Oceanic archaeology. While human predation can significantly reduce prey populations, environmental variation also contributes to reductions in prey abundance, possibly leading to increased human competition and resource scarcity. At the Natia Beach site, Nacula Island, Fiji, geoarchaeological evidence suggests that coastal progradation began soon after initial occupation of the coastal plain. Additionally, at approximately 650 BP a marked increase in clay and silt deposition occurred. Changes in coastal geomorphology may be explained by landscape response to regional Mid-Holocene sea level fall combined with human induced soil erosion due to upland settlement. Smaller scale environmental changes associated with climate variability may have also played a role. Additionally, landscape change appears to have had a measurable impact on local nearshore mollusks that are sensitive to high levels of water turbidity. Minor evidence of human exploitation is observable in this shellfish assemblage, although changes in predation pressure may have allowed shellfish populations to recover. Increased ceramic diversity and fortified settlements also appear at approximately 650 BP on Nacula and other parts of Fiji. The suite of changes at Natia may be explained by processes of regional and local environmental changes, and human adaptation in terms of subsistence, spatial organization, and competition.

TI Climatic change over the mediterranean and links to the more general
   atmospheric circulation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
AB The marine climate over the Mediterranean Sea has been examined for the winter and summer seasons over the period 1946-1987. Little change was found in the winter over this period, apart from some evidence of a decline in the strength of the surface circulation. However, the summer months have seen a general rise in atmospheric pressure over the basin, with strengthening north- westerly winds in the eastern Mediterranean. Changes in the eastern and western basin are frequently out-of-phase because different processes tend to affect the climates of the two basins. These changes have been validated by analysis of the climate at land-based stations around the periphery of the Mediterranean. Combining the marine and terrestrial analyses shows possible links between climate in the eastern Mediterranean, changes in the intensity of the South Asian Monsoon (via reorientation of the summer-time trough over the Middle East), and climatic change over sub-Saharan Africa.

TI Periodic-cyclic and chaotic successions of Upper Cretaceous (Cenomanian
   to Campanian) pelagic sediments in the North German Basin
SO CRETACEOUS RESEARCH
AB High resolution time series analyses (wavelet transform and power spectra) of Self-Potential logging data were used to detect unconformities, periodic-cyclic and chaotic successions in Upper Cretaceous pelagic sediments and to illustrate the stratigraphic position of dominant periodic cyclicity. Results of statistical analyses were compared to tectonic activity as well as climatic and sea-level changes in the North German Basin. The accumulation rates of the investigated sections fluctuate from 10-120 m/my with highest rates indicated for the Campanian. Two major sea-level cycles encompassing the Albian to Coniacian and Santonian to Maastrichtian controlled the stratigraphic position of the periodic-cyclic units (stable systems). During the highest sea level in the Middle Turonian, the sedimentation of the Stable System A was almost continuously about 0.5 my in the entire basin with accumulation rates of about 45-50 m/my. In the Stable System B, orbitally-forced climatic changes in the Milankovitch spectra may have been responsible for periodic cyclicity during an early Late Campanian interval of about 2 my. Chaotic (aperiodic) accumulation occurred during relative sea-level lowstands and transgressions during the Cenomanian, Coniacian and Santonian. The boundaries between the chaotic and periodic-cyclic succession are readily correlated in all investigated sections and mostly correspond to sequence boundaries. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.

TI How much and how fast will global sea level rise?
SO BULLETIN OF THE ATOMIC SCIENTISTS
AB The basic physics of how global warming contributes to sea-level rise has long been understood, but new research gives us a clearer picture of what to expect. Prior to the 1990s, most sea-level rise was attributed to melting glaciers and the thermal expansion of warming ocean waters. However, ice sheets such as those covering Greenland and Antarctica have also begun to melt and play a significant role in raising ocean levels. The author reviews the results of a number of recent studies. Two of them conclude that the seas could rise by 3 or more feet by the year 2100, and one argued that 5 feet or more by 2100 is a possibility. Exactly what happens, and when, will be influenced by the degree to which humans reduce carbon emissions, and the uncertain dynamics of the Antarctic ice sheet. Considerable sea-level rise will occur as a consequence of the global warming humans have already caused.

TI Environmental change and fishery management in the northern Persian Gulf
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB Approximately 52% of the 380,000 tons of fish landings in Iran come from the northern Persian Gulf, with a total of 108,000 fishermen and 8900 fishing vessels (2003 data). The fishery in the region is very important for the local economy, but the major problems facing the Iranian fisheries are an uncertain availability of fish and over-fishing. The Persian Gulf is a sensitive marine ecosystem. The Gulf is a partially enclosed sea with an average depth of 35 metres and replacement of waters take some three to five years. Environmental factors have a major effect on fish stocks and fisheries in such a sensitive ecosystem. This study examines the influence of environmental changes in water temperature, rainfall, wind and sea level pressure on fish stocks in the northern Persian Gulf and estimates the maximum sustainable yields for fisheries management. Multivariate data and surplus production bio-economic models with environmental parameters are used to determine optimal harvest and forecasting. The study found that rainfall, water temperature and wind had significant positive effects whereas sea level pressure had a negative effect on the fisheries in the northern Persian Gulf. It is concluded that environmental parameters should be monitored concurrently with the fisheries to allow a greater understanding for fisheries management in the Persian Gulf.

TI Paleolimnological evidence of holocene climatic changes in Lake Blanca,
   southern Uruguay
SO JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY
AB Paleolimnological data are presented on Holocene climatic changes in Lake Blanca, a small (0.6 km(2)), coastal fresh waterbody in southern Uruguay. Using a sediment core that extended to 7,300 year BP, analyses of pooid, panicoid and chloridoid phytoliths (Poaceae) allowed us to identify 16 Opal Phytoliths Association Zones (OPAZ). Both temperature and humidity indices were calculated from relative percentages of opal phytoliths and the climatic trends were inferred. During the early Holocene, prior to the first Holocene marine transgression (similar to 8,000-7,000 yr BP), cool-arid climatic conditions were inferred. After the first Holocene transgression, predominance of cool-humid conditions was registered until about 4,000 yr BP. A transition from cool-semiarid/arid to alternate warm-temperate and humid-very-humid conditions was detected for similar to 4,000-1,000 yr BP. Increases in trophic state were observed because of such a climatic amelioration. After similar to 1,000 yr BP, a shift from warm to temperate and cool temperatures was inferred. Such a cooling episode was assigned to a "LIA" which took place by the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century. A decrease in trophic state was observed during this climatic deterioration. After such a little ice age, present temperate humid conditions were established. The humidity indices calculated from relative percentages of opal phytoliths for the last similar to 70 years were compared to annual rainfall data. Such a comparison showed that opal phytoliths are reliable indicators of humidity.

Primarily due to ocean thermal expansion and transfer from land ice (glaciers, ice sheets) to the ocean, sea-level rise is therefore an integrated indicator of climate change. Coastal zones and communities are expected to be increasingly threatened by sea level changes, with various adverse and widespread impacts. The European Union's Earth Observation Programmed, Copernicus, monitors our planet and its environment, for the ultimate benefit of society. This includes the monitoring of sea level changes and the provision of ancillary fields needed to assess sea-level rise coastal risks, to guide adaptation and to support related policies and directives. Copernicus is organized with a space component, including dedicated Earth Observation satellites (Sentinel missions), and services, which transform the wealth of satellite, in situ and integrated numerical model information into added-value datasets and information usable by scientists, managers and decision-makers, and the wider public. Here, an overview of the Copernicus products and services to inform on sea level rise adaptation is provided. Perspectives from Copernicus services on future evolutions to better inform on coastal sea level rise, associated risks, and support adaptation are also discussed.

TI NUTRIENT-GRADIENT CONTROLS ON DEVONIAN REEFS: INSIGHT FROM THE
   RAMP-SITUATED ALEXANDRA REEF SYSTEM (FRASNIAN), NORTHWEST TERRITORIES,
   CANADA
SO CONTROLS ON CARBONATE PLATFORM AND REEF DEVELOPMENT
SE Society for Sedimentary Geology Special Publication
CT AAPG-SEPM Conference 2005 held in Honor of Wolfgang Schlager
CY MAY, 2005
CL Calgary, CANADA
AB Devonian reef systems are thought to represent the greatest phase of global reef development in the Phanerozoic. Despite this, ecological and environmental controls on the sedimentary nature of these vast systems have scarcely been investigated and remain enigmatic. The Late Devonian (Frasnian) Alexandra Reef System, exposed in the Northwest Territories of Canada, developed on a ramp that Was Situated on the western margin of Laurussia. The system consists of two reef complexes. The second reef complex developed basinwards of the first after sea level fell similar to 17 m. In contrast to stromatoporoid (+/- coral)-dominated reef facies in the first reef complex and the upper part of the second reef complex, reef facies in the lower part of the second reef complex are dominated stromatoporoid-microbe associations. These include significant renalcid bound stone and stromatolite accumulations that are lot found elsewhere in the reef system. It is concluded that the occurrence of the stromatoporoid-microbe reef facies indicates that a shift in the reef environment from oligotrophic to mesotrophic conditions took place. The mechanisms of nutrification were linked to the platform geometry, sea-level position, and oceanographic system, indicating that on carbonate ramps, systems tracts of falling sea level (forced regression)and sea-level low stand may be particularly Susceptible to nutrification. A nutrient-gradient model developed to explain different types of reef facies in the Alexandra Reef System indicates that trophic resources were an important control on the composition of Devonian reef-building communities, and that Devonian reefs and carbonate platforms were not highly Susceptible to nutrient-invoked drowning.

TI A Deep-Time Perspective of Land-Ocean Linkages in the Sedimentary Record
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF MARINE SCIENCE, VOL 5
SE Annual Review of Marine Science
AB It is increasingly important to understand and predict how marine environments respond to changes in climate and sea level and to variability in sediment flux from rivers. The dynamics of these factors occur over several orders of temporal magnitude and, under favorable geologic conditions, contribute to long-lived sediment accumulation. Thus, stratigraphic successions along continental margins are archives of these environmental changes and can be used to reconstruct land-ocean linkages, which provide important context for shorter-term and future modifications to this critical zone. Here, we discuss an integrated approach to the analysis of deep-time sediment archives (>10(6) years) that considers the entire system, from eroding catchments where sediment is produced to subsiding basins where sediment accumulates. This holistic approach is presented within the framework of fundamental concepts about sedimentary-basin analysis and stratigraphic characterization through a combination of foundational literature and studies that represent the state of the art.

TI Establishing Vertical Separation Models for Vulnerable Coastlines in
   Developing Territories
SO MARINE GEODESY
AB Vertical separation models are valuable for coastal zone management and protection against the effects of climate change. To date, the development of such models has been undertaken in areas where long-term sea level measurements exist and there are resources for extensive offshore bathymetric and Global Navigation Satellite Systems surveys. Many small island developing states and other resource constrained territories host vulnerable coastal zones and would benefit from such models, however, financial constraints and data sparsity make it difficult. This article describes the establishment of a vertical separation model using an amalgamation of long- and short-term sea level measurements with hydrodynamic modeling. With existing vertical separations at only two coastal points for comparison, the model was designed to include a tidal prediction element which allowed for validation against sparse independently observed sea levels. Considering that unmodeled influences on sea levels in the study area can exceed 0.2 m at times, the method was tested against independently observed sea levels and can be considered successful with variances in the range of 1.3-4.5% of the average tidal range for the study area. This research provides the means of addressing a significant need in developing territories where long-term sea level records are unavailable and resource deficiencies exist.

TI Geodiversity and Geotourism of the Ryukyu Islands
SO JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY-CHIGAKU ZASSHI
AB The Ryukyu Islands strongly promote the geodiversity of Japan. A sub-tropic natural environment forms coral reefs and various landscapes linked to surface processes, active tectonics, and Quaternary environmental changes. Field excursions permit geoscientific observations of such landscapes, which reveal geodiversity and a framework for geotourism. Fieldwork was undertaken to arrange an educational program for conserving geodiversity and for geotourism. This program demonstrates the geodiversity and geotourism of the Ryukyu Islands, in terms of geomorphology and related disciplines. Basic geotours observe landforms and sediments, and consider geomorphic processes: weathering, erosion, transport, sedimentation, uplift, and sea level change. Applied geotours observe landscapes indicating global environmental problems, such as global warming, climate change, sea level rise, acid rain, and ecosystem based on geomorphology and related geosciences. For instance, acid rain accelerates the chemical weathering (decomposition) of limestone and erosion of karst landforms that are distributed widely on raised coral reefs. Such geotours require both scientific and attractive geostories managed by geoscientists. Japanese geoscientists should propose models for geotours derived from field excursions for landscape observations that will contribute to education, conservation, and geotourism.

TI Regional sea level changes projected by the NASA/GISS Atmosphere-Ocean
   Model
SO CLIMATE DYNAMICS
AB Sea level has been rising for the past century, and coastal residents of the Earth will want to understand and predict future sea level changes. In this study we present sea level changes from new simulations of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) global atmosphere-ocean model fi om 1950 to 2099. The free surface, mass conserving ocean model leads to a straightforward calculation of these changes. Using observed levels of greenhouse gases between 1950 and 1990 and a compounded 0.5% annual increase in CO2 after 1990, model projections show that global sea level measured from 1950 will rise by 61 mm in the year 2000, by 212 mm in 2050, and by 408 mm in 2089. By 2089, 64% of the global sea level rise will be due to thermal expansion and 36% will be due to ocean mass changes. The Arctic Ocean will show a greater than average sea level rise, while the Antarctic circumpolar region will show a smaller rise in agreement with other models. Model results are also compared with observed sea level changes during the past 40 years at 12 coastal stations around the world.

TI CLIMATE CHANGE AND WATERBORNE PATHOGENS: THE EL NINO PHENOMENON AND ITS
   IMPACT ON HEALTH
SO REVISTA DE SALUD AMBIENTAL
AB Global warming induced by human activity has brought about irreversible environmental changes whose consequences are still being analyzed. Of all the affected areas, the coasts are the most volatile zones due to increasing seawater temperatures and rising sea levels. These climatic changes bring about ecological shifts, strongly impacting the biological equilibrium of coastal ecosystems. These same coastal areas are the naturally occurring habitat of the most important human pathogens of Vibrio: V. cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus. For the last year, the interaction of the oceans and climactic anomalies on the dynamics of diseases associated with these pathogens has been studied with the use of oceanographic data provided by satellites. Studies carried out in Peru using these new tools have allowed the epidemic expansion of V. cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus infections in South America to be linked to the arrival and spread of the El Nino waters. Further investigation using remote sensing data to analyze the dynamic of V. parahaemolyticus outbreaks in the USA, Spain and Chile has led to the conclusion that infections in these areas have also concurred with the presence of oceanic anomalies. The movement of oceanic waters has therefore been identified as a potential vehicle for the dispersion of Vibrio infections on a global scale, opening new channels for exploring and predicting new epidemic outbreaks of these diseases.

TI Climate change impacts on US coastal and marine ecosystems
SO ESTUARIES
AB Increases in concentrations of greenhouse gases projected for the 21st century are expected to lead to increased mean global air and ocean temperatures. The National Assessment of PotentiaI Consequences of Climate Variability and Change (NAST 2001) was based on a series of regional and sector assessments. This paper is a summary of the coastal and marine resources sector review of potential impacts on shorelines, estuaries, coastal wetlands, coral reefs, and ocean margin ecosystems. The assessment considered the impacts of several key drivers of climate change: sea level change; alterations in precipitation patterns and subsequent delivery of freshwater, nutrients, and sediment; increased ocean temperature; alterations in circulation patterns; changes in frequency and intensity of coastal storms; and increased levels of atmospheric CO2. Increasing rates of sea-level rise and intensity and frequency of coastal storms and hurricanes over the next decades will increase threats to shorelines, wetlands, and coastal development. Estuarine productivity will change in response to alteration in the timing and amount of freshwater, nutrients, and sediment delivery. Higher water temperatures and changes in freshwater delivery will alter estuarine stratification, residence time, and eutrophication. Increased ocean temperatures are expected to increase coral bleaching and higher CO2 levels may reduce coral calcification, making it more difficult for corals to recover from other disturbances, and inhibiting poleward shifts. Ocean warming is expected to cause poleward shifts in the ranges of many other organisms, including commercial species, and these shifts may have secondary effects on their predators and prey. Although these potential impacts of climate change and variability will vary from system to system, it is important to recognize that they will be superimposed upon, and in many cases intensify, other ecosystem stresses (pollution, harvesting, habitat destruction, invasive species, land and resource use, extreme natural events), which may lead to more significant consequences.

TI Long-time spatio-temporal variations in anchovy (Engraulis ringens)
   biological traits off northern Chile: an adaptive response to long-term
   environmental change?
SO ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE
AB Analyses of the dynamics of exploited marine populations show that population variations and tendencies are as often related to recruitment outcomes as to the anthropogenic effects of fishing. For small pelagic fishes such as sardines and anchovies in particular, environmental variability has been described as one of the primary forcings affecting availability and survival of prerecruitment early life stages. Although less well-documented, the impact of environmental variability on biological features can also be confused with traditional exploitation effects. In order to further our understanding of how the environment affects biological features of small pelagic resources, this work analyses variability of biological traits in anchovy (Engraulis ringens) off northern Chile (18 degrees 21'S-24 degrees 00'S) and the primary environmental variables of the sea surface from 1990 to 2015. The results show significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in both environmental conditions and anchovy biological traits (weight, length, and maturity), revealing an important relationship between the biological condition of E. ringens and food availability (represented by chlorophyll-a concentrations and average sea level). Our results suggest a heterogeneous population structure, and ametapopulation hypothesis is proposed. Over the last 15 years, anchovy monitoring has revealed greater gonad weights and proportions of mature individuals along with smaller, lighter-weight individuals. Such phenotypic plasticity is an adaptive strategy responding to large-scale environmental changes and is probably associated with diminished food availability. Interannual trends in anchovy biological traits in response to environmental variability and the species' heterogeneous population structure have important implications for population evaluations and diagnoses as well as fishery management.

TI Sea level rise in the Arctic Ocean
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB About 60 tide-gauge stations in the Kara, Laptev, East-Siberian and Chukchi Seas have recorded the sea level change from the 1950s through 1990s. Over this 40-year period, most of these stations show a significant sea level rise (SLR). In light of global change, this SLR could be a manifestation of warming in the Arctic coupled with a decrease of sea ice extent, warming of Atlantic waters, changes in the Arctic Ocean circulation, and an increase in coastal erosion and thawing of permafrost.
   We have analyzed monthly mean sea level data and assessed the role that different factors may play in influencing the process of sea level change in the Arctic Ocean. Analysis of the observational data and model results shows that changes in the patterns of wind-driven and thermohaline circulation may account for most of the increase of sea level in the Arctic Ocean and their cumulative action can explain more than 80% of the sea level variability during 1950-1990.

TI Sea level history of the northern Gulf of Mexico coast and sea level
   rise scenarios for the near future
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
AB The sea level history of the northern Gulf of Mexico during recent geologic time has closely followed global eustatic sea level change. Regional effects due to tectonics and glacio-isostasy have been minimal. Over the past several million years the northern Gulf coast, like most stable coastal regions of the globe, has experienced major swings of sea level below and above present level, accompanied by major shifts in shoreline position. During advances of the northern hemisphere ice sheets, sea level dropped by more than 100 m, extending the shoreline in places more than 100 km onto the shelf. For much of the period since the last glacial maximum (LGM), 20,000 years ago, the region has seen rates of sea level rise far in excess of those experienced during the period represented by long-term tide gauges. The regional tide gauge record reveals that sea level has been rising at about 2 mm/year for the past century, while the average rate of rise since the LGM has been 6 mm/year, with some periods of abrupt rise exceeding 40 mm/year. During times of abrupt rise, Gulf of Mexico shorelines were drowned in place and overstepped. The relative stability of modern coastal systems is due primarily to stabilization of sea level approximately 6,000 years ago, resulting in the slow rates of rise experienced during historic time. Recent model projections of sea level rise over the next century and beyond may move northern Gulf coastal environments into a new equilibrium regime, more similar to that experienced during the deglaciation than that which has existed during historic time.

TI Integrating conservation costs into sea level rise adaptive conservation
   prioritization
SO GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB Biodiversity conservation requires strategic investment as resources for conservation are often limited. As sea level rises, it is important and necessary to consider both sea level rise and costs in conservation decision making. In this study, we consider costs of conservation in an integrated modeling process that incorporates a geomorphological model (SLAMM), species habitat models, and conservation prioritization (Zonation) to identify conservation priorities in the face of landscape dynamics due to sea level rise in the Matanzas River basin of northeast Florida. Compared to conservation priorities that do not consider land costs in the analysis process, conservation priorities that consider costs in the planning process change significantly. The comparison demonstrates that some areas with high conservation values might be identified as lower priorities when integrating economic costs in the planning process and some areas with low conservation values might be identified as high priorities when considering costs in the planning process. This research could help coastal resources managers make informed decisions about where and how to allocate conservation resources more wisely to facilitate biodiversity adaptation to sea level rise.

TI Sea level in time and space: revolutions and inconvenient truths
SO JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE
AB In this paper we identify four revolutions' that in our view have shaped the study of sea-level changes in recent decades. (i) The search for eustasy'. One of the most hotly debated issues in the 1960s is still relevant as models of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) require input of the amount of meltwater transferred to the world's oceans following the demise of the large Pleistocene ice sheets. (ii) Resolution of sea-level archives. All sea-level archives have limitations in their resolving power but are we willing to define these? From studies of salt-marsh deposits and corals it is highly likely that climate-driven metre-scale sea-level fluctuations have not occurred during the middle and late Holocene. (iii) Rapid sea-level changes. Improved coring technology has resulted in the suggestion of meltwater pulses during the last deglaciation. Low-frequency high-magnitude events have been documented along seismically active shorelines and provide information on seismic hazards and storm impacts. (iv) Merging of empirical sea-level investigations and models. Much sea-level research in the past two decades has embraced the integration of models and field-derived data, providing testable hypotheses and insights into processes. We conclude with some reminders about the inconvenient truths' that keep the sea-level scientist honest.

TI RESPONSE OF REEF GROWTH TO SEA-LEVEL CHANGES (LATE MIOCENE, FORTUNA
   BASIN, SOUTHEASTERN SPAIN)
SO PALAIOS
AB Response of reef development to sea level is well displayed in the 70-m-thick upper Miocene El Desastre reef complex, Fortuna basin (Murcia Province, southeastern Spain). Conglomerates that show evidence of subaerial exposure characterize the sea-level low stand; reefs ag-graded as relative sea level rose tens of meters. The reef developed on an erosional platform (about 1.5 km(2)) carved into older reef-slope sediments. It exhibits evidence of start-up, catch-up, and Keep-up patterns of growth. Rapid relative sea-level rise flooded the platform to depths as great as 25 m. Prior to initiation of reef sedimentation (start-up phase), a lag phase of unknown duration occurred during which foraminifer wackestones and packstones accumulated. Following the lag phase, reef sedimentation yielded 20 to 40 m of fossiliferous packstones. Corals proliferated and eventually caught up to the sea-level surface, henceforth, the keep-up pattern of reef growth prevailed. Growth rates of branching-corals reflected chan,bes in sea level, which rose episodically producing distinct layers of corals and coralline algae up to 1.5 m thick. Seaward, a poorly developed algal ridge formed. The layers of flat-topped corals and algal ridges precisely record successive Miocene sea levels. The keep-up phase failed and the reef reverted to a catch-up style of growth, perhaps clue to accelerated sea-level rise, foul wafers, or isolation by a seaward barrier.
   Studies of similar-age reefs in the area and their inferred sea-level curves could shed light on the relative importance of eustatic and tectonic influence on sea-level change in the western Mediterranean during the late Miocene.

TI Reef response to sea-level and environmental changes in the Central
   South Pacific over the past 6000 years
SO GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
AB Geological records of coastal system evolution during past higher and/or rising sea levels provide an important baseline for developing projections regarding the response of modern coastal systems to future sea-level rise. The mid-late Holocene corresponds to the most recent window into natural variability prior to the Anthropocene and involves slow-rate and low-amplitude sea-level changes that were mostly governed by a limited glacio-eustatic contribution, most likely sourced from Antarctica, and 'glacial isostatic adjustment' processes.
   This paper documents in unprecedented detail the response of coral reefs and coastal systems to changing accommodation space in relation to mid-late Holocene sea-level changes in French Polynesia.
   The sea-level curve that underpins this study has a global significance and documents a single short-lived sea-level highstand between 4.10 and 3.40 kyr BP. The amplitude of the highstand is less than one metre, within the range of the predicted sea level at the end of the current century. The reported relative sea-level changes are characterized by slow rates ranging from a few tens of millimetres per year to up to 2.5 mm/yr and by significant sea-level stability (stillstands) lasting more than a century and up to 250 years, defining a step-like pattern. Sea-level variability probably driven by climatic oscillations on interannual to millennial time scales is evidenced during the entire time window.
   The detailed reconstruction of reef development over the last 6000 years brings valuable information regarding coral reef dynamics and coastal processes during periods of higher sea level and wave energy regimes. The persistence of stable and optimal depositional environments over the last 6000 years is demonstrated by the constant overall composition and diversity of reef communities and the almost continuous development of coral microatolls. The facies distribution as well as the lateral extension and shift of facies belts have been governed by variations in accommodation space, which are controlled by relative sea-level changes and antecedent topography. The widespread development of mid-late Holocene reef deposits in coastal areas suggests that they have played a prominent role in global processes related to the formation and shaping of modern islands.

TI Forcing Mechanisms of the Interannual Sea Level Variability in the
   Midlatitude South Pacific during 2004-2020
SO REMOTE SENSING
AB Over the past few decades, the global mean sea level rise and superimposed regional fluctuations of sea level have exerted considerable stress on coastal communities, especially in low-elevation regions such as the Pacific Islands in the western South Pacific Ocean. This made it necessary to have the most comprehensive understanding of the forcing mechanisms that are responsible for the increasing rates of extreme sea level events. In this study, we explore the causes of the observed sea level variability in the midlatitude South Pacific on interannual time scales using observations and atmospheric reanalyses combined with a 1.5 layer reduced-gravity model. We focus on the 2004-2020 period, during which the Argo's global array allowed us to assess year-to-year changes in steric sea level caused by thermohaline changes in different depth ranges (from the surface down to 2000 m). We find that during the 2015-2016 El Nino and the following 2017-2018 La Nina, large variations in thermosteric sea level occurred due to temperature changes within the 100-500 dbar layer in the midlatitude southwest Pacific. In the western boundary region (from 30 degrees S to 40 degrees S), the variations in halosteric sea level between 100 and 500 dbar were significant and could have partially balanced the corresponding changes in thermosteric sea level. We show that around 35 degrees S, baroclinic Rossby waves forced by the open-ocean wind-stress forcing account for 40 to 75% of the interannual sea level variance between 100 degrees W and 180 degrees, while the influence of remote sea level signals generated near the Chilean coast is limited to the region east of 100 degrees W. The contribution of surface heat fluxes on interannual time scales is also considered and shown to be negligible.

AB Recent advances in studies of dune dynamics and stratigraphy, together with the availability of luminescence dating of aeolian sands have combined to suggest a series of new paradigms for development of dune systems which emphasize the importance of Quaternary climatic and sea level changes to dune development. Many desert sand seas are characterized by multiple generations of dunes, each composed of sediments with different particle size, mineralogy, and degree of post-depositional alteration. Complex dune patterns are indicative of areas that are sensitive to climatic and sea level changes that have affected sediment supply and mobility. Developments in luminescence dating techniques enable the age of dunes of different generations of dunes to be assessed and compared with other sources of paleoclimatic information, suggesting the importance of sediment supply to periods of dune building. Recent work on dune dynamics and stratigraphy suggests that many large, complex dunes are probably tens of thousands of years old and are being modified by modern winds. Because linear dunes are slow to respond to change, many of them are on trends that are not in equilibrium with modern winds.

TI A Preindustrial Sea-Level Rise Hotspot Along the Atlantic Coast of North
   America
SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB The Atlantic coast of North America north of Cape Hatteras has been proposed as a "hotspot" of late 20th century sea-level rise. Here we test, using salt-marsh proxy sea-level records, if this coast experienced enhanced sea-level rise over earlier multidecadal-centennial periods. While we find in agreement with previous studies that 20th century rates of sea-level change were higher compared to rates during preceding centuries, rates of 18th century sea-level rise were only slightly lower, suggesting that the "hotspot" is a reoccurring feature for at least three centuries. Proxy sea-level records from North America (Iceland) are negatively (positively) correlated with centennial changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation. They are consistent with sea-level "fingerprints" of Arctic ice melt, and we therefore hypothesize that sea-level fluctuations are related to changes in Arctic land-ice mass. Predictions of future sea-level rise should take into account these long-term fluctuating rates of natural sea-level change.

TI Human-environment dynamics during the Iron Age in the Lofoten Islands,
   Norway
SO NORSK GEOGRAFISK TIDSSKRIFT-NORWEGIAN JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY
AB Integrated archaeological and paleoenvironmental investigations provide long-term perspectives on human-environment interactions. In the North Atlantic region, early human settlements were established in marginal agricultural environments and were susceptible to various environmental stressors. The Lofoten Islands have had an important role in the history of this region, particularly during the Iron Age, when Lofoten developed from pioneering agricultural settlements to a prominent node of power and trade under Viking chieftains. Iron Age developments in Lofoten were concurrent with significant natural environmental changes, including variations in climate and sea level. However, there has not been a comprehensive investigation of their influence on early settlements. The purpose of the study is to review Iron Age cultural developments in Lofoten using published archaeological data and paleoenvironmental records of past climate and sea-level change, and to present specific examples of the intersection of early human development and natural environmental changes. The findings show that climate changes probably influenced agricultural phases and that relative sea-level variations had important impacts on maritime developments. In conclusion, the findings demonstrate that human-environment interactions were significant factors in Lofoten's history and the authors suggest specific areas for future research.

TI Holocene paleoshoreline changes of the Red River Delta, Vietnam
SO REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY
AB The Red River Delta (RRD), one of the two largest deltas in Vietnam, has been severely affected by natural hazards induced by global climate change. Understanding the Holocene paleoshoreline is crucial in developing adaptive planning in response to future shoreline changes based on past natural shoreline changes. This study presents new data pertaining to pollen, grain size, lithological characteristics, and C-14 dating of six cores from the RRD. The purpose of this study was to determine the paleoenvironments and paleoshorelines of the RRD in the Holocene to provide information useful for modeling future changes, e.g., for calibration sea level in paleobathymetry and sea level change models; for making the necessary ecological and cultural adaption to survive. We identified 4 units and 10 sedimentary fades indicating periods of sedimentary evolution since late Pleistocene. The main indicators for paleoshoreline interpretation are true mangrove and backmangrove pollen. The inferred paleoshoreline changes and five paleogeographic maps for 10.5, 9.2, 7.8, 6.5. and 3.7 cal. kyr BP were constructed based on paleoshoreline indicators, and paleoenvironmental reconstructions from the dataset of our whole RRD study area.

TI Correlating Alpine glaciation with Adriatic sea-level changes through
   lake and alluvial stratigraphy
SO JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE
AB We compare lake and alluvial stratigraphy along a frame connecting the southern Alpine foothills and the Adriatic Sea, with the aim of matching the effects of Alpine glaciation and sea-level changes on sedimentation during the last glacial cycle. The palynostratigraphy of Lake Fimon provided proxies for regional vegetation and climate change and was coupled with sediment petrography, loss on ignition and magnetic susceptibility, disentangling alluvial phases from fluvioglacial activity related to culminations of the southeastern Alpine glaciers. The Fimon area was not reached by alluvial fans during the penultimate glacial maximum, nor by the sea transgression during the last interglacial, but a closed lake soon developed at the Eemian onset due to enhanced rainfall. Sea-level fall at glacial inception triggered the entrenchment of the drainage network in the plain reaching the outer Fimon Basin. Slow aggradation, but no sign of fluvioglacial activity, lasted to 38.2 +/- 1.45 cal. ka BP, when a major forest withdrawal took place, coeval to the spread of alluvial fans. By 27.5 perpendicular to 0.5 cal. ka BP the Fimon Basin was dammed by the Brenta outwash system. The main step of of forest recovery commenced at around (15.8) cal. ka BP, when apex trenching of the outwash fans was triggered by the glacier's decay. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Geomorphology of mesophotic coral ecosystems: current perspectives on
   morphology, distribution, and mapping strategies
SO CORAL REEFS
AB This paper presents a general review of the distribution of mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs) in relationship to geomorphology in US waters. It was specifically concerned with the depth range of 30-100 m, where more than 186,000 km(2) of potential seafloor area was identified within the US Gulf of Mexico/Florida, Caribbean, and main Hawaiian Islands. The geomorphology of MCEs was largely inherited from a variety of pre-existing structures of highly diverse origins, which, in combination with environmental stress and physical controls, restrict the distribution of MCEs. Sea-level history, along with depositional and erosional processes, played an integral role in formation of MCE settings. However, mapping the distribution of both potential MCE topography/substrate and existing MCE habitat is only beginning. Mapping techniques pertinent to understanding morphology and MCE distributions are discussed throughout this paper. Future investigations need to consider more cost-effective and remote methods (such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and acoustics) in order to assess the distribution and extent of MCE habitat. Some understanding of the history of known MCEs through coring studies would help understand their initiation and response to environmental change over time, essential for assessing how they may be impacted by future environmental change.

TI Plant Collection "Half-life:" Can Botanic Gardens Weather the Climate?
SO CURATOR-THE MUSEUM JOURNAL
AB Botanic gardens are organized around plant collections, and climate change will affect those collections. Land loss is expected for gardens near sea level, prompting a loss of plants from the collection. Future collection development requires planning for these losses, which in turn requires assessment of the extent and rate of collection loss. We examined collection inventory change over time using records at Montgomery Botanical Center (MBC), to formulate a plant collection half-life concept. This half-life was used to project changes in MBC's plant collection over the next 100 years within the context of sea level changes. Comparing predicted rates of collection change with projected rates of loss due to sea level rise, we expect plant collection development to keep pace with climate change. As actively curated resources, botanic garden plant collections can adapt to environmental change faster and more deliberately than natural systems.

TI Late Pleistocene and Holocene climate and environmental evolution of a
   subantarctic fjord ingression basin in the southwest Pacific
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB Subantarctic islands are located at a critical latitude for reconstructing past changes in ocean-atmosphere interactions. Currently, there is a lack of high-resolution records from the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean that can be used to reconstruct climate since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Here, we present a reconstruction of environmental change from a fjord ingression basin at New Zealand's subantarctic Auckland Islands (50.5 degrees S) over the last similar to 19 ka cal BP. Using sedimentological and geochemical analysis of cores collected along a depth transect in Norman Inlet we find evidence for four different stages of environmental history: deglacial, lacustrine, marine transgression, and marine. Glaciers retreated from their maximum extent before 19.4 ka cal BP during a period of ice retreat that appears synchronous across the Pacific basin, likely due to southward migration of the Subtropical Front. However, in contrast to other glaciated regions, we see no evidence for ice re-advance, and a proglacial lake was present in the basin until 15.7 ka cal BR. Following deglaciation, organic-rich sedimentation dominated the lacustrine environment until post-glacial sea-level rise flooded the depositional basin at 8.8 ka cal BR. Deposition of organic-rich sediment continued during the Antarctic Cold Reversal and we find no evidence for a glacial re-advance. Mixing of terrestrial and marine organic matter during the marine transgression (8.8-6.7 ka cal BP) indicates significant erosion and re-working of sediment in the catchment as seawater over-topped the sill. Modern fjord circulation commenced similar to 6.7 ka cal BP when sea level reached its maximum in the early Holocene. This well-dated, high-resolution record constrains the timing of deglaciation, sea-level rise, and subantarctic environmental change following the LGM that expands our understanding of the key drives of climate change in the middle to high southern latitudes.

TI Time stories: Making sense of futures in anticipation of sea-level rise
SO GEOFORUM
AB Adjustment to predicted environmental change in a place requires people in that place to consider short- and long-term futures there. These futures are imagined with reference to pasts and presents, remembered and lived. This paper presents the stories relating possible futures to pasts and presents of residents in tiny, low-lying coastal communities in Gippsland East, Australia, as they make sense of the uncertain futures they may face. It identifies four time stories, about generational continuity, the temporariness of inundation, endurance and acceptance in older age, and the impermanence of infrastructure. It sets these alongside the time-based practices inherent in existing adaptation policies, which do not satisfy the demands for adaptation arising from residents' time stories. We suggest that understanding local residents' time stories can contribute to a better synchronisation in the timing of local adaptation policies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Vulnerability of Turkish coasts to accelerated sea-level rise
SO GEOMORPHOLOGY
AB Accelerated rise in sea-level, and associated geological adjustment, may result in a high impact on shorelines. On the basis of hourly sea-level observations over a 20 year period, sea-level change along the Turkish coast has been investigated. In addition to relative sea-level rise, the high level of human activities in coastal areas puts a significant amount of stress on Turkish coastal zones, especially on coastal lowland plains. Coastal erosion and ground water salinization are the most important impacts and two case studies are discussed in this paper: the Kizilirmak river delta on the Black Sea; and the tourism center of Erdek on the Marmara Sea. Coastal retreat on the Kizilirmak river delta is mostly attributed to decreasing sediment supply to the coast. The shore barriers and the enclosed lagoons are likely to respond readily to future sea-level rise. At Erdek, the most important threat is intrusion of salt water into freshwater systems caused by a combination of accelerated sea-level rise, land reclamation and overexploitation of underground aquifers.

TI Glaciers and ice sheets: current status and trends
SO RENDICONTI LINCEI-SCIENZE FISICHE E NATURALI
AB About 10 % of the land surface on Earth is covered by glacier ice, with an estimated total volume equivalent to about 66 m of potential sea-level rise. Almost the totality (99 %) of this volume is locked in the polar ice sheets, while less than 1 % forms all the other mountain glaciers and ice caps. In the last three decades, the general retreat of the mountain glaciers and the accelerated flow and ice loss from several outlet glaciers draining the Greenland and the Antarctic ice sheets came to general attention as a major evidence of climate warming and as a potential contribution to the sea-level rise, to local shortage of water resources and to other environmental risks. Here, we present a short review of the most recent data and assessments on the present status and on trends of glaciers and polar ice sheets. The Greenland ice sheet (12 % of total glacier ice volume) over the last three decades showed an increase of the extent of the surface melt area and an acceleration of many marine-terminating glaciers; as a consequence, the ice sheet is losing ice at an increasing rate that reached -263 +/- A 30 Gt/year in the 2005-2010 time interval, equivalent to a sea-level rise of 0.72 +/- A 0.08 mm/year. The much larger, higher and colder composite Antarctic ice sheet (87 % of total glacier ice volume), in the same 2005-2010 time interval, had an ice loss of -81 +/- A 37 Gt/year. Mountain glaciers and ice caps are retreating in all the major glacierized regions, with the exception of a few mountain areas where contrasting patterns have been observed. Although containing less than 1 % of the total glacier ice, mountain glaciers and ice caps suffered a total ice loss of -259 +/- A 28 Gt/year in the period 2003-2009, equivalent to a sea-level rise of 0.71 +/- A 0.08 mm/year. The overall contribution of glaciers and ice sheets is estimated equivalent to a sea-level rise of 1.50 +/- A 0.16 mm/year for the period 2003-2009, or about 60 % of the total sea-level rise in the same period. Various estimates of the total glacier contribution to the sea-level rise by the end of the twenty-first century have been recently proposed, ranging from a few decimeters to 2 m, with most plausible projections at about 0.5 m. Most probably Greenland, the Antarctic Peninsula and the West Antarctic ice sheet will continue to lose ice, while the sign of the East Antarctica contribution is uncertain. Mountain glaciers will most likely continue to lose ice, although at different rates in the various mountain regions. For the European Alps and the Southern Alps (New Zealand), a loss of more than 70 % of their present volume is expected by the end of the twenty-first century. The glaciers' contraction in the mountain areas may cause slope failures, debris mobilization, outburst floods from glacial lakes, and water deficits, particularly in the summer season, in the arid zones in the coming decades. Together with other changes occurring in the cryosphere such as the Arctic sea-ice reduction, the snow cover decline and the permafrost degradation, the glacier retreat is considered part of a larger picture of environmental changes, directly or indirectly caused or increased by the human impact, leading to new environmental conditions, thus deserving to be indicated as the Anthropocene.
   Still more open to future responses is the consideration if the ongoing glacier reduction and the rise of the sea level will contribute to leave such a footprint in the geologic record as to require a new stratigraphic unit, a new time epoch in the billion years long history of the Earth.

TI Reconstructing the groundwater recharge history for the Plymouth-Carver
   Aquifer Massachusetts, USA
SO QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
AB Groundwater systems can respond to climate forcing and millennial climate shifts more slowly than other components of the hydrologic cycle, making it difficult to reconstruct the influences and responses of groundwater to changing climate. Here, we test the linkage between climate change and groundwater responses by using water level changes situated in areas with permeable, unconfined aquifers systems. For hydroclimate histories, we compare moisture models from terrestrial water level reconstructions with predictions of available water from a transient earth system climate model. We focus our analysis on several small waterbodies with Holocene-era proxy measurements that are connected to the Plymouth-Carver glacial aquifer in southeastern Massachusetts, USA. Using these pond-and marsh-based records, we reconstruct groundwater recharge histories along individual groundwater flow paths using water level and sea level reconstructions with an analytical solution to the groundwater flow equation. We find that the water level reconstructions could contain both hydroclimate and sea level signals, with the early Holocene water levels primarily due to hydroclimate with predominantly a sea level signal after similar to 7.5 ka cal BP. Our results indicate that sea level influenced coastal pond water levels, and sea level may play a more significant role than effective moisture over certain periods in the Holocene for terrestrial water bodies hydraulically connected to the evolving position of the coast. Future climate reconstructions developed from water level histories from low-elevation inland water bodies may benefit from examining the potential influence of sea level in addition to hydroclimate, but additional model validation and consideration of other cryosphere and glacial processes are needed to fully resolve sea level as a driver of terrestrial water level change.

TI An Anomalous Recent Acceleration of Global Sea Level Rise
SO JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
AB Tide gauge data are used to estimate trends in global sea level for the period from 1955 to 2007. Linear trends over 15-yr segments are computed for each tide gauge record, averaged over latitude bands, and combined to form an area-weighted global mean trend. The uncertainty of the global trend is specified as a sampling error plus a random vertical land motion component, but land motion corrections do not change the results. The average global sea level trend for the time segments centered on 1962-90 is 1.5 +/- 0.5 mm yr(-1) (standard error), in agreement with previous estimates of late twentieth-century sea level rise. After 1990, the global trend increases to the most recent rate of 3.2 +/- 0.4 mm yr(-1), matching estimates obtained from satellite altimetry. The acceleration is distinct from decadal variations in global sea level that have been reported in previous studies. Increased rates in the tropical and southern oceans primarily account for the acceleration. The timing of the global acceleration corresponds to similar sea level trend changes associated with upper ocean heat content and ice melt.

TI Small-scale benthos distribution modelling in a North Sea tidal basin in
   response to climatic and environmental changes (1970s-2009)
SO MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB We used small-scale species distribution models to predict the past and present spatial distribution of 7 characteristic macrofauna species in response to climatic and environmental changes that have been recorded for the Jade Bay (German Wadden Sea) over the last 4 decades (1970s to 2009). Four presence-absence modelling algorithms (RF, MARS, GLM, GBM) were merged within the ensemble forecasting platform 'biomod2'. The present spatial distribution (representing 2009) was modelled based on statistical relationships between species presences, true species absences and 7 high-resolution (5 m) environmental grids. The past spatial distribution (representing the 1970s) was then hindcast in response to climate change-induced (1) sea-level rise, (2) water temperature increase and (3) seagrass recovery due to de-eutrophication. The past distribution scenario was evaluated using independent historical macrofauna data from the 1970s. Present ensemble prediction maps accurately captured the potential ecological niches of the modelled species throughout Jade Bay (i.e. good to excellent true skill statistic [TSS] and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] evaluation measures). The predicted present macrofauna distribution correlated most significantly with hydrodynamic conditions (submergence time, shear stress) and sediment characteristics (mud content). The past distribution scenario revealed significant changes in small-scale spatial distribution patterns of the characteristic modelled species (1970s to 2009) and showed a very good match with historical macrofauna data. Climate change-induced sea-level rise and its local implications for Jade Bay (changes in topo graphy, tidal range and submergence time), and water temperature increase explained the potential macrofauna distribution shifts over the last 4 decades.

TI Late Quaternary sea-level changes of the Persian Gulf
SO QUATERNARY RESEARCH
AB Late Quaternary reflooding of the Persian Gulf climaxed with the mid-Holocene highstand previously variously dated between 6 and 3.4 ka. Examination of the stratigraphic and paleoenvironmental context of a mid-Holocene whale beaching allows us to accurately constrain the timing of the transgressive, highstand and regressive phases of the mid- to late Holocene sea-level highstand in the Persian Gulf. Mid-Holocene transgression of the Gulf surpassed today's sea level by 7100-6890 cal yr BP, attaining a highstand of >1 m above current sea level shortly after 5290-4570 cal yr BP before falling back to current levels by 1440-1170 cal yr BP. The cetacean beached into an intertidal hardground pond during the transgressive phase (5300-4960 cal yr BP) with continued transgression interring the skeleton in shallow-subtidal sediments. Subsequent relative sea-level fall produced a forced regression with consequent progradation of the coastal system. These new ages refine previously reported timings for the mid- to late Holocene sea-level highstand published for other regions. By so doing, they allow us to constrain the timing of this correlatable global eustatic event more accurately. (C) 2015 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Aquatic environmental changes and ecological implications from the
   combined effects of sea-level rise and land reclamation in Deep Bay,
   Pearl River Estuary, China
SO ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB Rising sea levels due to climate change are altering the hydrodynamic and solute transport conditions in estuarine regions worldwide. At the same time, anthropogenic projects such as land reclamation could change the potential effects of sea-level rise (SLR). In this study, Deep Bay in the Pearl River Estuary of China was used as a case study to investigate the combined effects of SLR and reclamation. A numerical model was applied to simulate the changes of hydrodynamic and solute transport with 0.0, 0.3, and 0.5 m of SLR in two groups of scenarios (i.e., before and after land reclamation). SLR alone substantially affected the hydrodynamics and strengthened the tidal influence. SLR resulted in a loss of intertidal regions and an increased tidal prism in the bay. Reclamation further magnified SLR's effects on both the hydrodynamics and solute transport. The tidal energy entering the bay during each tidal phase increased by 39.2% and 66.4% with 0.3 and 0.5 m of SLR (respectively) before reclamation, versus 40.7% and 68.9% (respectively) after reclamation. The reclamation projects in the bay helped the saline sea water to intrude further upstream, and magnified the effects of SLR on variations in seasonal salinity. SLR also decreased the bay's ability to exchange water. However, the reclamation accelerated the solute circulation inside the bay, considerably reduced the water age, and offset the SLR's effects on the bay's ability to exchange water with the adjacent sea. The increase in salinity variation due to the combined effects of SLR and reclamation might exert stress on the ecological system of the inner bay, which contains a Ramsar wetland.

TI A new outlook on the morpholithogenesis of marine terraces
SO OCEANOLOGY
AB The "new outlook" implies that marine terraces should be regarded as the topographic features of the coastal zone formed due to the action of the processes of morpholithogenesis in the wave-break barrier zone. Marine terraces mark the position of this barrier zone in the past related to a sea level position distinct from the present-day. The modern coastal accumulative features consisting of series of closely spaced coastal bars of different heights cannot be referred to as coastal terraces. Both in the coastal zone and on the shelf, the terraces are equally formed at the transgressions of the sea (bottom terrace. on the shelf) and at its regressions (coastal terraces). Thus, the formulation of the definitions of marine terraces in reference books, textbooks on geomorphology, geographical glossaries, and encyclopedias should be corrected: "marine terraces are subhorizontal surfaces of marine origin on land, the underwater coastal slope, and the shelf, bounded from two sides by clearly manifested escarpments of different steepnesses, formed by the physical-mechanical, biogeochemical, and other processes in the wave-break barrier zone of the sea under periodic climatic changes and relative sea level oscillations."

TI Beyond the Last Glacial Maximum: Island endemism is best explained by
   long-lasting archipelago configurations
SO GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB Aim To quantify the influence of past archipelago configuration on present-day insular biodiversity patterns, and to compare the role of long-lasting archipelago configurations over the Pleistocene to configurations of short duration such as at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the present-day. Location 53 volcanic oceanic islands from 12 archipelagos worldwide-Azores, Canary Islands, Cook Islands, Galapagos, Gulf of Guinea, Hawaii, Madeira, Mascarenes, Pitcairn, Revillagigedo, Samoan Islands and Tristan da Cunha. Time period The last 800 kyr, representing the nine most recent glacial-interglacial cycles. Major taxa studied Land snails and angiosperms. Methods Species richness data for land snails and angiosperms were compiled from existing literature and species checklists. We reconstructed archipelago configurations at the following sea levels: the present-day high interglacial sea level, the intermediate sea levels that are representative of the Pleistocene and the low sea levels of the LGM. We fitted two alternative linear mixed models for each archipelago configuration using the number of single-island endemic, multiple-island endemic and (non-endemic) native species as a response. Model performance was assessed based on the goodness-of-fit of the full model, the variance explained by archipelago configuration and model parsimony. Results Single-island endemic richness in both taxonomic groups was best explained by intermediate palaeo-configuration (positively by area change, and negatively by palaeo-connectedness), whereas non-endemic native species richness was poorly explained by palaeo-configuration. Single-island endemic richness was better explained by intermediate archipelago configurations than by the archipelago configurations of the LGM or present-day. Main conclusions Archipelago configurations at intermediate sea levels-which are representative of the Pleistocene-have left a stronger imprint on single-island endemic richness patterns on volcanic oceanic islands than extreme archipelago configurations that persisted for only a few thousand years (such as the LGM). In understanding ecological and evolutionary dynamics of insular biota it is essential to consider longer-lasting environmental conditions, rather than extreme situations alone.

TI Sea level change and the area of shallow-marine habitat: implications
   for marine biodiversity
SO PALEOBIOLOGY
AB Analysis of a global elevation database to measure changes in shallow-marine habitat area as a function of sea level reveals an unexpectedly complicated relationship. In contrast to prevailing views, sea level rise does not consistently generate an increase in shelf area, nor does sea level fall consistently reduce shelf area. Different depth-defined habitats on the same margin will experience different changes in area for the same sea level change, and different margins will likewise experience different changes in area for the same sea level change. Simple forward models incorporating a species-area relationship suggest that the diversity response to sea level change will be largely idiosyncratic. The change in habitat area is highly dependent on the starting position of sea level, the amount and direction of sea level change, and the habitat and region in question. Such an idiosyncratic relationship between diversity and sea level reconciles the widespread evidence from the fossil record, for a link between diversity and sea level change with the lack of quantitative support for such a relationship throughout the Phanerozoic.

TI Sea level trend over Malaysian seas from multi-mission satellite
   altimetry and vertical land motion corrected tidal data
SO ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
AB Rise in sea levels is one of the disastrous effects of climate change. A relatively small increase in sea level could affect natural coastal systems. In a study of long-term changes in sea level and measurements of postglacial rebound, monitoring vertical land motion (VLM) is of crucial interest. This study presents an approach to estimate precise sea level trends based on a combination of multi-sensor techniques in the Malaysian region over 19 years. In this study, satellite altimeters (SALT) were used to derive absolute sea levels (ASLs). Tide gauge (TG) stations along the coast of Malaysia were utilised to derive the rate of relative sea levels using sea level changes and VLMs. To obtain ASL at TGs, VLM at these stations were computed using Global Positioning System (GPS), Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PS InSAR), and SALT minus TG. The computed VLMs mostly show similarities in signs rather than magnitude. The findings from the multi-sensor techniques showed that regional sea level trends ranged from 2.65 +/- 0.86 mm/yr to 6.03 +/- 0.79 mm/yr for chosen sub-areas, with an overall mean of 4.47 +/- 0.71 mm/yr and overall subsidence. This information is expected to be valuable for a wide variety of climatic applications and for studying environmental issues related to flooding and global warming in Malaysia. (C) 2019 COSPAR.

TI Paleo-environmental changes during the Middle-Late Ordovician transition
   on the Yangtze Platform, South China and their ecological implications
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB Rocks of Darriwilian and Sandbian age (Middle-Late Ordovician) record the extraordinary peak of the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE) and significant global environmental changes. To track paleo-environmental changes through this critical time, we have analyzed iron speciation, trace elements and total organic carbon in samples of the Miaopo Formation from an intra-shelf basin in South China. The results reveal moderate primary productivity and possible fluctuations in benthic redox. Upwelling during marine transgression is thought to have increased the availability of nutrients in surface waters, sustaining the biological pump. Enhanced export of organic matter would have consumed dissolved oxygen at depth, driving the system toward anoxia. However, it is also possible for deep-water renewal events to transfer more dissolved oxygen into the bottom water. Those proxies suggests high primary productivity and varying sea level (global and local), not benthic anoxia, as the driver of accumulated "black shale". Thus, the local marine ecosystem thrived in this oxic intra-shelf basin, challenging the preexisting paradox that the high-diversity community flourished in an oxygen-depleted environment.

TI Depositional processes and environmental changes during initial flooding
   of an epeiric platform: Liguan Formation (Cambrian Series 2), Shandong
   Province, China
SO GEOSCIENCES JOURNAL
AB This paper focuses on the depositional processes and environmental changes during initial marine flooding recorded in the lower Cambrian succession of the North China Platform in Shandong Province, China. In order to understand imbalance of accommodation and sediment supply in the initial stage of basin-fill, a detailed analysis of sedimentary facies was made for the lowermost siliciclastic deposits of the Liguan Formation. It reveals ten siliciclastic lithofacies in three large-scale outcrops (Jinhe, Anqianzhuang, and Zhangjiapo sections). These facies are grouped into four facies associations, representing siliciclastic foreshore-shoreface (S1), siliciclastic offshore (S2), distributary mouth bars (S3), and coastal plain (S4). The siliciclastic components occur in a linear belt, emanating from a major drainage system in the northeastern part of the platform. Deposition of siliciclastic sediments was largely controlled by regional topography of the unconformable surface and shoreline configuration as well as strong effect of waves and currents. With ensued rise in sea level and decrease in siliciclastic sediment supply, carbonate sediments prevailed, filling the accommodation created by epeirogenic subsidence and sediment loading.

SO JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
AB Estuaries lie at the interface of land and sea, and are particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise due to climate change that might lead to intrusion of salt water further upstream and affect circulation patterns. Climate change is also likely to have a major impact on hydrological cycles and consequently lead to changes in freshwater inflows into estuaries. An idealized estuary model is employed to investigate the effects of sea-level rise and freshwater inflows on estuarine circulation. Rising sea levels result in a stronger longitudinal salinity gradient partial derivative s/partial derivative x, indicating an increase in the strength of the gravitational circulation U-GC, higher longitudinal dispersion coefficients K and enhanced salinity intrusion. Under low-flow conditions, the effects of sea level rise on salinity intrusion are largest because sea-level rise has a greater impact due to weaker vertical stratification. Strong flows increase the strength of the gravitational circulation, resulting in higher vertical stratification, which leads to the nonlinear feedback between vertical mixing and stratification. The effect of sea-level rise on salinity intrusion is reduced owing to the suppression of mixing by stratification. Supporting three-dimensional simulations from northern San Francisco Bay are presented. The intrusion length scale L is used as a substitute for regulating inflows to ensure that sufficient fresh water is available to flush the Bay. Following a set of standards explicitly stated in the 1994 Bay-Delta Accord, a series of simulations is performed and we find that with sea-level rise stronger inflows are required to maintain L at the proposed locations.

TI Past, Present and Future Perspectives of Sediment Compaction as a Driver
   of Relative Sea Level and Coastal Change
SO CURRENT CLIMATE CHANGE REPORTS
AB Compaction describes a range of natural syn- and post-depositional processes that reduce the volume of sediments deposited in low-lying coastal areas, causing land-level lowering and a distortion of stratigraphic sequences. Compaction affects our reconstructions and understanding of historic sea levels, influences how relative sea level changes in the future and can act as a catalyst for rapid, widespread changes in coastal geomorphology. Rates of compaction-induced relative sea-level rise vary across space and through time in response to a range of natural and anthropogenically accelerated processes and conditions. This paper provides a summary of our understanding of the causes and effects of compaction, considering findings from key palaeoenvironmental and stratigraphic studies, sea-level reconstructions and recent observational data. It then considers the implications of these findings for our ability to project compaction-induced relative sea-level and associated coastal changes into the future.

TI Indian Ocean dynamic sea level, its variability and projections in CMIP6
   models
SO CLIMATE DYNAMICS
AB The regional sea level variability and its projection amidst the global sea level rise is one of the major concerns for coastal communities. The dynamic sea level plays a major role in the observed spatial deviations in regional sea level rise from the global mean. The present study evaluates 27 climate model simulations from the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) for their representation of the historical mean states, variability and future projections for the Indian Ocean. Most models reproduce the observed mean state of the dynamic sea level realistically; however, consistent positive bias is evident across the latitudinal range of the Indian Ocean. The strongest sea level bias is seen along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) regime owing to the stronger than observed south Indian Ocean westerlies and its equatorward bias. This equatorward shift of the wind field also results in a stronger positive windstress curl across the southeasterly trade wind regime in the southern tropical basin and an easterly wind bias along the equatorial waveguide. Owing to the anomalous easterly equatorial winds, the thermocline in the eastern tropical basin is shallower in the models than observed, resulting in enhanced variability there. Such spurious variability in the eastern part of the basin causes models to become biased towards the dipole zonal mode or Indian Ocean dipole patterns in the tropics. In the north Indian Ocean, the summer monsoon winds are weak in the model leading to weaker coastal upwelling and positive sea level bias along the western Arabian Sea. Further, it is noted that the high-resolution models compare better in simulating the sea level variability, particularly in the eddy-dominated regions like the ACC regime in interannual timescale. However, these improved variabilities do not necessarily produce a better mean state likely due to the spurious enhanced mixing driven by parametrizations set in these high-resolution models. Finally, the overall pattern of the projected dynamic sea level rise is similar for the mid (SSP2-4.5) and high-end (SSP5-8.5) scenarios, except that the magnitude is higher under the high emission situation. Notably, the projected dynamic sea level change is milder when only the best-performing models are used compared to the complete ensemble.

TI Late Holocene drying of Port Phillip Bay: archaeological and cultural
   perspectives
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
AB Evidence from bay floor channelling, seismic surveys and core dating has been used to suggest that Port Phillip Bay dried out for a period between about 2800 and 1000 cal. yr BP as sandbars blocked it off from the sea. This model is now supported by the examination of radiocarbon ages from archaeological excavations of Aboriginal shell middens on the shoreline of the Mornington Peninsula on Bunurong Country. This shows a near-continuous use of marine resources by Bunurong people over the last 6000 years for areas south of Rosebud, while those to the north are only of more recent date, following the refilling of the bay in the last millennium. This study provides an example of the integration of traditional, archaeological and geoscience evidence and the way in which local environmental changes impact on society.
   KEY POINTS 1. Radiocarbon dates from Aboriginal places support the argument that a sandbar blocked much of Port Phillip Bay from the sea between about 2800 and 1000 cal. yr BP. 2. Dates from Aboriginal places south of the sand bar show continuity since the bay formed following the post-Pleistocene rise in sea-levels. 3. Dates north of the sandbar indicate that Aboriginal people began exploiting marine resources in this area once the bay refilled about 1000 years ago.

TI Wet-bulb Temperature and Sea-level Rise in the United Arab Emirates -
   Planning Responses
SO PLANNING PRACTICE AND RESEARCH
AB Increased heat stress and sea-level rise, associated with climate change could threaten the viability of some cities by the latter part of this century. This paper reviews urban development patterns in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, and concludes these cities are highly vulnerable to elevated wet-bulb temperatures and sea level rise. This is predominantly due to the focus of development along the Gulf coastline, where these issues are concentrated. In response, this paper ventures regional planning responses to adapt to these threats through decentralising populations to inland areas.

TI Detecting changes in the transport of the Gulf Stream and the Atlantic
   overturning circulation from coastal sea level data: The extreme decline
   in 2009-2010 and estimated variations for 1935-2012
SO GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
AB Recent studies reported weakening in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and in the Gulf Stream (GS), using records of about a decade (RAPID project) or two (altimeter data). Coastal sea level records are much longer, so the possibility of detecting climatic changes in ocean circulation from sea level data is intriguing and thus been examined here. First, it is shown that variations in the AMOC transport from the RAPID project since 2004 are consistent with the flow between Bermuda and the U. S. coast derived from the Oleander measurements and from sea level difference (SLDIF). Despite apparent disagreement between recent studies on the ability of data to detect weakening in the GS flow, estimated transport changes from 3 different independent data sources agree quite well with each other on the extreme decline in transport in 2009-2010. Due to eddies and meandering, the flow representing the GS part of the Oleander line is not correlated with AMOC or with the Florida Current, only the flow across the entire Oleander line from the U.S. coast to Bermuda is correlated with climatic transport changes. Second, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) analysis shows that SLDIF can detect (with lag) the portion of the variations in the AMOC transport that are associated with the Florida Current and the wind-driven Ekman transport (SLDIF-transport correlations of similar to 0.7-0.9). The SLDIF has thus been used to estimate variations in transport since 1935 and compared with AMOC obtained from reanalysis data. The significant weakening in AMOC after similar to 2000 (similar to 4.5 Sv per decade) is comparable to weakening seen in the 1960s to early 1970s. Both periods of weakening AMOC, in the 1960s and 2000s, are characterized by faster than normal sea level rise along the northeastern U.S. coast, so monitoring changes in AMOC has practical implications for coastal protection.

TI Coastal Airports and Rising Sea Levels
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB Most of the world's major cities are located along coastlines, and their large international airports are typically built either very close to sea level or on filled shallow coastal waters. These large facilities handle thousands of flights and millions of passengers annually, and in addition to being critical infrastructure, they are huge economic engines. Being very close to sea level, however, many of these airports are already exposed to extreme flood events (hurricanes, typhoons, large storms, and high tides) and in the future will face increasing risks with global sea-level rise. LaGuardia, John F. Kennedy (JFK), and Newark all suffered some flood damage during Superstorm Sandy in 2012. San Francisco and Oakland airports have already developed plans to build walls to protect them from 2 to 3 ft (0.6 to 0.9 m) of additional sea-level rise. In addition to these airports, the Federal Aviation Administration has designated the airports at Philadelphia, Washington National, Miami, Tampa, Ft. Lauderdale, Louis Armstrong New Orleans, and Honolulu as atrisk from future storm surge and high water from extreme events. A rising ocean is inevitable and will be additive over time with extreme events. The existing elevations of individual airports combined with projections of future sea-level rise can provide important guidance on when these facilities are likely to be exposed to tidal flooding and, therefore, when airport management should begin to plan to respond or adapt to the future threats.

TI Revisiting historical sea level elevation in Israel from the British
   Mandate period through the present day (1922-2017)
SO JOURNAL OF GEODESY
AB Long-term series of reliable sea level (SL) data are essential for understanding the trends and causes of SL changes, for furthering knowledge about the effects of current climate change and for predicting future SL evolution. This study aims to extend the SL time series of measurements along the Israeli Mediterranean coastline by revisiting historical benchmarks (BM) along the Israeli coast, first determined by the British Survey of Palestine (SOP) at 1922 and later by the Survey of Israel (SOI) in 1995. By identifying and remeasuring the historical BM from Gaza to Imera (1922) and in Jaffa (1936), this study reconstructs the historical mean sea level (MSL), anchoring it to the present national height network, and extending the SL time series of equipped measurements along the Israeli coastline. Accordingly, the study provides long-term SL trends for the Levantine Basin. The long-term SL time series reveals an increasing trend in the 1920s, which moderates during the 1930s, a decreasing trend from the 1960s to the 1990s, and a rapid increasing trend in the 1990s. As a result, it can be deduced that the historical datum can reflect the historical MSL of its period, extend the long-term SL data and by that indicate for environmental changes. Based on long-term SL data (1956-2016) it can be determined that the MSL of Israel is 0.082 m relative to the 1995 Israeli datum.

TI Terrestrial palynology from marine cores as an indicator of
   environmental change for the Waipaoa Sedimentary System and
   north-eastern New Zealand
SO MARINE GEOLOGY
AB Diverse terrestrial palynomorph assemblages of Pleistocene to Recent age have been recovered from mainly marine sediment cores along the eastern New Zealand margin. These assemblages record a range of environmental changes including climate, deforestation, reforestation, rates of erosion, sediment provenance and age, volcanic activity, Polynesian and European settlement, strength and direction of ocean currents, astronomical cyclicity, and other major events many of which can be correlated with shorter onshore terrestrial sequences. As such, pollen yields valuable information on the dynamic New Zealand landscape, which is of particular relevance to a source-to-sink approach. This paper provides an integrated summary of published and unpublished late Pleistocene palynological studies off eastern North Island, New Zealand that gives context for an analysis of cores within and marginal to the Waipaoa Sedimentary System. Pollen assemblages faithfully reflect the last glacial vegetation dominated by grass- and shrub-land species together with elevated Tertiary pollen from enhanced erosion of the regolith. The glacial termination and Holocene were marked by establishment of podocarp forest, a mid-Holocene disappearance of sediment-trapping mangroves, and introduction of distal pollen with establishment of coastal current systems under rising sea level. These natural signals are overprinted by abrupt changes in pollen species caused by volcanic eruptions. Finally, endemic forest and shrub pollen were markedly reduced with human colonisation, associated land use changes and introduction of exotic species. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Existing at the transition between the terrestrial environment and hydrosphere, mangroves are sensitive to environmental change (e.g. sea-level rise). We present pollen and stable isotope data from a core (TCC1) of continuous (10 m) mangrove peat from Twin Cays, similar to12 km off of the coast of Belize, Central America. Radiocarbon dates on fragments of mangrove leaves preserved in TCC1 show that the core provides an 8600 C-14 year record of mangrove ecosystem changes. Variation in the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope composition (delta(13)C = similar to -30 to -25parts per thousand; delta(15)N = similar to -6 to 2parts per thousand) of mangrove leaves imply that the stand structure and nutrient Status of the mangroves at the site have changed during the Holocene. Pollen data from the same core show that the floral composition of the site has changed at points during the Holocene, most notably a brief (similar to240 years) switch at similar to3860 C-14 yr BP to dominance by a species of Myrsine (not currently present at the site). Our results are consistent with significant environmental changes (either marked disturbance from hurricanes or fluctuations in sea-level) through the Holocene.

TI Correlations and sequence stratigraphic model for Messinian carbonate
   platforms of the western and central Mediterranean
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
AB Distance correlations of Late Tortonian-Messinian littoral carbonate complexes are proposed from the study of eight platforms in the western and central Mediterranean. Correlations are based on the identification of two major biological sedimentary cycles and of two index surfaces. Surface A is a maximum flooding surface during cycle 1 at around 6.7 Ma. Surface B is a regional marine planation surface at around 5.95 Ma, at the base of cycle 2 (Terminal Carbonate Complex). A general sedimentary model is proposed for the 7-5.6-Ma time-span. The boundary between cycles 1 and 2 is coincident with the onset of the Messinian Salinity Crisis, and appears to be related to major environmental-paleo-oceanographic changes in the Mediterranean, rather than to a major sea-level drop or to climatic change.

TI The Perception and Impact of Natural Hazards on Fishing Communities of
   Kutubdia Island, Bangladesh
SO GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW
AB Natural hazards lead to unexpected and often dire situations for people who have few resources and little control over the environment in which they live. Kutubdia, an island in the southeastern part of Bangladesh, experiences frequent natural hazards that impact the livelihoods of its people and put them in vulnerable situations. The research elaborated here is the result of 300 household surveys collected from persons in Kutubdia's fishing communities. The surveys investigated the perception and consequences of natural hazards on the fishing communities. The results indicated that the experience of natural hazards-cyclones, erosion, and flooding are examples-have increased over the years. Coastal erosion displaced seventy-two (24 percent) fishers, forcing them to relocate their houses several times and imposing multiple challenges on their lives. Literacy was not associated with perceptions of environmental changes or changes in fishing. However, young fishers-less than forty years of age-perceived that environmental changes had affected fish catch more than their older colleagues.

TI Critical analysis of Mediterranean sea level limit cycles during the
   Messinian salinity crisis
SO GEOLOGICA ACTA
AB The Messinian Salinity Crisis (5.97-5.33Ma) may be one of the most significant periods of sea-level change in recent geologic history. During this period, evaporite deposition throughout the Mediterranean basin records a series of dramatic environmental changes as flow through the Strait of Gibraltar was restricted. In the first stage of evaporite deposition, cycles of gypsum appear in shallow basins on the margins of the Mediterranean. The complex environmental history giving rise to these cycles has been investigated for decades but remains controversial. Notably, whether the evaporites are connected to significant changes in Mediterranean sea level is an open question.
   In one proposed model, competition between tectonic uplift and erosion at the Strait of Gibraltar gives rise to self-sustaining sea-level oscillations-limit cycles-which trigger evaporite deposition. Here I show that limit cycles are not a robust result of the proposed model and discuss how any oscillations produced by this model depend on an unrealistic formulation of a key model equation. First, I simplify the model equations and test whether limit cycles are produced in 64 million unique combinations of model parameters, finding oscillations in only 0.2% of all simulations. Next, I examine the formulation of a critical model equation representing stream channel slope over the Strait of Gibraltar, concluding that a more realistic formulation would render sea-level limit cycles improbable, if not impossible, in the proposed model.

TI Late-Holocene environment and climatic changes in Ameralik Fjord,
   southwest Greenland: evidence from the sedimentary record
SO HOLOCENE
AB Sedimentological and geochemical (XRF) data together with information from diatom and benthic foraminiferal records of a 3.5 m long gravity core from Ameralik Fjord, southern West Greenland, is used for reconstructing late-Holocene environmental changes in this area. The changes are linked to large-scale North Atlantic ocean and climate variability. AMS C-14-dating of benthic foraminifera indicates that the sediment core records the last 4400 years and covers the termination of the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM). The late HTM (4.4-3.2 ka BP) is characterized by high accumulation rates of fine (silty) sediments related to strong meltwater discharge from the Inland Ice. The HTM benthic foraminiferal fauna demonstrates the presence of well-ventilated, saline bottom water originating from inflow of subsurface West Greenland Current water of Atlantic (Irminger Sea) origin. The hydrographic conditions were further characterized by limited sea ice probably related to a mild and relatively windy winter climate. After 3.2 ka BP lower fine-grained sedimentation rates, but a larger input from sea-ice rafted or aeolian coarse material prevailed. This can be related to colder atmospheric conditions with a decreased meltwater discharge and more widespread sea-ice cover in the fjord.

The annual linear rate of mean sea level rise in the Cuban archipelago, obtained from the longest tide gauge records, has fluctuated between 0.005 cm/year at Casilda and 0.214 cm/year at Siboney. The main sea level rise effects for the Cuban coastal zone due to climate change and global warming are shown. Monthly and annual mean sea level anomalies, some of which are similar to or higher than the mean sea level rise estimated for halfway through the present century, reinforce the inland seawater penetration due to the semi-daily high tide. The combination of these different events will result in the loss of goods and services, and require expensive investments for adaption.

TI Testing models of ice cap extent, South Georgia, sub-Antarctic
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB The extent of Last Glacial Maximum ice in South Georgia is contested, with two alternative hypotheses: an extensive (maximum) model of ice reaching the edge of the continental shelf, or a restricted (minimum) model with ice constrained within the inner fjords. We present a new relative sea-level dataset for South Georgia, summarising published and new geomorphological evidence for the marine limit and elevations of former sea levels on the island. Using a glacial isostatic adjustment model (ALMA) specifically suited to regional modelling and working at high spatial resolutions, combined with a series of simulated ice-load histories, we use the relative sea-level data to test between the restricted and extensive ice extent scenarios. The model results suggest that there was most likely an extensive Last Glacial Maximum glaciation of South Georgia, implying that the island was covered by thick (>1000 m) ice, probably to the edge of the continental shelf, with deglaciation occurring relatively early (ca.15 ka BP, though independent data suggest this may have been as early as 18 ka). The presence of an extensive ice cap extending to the shelf edge would imply that if there were any biological refugia around South Georgia, they must have been relatively localised and restricted to the outermost shelf.

TI Phylogeographic analyses of a migratory freshwater fish (Megalobrama
   terminalis) reveal a shallow genetic structure and pronounced effects of
   sea-level changes
SO GENE
AB Different types of fish taxa generally seem to present diverse phylogeographic structures and show different responses to environmental changes. In southern China, however, a large number of phylogeographic studies have been employed for small and/or benthic fish species, while phylogeographic patterns of larger and migratory species are not well understood. In this study, we chose Megalobrama terminalis, an endemic cyprinid from Southern China with a median size and relatively high migratory potential as a candidate to explore the phylogeographic structure and to seek the relevant driving forces using a multilocus approach (two mitochondrial markers and three nuclear markers). Our results show that M. terminalis exhibits three mtDNA genetic groups, each presenting genetic structure to the local geography, but the differentiation level was much weaker than that of small and/or benthic fish species reported in earlier studies. Nuclear loci did not observe pronounced genetic group subdivision, but did examine noteworthy genetic differentiation between the Hainan Island population and the mainland populations. Divergence time estimation and demographic analyses suggest that sea-level changes associated with the Late Pleistocene glacial cycles have exerted pronounced effects on the divergence of the three groups and the expansion of M. terminalis populations. Above all, our study provides important knowledge that can be used to improve monitoring programs and develop a conservation strategy for this endemic organism.

TI Satellite-Derived Trends in Inundation Frequency Reveal the Fate of
   Saltmarshes
SO FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB Some of the world's coastal saltmarshes experience loss in area due to environmental changes, such as relative sea level rise and limited sediment supply. We use satellite remote sensing to assess changes in inundation (flooding) frequency in tidal basins and investigate the bio-physical interactions with saltmarshes. We apply a simple automated method to retrieve time series of inundation frequency change and seaward habitat change of saltmarshes and tidal flats from Landsat-5 TM satellite imagery between 1985 and 2011, for a number of contrasting tidal basins (estuaries, deltas) globally. We evaluated the satellite-derived information on inundation frequency with such information obtained from elevation and tide gauge data for the Western Scheldt estuary, showing good agreement. Application of the method on all study sites reveal which tidal basins are stable or net emerging and which tidal basins are net drowning, but also show large spatial variation in the changes in inundation frequency within each basin. Tidal basins experiencing an overall significant increase in inundation frequency (Mississippi Delta and Venice Lagoon) were associated with an overall loss of saltmarsh area. Satellite-derived temporal and spatial information on inundation frequency helps to assess the fate of saltmarshes in light of sea level change, changes in sediment supply and subsidence.

TI The Silurian red beds of Tarim Basin: Signals of palaeoenvironment,
   palaeoclimate, and sea-level change
SO GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
AB The Silurian red beds of the Tarim Basin were formed in a coastal tidal and fluvial delta environment. They consist of red mudstone layers of the lower Tataaiertag Formation and separate the grey-green muddy sandstones of the Kalpintag Formation from the red sandstones of the upper Tataaiertag Formation. These mudstones are regarded as the most important regional seal for Silurian oil reservoirs. They contain a significant record of palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimate changes which is related to global sea-level changes. Based on a systematic and continuous sedimentary study and multiple geochemistry analyses of samples taken from the Sishichang outcrop profile in west of the Tarim Basin, the Early-Middle Silurian palaeoclimate and sea-level curve have been reconstructed. The Early-Middle Silurian Tarim Basin encountered five intervals of climate change, from humid transitioning to semi-humid and dry-hot climate which shows signs of generally increasing oxidation. The reconstructed sea-level curve indicates five sea-level cycles throughout the Early-Middle Silurian succession. The most significant sea-level drop occurred during the early Telychian stage, which represents the onset of the red mudstone section of the Tataaiertag Formation. This new sea-level curve shows some differences compared with the earlier proposed global sea-level curves. The dry-hot climate occurred during the late Telychian stage and the beginning of Wenlock age. The Early-Middle Silurian sea-level change of the Tarim Basin was mostly synchronical to the eustacy. However, regional tectonic activities during the early Telychian stage further enhanced the effect of the global sea-level fall and lead to a dry-hot climate trend which also caused the creation of the red beds of the Silurian period.

TI Middle to late Holocene delta plain evolution of the Kimotsuki lowland,
   Kyushu (southern Japan)
SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB The evolution of delta plains and coastal floodplains is commonly believed to be influenced by sea-level and climate changes. However, regional climate change influences on the evolution of delta plains and floodplains are poorly understood compared with responses to rapid sea-level rise since the last deglaciation. This study investigated the Kimotsuki lowland delta plain evolution (Kyusyu, southern Japan), including allogenic controls, based on 28 auger cores and 28 radiocarbon ages. Large-scale crevasse splay deposition occurred at 7000-6000 cal yr BP in response to sea-level rise or increased sediment supply following a volcanic eruption. Afterwards, widespread peat was formed in the absence of substantial fluvial sedimentation. Decreased precipitation from a weakened East Asian summer monsoon may have dried the peatlands around 4000 cal yr BP. With increasing precipitation and storminess around 2000 cal yr BP, peat formation resumed at areas further from the Kimotsuki River, while increased overbank flows deposited organic-rich mud near the river. These changes may reflect an increased frequency of La Nina events and higher ocean surface temperatures of the Kuroshio extension. The increased storminess around 2000 cal yr BP may have produced similar influences on delta plain and coastal floodplain evolution across the East Asia region. The results of this study suggest that regional climate change in the late Holocene has a potential to control the evolution of coastal floodplains and delta plains.

TI Stepwise accelerations in the rate of sea-level rise in the area north
   of Tokyo Bay during the Early Holocene
SO QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB Tokyo Bay is situated near the triple junction of the North America, Pacific, and Philippine Sea plates, where relative sea-level changes since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) have been strongly affected by subduction tectonics. In this study, 55 sea-level index points were extracted from the post-LGM incised valley fills beneath the lowlands north of Tokyo Bay and used to construct a detailed relative sea-level curve for the Early Holocene. Sea-level jumps were detected at 10.1-10.0, 9.2-9.1, and 8.9-8.7 ka, each of 2-7 m and each followed by an acceleration in the rate of sea-level rise. These paired phenomena are attributed to coseismic subsidence and an interseismic decrease in the rate of uplift, respectively. The Early Holocene sea-level changes in Tokyo Bay are characterized by remarkably short sea-level jumps of <100 years and accelerations in the rates of sea-level rise with relatively long durations of 200-800 years. After separating these tectonic effects from relative sea-level changes, sea-level jumps that have been hypothesized to be eustatic events, such as Meltwater Pulses 1C and 1D and the pre-8.2-ka event, were not identified based on a sea-level detection limit of 3 m, but a decrease in the rate of sea-level rise at 8.2 ka, which can be regarded as a global phenomenon, was verified in Tokyo Bay.

TI Interannual Sea Level Variations in the South China Sea Over 19502009
SO MARINE GEODESY
AB Spatial patterns of interannual sea level variations in the South China Sea (SCS) are investigated by analyzing an EOF-based 2-dimensional past sea level reconstruction from 1950 to 2009 and satellite altimetry data from 1993 to 2009. Long-term tide gauge records from 14 selected stations in this region are also used to assess the quality of reconstructed sea levels and determine the rate of sea level along the coastal area. We found that the rising rate of sea levels derived from merged satellite altimetry data during 19932009 and past sea level reconstruction over 19502009 is about 3.9 +/- 0.6mm/yr and 1.7 +/- 0.1 mm/yr, respectively. For the longer period, this rate is not significantly different from the global mean rate (of 1.8 +/- 0.3mm/yr). The interannual mean sea level of the SCS region appears highly correlated with Nino 4 indices (a proxy of El Nino-Southern Oscillation/ENSO), suggesting that the interannual sea level variations over the SCS region is driven by ENSO events. Interpolation of the reconstructed sea level data for 19502009 at sites where tide gauge records are of poor quality (either short or gapped) show that sea level along the Chinese coastal area is rising faster than the global mean rate of 1.8mm/yr. At some sites, the rate is up to 2.5mm/yr.

TI SUBSIDENCE, ACCRETION, AND SEA-LEVEL RISE IN SOUTH SAN-FRANCISCO BAY
   MARSHES
SO LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Accelerated sea level rise that is predicted to occur as a result of the greenhouse effect is likely to have a significant effect on the world's salt marshes.  For salt-marsh vegetation to remain productive and even to survive in a period of rising sea level, the marsh must accrete sufficient sediment to maintain the marsh surface within an appropriate tidal range.  Accretion and subsidence were studied in three south San Francisco Bay salt marshes that differed greatly in subsidence over the past few decades.  Marsh accretion as a result of sedimentation and peat formation has been able to compensate for high rates of subsidence and the low rate of sea level rise and to maintain the elevation of the marsh surface above mean high water (MHW).  South San Francisco Bay appears to be a sediment-rich system that transports enough sediment by tidal action and during storm events to compensate for sea level rise and subsidence in the fringing salt marshes.

TI LONG-TERM SEA-LEVEL VARIATIONS IN THE CENTRAL GREAT-BARRIER-REEF
SO CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
AB Low frequency sea-level variations and associated geostrophic currents in the central Great Barrier Reef(GBR) region near Townsville are studied using optimally-lagged multivariate regression. The analyses show that pressure-adjusted coastal sea levels and mid-shelf geostrophic currents are influenced predominantly by local along-shelf wind stress at the weather time-scale, and by climatic variables, such as atmospheric pressure and temperature, at seasonal and interannual time-scales. These forcing variables can specify sea levels over annual and inter-annual time-scales with a forecasting skill of 0.53 and 0.22, respectively (where 1.0 is perfect skill). Associated along-shelf geostrophic currents can be forecast with a skill of 0.57 over an annual time scale. If, instead, absolute coastal sea levels or offshore sea-level differences are used to specify the along-shelf geostrophic current, the forecasting skill is 0.75. A characteristic El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) response is detected for time periods up to 25 years in monthly sea-level both at Townsville and at western Pacific island sea-level stations. This spatially coherent response varies in intensity and phase within the Coral Sea. Sea-level differences show a pattern which characterizes known features of the large-scale circulation of the Coral Sea. These very low frequency sea-level variations in the Coral Sea must be taken into account to obtain accurate predictions of along-shelf geostrophic current variations on seasonal and inter-annual time scales. Regression analysis and a diagnostic river plume model show that the influence of the major rivers can produce sea-level changes due to buoyancy of order 5 cm. The corresponding errors in geostrophic velocities estimated using pressure-adjusted Townsville sea-level data alone are of order 5 cm s(-1) rms.

TI Environmental changes in the Amur Bay (Japan/East Sea) during the last
   150 years revealed by examination of diatoms and silicoflagellates
SO OCEAN SCIENCE JOURNAL
AB Siliceous unicellular microalgae - diatoms and silicoflagellates from sediments in Amur Bay were analyzed with high temporal resolution to examine changes over the last 150 years. The age of sediments was estimated from unsupported Pb-210 controlled by Cs-137. Siliceous microalgae examined in each cm of two sediment cores demonstrated significant changes in the ecological structure of the assemblages that reflected changes in sedimentation conditions. During the years 1860-1910 the sediments accumulated under the great influence of river runoff. For about the next 50 years the number of freshwater species and marine benthic diatoms in sediments sharply declined, which is probably connected with the weakening of the effects of river runoff due to deforestation. Since the early 1960s the sedimentation conditions in the Amur Bay changed significantly. Marine planktonic diatoms and silicoflagellates began to prevail in sediments and this reflects increasing microphytoplankton productivity. One consequence of this was the formation of seasonal bottom hypoxia in Amur Bay. The ecological structure of diatom and silicoflagellate assemblages indicates that the sea level began to rise since the early 1960s and this corresponds to the water and air temperature increase in the area for that period. The obtained data suggest that the environmental changes over the last 150 years in Armur Bay are associated with the weakening of river runoff due to deforestation, sea level rise caused by global warming, and the increase of siliceous microplankton productivity that resulted in the formation of seasonal bottom hypoxia.

TI HOLOCENE CLIMATE AND RELATIVE SEA LEVEL CHANGES IN CAUVERY RIVER DELTA,
   INDIA BASED ON POLLEN AND SEDIMENTARY RECORDS
SO JOURNAL OF THE PALAEONTOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
AB Climate induced minor relative sea level oscillations, brought by either natural or anthropogenic factors involves serious impact on the economy of coastal habitation that largely sustains millions of people living along the vast stretch of coastal areas in tropics. Relative sea level changes that occurred during the last 7000 cal BP affecting the coastal vegetation have been documented through palynology in sedimentary cores/trenches retrieved from the Vellar estuary (VE) and Thillaividangan village (TVG) which are 3 km and 10 km away from the coast, respectively in the northeastern Cauvery river delta. Around 6000-7000 cal BP both sites show marine palynomorphs thereby indicating palaeoshoreline extending inland to about 10 km. Retreat in shoreline post 5700 cal BP from TVG and stray presence of salt tolerant Avicennia species from Vellar was recorded. Around 2440 cal BP true mangroves rejuvenated in Vellar indicating approximately 2-3 km ingression of sea water due to configurational changes in the coastal wetland likely induced by geomorphological changes influenced by weakened monsoon that is evidenced by the low percentage of terrestrial and mangrove pollen. At 4000 cal BP, evidences of marine palynomorphs in Vellar, Pichavaram and Coleroon is at present mean sea level but in TS Pettai the marine signatures are about 4m below present mean sea level suggesting similar to 2-3 m subsidence in TS Pettai i.e. the middle part of North-eastern Cauvery delta which facilitated more diverse mangroves in this part of delta.

   Guerra-Merchan
SO MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY
AB The marine context of the Lago Mare deposit near Malaga has received agreement as well as its ascription to the third Lago Mare event of Clauzon et al. (2005). This deposit is not a "transitional unit towards normal marine conditions" but followed the marine reflooding of the Mediterranean Basin, allowing the connection with the Dacic Basin (Eastern Paratethys). We show that this Lago Mare event did not result from a climatic change leading to a dilution episode but from a high sea-level connection. Different interpretations on the respective effects of tectonics and eustatism on the sedimentary archives linked to the Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC) are once more debated. They depend on (1) the duration assigned to the MSC and its subdivisions, (2) the amplitude of the successive sea level variations, and at last (3) the dimensional (local or regional) view of the MSC. Such discrepancies concern subsidiary matters which cannot mask first order facts and progresses in their knowledge. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Late Weichselian fluvial evolution on the southern Kara Sea Shelf, North
   Siberia
SO GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
AB Glaciations had a profound impact on the global sea-level and particularly on the Arctic environments. One of the key questions related to this topic is, how did the discharge of the Siberian Ob and Yenisei rivers interact with a proximal ice sheet? In order to answer this question high-resolution (1-12 kHz), shallow-penetration seismic profiles were collected on the passive continental margin of the Kara Sea Shelf to study the paleo-drainage pattern of the Ob and Yenisei rivers. Both rivers incised into the recent shelf, leaving filled and unfilled river channels and river canyons/valleys connecting to a complex palco-drainage network.
   These channels have been subaerially formed during a regressive phase of the global sea-level during the Last Glacial Maximum. Beyond recent shelf depths of 120 in particle transport is manifested in submarine channel-levee complexes acting as conveyor for fluvial-derived fines. In the NE area, uniform draping sediments are observed. Major morphology determining factors are (1) sea-level fluctuations and (2) LGM ice sheet influence. Most individual channels show geometries typical for meandering rivers and appear to be an order of magnitude larger than recent channel profiles of gauge stations on land.
   The Yenisei paleo-channels have larger dimensions than the Ob examples and could be originated by additional water release during the melt of LGM Putoran ice masses.
   Asymmetrical submarine channel-levee complexes with channel depths of 60 in and more developed, in some places bordered by glacially dominated morphology, implying deflection by the LGM ice masses. A total of more than 12,000 km of acoustic profiles reveal no evidence for an ice-dammed lake of greater areal extent postulated by several workers. Furthermore, the existence of the channel-levee complexes is indicative of unhindered sediment flow to the north. Channels situated on the shelf above 120-m water depth exhibit no phases of ponding and or infill during sea-level lowstand. These findings denote the non-existence of an ice sheet on large areas of the Kara Sea shelf. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Documenting a thousand years of environmental and anthropogenic changes
   on mangroves on the Bangkok coast, the upper Gulf of Thailand
SO VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY
AB Environmental changes and human activities in a mangrove ecosystem in Bang Khun Thian, south of Bangkok, the upper Gulf of Thailand were reconstructed through the analyses of pollen, charcoal, organic carbon, carbonate, particle size, heavy metals and radiocarbon dating. The results showed that fluctuating sea levels supported mangrove establishment since at least ad 840. From ad 840 to 1240, a delta progradation from the Lower Chao Phraya river was recorded with associated dry conditions. A short period characterized by wetter conditions was recorded from ad 1050-1240. After ad 1240, mangroves were gradually replaced by terrestrial grasses indicative of a period of sea-level fall with relatively drier conditions. There was extension of the intertidal shoreline of Bang Khun Thian farther south allowing open grassland and wetland to form as a young deltaic plain until around ad 1660. During this period, intense agricultural practices, particularly paddy and orchards, expanded in the Lower Chao Phraya delta during this marine regression. From ad 1660, an upper intertidal habitat was gradually re-established, characterised by the presence of back mangroves that possibly result from sea-level rise in the last 300 years. The pollen and heavy metal data also track increasingly intensive human activities such as agriculture, aquaculture, urbanisation and industrial activity in the catchment during the last century.

TI National-Scale Built-Environment Exposure to 100-Year Extreme Sea Levels
   and Sea-Level Rise
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Coastal flooding from extreme sea levels will increase in frequency and magnitude as global climate change forces sea-level rise (SLR). Extreme sea-level events, rare in the recent past (i.e., once per century), are projected to occur at least once per year by 2050 along many of the world's coastlines. Information showing where and how built-environment exposure increases with SLR, enables timely adaptation before damaging thresholds are reached. This study presents a first national-scale assessment of New Zealand's built-environment exposure to future coastal flooding. We use an analytical risk model framework, "RiskScape", to enumerate land, buildings and infrastructure exposed to a present and future 100-year extreme sea-level flood event (ESL100). We used high-resolution topographic data to assess incremental exposure to 0.1 m SLR increases. This approach detects variable rates in the potential magnitude and timing of future flood exposure in response to SLR over decadal scales. National built-land and asset exposure to ESL100 flooding doubles with less than 1 m SLR, indicating low-lying areas are likely to experience rapid exposure increases from modest increases in SLR expected within the next few decades. This highlights an urgent need for national and regional actions to anticipate and adaptively plan to reduce future socio-economic impacts arising from flood exposure to extreme sea-levels and SLR.

TI Sea-level rise, depth-dependent carbonate sedimentation and the paradox
   of drowned platforms
SO SEDIMENTOLOGY
AB A mathematical model of carbonate platform evolution is presented in which depth-dependent carbonate growth rates determine platform-top accumulation patterns in response to rising relative sea-level. This model predicts that carbonate platform evolution is controlled primarily by the water depth and sediment accumulation rate conditions at the onset of relative sea-level rise. The long-standing paradox of a drowned platform arose from the observation that maximum growth rate potentials of healthy platforms are faster than those of relative sea-level rise. The model presented here demonstrates that a carbonate platform could be drowned during a constant relative sea-level rise whose rate remains less than the maximum carbonate production potential. This scenario does not require environmental changes, such as increases in nutrient supply or siliciclastic sedimentation, to have taken place. A rate of relative sea-level rise that is higher than the carbonate accumulation rate at the initial water depth is the only necessary condition to cause continuous negative feedbacks to the sediment accumulation rates. Under these conditions, the top of the carbonate platform gradually deepens until it is below the active photic zone and drowns despite the strong maximum growth potential of the carbonate production factory. This result effectively resolves the paradox of a drowned carbonate platform. Test modelling runs conducted with 2.5 m and 15 m initial sea water depths at bracketed rates of relative sea-level rise have determined how fast the system catches up and maintains the keep-up phase. This is the measure of time necessary for the basin to respond fully to external forcing mechanisms. The duration of the catch-up phase of platform response (termed carbonate response time) scales with the initial sea water depth and the platform-top aggradation rate. The catch-up duration can be significantly elongated with an increase in the rate of relative sea-level rise. The transition from the catch-up to the keep-up phases can also be delayed by a time interval associated with ecological re-establishment after platform flooding. The carbonate model here employs a logistical equation to model the colonization of carbonate-producing marine organisms and captures the initial time interval for full ecological re-establishment. This mechanism prevents the full extent of carbonate production to be achieved at the incipient stage of relative sea-level rise. The increase in delay time due to the carbonate response time and self-organized processes associated with biological colonization increase the chances for platform drowning due to deepening of water depth (> ca 10 m). Furthermore this implies a greater likelihood for an autogenic origin for high-frequency cyclic strata than has been estimated previously.

TI High-precision chronostratigraphy of a Late Pleistocene shelf-edge
   delta, Louisiana
SO JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH
AB The accurate dating of depositional sequences and sea-level changes is essential in the search for hydrocarbons and in the study of global climatic changes. Graphic correlation is a precise and accurate technique that integrates diverse types of time-significant data and compares the events in a new section with the complete range of those events in a reference data base. Graphic correlation is a quantitative method of analyzing complex data to evaluate and test hypotheses of chronostratigraphy,
   During the Late Pleistocene glacio eustatic lowstands, sand-prone deltas were deposited at the Louisiana shelf edge. Regional seismic stratigraphic boundaries traced on the seismic data have been tied to important sequence stratigraphic contacts in four coreholes on the outer shelf and upper slope, Fossil abundances and diversities contributed to the interpretation of depositional systems tracts, The ages of these contacts are dated by the graphic correlation integration of fossil tops and oxygen isotope events in two of the cores.
   Four regional unconformities and five transgressive surfaces were cored in two wells within the uppermost 250 m of section on the shelf margin and upper slope. These contacts were graphically correlated with a composite standard reference section containing oxygen isotope events dated in deep sea cores (DSDP 502, 552A, 572, ODP 607 and 625), Lowstand events are dated at 332 ka, 254 ka, 168 ka, and 70 ka, Transgressive sea level-rise events are dated at 475 ka, 313 ka, 209 ka, 125-133 ka, and 14-16 ka, These data define the timing of sea-level changes recorded southeast of the ancestral Mississippi River. The timing of these events compares with sequence boundaries elsewhere in the Gulf of Mexico dated at 400 ka, 200 ka, and 90 ka by Martin et al, (1993), The differences in ages mag be a result of the incompleteness of the sediment preserved at each site. Although the sequence boundaries record glacio eustatic events, their timing is not periodic and does not represent a single Milankovitch frequency. This seeming inconsistency may be a clue to the influence of complex sedimentary processes. Perhaps not all the events have been recorded in this section. Application of continental glacial stages to these events is not recommended.

AB Global climatic change, as defined by the U. S. Global Change Research Act of 1990 (GCRA), "means changes in the global environment ( including alterations in climate, land productivity, oceans or other water resources, atmospheric chemistry, and ecological systems) that may alter the capacity of the Earth to sustain life". Climatic changes are the most drastic variables interacting with all live aspects of the world's development equation. Global warming, melting glaciers, sea level rise with increased coastal erosions, increased rate of lake evaporation, green house effects, increased ocean acidity, increased rates of biological invasions and deteriorated biodiversity are the interacting variables. There is a very clear fact that climatic change is not a country made product, however, it is a trans-continental issue. The abrupt surge in the catastrophic consequences of climatic changes was primarily derived from the hydrologic changes in global water that gradually moved forward toward the land. This fact puts the aquatic species on the top list of the most impacted creatures. As an ideal example for the regional impacts of global climatic changes, the coastal zones of the Levantine Mediterranean Sea at the basins of countries like Egypt, Israel and Lebanon are on an ongoing process of continuous coastal land erosions with subsequent fisheries recession due to critical damage of the breeding habitats of the native fishes at such pristine areas of the world. Further, the historical opening of Suez Canal in 1869 was a triggering force behind the development of many ecological changes in the Levantine Mediterranean as well as the Egyptian territories from the Red Sea basin. Such climatic changes have favoured the move of some invasive species like Rabbit fish and Erythrean mytilid mussel from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea with their consequent huge negative impacts on the native biodiversity of the southeast Mediterranean. Other detrimental factors that will ultimately lead to great impact on the aquatic biodiversity are the inland aquaculture, eutrophication; aquatic habitat destruction and fragmentation. Thus, without a real creative international initiative to save the world's ecosystem from the colossal destructive effects of climatic changes, there will be possible endangering effects on all living creatures on planet earth.

TI SEA LEVEL RISE AND THE INCREASE IN RUBBLE MOUND BREAKWATER DAMAGE
SO COASTAL STRUCTURES 2011, VOL 1 & 2
CT 6th International Conference on Coastal Structures
CY SEP 06-08, 2011
CL Yokohama, JAPAN
SP ASCE COPRI, Kajima Fdn
AB Sea level rise could threaten the stability of rubble mound breakwaters in the future, as greater water depth will allow larger waves to reach these structures. Particularly worrying, however, is the prospect of an acceleration in the pace of sea level rise as a result of climate change, especially after 2050. This could lead to a change in the philosophy behind the design of breakwaters and ports, leading to substantial increases in the cost to build and maintain these costly structures. Particularly there would have to be a shift in the main parameter used to calculate breakwater sections from the significant wave height (H-s) to the limiting breaker height (H-b), due to future uncertainties in wave climate. The likely increases in breakwater costs due to this shift in design philosophy were evaluated for 4 different rates of sea level rise showing that for the more extreme cases of sea level rise (for a sea level rise of 1.3m over 50 years) a breakwater designed in 2050 would be between around 8% and 66% more expensive than one designed in the 20th century not taking into account sea level rise.

TI Assessing the Impacts of Sea Level Rise on Salinity Intrusion and
   Transport Time Scales in a Tidal Estuary, Taiwan
SO WATER
AB Global climate change has resulted in a gradual sea level rise. Sea level rise can cause saline water to migrate upstream in estuaries and rivers, thereby threatening freshwater habitat and drinking-water supplies. In the present study, a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model was established to simulate salinity distributions and transport time scales in the Wu River estuary of central Taiwan. The model was calibrated and verified using tidal amplitudes and phases, time-series water surface elevation and salinity distributions in 2011. The results show that the model simulation and measured data are in good agreement. The validated model was then applied to calculate the salinity distribution, flushing time and residence time in response to a sea level rise of 38.27 cm. We found that the flushing time for high flow under the present condition was lower compared to the sea level rise scenario and that the flushing time for low flow under the present condition was higher compared to the sea level rise scenario. The residence time for the present condition and the sea level rise scenario was between 10.51 and 34.23 h and between 17.11 and 38.92 h, respectively. The simulated results reveal that the residence time of the Wu River estuary will increase when the sea level rises. The distance of salinity intrusion in the Wu River estuary will increase and move further upstream when the sea level rises, resulting in the limited availability of water of suitable quality for municipal and industrial uses.

AB An extensive unconformity surface has been reported on top of the Changxing Formation in northeastern Sichuan Basin, which was formed by the end-Permian sea level drop globally. The amplitude of sea level change has never been studied in Changxing Formation, however, this is a problem of vital importance in petroleum exploration. Logging curves of boreholes located in Longgang, Puguang and Yuanba areas are used to analyze the intensity of karst, which can be used to represent the amplitude of sea level drop. Four, two and two logging phases are identified in Longgang, Yuanba and Puguang areas, respectively, which indicate different combinations of sedimentary facies and diagenesis features. By analyzing the thickness of karst formations in the studied sections, the amplitudes of sea level drop are identified in different areas. Combined with karst features reflected from Permian Panlongdong Outcrop, the amplitude of end-Permian sea level drop is at least 190 m in Sichuan Basin.

TI A 500 kyr record of global sea-level oscillations in the Gulf of Lion,
   Mediterranean Sea: new insights into MIS 3 sea-level variability
SO CLIMATE OF THE PAST
AB Borehole PRGL1-4 drilled in the upper slope of the Gulf of Lion provides an exceptional record to investigate the impact of late Pleistocene orbitally-driven glacio-eustatic sea-level oscillations on the sedimentary outbuilding of a river fed continental margin. High-resolution grain-size and geochemical records supported by oxygen isotope chronostratigraphy allow reinterpreting the last 500 ka upper slope seismostratigraphy of the Gulf of Lion. Five main sequences, stacked during the sea-level lowering phases of the last five glacial-interglacial 100-kyr cycles, form the upper stratigraphic outbuilding of the continental margin. The high sensitivity of the grain-size record down the borehole to sea-level oscillations can be explained by the great width of the Gulf of Lion continental shelf. Sea level driven changes in accommodation space over the shelf cyclically modified the depositional mode of the entire margin. PRGL1-4 data also illustrate the imprint of sea-level oscillations at millennial time-scale, as shown for Marine Isotopic Stage 3, and provide unambiguous evidence of relative high sea-levels at the onset of each Dansgaard-Oeschger Greenland warm interstadial. The PRGL1-4 grain-size record represents the first evidence for a one-to-one coupling of millennial time-scale sea-level oscillations associated with each Dansgaard-Oeschger cycle.

SO MEDITERRANEAN SEA: ITS HISTORY AND PRESENT CHALLENGES
AB This chapter illustrates the main trends of interlaced forces acting on the development of the Mediterranean landscape during the Holocene. The mosaic of habitats distributed in the Mediterranean basin has been continuously transformed by climatic changes occurring at a global scale during the early, mid and late Holocene. In the meantime, the environment has been exploited and the landscape shaped by different civilizations. Climate changes and human activities are observed through the lens of pollen found in terrestrial and marine sediment cores and in archaeological layers. Joint actions of increasing dryness, climate oscillations, and human impact are hard to disentangle, and this becomes particularly true after the mid-Holocene onset of Bronze Age cultures. Regional differences and similarities are reported for eastern, central and western Mediterranean, and for northern Africa and Sahara. The mixing of cultures accelerated the exchanges of ideas, technologies, raw materials and people along the coasts of this 'great lake', making the different civilizations linked between them as one network of regions belonging to the 'Mediterranean culture'.

AB Eustatic curves show that no oscillation in sea-level exceeding 8 cm occurred during Late Holocene. Therefore shore platforms and shorelines cannot be generated by these low-amplitude fluctuations. Shore platforms and shorelines uplifted along the Scilla Fault are of coseismic origin and not of eustatic origin. Notches cannot be related to unreliable fluctuations in sea level and without taking into account different uplift rates in Southern Calabria. The transgression model with first abrasion then burying a plunging cliff does not fit reality.

Good correlation of the increased SiO2/Al2O3 and K2O/Al2O3 values in the Priekule section with positive delta C-13 excursions recognized worldwide suggests that these sea depth changes correspond to global sea level changes. The curves composed indicate a moderate long-range sea level low stand from the Sheinwoodian to the middle Ludfordian, superimposed with larger sea level falls in the lower Sheinwoodian, upper Homerian and middle Ludfordian. The Telychian and upper Ludfordian are characterized by sea level high stands.

TI Quaternary sequence stratigraphy of onshore Abu Dhabi Emirate
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
AB Glacially driven eustatic sea-level fluctuations have left a clear signature only along the coastal regions and barrier islands of the Abu Dhabi Emirate. Four marine sequences are identifiable although others are known to exist offshore. The stratigraphy is complicated by aeolian processes associated especially with the Shamal winds which have blown from the northwest to create dune fields that dominate the Quaternary sedimentation. Whilst aeolian facies can clearly be identified separating marine incursions along the coastal regions, aeolian deflation has complicated the stratigraphy by recycling sediment partly in response to loss of windward sediment sources during marine transgressions and partly in response to glacially driven climatic changes. Unravelling the sequence stratigraphy of the desert dunes inland, especially beyond the coastal sabkhas, is therefore extremely difficult. The late Quaternary aeolian dunes and their veneer of mobile aeolian sands are grouped into a single poorly defined formation which spans the entire timescale of the sequences identified along the coast.

AB In this chapter, we analyze the patterns of vicariance and dispersal in fossil horses and the relationship with the environmental changes. We found that predominance of the dispersal events over vicariant ones is consistent with the migratory habits of horses. Ancestral distribution for the Equini tribe was ranged widely across North America. This distribution could have been succeeded during the middle to late Miocene, a time of tectonic and climatic change, and an increasing number of grasslands.

TI Punctuated environmental change along the Holocene (< 6 ka) bank margin
   of south-west Exuma Sound, Bahamas
SO SEDIMENTOLOGY
AB Characteristics of environmental change along the Holocene (<6 ka BP) bank margin of south-west Exuma Sound, Bahamas, are defined by comparing mineral, isotope and lithologic stratigraphic patterns in deep-water (1081 m) slope strata in ODP Hole 631A (Exuma Sound) with proximal (approximate to 6 km) shoal-water and insular geology of the Lee Stocking Island (LSI) region. After platform submergence, a bank-top transition from non-skeletal- to skeletal-dominated deposition occurred in the LSI region by approximate to 3.8 ka, and is recorded in the adjacent slope sediments by a contemporaneous change in the abundance of transported allochems. The transition at Site 631 is punctuated by an anomalous shift in foraminiferal delta(13)C (-1 parts per thousand) and delta(18)O (-3 parts per thousand), which may represent a period of climate change that established a brackish coastal zone at least 6 km wide, coincident (approximate to 3.8-4 ka) with bank-top erosion and pedogenesis. Non-skeletal allochems reappeared in Hole 631A sediments as the dominant transported allochem type by approximate to 2.4 ka, then again over the last several hundred years, and are contemporaneous with periods of increased platform-margin circulation in the LSI region. Such rejuvenation of platform circulation may have resulted from rapid relative rises in sea level, superimposed on the net gradual post-glacial rise. At Site 631, a prominent (25%) decline in aragonite abundance occurred during the period from 2.4 ka to the last few hundred years, and coincided with an increase in magnesian calcite and skeletal debris, and a positive shift in foraminiferal delta(18)O values. These patterns lend support to the hypothesis that, during this period, the LSI margin was barred by skeletal shoals, allowing bank-top trapping of aragonite and hypersaline water, with increased coastal salinity (resulting from reflux of hypersaline waters through the shoals) and/or cooled coastal waters (caused by reduced exchange of warmed bank-derived water relative to wind-generated upwelling). Along the Exuma slope, a diagenetic overprint may further enhance the recent decline in aragonite accumulation. Integration of Holocene deepwater slope and bank-top stratigraphies along the bank margin of south-west Exuma Sound reveals a pattern of punctuated environmental change superimposed on longer term development of interglacial conditions.

TI Benthic macroinvertebrate community response to environmental changes
   over seven decades in an urbanized estuary in the northeastern United
   States
SO MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Narragansett Bay is representative of New England, USA urbanized estuaries, with colonization in the early 17th century, and development into industrial and transportation centers in the late 18th and early 20th century. Increasing nationwide population and lack of infrastructure maintenance led to environmental degradation, and then eventual improvement after implementation of contaminant control and sewage treatment starting in the 1970s. Benthic macroinvertebrate community structure was expected to respond to these environmental changes. This study assembled data sets from the 1950s through 2010s to examine whether quantitative aggregate patterns in the benthic community corresponded qualitatively to stressors and management actions in the watershed. In Greenwich Bay and Providence River, patterns of benthic response corresponded to the decline and then improvement in sewage treatment at the Fields Point wastewater treatment plant. In Mount Hope Bay, the benthos corresponded to changes in bay fish populations due to thermal discharge from the Brayton Point power plant. The benthos of the Upper West Passage corresponded to climatic changes that caused regime shifts in the plankton and fish communities. Future work will examine the effects of further environmental improvements in the face of continued climatic changes and population growth.

TI Approaching tipping points: a focussed review of indicators and
   relevance to managing intertidal ecosystems
SO WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB Abrupt ecosystem regime shifts from one state to another can occur in response to environmental change (such as climate/sea level change). Detecting an approaching tipping point may help management to adapt to or mitigate the effects of catastrophic change. Intertidal wetlands are one of the most vulnerable ecosystems, faced with climate, sea level and anthropogenic changes. Early warning indicators of regime shifts that may be evident include slowing recovery rates from perturbation, increased autocorrelation and variance, changing skewness and self-organised patchiness. We examine these indicators using intertidal examples and discuss the limitations. Managers cannot adapt to or mitigate the effects of state shifts over tipping points if there is no way to detect early warning signals. This detection is highly dependent on system-specific modelling and requires understanding of alternate stable states theory and its application in large, complex ecosystems.

TI The submerged paleolandscape of the Maltese Islands: Morphology,
   evolution and relation to Quaternary environmental change
SO MARINE GEOLOGY
AB After the end of the Last Glacial Maximum, 450 km(2) of former terrestrial and coastal landscape of the Maltese Islands was drowned by the ensuing sea level rise. In this study we use high resolution seafloor data (multibeam echosounder data, seismic reflection profiles, and Remotely Operated Vehicle imagery) and bottom samples to reconstruct similar to 300 km(2) of this submerged Maltese paleolandscape. The observed paleolandscape is exceptionally well preserved and comprises former coastal landforms - (i) fault-related escarpments, (ii) paleoshore platforms and associated shorelines, (iii) paleoshoreline deposits, and (iv) mass movement deposits - and former terrestrial landforms - (v) river valleys, (vi) alluvial plains, (vii) karstified limestone plateaus, and (viii) sinkholes. These elements indicate that the paleolandscape has been primarily shaped by tectonic activity combined with fluvial, coastal, slope instability and karstic processes; these are the same processes the shaped the current terrestrial and coastal landscape. By correlating the identified landforms with the timing of known changes in sea level during the last glacial cycle, we infer that the alluvial plains and the shallowest limestone plateaus had up to 100 kyr to develop, whereas the paleoshoreline deposits are likely to have formed between 28 kyr and 14 kyr. The most prominent paleoshore platforms, shorelines and river valleys were generated between 60 kyr and 20 kyr. Fluvial erosion is likely to have been prevalent during periods of low sea level (Last Glacial Maximum and stadial conditions during MIS 3), whereas karst processes should have been more effective during warm and humid interstadial periods. Our results have implications for improving the characterization of past environments and climates, as well as providing a much needed background for prehistoric and geoarcheological research in the central Mediterranean region.

TI Impacts of natural and human drivers on the multi-decadal morphological
   evolution of tidally-influenced deltas
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING
   SCIENCES
AB The world's deltas are at risk of being drowned due to rising relative sea levels as a result of climate change, decreasing supplies of fluvial sediment, and human responses to these changes. This paper analyses how delta morphology evolves over multidecadal timescales under environmental change using a process-based model. Model simulations over 102 years are used to explore the influence of three key classes of environmental change, both individually and in combination: (i) varying combinations of fluvial water and sediment discharges; (ii) varying rates of relative sea-level rise; and (iii) selected human interventions within the delta, comprising polder-dykes and cross-dams. The results indicate that tidal asymmetry and rate of sediment supply together affect residual flows and delta morphodynamics (indicated by sub-aerial delta area, rates of progradation and aggradation). When individual drivers of change act in combination, delta building processes such as the distribution of sediment flux, aggradation, and progradation are disrupted by the presence of isolated polder-dykes or cross-dams. This suggests that such interventions, unless undertaken at a very large scale, can lead to unsustainable delta building processes. Our findings can inform management choices in real-world tidallyinfluenced deltas, while the methodology can provide insights into other dynamic morphological systems.

TI Contribution of Wave Setup to Projected Coastal Sea Level Changes
SO JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB Along open coasts, wind waves are a key driver of coastal changes and can be major contributors to coastal hazards. Wind wave characteristics are projected to change in response to climate change, notably due to changes in atmospheric circulation patterns and the associated surface winds. Here, a first-order estimate of projected 20-yr mean wave setup changes, excluding extreme events and subannual variability, is provided for sandy beaches along most of the world's coastline over the middle and end of the 21st century. Calculations are based on an ensemble of wave model projections under the representative concentration pathways (RCP) 8.5 and on empirical formulations for wave setup. Projected wave setup changes are compared to other contributors currently accounted for in regional sea level projections to extend existing projections of 21st century coastal sea level changes. Projected wave setup changes exhibit a clear spatial heterogeneity and mostly average out at global scale. However, at regional or local scale, wave setup changes are a small yet nonnegligible contributor to total coastal sea level 20-yr mean changes (which include global mean sea level rise, GMSLR) over the middle and end of the 21st century. Wave setup can be a substantial contributor to local departures of coastal sea level changes from GMSLR. Wave setup changes should therefore be included in projections of regional patterns of coastal sea level changes. The reported long-term changes in wave setup also advocate for the inclusion of nonstationary wave contributions to projected regional patterns of coastal sea level changes, including for studies on extreme events.

   PALEOCEANOGRAPHIC AND PALEOCLIMATIC SIGNIFICANCE
SE Society for Sedimentary Geology Special Publication
AB The uppermost Cretaceous marine red beds from the Romanian Carpathian bend area were investigated in detail from the lithostratigraphic and biostratigraphic points of view. Geochemical and mineralogical investigations were performed along the same profile. The investigated sequence spans the Upper Campanian and the whole Maastrichtian stages, including the K-T boundary, as evidenced by the nannofloral mass extinction and the well known carbon isotope excursion. Both qualitative and semiquantitative calcareous nannofossil studies were conducted. The semiquantitative investigations focused on six taxonomic groups, such as Watznaueria barnesae, Micula spp., Boreal nannofossils, Tethyan nannofossils, Braarudosphaera bigelowii, and the calcareous dinoflagellate genus Thoracosphaera. The new data indicate constant delta C-13 values in the Upper Campanian and Lower Maastrichtian red marls of the Gura Beliei Formation. In the Upper Maastrichtian deposits of the lalomica section, lithological and mineralogical changes, together with several negative delta C-13 and delta O-18 excursions, suggest instability of the ecosystems, fluctuating sea level, and/or detrital input as well as climatic changes during the Late Maastrichtian interval. The age and the lithology of the Gura Beliei red beds are similar to other red beds deposited in the Tethys Realm (i.e., the Nierental Formation of Austrian Northern Calcareous Alps, the Puchov Marl of the Slovakian and Polish Western Carpathians, the Vojvodina region of Serbia, and the Scaglia Rossa of Apennines).

TI Thresholds of sea-level rise rate and sea-level rise acceleration rate
   in a vulnerable coastal wetland
SO ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB Feedbacks among inundation, sediment trapping, and vegetation productivity help maintain coastal wetlands facing sea-level rise (SLR). However, when the SLR rate exceeds a threshold, coastal wetlands can collapse. Understanding the threshold helps address key challenges in ecologynonlinear response of ecosystems to environmental change, promotes communication between ecologists and resource managers, and facilitates decision-making in climate change policies. We studied the threshold of SLR rate and developed a new threshold of SLR acceleration rate on sustainability of coastal wetlands as SLR is likely to accelerate due to enhanced anthropogenic forces. Deriving these two thresholds depends on the temporal scale, the interaction of SLR with other environmental factors, and landscape metrics, which have not been fully accounted for before this study. We chose a representative marine-dominated estuary in the northern Gulf of Mexico, Grand Bay in Mississippi, to test the concept of SLR thresholds. We developed a mechanistic model to simulate wetland change and then derived the SLR thresholds for Grand Bay. The model results show that the threshold of SLR rate in Grand Bay is 11.9mm/year for 2050, and it drops to 8.4mm/year for 2100 using total wetland area as a landscape metric. The corresponding SLR acceleration rate thresholds are 3.02x10(-4)m/year(2) and 9.62x10(-5)m/year(2) for 2050 and 2100, respectively. The newly developed SLR acceleration rate threshold can help quantify the temporal lag before the rapid decline in wetland area becomes evident after the SLR rate threshold is exceeded, and cumulative SLR a wetland can adapt to under the SLR acceleration scenarios. Based on the thresholds, SLR that will adversely impact the coastal wetlands in Grand Bay by 2100 will fall within the likely range of SLR under a high warming scenario (RCP8.5), highlighting the need to avoid RCP8.5 to preserve these marshes.

TI SOUTH-AFRICAN SEA-LEVEL MEASUREMENTS IN THE GLOBAL CONTEXT OF SEA-LEVEL
   RISE
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
AB Examination of historical instrument records of temperature and sea level in tectonically stable areas around the world have shown a global warming of about 0.5-degrees-C and a eustatic rise in sea level of between 10 mm and 15 mm/decade over the last century.  Sea-level measurements around South Africa are available only from 1959 onwards and their analyses show trends comparable with global trends of sea-level rise.  The best long tide gauge record is from Port Nolloth and shows a rise in relative sea level over the period 1960 to 1988 of 12.3 mm/decade at the 95% confidence level.  Comparison with an Argentinian relative sea-level curve indicates some basin-wide coherence in water levels on approximately a 5-year time scale.  South African sea surface temperatures (SST) also show historical increases comparable with other global SST estimates.
   On the basis of agreement between historical South African and globally estimated trends, predictions of future sea-level rise around South Africa are adopted from globally modelled studies.  Sea level in South Africa is expected to rise by approximately 20 cm within the next 40 years and may increase further to up to 100 cm by the end of the next century.  The rate of increase of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases is shown to be the best indicator of continued sea-level rise.

TI Diatom responses to long-term climate and sea-level rise at a
   low-elevation lake in coastal British Columbia, Canada
SO ECOSPHERE
AB Diatom assemblages from Lake Stowell, a low-elevation lake in coastal British Columbia, were used to assess limnological responses associated with changes in relative sea level (RSL) and climate over the past 14,500 yr. Marine diatom taxa dominated the early record and disappeared abruptly by 14,000 cal yr BP in response to glacio-isostatic uplift and an ensuing decrease in RSL. A brackish-freshwater phase from 14,200 to 13,400 cal yr BP was marked by increases in several diatom taxa with tolerance for low-to-moderate salinity, after which assemblages became strictly freshwater. Biostratigraphic changes in both diatom and chironomid assemblages from Lake Stowell occurred more or less simultaneously throughout the record in response to long-term changes in climate forcings, such as temperature. Increases in cold-adapted diatom (Staurosirella pinnata, Staurosira construens, Staurosirella dubia) and chironomid (Sergentia) taxa between 12,900 and 11,700 cal yr BP coincided with Younger Dryas cooling, suggesting a direct link with summer temperature. Shifts in aquatic biota also reflected indirect mechanisms through which climate affected the Lake Stowell ecosystem, for example, by altering thermal stratification, disturbance regimes, and nutrient concentrations. For instance, high summer insolation and warm summer temperatures from 11,700 to 8500 cal yr BP were associated with greater abundances of Stephanodiscus hantzschii and especially Aulacoseira subarctica. A concurrent opening of the forest canopy triggered by warming would have exposed the lake to strong winds and enhanced mixing, favoring these more heavily silicified taxa as an indirect consequence of climatic changes. Diatom assemblages appear to have been impacted by the deposition of Mount Mazama tephra at 7600 cal yr BP; a notable increase in Aulacoseira tenella suggests a response to increased silica availability in association with tephra deposition.

TI Role of climate in the rise and fall of Neolithic cultures on the
   Yangtze Delta
SO BOREAS
AB Climatic changes in the Yangtze Delta have played an important role in the emergence, persistence and collapse of civilization. Archaeological excavations in the region over many years have demonstrated that there are several layers of fine sand or organic mud that interrupt the consecutive culture strata in a number of Neolithic culture sites. Continuous biostratigraphical and sedimentological records from the Maqiao cultural site, Shanghai, suggest that the fine sand and organic mud units resulted from expansion of water bodies both by sea-level fluctuations and from increased flooding during cold and humid episodes of Holocene climates. The absence of human settlement from 7240 BP to 5320 BP in the region was mainly caused by higher sea levels resulting from a warm and humid climate. The Neolithic cultures developed under conditions of lower and more stable sea level as well as warmer and dryer climates between about 4410 BP and 3250 BP. A flood-induced lake expansion interrupted the civilization in the region at about 4200 BP. Later, higher water tables and expansion of lakes between 3250 BP and AD 618 under a cold and moist climate temporarily terminated settlement on the delta. Later, during the Tang Dynasty, beginning at about AD 618, the region again became suitable for human settlement under conditions of more favourable climate and lower water tables.

TI Sedimentary architecture of the Bohai Sea China over the last 1 Ma and
   implications for sea-level changes
SO EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
AB Sedimentary architecture dominated by transgression-regression cycles in the shallow Bohai shelf region contains information about global sea-level, climate and local tectonics. However, previous studies of transgression-regression cycles in this region at orbital timescales that extend back to the early Pleistocene are sparse, mainly because of the shortage of well-dated long cores. Although transgression regression sedimentary cycles in the region have been interpreted in terms of local tectonics, sea level, and climate change, the detailed structure of marine transgressions and their significance for Quaternary global sea-level variations remains to be examined. In this study, we present an integrated sedimentological, geochemical and paleontological study of a 212.4 m (similar to 1 Ma) core (BH08) recovered from the Bohai Sea, China, for which an astronomically-based age model is available. Correspondence between marine-terrestrial sedimentary cycles and global sea-level fluctuations suggests that stacking of marine and terrestrial sediments was driven mainly by glacio-eustatic sea-level fluctuations in a context in which tectonic subsidence was largely balanced by sediment supply over the last similar to 1 Ma. We report a dominant 100-kyr cycle beginning at similar to 650 ka, which reflects the worldwide influence of the mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT) in sea-level records. We find that neritic deposits after the MPT were relatively thicker than before the MPT, which indicates an important control of the MPT on sedimentary architecture through lengthening of the duration of sea-level highstands.

TI Pleistocene raised marine deposits of the Cap Bon peninsula (N-E
   Tunisia): Records of sea-level highstands, climatic changes and coastal
   uplift
SO GEOMORPHOLOGY
AB Morphostratigraphic and sedimentological studies were undertaken in the Cap Bon peninsula, north-eastern Tunisia. These studies have identified a series of middle to late Pleistocene-age marine deposits discontinuously cropping out on three raised platforms (Pf I, Pf II and Pf III). These stepped marine platforms (terraces) were related to the interplay between Pleistocene sea-level changes and progressive uplift movement during Quaternary period. We present here a description of facies organization and stratigraphic characteristics of the platform deposits, and their relation with eustatic and climatic variations. All the marine platforms unconformably overlie a Mio-Pliocene and Quaternary slope succession. The sedimentary sequences represented by mixed carbonate and siliciclastic bodies are related to the succession of highstand shorelines and contrasting climate conditions. The intercalated soils and calcretization occurred during episodes of relative sea-level fall. The oldest platforms (Pf I and Pf II), found at an elevation of about + 100 m and + 60 m respectively, have so far no equivalent in the northern, in the eastern or in the southern coasts of Tunisia. They are correspondingly attributed to MIS 11/13 and MIS 9/11. The youngest and lowest platform (Pf III) attains an altitude of + 40 m and shows three high-frequency cycles of sea-level rise and fall, probably associated with Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e and MIS 7.

TI Demographic changes in Pleistocene sea turtles were driven by past sea
   level fluctuations affecting feeding habitat availability
SO MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB Pleistocene environmental changes are generally assumed to have dramatically affected species' demography via changes in habitat availability, but this is challenging to investigate due to our limited knowledge of how Pleistocene ecosystems changed through time. Here, we tracked changes in shallow marine habitat availability resulting from Pleistocene sea level fluctuations throughout the last glacial cycle (120-14 thousand years ago; kya) and assessed correlations with past changes in genetic diversity inferred from genome-wide SNPs, obtained via ddRAD sequencing, in Caribbean hawksbill turtles, which feed in coral reefs commonly found in shallow tropical waters. We found sea level regression resulted in an average 75% reduction in shallow marine habitat availability during the last glacial cycle. Changes in shallow marine habitat availability correlated strongly with past changes in hawksbill turtle genetic diversity, which gradually declined to -1/4th of present-day levels during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 26-19 kya). Shallow marine habitat availability and genetic diversity rapidly increased after the LGM, signifying a population expansion in response to warming environmental conditions. Our results suggest a positive correlation between Pleistocene environmental changes, habitat availability and species' demography, and that demographic changes in hawksbill turtles were potentially driven by feeding habitat availability. However, we also identified challenges associated with disentangling the potential environmental drivers of past demographic changes, which highlights the need for integrative approaches. Our conclusions underline the role of habitat availability on species' demography and biodiversity, and that the consequences of ongoing habitat loss should not be underestimated.

TI Multiple Physiological Responses to Multiple Environmental Challenges:
   An Individual Approach
SO INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY
AB The injection of anthropogenically-produced CO2 into the atmosphere will lead to an increase in temperature and a decrease in pH at the surface of the oceans by 2100. Marine intertidal organisms possess the ability to cope in the short term with environmental fluctuations exceeding predicted values. However, how they will cope with chronic exposure to elevated temperature and pCO(2) is virtually unknown. In addition, individuals from the same species/population often show remarkable levels of variation in their responses to complex climatic changes: in particular, variation in metabolic rates often is linked to differences in individuals' performances and fitness. Despite its ecological and evolutionary importance, inter-individual variation has rarely been investigated within the context of climatic changes, and most investigations have typically employed orthogonal experimental designs paired to analyses of independent samples. Although this is undoubtedly a powerful and useful approach, it may not be the most appropriate for understanding all alterations of biological functions in response to environmental changes. An individual approach arguably should be favored when trying to describe organisms' responses to climatic change. Consequently, to test which approach had the greater power to discriminate the intensity and direction of an organism's response to complex climatic changes, we investigated the extracellular osmo/iono-regulatory abilities, upper thermal tolerances (UTTs), and metabolic rates of individual adults of an intertidal amphipod, Echinogammarus marinus, exposed for 15 days to combined elevated temperature and pCO(2). The individual approach led to stronger and different predictions on how ectotherms will likely respond to ongoing complex climatic change, compared with the independent approaches. Consequently, this may call into question the relevance, or even the validity, of some of the predictions made to date. Finally, we argue that treating individual differences as biologically meaningful can lead to a better understanding of the physiological responses themselves and the selective processes that will occur with complex climatic changes; selection will likely play a crucial role in defining species' responses to future environmental changes. Individuals with higher metabolic rates were also characterized by greater extracellular osmo/iono-regulative abilities and higher UTTs, and thus there appeared to be no evolutionary trade-offs between these functions. However, as individuals with greater metabolic rates also have greater costs for maintenance and repair, and likely a lower fraction of energy available for growth and reproduction, trade-offs between life-history and physiological performance may still arise.

TI Late-surviving megafauna in Tasmania, Australia, implicate human
   involvement in their extinction
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Establishing the cause of past extinctions is critical if we are to understand better what might trigger future occurrences and how to prevent them. The mechanisms of continental late Pleistocene megafaunal extinction, however, are still fiercely contested. Potential factors contributing to their demise include climatic change, human impact, or some combination. On the Australian mainland, 90% of the megafauna became extinct by approximate to 46 thousand years (ka) ago, soon after the first archaeological evidence for human colonization of the continent. Yet, on the neighboring island of Tasmania (which was connected to the mainland when sea levels were lower), megafaunal extinction appears to have taken place before the initial human arrival between 43 and 40 ka, which would seem to exonerate people as a contributing factor in the extirpation of the island megafauna. Age estimates for the last megafauna, however, are poorly constrained. Here, we show, by direct dating of fossil remains and their associated sediments, that some Tasmanian megafauna survived until at least 41 ka (i.e., after their extinction on the Australian mainland) and thus overlapped with humans. Furthermore, a vegetation record for Tasmania spanning the last 130 ka shows that no significant regional climatic or environmental change occurred between 43 and 37 ka, when a land bridge existed between Tasmania and the mainland. Our results are consistent with a model of human-induced extinction for the Tasmanian megafauna, most probably driven by hunting, and they reaffirm the value of islands adjacent to continental landmasses as tests of competing hypotheses for late Quaternary megafaunal extinctions.

TI The coral conservation crisis: interacting local and global stressors
   reduce reef resiliency and create challenges for conservation solutions
SO SN APPLIED SCIENCES
AB Coral reefs are one of the most productive and biodiverse ecosystems in the world. Humans rely on these coral reef ecosystems to provide significant ecological and economic resources; however, coral reefs are threatened by numerous local and global anthropogenic factors that cause significant environmental change. The interactions of these local and global human impacts may increase the rate of coral reef degradation. For example, there are many local influences (i.e., sedimentation and submarine groundwater discharge) that may exacerbate coral bleaching and mortality. Therefore, researchers and resource managers cannot limit their narratives and actions to mitigating a sole stressor. With the continued increase in greenhouse gas emissions, management strategies and restoration techniques need to account for the scale at which environmental change occurs. This review aims to outline the various local and global anthropogenic stressors threatening reef resiliency and address the recent disagreements surrounding present-day conservation practices. Unfortunately, there is no one solution to preserve and restore all coral reefs. Each coral reef region is challenged by numerous interactive stressors that affect its ecosystem response, recovery, and services in various ways. This review discusses, while global reef degradation occurs, local solutions should be implemented to efficiently protect the coral reef ecosystem services that are valuable to marine and terrestrial environments.

TI Linear and nonlinear sea-level changes at Durban, South Africa
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
AB The tide record between 1970 and 2003 for Durban, South Africa, is analysed to determine the extent of recent linear and nonlinear sea-level trends in the light of predicted global sea-level rise. Given the stability of the adjacent land mass, Durban is ideally suited to test global sea-level change. The linear trends of monthly mean sea level revealed a sea-level rise of 2.7 +/- 0.05 mm/yr and the yearly mean sea-level trend revealed a rise of 2.4 +/- 0.29 mm/yr. Nonlinear trends varied between -1 mm and +8 mm/yr. These findings are similar to recently published results of global sea-level rise calculations over the last ten years derived from worldwide tide gauge and TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter measurements, which range between 2.4 and 3.2 mm/yr.

AB Climate change impacts are functioning as risk multipliers to problems which are already apparent and affect cultural heritage sites. Sea Level Rise and increased storm events can damage structures that were not designed to withstand prolonged structural pressure, erosion, and immersion. Risks affecting coastal cultural heritage may stem from exposure to one or more hazards and it is important to facilitate a holistic understanding of factors driving them. Wave energy and overtopping of coastal structures represents a potential hazard for people, property and infrastructure. Especially when the coastal structure is a monument or landmark, mitigation measures and monitoring are needed. Depending on the level of acceptable risk and required degree of certainty related to wave overtopping, coastal engineers rely on predictions from semi-empirical desktop methods and numerical models for answers. Moreover, the anticipated increase in extreme events due to climatic change make protection and prevention action even more necessary. In this work the combination of risk assessment analysis related to increasing sea level and storm frequency, wave numerical modelling, breakwater design and economic sustainability is presented. As a case study, the Venetian Coastal walls of the city of Heraklion are considered. Numerical modelling results were generally found to be consistent with overtopping wave measurements. For the analysis of the wind regime in the near and far future, climatic modelling has been used. Climatic modelling results indicate that for the coastal area of Heraklion the wind speed and directions are expected to change in the near and far future, with an increase in wind speeds but also an increase in the frequency of the wind directions that effect the monuments the most. Based on the results of the measurements and numerical modelling, mitigation actions were proposed that include, increasing the submerged armouring of the Venetian City walls and the use of natural based solutions for low slope areas in order to reduce wave energy, run up and overtopping, reconstruction of the natural environment, so that the monument can be made accessible for longer periods of time.

TI Neogene to Quaternary evolution of carbonate and mixed
   carbonate-siliciclastic systems along New Caledonia's eastern margin (SW
   Pacific)
SO MARINE GEOLOGY
AB Neogene and Quaternary shallow-water carbonate records surrounding New Caledonia main island, Grande Terre, provide a good example for understanding the stratigraphic architecture of tropical mixed carbonate-siliciclastic systems. Due to a southeastern tilt of the eastern margin, the eastern shelf of Grande Terre has been better preserved from erosion than the western part, favouring the development and preservation of shallow-water carbonates. Based on the integration of bathymetric and seismic data, along with paleoenvironmental and biostratigraphic constraints derived from dredged carbonate rocks, a comprehensive geomorphological and architectural characterization of the offshore eastern margin of Grande Terre has been made. During the Mio-Pliocene, a wide, up to 750 m-thick carbonate build-up developed and extended over at least 350 km from north to south. This Mio-Pliocene build-up, currently lying at 300 to 600 m water depths, is overlain by a Pleistocene-Holocene barrier reef-lagoon complex and associated slope deposits. The switch from aggrading Neogene carbonate banks to backstepping Quaternary platforms likely reflects an increase in accommodation due to a high subsidence rate or to relative sea-level rise, and/or results from a switch in carbonate producers associated with global environmental changes. The internal architecture of the Quaternary barrier reef-lagoon complex is highlighted, especially the development of lowstand siliciclastic prisms alternating with transgressive shallow-water carbonate sequences. This pattern agrees with the reciprocal sedimentation model typically invoked for mixed sedimentary systems. This stratigraphic pattern is well developed in front of the Cap Bayes inlet in the north of our study area, yet it is not observed southward along the eastern margin. This difference suggests that other factors than relative sea-level variations directed the architecture of the margin, such as low terrigenous inputs, lagoon paleo-drainage networks or sediment by-pass towards deep basins.

AB To investigate dominant sea level variations in the Korea Strait (KS) and to find their responsible factors, Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis was performed on the non-seasonal components of sea level, wind, and sea level pressure data from 1993 to 2014. The non-seasonal sea level variation accounts for 20% of the total sea level variations in the KS. The first EOF mode of the sea level explains 63.8% of the total variance and represents strait-wide simultaneous sea level oscillations. EOF analysis on the surface wind data over the KS and the East China Sea was performed and the first EOF of winds, explaining 49.5% of the total variance, represents the strength of the northeasterly wind. The amplitude time series of the first EOF s from wind and sea level data has correlation coefficients (r) of 0.48. The sea level and wind data have common spectral peaks at periods of 5.1 and 10.2 months. Variance and the first EOF of the steric height in the KS are relatively high around Jeju Island while they are small near the south coast of Korea. Correlation between the amplitude time series of sea level and steric height first modes is low (r = 0.20). The basin-wide simultaneous sea level variations with intra-seasonal and interannual periods in the KS are found to be modulated by variations in the regional surface winds and sea level pressure patterns over the East China Sea and the KS rather than by changes in local steric height.

TI Facies analysis and sea-level change at the Guadalupian-Lopingian Global
   Stratotype (Laibin, South China), and its bearing on the end-Guadalupian
   mass extinction
SO JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY
AB The Guadalupian-Lopingian boundary stratotype at Penglaitan, and the nearby Tieqiao section, near Laibin, South China, record a series of major environmental changes within the Jiangnan Basin during a Mid-Permian biotic crisis. The sequence-stratigraphic, petrographic and palaeontological record of these sections has been studied and the associated strontium isotopic fluctuations have been assayed. Mass extinction of fusulinid foraminifers is most clearly associated in time with onset of volcanism and a relative sea-level fall that led to the establishment of mid-ramp conditions (Laibin Limestone) in settings that were previously dominated by radiolarian mudstones. The regression also coincides with a low point of Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios. The lowstand deposits contain mafic scoriaceous grains that record pyroclastic volcanism probably centred in the Emeishan flood basalt province 800 km to the west of Laibin. Thus, unusually violent eruptions associated with flood basalts in this province may have contributed to the environmental stresses responsible for the extinction event. Subsequent environmental changes included transgression, spread of dysoxic waters, indicated by populations of small pyrite framboids, and a major negative C-isotope excursion. All these phenomena have been previously related to the end-Guadalupian extinction but they in fact post-date the crisis because a post-extinction fauna of foraminifers is encountered at this time.

TI Cycles of coral reef 'turn-on', rapid growth and 'turn-off' over the
   past 8500 years: a context for understanding modern ecological states
   and trajectories
SO GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB Human activities threaten reef ecosystems globally, forcing ecological change at rates and scales regarded as unprecedented in the Holocene. These changes are so profound that a cessation of reef accretion (reef 'turn-off') and net erosion of reef structures is argued by many as the ultimate and imminent trajectory. Here, we use a regional scale reef growth dataset, based on 76 core records (constrained by 211 radiometric dates) from 22 reefs along and across the inner-shelf of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, to examine the timing of different phases of reef initiation ('turn-on'), growth and 'turn-off' during the Holocene. This dataset delineates two temporally discrete episodes of reef-building over the last 8500 years: the first associated with the Holocene transgression-early highstand period [similar to 8.5-5.5 k calibrated years bp (cal ybp)]; the second since similar to 2.3 k cal ybp. During both periods, reefs accreted rapidly to sea level before entering late evolutionary states - states naturally characterized by reduced coral cover and low accretion potential - and a clear hiatus occurs between these reef-building episodes for which no records of reef initiation exist. These transitions mimic those projected under current environmental disturbance regimes, but have been driven entirely by natural forcing factors. Our results demonstrate that, even through the late Holocene, reef health and growth has fluctuated through cycles independent of anthropogenic forcing. Consequently, degraded reef states cannot de facto be considered to automatically reflect increased anthropogenic stress. Indeed, in many cases degraded or nonaccreting reef communities may reflect past reef growth histories (as dictated by reef growth-sea level interactions) as much as contemporary environmental change. Recognizing when changes in reef condition reflect these natural 'turn-on' - growth - 'turn-off' cycles and how they interact with on-going human disturbance is critical for effective coral reef management and for understanding future reef ecological trajectories.

TI Marine events and coastal settlements in Southwestern Iberia
SO CUATERNARIO Y GEOMORFOLOGIA
AB One of the most dynamic parts of the earth system is where terrestrial processes interact with marine processes on the coast. Changes in relative sea level, coastal evolution and extreme events such as storms and tsunamis are of local and global interest. Such events hinder individual well-being and intensify/enhance environmental degradation. In a changing world, in which climate and sea-level change impact on human habitats, geoarchaeological research is highly relevant. The way past cultures coped with environmental change and natural hazards provide important lessons for human responses to future environmental changes. Geomorphological, palaeoenvironmental and sedimentological approaches in geoarchaeological studies frequently lack the integration of archaeological and historical data. This special issue of the journal "Cuaternario y Geomorfologia" therefore aims to provide a multidisciplinary platform to define the present state of geoarchaeological science throughout the Iberian coast of the Gulf of Cadiz. All the contributions will stimulate the debate on new approaches to study human-environmental interaction and address research themes such as 'palaeo-geohazards' (e.g. tsunami, earthquake and coastal and fluvial flooding).

TI Effects of Holocene sea level changes on subtidal palaeoecosystems,
   southeastern Brazil
SO MARINE GEOLOGY
AB Southeastern Brazilian marine coastal deposits provide an excellent opportunity to investigate environmental changes such as sea level and trophic variability during the Holocene period. In this study, we present a sediment record from Arraial do Cabo Bay, Rio de Janeiro State. In order to improve the understanding of the upper subtidal palaeoecosystem evolutionary dynamics of this Bay, we provide a microfacies analysis of Holocene carbonate and mixed siliciclastic-carbonate deposits cropping out today from the supratidal to the subtidal zones. The age depth model is based on C-14 dating and revealed a basal age of similar to 7000 cal. years BP. In the six distinguished microfacies, the biogenic components are dominated by vermetids and coralline algae. A number of subordinate components are also present, including the microfacies determining thin-shelled bivalves. Fossil vermetids are represented by monospecific clusters of overgrowing Petaloconchus varians. Coralline red algae are represented by Lithophyllum pustulatum, Spongites fruticulosus, Spongites yendoi, Mesophyllum engelharti, and unidentified geniculate corallines. The microfacies analysis revealed that the substrate of the benthic community in the upper subtidal ecosystem of the Bay changed according to the relative sea level: (1) during the rapid sea transgressive trend it was coarse soft substrate, (2) after the postglacial sea level maximum succeeding a slow decline to present sea level it changed into fine soft substrate. At similar to 7000 years ago the coarse soft substrate was characterised by fruticose corallines and composed of quartz grains from continental run off input. After the postglacial sea level maximum the highstand elevation along with the established upwelling system brought about a predominantly carbonate deposition. Vermetids and corallines, along with thin-shelled bivalves, thrived in a low sedimentation rate setting and high nutrient level environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Climate change, ecosystem services and migration in the Marshall
   Islands: are they related?
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
AB As one of the lowest-lying island nation states in the world, the Republic of the Marshall Islands is vulnerable to sea level rise, flooding and the associated impacts on soil and water salinity. Persistent drought is further affecting agricultural production and access to drinking water, and heat stress is increasingly common. The number of Marshallese people residing in the USA has increased rapidly from 6650 in 2000 to an estimated 30,000 in 2018. While we know that climate change is already affecting the Marshall Islands and that there are significant migration flows, we do not know to what extent people already migrate because of climate change. This paper addresses this gap and presents findings from interdisciplinary fieldwork in the Marshall Islands and destination areas in the USA. The research team conducted a survey (N = 278), focus group discussions, expert interviews and a geo-spatial analysis of flood extent and migration rates to study the relationship between climatic events, ecosystem services and migration. The results show that respondents primarily cite education, health care, work and family visits as migration drivers, and only few mention climate impacts or environmental change. However, respondents do identify impacts of climate change on their livelihoods, health and safety, and the study finds significant correlations between climate impacts, trends in ecosystem services and migration propensities at household level. Furthermore, 62% of Marshallese respondents in the USA indicated that climate change affects their decision to return to Marshall Islands in the future.

AB Global climate change implies difficulties for coastal communities where activities are highly influenced by climate. This paper examines the case of seaweed harvesting in the community of Pisco-Peru. Aspects of environmental change that impact seaweed harvesting include global warming, "El Nino" events, pollution of marine space, declines of marine species, and the rupture of ecological cycles.
   We look for relationships between local ecological knowledge (LEK) related to climate and other environmental change and strategies for coping with and adapting to current and anticipated change.
   This project is developed through a participative methodology, with the participation of university researchers and the community of seaweed extractors, and builds on an ongoing study of collaborative approaches to research and development of the algae industry in this region.
   Research questions include: the nature of the LEK held and shared; the extent to which LEK includes: the effects of climate changes on resources, harvesting and communities; and the contribution of LEK to industry resilience, harvester livelihoods and community well-being.
   The results of the research provide insight into LEK accumulation about algae species, management, and impacts of global environmental change. Documenting methods of collecting, analyzing and sharing harvester knowledge is an additional contribution.

CL Southampton, ENGLAND
AB With sea levels projected to rise as a result of climate change, it is imperative to understand not only long-term average trends, but also the spatial and temporal patterns of extreme sea level. In this study, we use a comprehensive set of 30 tide gauges spanning 1954-2014 to characterize the spatial and temporal variations of extreme sea level around the low-lying and densely populated margins of the South China Sea. We also explore the long-term evolution of extreme sea level by applying a dynamic linear model for the generalized extreme value distribution (DLM-GEV), which can be used for assessing the changes in extreme sea levels with time. Our results show that the sea-level maxima distributions range from similar to 90 to 400 cm and occur seasonally across the South China Sea. In general, the sea-level maxima at northern tide gauges are approximately 25-30% higher than those in the south and are highest in summer as tropical cyclone-induced surges dominate the northern signal. In contrast, the smaller signal in the south is dominated by monsoonal winds in the winter. The trends of extreme high percentiles of sea-level values are broadly consistent with the changes in mean sea level. The DLM-GEV model characterizes the interannual variability of extreme sea level, and hence, the 50-year return levels at most tide gauges. We find small but statistically significant correlations between extreme sea level and both the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and El Nino/Southern Oscillation. Our study provides new insight into the dynamic relationships between extreme sea level, mean sea level and the tidal cycle in the South China Sea, which can contribute to preparing for coastal risks at multi-decadal timescales.

TI Delineating sequence stratigraphic patterns in deeper ramp carbonates:
   Quantitative palynofacies data from the Upper Jurassic (Kimmeridgian) of
   southwest Germany
SO JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH
AB The delineation of sequence stratigraphic patterns in deeper ramp carbonates is notoriously difficult using sedimentological criteria. Hence, in an effort to better understand the processes controlling the formation of deeper-water carbonate ramps, fully quantitative palynofacies analyses were carried out on two cores from the Upper Jurassic (Kimmeridgian) of the Swabian Marl Basin, SW Germany. To eliminate the effect of variable carbonate content, absolute palynoclast abundances (i.e., particles per gram of sediment) were calculated with respect to the non-carbonate fraction of the original sediment. The palynofacies data were supplemented by bulk sediment. oxygen isotope data and sedimentological information.
   Terrestrial and marine palynoclast groups show in-phase, cyclical absolute abundance patterns in both cores investigated. Highest carbonate-adjusted absolute abundances of terrigenous palynoclasts are interpreted to indicate sea-level lowstands and vice versa. The in-phase distribution of marine and terrestrial palynoclast groups points towards a coupling between the terrestrial and marine realms. Increased absolute abundances of terrigenous palynoclasts are interpreted to represent intervals of enhanced land-derived nutrient input into the marine system. Such higher nutrient availability would have caused higher phytoplankton productivity as evidenced in increased absolute abundances of marine palynomorphs. Hence, marine productivity in the epeiric setting of the Swabian Marl Basin was strongly controlled by the nutrient flux from the surrounding landmasses.
   In the palynofacies and bulk sediment delta O-18 records, two hierarchies of sequences are recognized. Well-pronounced medium-scale sequences (with thicknesses of 5-20 m) are built by the stacking of smaller-scale sequences (with thicknesses of 3-7 m). Heavier delta O-18 values coincide with high absolute abundances of terrigenous palynoclasts. Based on this observation, a model for environmental fluctuations is proposed. Time intervals with high sea level were characterized by relatively high water temperatures, whereas time intervals with low sea level coincided with relatively low water temperatures. Estimates of ammonite zone ages available from the literature were used to constrain the duration of medium-scale sequences. When taking into account the range of dating uncertainties, the obtained value of ca. 370 kyr appears reasonably close to the duration of the 400 kyr eccentricity cycle. We speculate that the formation of medium-scale sequences as evidenced in our palynoclast and delta O-18 records may be related to eccentricity-driven insolation changes that caused sea-level changes, with higher insolation leading to a sea-level rise. This would imply that the regional record of sea-level and temperature fluctuations within the epeiric Swabian Marl Basin reflects climatic changes that occurred on a more global scale. The integration with sedimentological data shows that marl-dominated intervals were deposited during early sea-level rise and under cooler conditions, whereas limestone-dominated intervals formed during intervals of high sea level and under warmer conditions.

TI Rapid glaciation and a two-step sea level plunge into the Last Glacial
   Maximum
SO NATURE
AB The approximately 10,000-year-long Last Glacial Maximum, before the termination of the last ice age, was the coldest period in Earth's recent climate history(1). Relative to the Holocene epoch, atmospheric carbon dioxide was about 100 parts per million lower and tropical sea surface temperatures were about 3 to 5 degrees Celsius lower(2,3). The Last Glacial Maximum began when global mean sea level (GMSL) abruptly dropped by about 40 metres around 31,000 years ago(4) and was followed by about 10,000 years of rapid deglaciation into the Holocene(1). The masses of the melting polar ice sheets and the change in ocean volume, and hence in GMSL, are primary constraints for climate models constructed to describe the transition between the Last Glacial Maximum and the Holocene, and future changes; but the rate, timing and magnitude of this transition remain uncertain. Here we show that sea level at the shelf edge of the Great Barrier Reef dropped by around 20 metres between 21,900 and 20,500 years ago, to-118 metres relative to the modern level. Our findings are based on recovered and radiometrically dated fossil corals and coralline algae assemblages, and represent relative sea level at the Great Barrier Reef, rather than GMSL. Subsequently, relative sea level rose at a rate of about 3.5 millimetres per year for around 4,000 years. The rise is consistent with the warming previously observed at 19,000 years ago(1,5), but we now show that it occurred just after the 20-metre drop in relative sea level and the related increase in global ice volumes. The detailed structure of our record is robust because the Great Barrier Reef is remote from former ice sheets and tectonic activity. Relative sea level can be influenced by Earth's response to regional changes in ice and water loadings and may differ greatly from GMSL. Consequently, we used glacio-isostatic models to derive GMSL, and find that the Last Glacial Maximum culminated 20,500 years ago in a GMSL low of about - 125 to - 130 metres.

TI Climate and sea level variability on a centennial time scale over the
   last 1500 years as inferred from the Coastal Peatland of Puck Lagoon
   (southern Baltic Sea)
SO HOLOCENE
AB The climate variability and related sea-level changes during the Holocene are still under discussion, especially in a regional context. Very little information comes from the southern and south-eastern Baltic coast. The aim of the paper is to gain insight on the history of regional environmental changes, particularly sea-level and storminess, and their driving forces. The investigations were located on a peatland on the coast of Puck Lagoon (Gulf of Gdansk, southern Baltic Sea). The analysis of peat core comprised: radiocarbon dating, analysis of stable isotopes(18)O and(13)C and chemical components, as well as palynological and diatomic studies. Results showed the 1.0 m peat section accumulated over 1500 years, with a time resolution of 100 years per sample. The average water level in the Puck Lagoon rose by ca. 0.85 m during the last 1500 years in a cyclic mode, with a period cycle of ca. 600-550 years and an amplitude not exceeding 0.5 m. The accelerated sea level rise and frequent storminess occurred during the first half of the Dark Ages (1500-1300 years b2k) and LIA (750-450 years b2k) and since the beginning of the 20th century. Recognized environmental changes are well correlated with both temperature changes in the North Atlantic and changes in total solar irradiance, suggesting synchronous Northern Hemisphere-wide fluctuations. The solar forcing was an important constituent of natural climate variability in the past and of forcing climate warming during modern times - after the Little Ice Age.

TI Navigating capitalist expansion and climate change in pastoral
   social-ecological systems: impacts, vulnerability and decision-making
SO CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB The independent and synergic impacts of climatic change and capitalist expansion may render pastoral socialecological systems extinct. Climatic change compromises rangelands, while economic development fosters conversion of pastoral land into territories for capitalist expansion. Pastoral ists' institutions regulate decisionmaking to socio-environmental change and shape adaptive responses, enabling mobile livestock rearing for using multiple grazing areas, and households' diverse income sources. These institutions are characterized by flexibility, such as mixed individual-collective water and land tenure regimes. However, capitalist-led reduction of land-based resources, the push for privatization and commodification of land and livestock hinder flexibility, and undermine pastoralists' institutions for decision-mak ing; ultimately creating challenges for pastoralists' adaptive capacity. Research on the compound effects of the expanding global economy and climate change on pastoral social-ecological systems is needed to inform efforts constraining unregulated capitalist expansion, and policies for water and land security. Research, practice, and policies will improve pastoral social-ecological systems adaptability and resilience.

TI Evidence on the paleodrainage connectivity during Pleistocene:
   Phylogeography of a hypoptopomatine endemic to southeastern Brazilian
   coastal drainages
SO NEOTROPICAL ICHTHYOLOGY
AB The coastal basins of southeastern Brazil are influenced by climatic changes that caused sea-level oscillations during the Pleistocene. These marine transgressions and regressions can generate isolation and connection among coastal rivers. In this region, freshwater fishes are excellent models for phylogeographic studies because their distributions may have been affected by geographical and ecological changes resulting from these processes. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of Pleistocene sea-level changes on the genetic structure of the loricariid Hisonotus leucofrenatus throughout its area of occurrence. Two genes were sequenced: Cytochrome Oxidase subunit 1 (mitochondrial gene) and rpS7 ribosomal protein gene intron 1 (nuclear gene) from specimens representing 14 river drainages. The genetic data corroborate a divide for freshwater fish by the Serra do Tabuleiro mountain in Santa Catarina State. This divide determines two main genetic groups in H. leucofrenatus: one group to the south and one to the north of this mountain range. The genetic structure observed coincide with the limits of estimated paleodrainage systems for the region, supporting that marine transgressions and regressions during the Pleistocene influenced the biogeographical history of H. leucofrenatus.

TI GLOBAL SEA-LEVEL CHANGES AND THEIR MEASUREMENT
SO GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
AB Field sea-level data are generally only of local value, being affected by a complex of local, regional and global Processes which operate on different time and space scales. Averages or compilations of local sea-level data may lead therefore to misleading estimations of global sea-level changes and be biased towards predominant factors which are active in the study areas at the time scale considered. Approximate estimations of global sea-level changes can be attempted using proxy data, such as variations of oxygen isotope ratios in oceanic core sediments. These suggest an oscillatory pattern during the last 3 Ma, with glacial-interglacial cycles occurring with a periodicity of about 100 ka and sea-level fluctuations of the order of 100 m. Chronology in oceanic cores is calibrated with geomagnetic reversals, biostratigraphy and the identification of certain peaks in the isotopic curve, which allow a comparison with astronomical cycles. The amplitude of sea-level oscillations is refined through correlation with sequences of Quaternary marine terraces in uplifting areas. Holocene sea-level data show a great vertical dispersion, caused by the superposition of eustatic, isostatic, tectonic and other factors. Similar biases probably exist also for estimations of global sea-level change during longer (several Ma) and shorter (1-100 yr) geological time periods. This is true for tide-gauge data: only 13% of the stations with long enough records indicate a rise between 1.0 and 1.5 mm/yr (which corresponds to values often assumed as ''eustatic''), whereas interpretations of global sea-level rise deduced from tide-gauge records diverge appreciably, with estimates for the past century ranging from 0.5 to 2.4 mm/yr. It is hoped that data from new altimeter satellites (ERS-1, TOPEX/POSEIDON), combined with Global Positioning System geodesy data, will soon clarify this uncertain situation.

TI Effect of Long-Term Changes of Marine Factors on River Mouths
SO WATER RESOURCES
AB The main marine hydrological factors that influence the regime and structure of river mouths, including the mean (background) sea level, waves, tides, and storm surges, are discussed. Special attention is given to the long-term changes in the water levels of the World Ocean and in related seas that occurred during the XIX-XX centuries and to the predicted considerable sea level rise in the XXI century. The role of natural and anthropogenic land subsidence in variations of water levels in river deltas is assessed. The main hydrological and morphological processes at river mouths related to the sea level rise are considered. Special attention is given to the discussion of insufficiently studied problems such as changes in the characteristics of tides and storm surges under the condition of the sea level rise and nonlinear interaction of these phenomena.

TI Can climatic signals be discerned in a deep-water sink?: An answer from
   the Pearl River source-to-sink sediment-routing system
SO GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN
AB Using integrated two- and three-dimensional seismic and shallow borehole data from the Pearl River source-to-sink system, this study demonstrates that submarine fan deposition records climatic signals of Asian monsoons and the mid-Pleistocene climate transition, but with a lag time of 100 k.y., providing new tools to predict the past climate and important insights in source-to-sink context. Specifically, cooler and drier climates during weakened monsoons from marine oxygen isotope stages (MIS) 20 to 12 (814-478 ka), with reduced global ice volumes, led to decreased overall sediment supply and reduced amplitudes of sea-level change, which, in turn, decreased cross-shelf transit distances and gave rise to much sandier prograding intraslope fans. Warmer and wetter strengthened monsoons from MIS 12 to 1 (478 ka to recent), with larger global ice volumes and corresponding amplitudes of sea-level change, in contrast, led to increased overall sediment supply but served to increase cross-shelf transit distances, resulting in much muddier retrograding intraslope fans. Climatic changes in source areas, coupled with global climate and sea-level changes, therefore modulated the lithological characteristics of terminal sinks in the Pearl River source-to-sink system. High-frequency (43 k.y.) and low-amplitude sea-level changes (mean value of sea level = -55.8 m, with the standard deviation of +/- 24.2 m) during the mid-Pleistocene climate transition caused shorelines to more frequently reside proximal enough to the shelf edge to deliver coarse sediments to deep-water areas, leading to higher sediment delivery rates (R-s) of 5-15 km/m.y. and larger prograding intraslope submarine fans. Lower-frequency (100 k.y.) and high-eramplitude sea-level fluctuations (mean value of sea level = -62.7 m, with the standard deviation of +/- 33.2 m) after the mid-Pleistocene climate transition, in contrast, prevented shorelines from staying close enough to the shelf edge to continuously deliver coarse sediments to deep water, resulting in lower Rs of 4-8 km/m.y. and smaller retrograding intraslope submarine fans. Climatically controlled eustatic fluctuations, thus, determined sediment delivery rates and volumes of the terminus of source-to-sink systems.

TI Coastal plain stratigraphy records tectonic, environmental, and human
   habitability changes related to sea-level drawdown, 'Upolu, Samoa
SO QUATERNARY RESEARCH
AB Coastal plain stratigraphy is often over looked in paleo-sea-level reconstructions because carbonate sediments do not precisely constrain former sea level. Pacific Island sedimentology provides an invaluable record of geomorphic and environmental consequences of coastal evolution in response to changes in sea level and local tectonics. A series of coastal auger cores obtained from eastern. Upolu reveal a subsurface carbonate sand envelope predominately composed of coral and coralline algae derived from the reef framework. Coupling the sedimentological record with geophysical models of Holocene sea level, we identify a critical value (0.3-1.0 m) during the falling phase of the sea-level high stand (1899-2103 cal yr BP) that represents the transition from a transgressive to a regressive environment and initiates coastal progradation. Correlating the critical value with time, we observe nearly a millennium of coastal plain development is required before a small human population is established. Our findings support previous studies arguing that Samoa was colonized by small and isolated groups, as post-mid-Holocene drawdown in regional sea level produced coastal settings that were morphologically attractive for human settlement. As future sea level approaches mid-Holocene high stand values, lessons learned from Pacific Island sedimentological records may be useful in guiding future decisions related to coastal processes and habitat suitability.

TI Nonlinear Change in Sea Level Observed at North American Tide Stations
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB The rate at which coastal sea level is expected to rise or fall is of considerable interest to coastal residents and managers who view changes on the time scale of a 30-year mortgage. Analysis of historical records at North American tide stations provides evidence of recent nonlinear sea-level change at this scale using relative mean sea-level (RMSL) observations. RMSL tracks local inundation risk directly without the need to correct an accepted worldwide geocentric measure e.g., global mean sea-level rise with locally estimated vertical rate adjustments. Published RMSL linear trends provide essential information but are routinely compared between tide stations with widely varying record lengths, thereby obfuscating nonlinear change (acceleration or deceleration) over a specific period of time. Here monthly averaged RMSL data from 45 U.S. tide stations and one Canadian tide station are analyzed from 1969 through 2014, extending a definitive period of acceleration previously noted along the U.S. NE Coast. Using a Bayesian approach to determine the joint probability of paired regression parameters for RMSL quadratic trends, probabilities for forward projections to the year 2050 based on these trends suggest continued sea-level rise will be aided by acceleration presently on the order of 0.1 to 0.2 mm/y(2) in the U.S. NE and Gulf Coast regions. Deceleration ranging from -0.1 to -0.4 mm/y(2) is likely to reinforce falling sea levels at specific locations on the U.S. West Coast in the near term.
