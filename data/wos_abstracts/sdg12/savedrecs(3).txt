TI Driving forces of green consumption in sharing economy
SO MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to identify the accelerators of sharing economy that lead to sustainability by adopting green consumption. Nostalgia is studied as a mediator along with social connectedness and past orientation. Specifically, the study is based upon a framework to explore the outcomes of sharing economy through an individual's green consumption behavior from the perspective of mortality anxiety. Design/methodology/approach Quantitative research technique was employed by collecting data from 537 households through snowball sampling. The model was tested using partial least squares (SEM-VB). The validity of the theoretical and measurement model was assessed. Findings The results revealed that nostalgia positively influences social connectedness and past orientation, whereas social connectedness and past orientation accelerate green consumption. However, it was confirmed that nostalgia decreases green consumption. Research limitations/implications The drivers of sharing economy lead toward environmentally friendly consumer behavior by providing opportunities for different agents to increase the usage of shared consumption. The model can be improved by introducing other mediating variables to enrich understanding. Practical implications The study may provide opportunities for practitioners and the government to identify the key factors in a sharing economy, specifically with reference to green consumption and social connectedness. It is predicted that it will help reduce environmental deterioration. Originality/value This study identifies the role of mortality anxiety and nostalgia toward green consumption, predominantly in the context of a sharing economy. It is a forward to collaborative consumption.

AB A great upsurge of sharing economy occurs currently in China's green consumption market. On the basis of the theory of planned behavior, this research takes bike-sharing as an example to construct behavior structure model of green consumption by setting environmental self-accountability as a predictor of green consumption behavior and impression management and product attributes as the regulated variables. The results show that environmental self-accountability has positive impact on green consumption behavior. Green consumption tendency plays a role as intermediary. With the higher degree of consumer impression management, the positive impacts of environmental self-accountability to green consumption tendency will become stronger, otherwise weaker. The more the consumers recognize the hedonic attributes of products, the stronger the positive impacts of environmental self-accountability on green consumption tendency will be stronger, otherwise weaker. The conclusions also provide specific suggestions for the government and enterprises to find the right incentive to stimulate green consumption.

TI How do ethical consumers utilize sharing economy platforms as part of
   their sustainable resale behavior? The role of consumers' green
   consumption values
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB Past research has extensively studied the antecedents and consequences of consumers' green consumption values, as well as the psychological mechanisms that underlie an ethical consumer. Yet a frustrating paradox remains, indicated by the consumers' intention-behavior gap for their sustainable behavior. To address this gap, the present study focuses on the consumption values that lead to using a sharing economy platform. Our study draws on the theory of consumption values and altruistic-egoistic values, as well as spillover effect psychology, to examine associations between context-specific values, green consumption values, and sustainable resale behavior. By collaborating with a Nordic second-hand peer-to-peer platform brand, our findings-obtained from large-scale field data (n = 3256)-challenge the conventional wisdom by demonstrating that economic and practical values for using the second-hand peer-to-peer platform negatively affect green consumption values and subsequently weaken the consumers' preparedness to engage in sustainable resale behavior. In contrast, recreational, generative, societal benefit, and protestor values positively influence green consumption values and increase the consumers' willingness to engage in pro-environmental behavior. Further, such relationships are moderated by gender: stronger effects were identified among female consumers. These findings have important implications for theory and practice.

   consumption?
SO FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB In the context of the sharing economy, green consumption is becoming a trend. Shared accommodation represented by Airbnb has been extensively studied. Analysis of the emotional characteristics of green users is the key to promoting the sustainable development of Airbnb. The article obtains the online reviews of Airbnb green users, fully considers the deviation caused by the weight of feature words to the sentiment calculation, and combines the sentiment value with the weight value to obtain the comprehensive sentiment value of green users. Then, a spatial comparative analysis of green users' emotional characteristics in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong in China is carried out. The results show that in Airbnb, green users have a more obvious emotional tendency to human and geographical factors, followed by housing factors, and show lower tendency to environmental factors. The study provides a new perspective for optimizing the Airbnb scoring system and promoting the sustainable development of the shared accommodation market.

TI The technology effect, green consumption and age in propensity to
   collaborative consumption
SO CLEANER AND RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION
AB Although several studies point to the emerging importance of technology in consumer habits, limited studies have quantitatively shown how these variables influence consumer intention. Given this gap, this study offers an analytical model based on technology readiness, collaborative consumption intention and green consumption values, using age groups as a moderating variable. Through covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB -SEM) and a sample of 374 respondents (238 younger and 136 older subjects), it was observed that technology readiness positively influences collaborative consumption intention, with green consumption values as a pre -cursor. This relationship is stronger for older people, who generally have a lower perception of the control of technology than younger people. Public strategies and policies to encourage collaborative consumption must, therefore, take into account consumer values and age. Future studies could validate the results presented in this study, and include other demographic and behavioral dimensions.

TI Social norms and socially responsible consumption behavior in the
   sharing economy: The mediation role of reciprocity motivation
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The sharing economy has become a rapidly growing global phenomenon, providing economic, social, and environmental benefits through resource redistribution. However, the low cost of engaging in misbehavior has led to a lack of socially responsible consumer behavior, posing a threat to the sustainability of sharing services. This study investigates the impact of social norms on promoting socially responsible consumption behavior in the context of shared bicycles, focusing on the role of injunctive norms and descriptive norms, and the mediating effect of reciprocity motivation. Using a behavioral experiment, this study find that injunctive norms have a stronger influence than descriptive norms, and that rewards are more effective than punishments in promoting socially responsible consumption behavior. This study highlights the social responsibility of consumers towards their peers in the sharing economy, an aspect that has been overlooked in previous research. Furthermore, this research reveals a unique influence mechanism of social norms on promoting socially responsible consumption through reciprocity motivation. These findings extend the understanding of the focus theory of normative conduct and offer valuable insights for promoting socially responsible consumption behavior in the sharing economy.

TI Social trust and sharing economy size: country level evidence from home
   sharing services
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB The sharing economy (peer-to-peer based sharing or renting activities coordinated through community-based online services) is often said to be closely related to trust. This paper examines the association empirically. Using data collected from the two sharing economy companies Airbnb and Flipkey that exist in over 100 countries, we construct a measure of sharing economy penetration and examine its correlation with social trust and other potential explanations. Sharing economy penetration is promoted by ICT-infrastructure and economic openness. Conditional on ICT-infrastructure, countries with higher social trust have significantly lower sharing economy penetration. Our conclusion is that sharing economy services do not require high levels of social trust to succeed. Rather, they provide institutions that facilitate trust-intensive economic activities also where social trust is low.

AB The modern sharing economy paradigm is tied with using novel technologies. This study defines and investigates actual sharing economy participation. The role of demographic, economic, locational, and social capital factors, along with attitude towards sustainability and trust on participation by hosts of shared accommodations is examined to understand participation motivations. Building upon social exchange theory and sharing economy literature, the conceptual model of sharing economy participation is developed. The model is tested with data obtained from Airbnb. Socio-economic spatial data is sourced from public datasets. Location attributes of the model are analyzed using spatial statistics techniques to avoid spatial bias. We anticipate our results to predict sharing economy participation. Theoretically, findings of our research will provide a framework for IS researchers to study spatial patterns of sharing economy and participation therein. In practice, we expect our results to be generalizable for non accommodation forms of collaborative consumption.

TI The Short- and Long-Term Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic on the Sharing
   Economy: Distinguishing Between "Symptomatic" and "Asymptomatic"
   Platforms
SO JOURNAL OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY
AB Our study presents a systematic literature review on the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic on the different types of sharing economy platforms and the sharing economy phenomenon in its entirety. Our literature review helps understand how the characteristics of different services of the sharing economy combine with contingent factors, such as government-mandated lockdowns, changed consumer behaviors, and people's fear of contagion, to determine the magnitude of the impact of COVID-19 on the sharing economy both in the short run and in the long run. By examining these factors, we distinguish between sharing economy services/platforms that were (and possibly will be) negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic (referred to as "symptomatic" platforms) and those that were not (and possibly will not be) impacted at all or even benefit (referred to as "asymptomatic" platforms). We then propose a new framework that combines traditional dimensions of sharing economy with a dimension resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e., the level of physical interaction required to deliver the sharing economy service. Building upon the extant literature, the framework helps better understand how the sharing economy will evolve after the pandemic. It also helps identify important research gaps that both academics and practitioners working on the field of sharing economy should address in the near future.

TI Sharing economy and the city
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS
AB Sharing economy is a very broad term, covering various areas and forms of human activity. It includes activities of individuals, social groups, and enterprises, as well as local and state authorities, which aim to enable, facilitate, or even organize the sharing of resources. Sharing economy has an increasing importance and is accompanied by large-scale changes of revolutionary character embodied in innovative thinking. In this paper, a multidimensional assessment of the sharing economy from the perspective of various groups of stakeholders is undertaken. In order to analyze this phenomenon in more depth, the analyzed field of sharing economy has been narrowed subjectively (to the sphere of operations of for-profit corporations from this sector) and territorially (to the area of cities, as special places attracting sharing economy start-ups). The analysis has found that although the idea of sharing creates new opportunities, it also causes new challenges for cities' functioning and development, especially when considering the influence of large sharing economy companies on other stakeholders. The findings also show that not only does sharing economy have an uneven impact on the functioning of different cities but it also has heterogeneous consequences for different groups of stakeholders in the same city.

TI THE SHARING ECONOMY IN THE OPINION OF POLISH CONSUMERS
SO EKONOMIA I SRODOWISKO-ECONOMICS AND ENVIRONMENT
AB This article is devoted to the issue of the sharing economy. In Poland, the sharing economy is a relatively new area but with high development dynamics. Therefore, the paper aims to answer the question:,is Polish society ready to adopt the sharing economy concept?"
   In Poland, there is a research gap in the context of the sharing economy. The phenomenon of collective consumption concerning Polish consumers is a relatively new area that requires careful research. For this purpose, a pilot study was used with the use of the diagnostic survey method using the questionnaire survey technique.
   The presented research results show that 39.7% of the respondents have come across the sharing economy concept. However, ignorance of the concept does not mean that the respondents did not use services based on the assumptions of the sharing economy. 56.7% of respondents used at least one service provided by the sharing economy. There is a visible relationship between the respondents' age and education and their awareness of the sharing economy. The highest knowledge of the sharing economy was found in the age group under 36 and among respondents with higher education. Most of the respondents support the directions of activities presented by the sharing economy and use its services.
   The conducted research is of a pilot nature. However, it allows drawing attention to an important issue in the acceptance of new solutions related to the application of the sharing economy by the older generation of Polish consumers. This is a field for further research on a much wider research sample.

Recognizing that many of these organizations represent the sharing economy to varying degrees, this study selected two organizations - Airbnb and Fairbnb, to analyze the extent to which they serve as examples of the sharing economy. A content analysis was undertaken to identify the position of each organization on a continuum, ranging from pure sharing to pure exchange characteristics. The analysis reveals that overall Fairbnb may be a stronger example of the sharing economy than Airbnb.

TI Regulating the Sharing Economy: A Field Perspective
SO THEORIZING THE SHARING ECONOMY:VARIETY AND TRAJECTORIES OF NEW FORMS OF
   ORGANIZING
SE Research in the Sociology of Organizations
AB Critics increasingly highlight the dark sides of the sharing economy resulting from the insufficient regulation of competition, labor, or taxes in its for-profit sector. In this chapter, the authors argue that regulatory solutions for the sharing economy hinge on the understanding of the ways in which the sharing economy is organized. Here, digitalization undermines established regulation through underlying organizational shifts pertaining to places, labor inputs and output responsibilities. Mapping out the field of actors that are or could be involved in regulating the sharing economy, the authors highlight a particular role played not only by digital platforms as market organizers, but also of a variety of other public and private actors such as standard setting organizations, social movements, trade unions, organized buyers and sellers, incumbents, or policy makers. The authors suggest that an understanding of sharing economy markets as fields can not only capture the highly organized nature of the sharing economy, but also serve to untangle the contestations and power dynamics unfolding among various actors engaged in different regulatory issues associated with the sharing economy. Seeing "Uberization" as a next development stage away from the modern corporation after global supply chains, the authors highlight regulatory challenges associated with the even more individualized and dispersed way in which sharing economy markets are organized and also discuss new opportunities for regulation provided by digital technology.

TI Eating with EatWith: analysing tourism-sharing economy consumers
SO CURRENT ISSUES IN TOURISM
AB In recent years, a growing body of research has analysed tourism-sharing economy users. While several studies have revealed the specific motivations of tourists for participating in such activities, there is an apparent lacuna with regard to understanding the generic motivations of such consumers. In response to this literature gap, the current study explores the motivations of these users, aiming to shed light on their values, lifestyles and consumption preferences. The motivations of sharing economy users were examined using a quantitative survey involving 738 consumers of EatWith - a global sharing economy marketplace that offers a communal dining experience. The study's findings indicate that EatWith users have the generic primary motivation of achievement. The findings present several contributions to scholars and practitioners, and propose that sharing economy users are affected both by the specific motivations of social considerations, environmental considerations and economic considerations, and by their primary motivations of ideals, achievement and self-expression.

AB The sharing economy has shown significant growth in recent years, reinforced by the emergence and success of companies like Uber, Airbnb, eBay, etc. Consistently, it is attracting more and more attention from both the business and academic communities, which in turn are driving the development and adoption of new technologies in the sharing economy, such as smart contracts. However, which attributes of sharing economy business model would be most effectively modified by smart contracts and what would the qualitative effect? To answer these questions in this paper, we conducted a four-part study. First, we presented a description of the sharing economy and smart contract technology. Second, we considered the previously proposed generalized business model of a sharing economy company. Third, we identified the attributes of this business model to which smart contracts can be most effectively applied. Fourth, we qualitatively presented the effect of using smart contracts for each attribute.

TI Literature review of the sharing economy: Socio-cultural perspective
SO JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY & APPLIED SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB This article reviews the literature to explore the role of culture in the sharing economy. During the literature review process, we used the terms collaborative consumption, collaborative economy, gift economy, gift-giving, mesh, peer-to-peer, and commercial sharing systems in addition to the term sharing economy. Thus, we offer a reasonably broad scope in our research. It analyses 89 articles through a systematic literature review to determine the role of society and culture in the sharing economy. In addition, it offers a theoretical and descriptive exploration of the sharing economy and culture. The research shows that cultural dimensions and sharing motives shape the role of culture in the sharing economy. In this context, we determine the dimensions of power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism-collectivism, masculinism, long- and short-term orientation, and indulgence-restrain. In addition, we determine economic, social, sustainability, materialism, and trust motives. It shows that materialism, economic, sustainability, and trust differ depending on cultural dimensions. This situation shapes the attitudes and intentions of individuals toward the sharing economy. In addition, the study lists the cultures studied and the theoretical approaches used in previous cross-cultural studies on the sharing economy. The study shows that cross-cultural studies often focus on the cultures of the United States, China, and India. Finally, we offer suggestions for future research.

TI Regulating the sharing economy
SO INTERNET POLICY REVIEW
AB In this introductory essay, we explore definitions of the 'sharing economy', a concept indicating both social (relational, communitarian) and economic (allocative, profit-seeking) aspects which appear to be in tension. We suggest combining the social and economic logics of the sharing economy to focus on the central features of network enabled, aggregated membership in a pool of offers and demands (for goods, services, creative expressions). This definition of the sharing economy distinguishes it from other related peer-to-peer and collaborative forms of production. Understanding the social and economic motivations for and implications of participating in the sharing economy is important to its regulation. Each of the papers in this special issue contributes to knowledge by linking the social and economic aspects of sharing economy practices to regulatory norms and mechanisms. We conclude this essay by suggesting future research to further clarify and render intelligible the sharing economy, not as a contradiction in terms but as an empirically observable realm of socio-economic activity.

Utilizing Social Media Analytics (SMA) for institutional analysis, we track the formation of the sharing economy in Sweden, its actors and their impact. Our findings reveal that the sharing economy in Sweden currently encompasses a wide variety of both non-market and market practices. Discussions concerning commercial exchanges, the role of profit-driven firms such as Uber and Airbnb, and the emergence of a market logic has created a state of instability. Our results point at several unresolved issues, such as taxation and regulation.

TI Understanding consumers? resistance to pay with cryptocurrency in the

SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB The sharingeconomy has enabled people to generate income from the excess capacity that they possess. With that said, blockchain technology in the form of cryptocurrency has disrupted the way in which transactions are facilitated in sharing economy. However, consumers' resistance to paying with cryptocurrency in the sharing economy remains a challenge for the stakeholders. This research was developed grounded on the foundation of Status Quo Bias theory to address the matter. Data was collected through online survey and subsequently analyzed with a hybrid SEM-fsQCA approach. It was revealed that complexity, skepticism, habit, and inertia are significant antecedents of consumers' resistance to pay with cryptocurrency in the sharing economy. This study provided insights that would be of great value to stakeholders in the sharing economy. Additionally, this study is expected to serve as reference to future research in the areas of cryptocurrency, consumer behavior, sharing economy, and innovation resistance.

TI The Impact of the Sharing Economy as an Ecosystem on the Tourism Sector
SO JOURNAL OF TOURISM AND SERVICES
AB The authors of the article investigated the sharing economy elements as an ecosystem and analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of the sharing economy in the tourism sector. Exploring the elements of the sharing economy's ecosystem can help identify the challenges of globalization and lead to exploiting the sharing economy's potential more efficiently in the tourism sector. The study of the impact of the sharing economy as an ecosystem on the tourism sector is also made relevant by the lack of research examining the advantages and disadvantages of sharing economy models. To determine the impact of the sharing economy on the tourism sector, the authors analyzed the scientific literature. An empirical study of business models based on the sharing economy in the tourism sector was carried out. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages were identified of the sharing economy in the tourism sector. The authors' analysis has shown that, despite conflicting views on the impact and importance of the sharing economy in the tourism sector, many experts are optimistic about sharing economy-based models in this sector. Research by the authors of the article shows that sharing economy-based businesses are superior to traditional business models. The sharing economy-based models are preeminent because of more affordable prices for tourists, better satisfaction of individual needs, opportunities to become part of the community, a more comprehensive range of services, better access to tourism services. A better quality of services also highlights the advantages of economy-based businesses. Although the study was conducted in the Lithuanian tourism sector, we can assume that the study data can be unified and applied to analyze similar markets in other countries.

AB Uber and AirBnb, whose business models can best be described as sharing economy businesses, are disrupting the traditional businesses in their industries. Yet, many other sharing economy startups go unheard of and eventually cease to exist. There exists a fierce debate regarding whether sharing economy businesses are successful or not. While many researchers have sought to study the user motivation for engage with such businesses, no study has been conducted on a micro-economic level that determine the factors of success of sharing economy businesses. In this paper, we present a quantitative analysis study of 99 US based sharing economy business platforms to understand the factors which relate to the success of these startups. The finding of this study explains how factors such as human capital, innovation, and online reputation might impact the success of sharing economy startups.

TI Evaluation of metaverse integration alternatives of sharing economy in

SO DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS
AB Sharing economy transportation applications reduce car ownership and single-vehicle occupancy, contributing to the region's environmental sustainability. Metaverse is a promising new technology that combines sharing economy applications with transportation networks. By combining these two approaches, authorities can improve the sustainability of sharing economy applications. This study aims to assist decision-makers and authorities by developing a multi-criterion decision-making (MCDM) model that prioritizes three sharing economybased metaverse integration alternatives, namely integrating safety measures, payment systems, and the optimization of operations in the metaverse. A novel multi-criteria framework, including fuzzy Schweizer-Sklar norms based on the Ordinal Priority Approach (OPA) to assess the metaverse integration alternatives, is developed. To rank the alternatives, non-linear processing of information based on the fuzzy Schweizer-Sklar weight assessment method (SWAS) is proposed. A case study is developed to provide a foundation for the experts' evaluations using twelve criteria, which are organized into four aspects namely, economic, user, operational, and advancement. Finally, the results indicate that the most favorable approach is optimized operations via the integration of the sharing economy into the metaverse.

TI The sharing economy: turning challenges into compliance opportunities
   for tax administrations
SO EJOURNAL OF TAX RESEARCH
AB The rapid growth of the sharing economy has increased pressures on governments to address the variety of economic, social and legal issues it has given rise to in order to redress the emerging distortions without curtailing innovation. A key concern is whether the activities carried out by the agents involved in the sharing economy are adequately captured for tax. The current viewpoint is that the absence of sharing economy-specific regulation exacerbated by the poor visibility of the underlying activities results in under-collection of tax from the service providers and tax breaks for the platforms leading to an unfair competitive advantage over counterparts in the more strictly regulated traditional sectors. This article considers the challenges that the sharing economy poses for tax administrations, how these concerns are acknowledged within national and supranational governments and international organisations, the opportunities it presents for enhanced tax compliance, and measures, taken or proposed, by governments for enhancing tax compliance.

TI Is the Sharing Economy Green? Evidence from Cross-Country Data
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Using cross-sectional data from 165 countries, this study takes a fresh look at whether or not the sharing economy is a green solution for countries. This study relies on the Timbro sharing economy index and uses both carbon emission and environmental performance index as proxies for the greenhouse gas effect and overall environment, respectively. Due to limited sample size and non-normal distribution of the sample, this paper applies the Bayesian regression model, which is based on posterior distribution. The findings suggest the following: (1) a high sharing economy level has a negative relationship to carbon emissions but a positive relationship to overall environmental performance; (2) the joint variables show that a high sharing economy level together with high broadband access, urbanization, and high education level reduces carbon emissions; and (3) for manufacturing countries, a high sharing economy level together with high urbanization is associated with comparatively low carbon emissions and high environmental performance. In general, these findings allow us to conclude in favor of the contribution made by a high sharing economy level to sustainability.

TI The motivation for Muslim customers' participation in the sharing

SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB The sharing economy concept has attracted considerable attention among both academic researchers and practitioners. Several factors that can motivate customers' participation in sharing-economy activities have been discussed in the literature, but there has been an absence of investigations of the Muslim context, which could differ markedly given the significant impact of Islamic values regarding what is allowed or forbidden. This study seeks to narrow this gap by exploring the motivation for Muslim customers' participation in the sharing economy. By conducing qualitative research using grounded theory methods, we investigated Muslim customers of Go-Jek, the largest transportation sharing-economy platform in Indonesia. Our findings lead to the proposal of a Muslim customer motivation model, indicating that diverse intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including Islamic values, tend to impact on the motivations behind Muslim customers' participation in this sharing-economy platform, which offers a significant contribution to the literature, as well as important implications for management.

   The main objective of the research is to define the sharing economy and see how it's applied by entrepreneurs. To this end, we have chosen to perform a literature review, where various business models associated with sharing economy will be analyzed. The practical part of the research is made by a case study featuring a start-up active in the toys industry in Romania. The results of the study show that sharing economy is strongly linked with entrepreneurship. We expect that more initiatives will be launched in the future to capture the opportunities offered by sharing economy in various industries.

AB Sharing economy services have become increasingly popular. In addition to various well-known for-profit activities in this space (e.g., ride and apartment sharing), many community groups and non-profit organizations offer collections of shared things (e.g., books, tools) that explicitly aim to benefit local communities. We expect that both non-profit and for-profit approaches will see an increased use in the future. To support designers in devising new sharing economy services, we developed the Sharing Economy Design Cards, a design toolkit in the form of a card deck. We present two deployments of the cards: (1) in individual interviews with 16 designers and sharing economy domain experts; and (2) in two workshops with 5 participants each. Our findings show that the use of the cards not only facilitates the creation of future sharing platforms and services in a collaborative setting, but also helps to evaluate existing sharing economy services as an individual activity.

TI Assessment of the Sharing Economy in the Context of Smart Cities: Social
   Performance
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The sharing economy (SE) provides new opportunities to solve social, economic, and environmental problems, as well as increasing resource efficiency and releasing underutilized assets. However, social aspects of the sharing economy remain to be fully appraised. The present study aims to develop and apply a technique for assessing the sharing economy in the context of improving the social performance of smart cities. When considering social performance, we examine the relationship between the development of SE services and the public goods sector, as well as the potential of the sharing economy for improving the quality of life of citizens. A comparative analysis of approaches used to evaluate the sharing economy concluded that the social and environmental significance of the sharing economy can be most appropriately considered at the level of cities. The proposed technique is based on the use of the Smart City Index and Sharing Economy Index databases, data on collaborative economy platforms presented by Eurostat. The methodology used to assess the sharing economy comprises three stages: substantiation of the selected indicators for assessing SE; calculation of the presented integral index of the sharing economy; and construction of a matrix of indices of the sharing economy. At the first stage, correlation analysis was used; at the second stage, the TOPSIS system analysis method was used; and at the third stage we used graphical analysis. As a result, a ranking of 31 European cities was compiled in terms of the level of development of the sharing economy. It is shown that the sharing economy has a greater impact on public goods in cities with lower rates of economic development. In addition, significant changes in the 2020 ranking occurred due to restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is hoped that the obtained results will contribute to the development both of sharing economy methodologies and the urban environment by supporting sharing services.

AB The sharing economy is an economic principle that has risen thanks to technological advances. With the rise of this type of C2C markets in the context of the sharing economy, it is important to understand the factors that affect the intention to use these services. Using the theory of planned behavior and the antecedents of trust, we propose a conceptual research model that outline the factors that may affect the consumer's intention to engage in such economy. We test the model on the Airbnb service using an online survey.

TI Learning from Failures in the Sharing Economy
SO MIS QUARTERLY EXECUTIVE
AB Firms eager to succeed in the sharing economy are encouraged to imitate the strategies and business models of successful businesses like Airbnb and Uber. Yet they often ignore the lessons from sharing economy firms that failed with similar business models. Our analysis of several failed firms has identified common causes of failure, and the associated risks, when competing in the sharing economy. An illustrative case study shows that a hybrid business model can significantly reduce the inherent risks and can lead to sustainable growth in the sharing economy.(1,2)

TI May the sharing economy create a new wave of globalization?
SO ECONOMIC ANNALS-XXI
AB Sharing economy is a promising concept which was re-founded as a replay to the increasing globalization, resource misallocation and growing inequality and poverty. In this paper, we try to identify the potentials of the sharing economy and its possible impact on future financial and market developments. We have presented a number of examples of the realizations of sharing economy in practice with its limitations and constrains. We have also shown how easy this new concept may be transformed to a global movement similar to the current globalization process. It has also been noted that the critics and objections against the globalization may be valid also for sharing economy unless some actions will be carried out to avoid the mistakes of the past connected to the globalization.

AB The fact that sharing economy is growing rapidly in various areas such as transport, finance and personal services ( e.g. delivery, accommodation) has a huge impact on socio-economic system. Guttentag (2015) and Sigala (2017) observed that sharing economy would change the dynamics of the hospitality and tourism industry. Apart from a new supplier of tourist services (as consumers provide services to other consumers) and an exchange of intermediary (specialised online platforms) there also emerges a new type of tourist driven by new motives. The purpose of this article is to identify the new tourist who has appeared in sharing economy and to describe their profile with particular emphasis on their socio-demographic features, motives and barriers to using SE platforms, based on Polish tourists' research.

AB Sharing economy is also known as collaborative consumption or cooperative consumption, which is the sharing of information and resources. The rapid development of the sharing economy has brought new growth for the vigorous development of the economy. Usually, the relevant experts and scholars in the study of sharing economy will focus on the sharing of the right to use. Different from the previous researches which are analyzed from the perspective of information resource sharing, this paper analyzes the brand of "Lao Gan Ma" which has no advertisement, marketing team, nor debt and it is not a listed company. It is original from a small factory at the border. But it has been a well-known enterprise around the world successful with a short period of 20 years.

The objective of this article is to conduct an institutional analysis of the sharing economy in an emerging country. In order to proceed with it, we used the Social Media Analysis (SMA) alongside content analysis in order to obtain and analyze the collected data. The results indicate that the understanding of the sharing economy is intimately linked to the institutional context to which the analysis is connected.

TI Framing the sharing economy: Toward a sustainable ecosystem
SO TOURISM MANAGEMENT
AB The sharing economy has been a controversial phenomenon since its inception. This study employed the frame analysis method to examine and understand how the sharing economy is conceptualized in the news media discourse. A total of 340 online news articles regarding the sharing economy published between 2011 and 2017 were selected from 13 U.S. news entities. Six issue-specific frames and seven interest groups were identified to organize the whole public discourse of the sharing economy. Based on the frame analysis results, an ecosystem framework was proposed to display the underlying structure of the sharing economy. The findings reveal that the sharing economy is in its early stages and the ecosystem is not yet in healthy shape. Therefore, three strategies were suggested to pave the way for sustainable development of the sharing economy ecosystem: alignment to mutual interests, collaboration for shared success, and commitment to social responsibility.

SO COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR
AB The current study aims to identify a customer value proposition (CVP) for the sharing economy business model and to compare the competitive advantages of CVPs in the sharing economy. Because of the novelty of the topic of CVPs in the context of the sharing economy, this study adopts a mixed-methods approach. First, a qualitative study is conducted to develop a scale and theoretical framework for a CVP in the sharing economy. Then, a quantitative approach is performed to test the scale and framework and compare CVPs and their competitive advantages. The qualitative study shows that four values reside in a CVP: economic, social, emotional, and technical. These values result in the development of a model CVP for the sharing economy. Moreover, the quantitative data collected from 1285 samples indicate that social and emotional values are assessed as more significant than technical and economic values in terms of customer repurchase intention with regard to services in the sharing economy. Furthermore, results show that social and emotional values play equal roles in motivating customers to revisit businesses in the sharing economy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO REGE-REVISTA DE GESTAO
AB Purpose - In recent years, much has been discussed about new consumer practices based on the sharing economy. In this context, the purpose of this paper is to map out the international scientific production on sharing economy.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research adopted a descriptive qualitative approach. Based on a sample of 95 documents collected in the Scopus database, analyses of bibliometric and sociometric indicators were carried out, as well as content analyses were conducted to identify the main thematic categories in the field.
   Findings - The results show that sharing economy is an emerging topic, and of late, the research in this field has grown rapidly. The study provides a mapping of top journals and authors, works of greatest impact and of co-authorship, co-citation and bibliographic coupling networks, which evidence the low intensity of researcher's interactions and scientific production dispersion in the field. The main subjects found in the sharing economy literature are determinants, motivations and barriers, sharing economy impacts, regulation, models and frameworks, critical approach and entrepreneurship and sharing-based new businesses.
   Research limitations/implications - The analyses did not take into account the timing perspective. Further research could undertake a timeline-based approach in order to present direct citation networks and to relate works according to the year when they were published.
   Originality/value - The study innovates by identifying the main subjects in the sharing economy literature, as well as by presenting network analysis for some bibliometric indicators, complementing previous research in the field.

PROMISE's proposal was grounded on the literature. In this paper we present a two-step analysis of the framework. To do so, we applied the Semiotic Inspection Method (SIM) in order to reconstruct the designer message to users, and a coding step was applied to evaluate the users experience with the sharing economy. As a result, we have identified some aspects that PROMISE was not able to represent well, and have proposed changes on the framework.

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The last decade has seen the emergence of the sharing economy as well as the rise of a diverse array of research on this topic both inside and outside the marketing discipline. However, the sharing economy's implications for marketing thought and practice remain unclear. This article defines the sharing economy as a technologically enabled socioeconomic system with five key characteristics (i.e., temporary access, transfer of economic value, platform mediation, expanded consumer role, and crowdsourced supply). It also examines the sharing economy's impact on marketing's traditional beliefs and practices in terms of how it challenges three key foundations of marketing: institutions (e.g., consumers, firms and channels, regulators), processes (e.g., innovation, branding, customer experience, value appropriation), and value creation (e.g., value for consumers, value for firms, value for society) and offers future research directions designed to push the boundaries of marketing thought. The article concludes with a set of forward-looking guideposts that highlight the implications of the sharing economy's paradoxes, maturation, and technological development for marketing research. Collectively, this article aims to help marketing scholars not only keep pace with the sharing economy but also shape its future direction.

AB With the rapid development of the sharing economy, people's way of life and the development of enterprises are affected. At the same time, some local governments have had a profound discussion on the governance mode and structure of the sharing economy. Sharing economy represents a new economic model, which has changed the traditional business model, reduced marginal cost, activated stock resources, and significantly improved the efficiency of economic operation. Therefore, on the basis of following the law of economic development, the government needs to establish and improve the government-led mode and carry out the governance mechanism of the government in a way of multi-subject cooperation. While perfecting the legislation, we should pay attention to the innovation of regulation, create the mode of benign competition and shape a fair market environment of sharing economy.

TI Sharing economy business models for sustainability
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Background: The predominant focus of academic research on the sharing economy has been on Airbnb and Uber; to this extent, the diversity of business models ascribed to the sharing economy has not yet been sufficiently explored. Greater conceptual and empirical research is needed to increase understanding of business models in the sharing economy, particularly attributes that deliver on its purported sustainability potential.
   Objective: We aimed to elaborate an improved sharing economy business modelling tool intended to support the design and implementation of sharing economy business models (SEBMs) with improved sustainability performance.
   Methods: We used a structured approach to business modelling, morphological analysis, to articulate relevant business model attributes. Our analysis was informed by a narrative literature review of business and platform models in the sharing economy. We also iteratively tested, refined, and evaluated our analysis through three structured opportunities for feedback.
   Results: The output of the morphological analysis was a sharing economy business modelling tool for sustainability, with stipulated preconditions and descriptions of all business model attributes.
   Conclusion: The sharing economy is not sustainable by default, so we must be strategic and deliberate in how we design and implement SEBMs. The sharing economy business modelling tool should be of interest not only to researchers and practitioners, but also to advocacy organisations and policymakers who are concerned about the sustainability performance of sharing platforms.

Through a case study analysis of bike-sharing service providers in one of the largest cities in China, this paper examines the phases of regulation of the sharing economy from problem discovery, enacting regulation, and the aftermath of regulation. The public interest theory is used as a way of understanding the evolution of regulation of the sharing economy. Our analysis of the case study showed that the government took on three roles as protector, coordinator, and regulator that demonstrate working within the public interest theory. The results of this case study show the evolution of regulatory roles in a new and emerging industry within China and the lessons learned for public administrators.

TI The Impact of Gamification Motivation on Green Consumption Behavior-An
   Empirical Study Based on Ant Forest
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The development of the Internet has led to new forms of integration of gamification and environmental protection and has become a new perspective for exploring the emergence of green consumer behavior. In particular, gamification participation motivation has a growing influence on consumers' green consumption behavior, and the magnitude of gamification participation motivation is transmitted to consumers' green consumption behavior through their continuity of use. We choose Ant Forest as the research scenario of the integration of green consumption and gamification in China and try to explore the mechanism of the interaction between gamification participation motivation, continuity of use, and green consumption behavior from the perspective of green consumption. This paper tests the hypotheses through empirical research methods and structural equation modeling. The findings show that enjoyment motivation, social motivation, and achievement motivation positively influence consumers' continuity of use; continuity of use positively influences consumers' green consumption behavior; and the sense of environmental indebtedness plays a moderating role in the relationship between continuity of use and green consumption behavior.

TI Dark Side of Sharing Economy: Examining the Unethical Practices and Its
   Impact on Coopetition and Firm Performance
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS MARKETING
AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the unethical practices that could take place in the sharing economy and their impact on B2B cooperation and competition among rival firms and their performance. Design/methodology/approach From the literature review and theories, a theoretical model has been developed. The model is later validated using the structural equation modelling technique considering samples from 16 firms involved in sharing resources. Findings The study found that there is a significant negative impact of unethical practices in the sharing economy for B2B coopetition, which in turn negatively impacts firm performance. Research implications The business model for the sharing economy is becoming popular in business-to-business (B2B) marketing literature. Firms can utilize resources of other firms lying idle and reduce cost, optimize resource utilization, and achieve greater flexibility. Some organizations also share their resources with rival firms. However, there are concerns about unethical practices by rival firms, which may be due to the misuse of data, human resources, and intellectual property, and so on. Few studies have investigated the unethical practices that may take place in the sharing economy, but there is a growing interest among the practitioners, researchers, and academicians in this area. Thus, this research investigated the unethical practices that may take place in the sharing economy and its consequences from B2B cooperation and competition perspectives. Originality/value Only a limited number of research studies have investigated the unethical practices that could happen in the sharing economy. This study has investigated the issues of unethical practices in sharing economy from B2B perspective in relation to cooperation and competition among the rival firms which is a unique value proposition. Also, the proposed theoretical model is a unique model and with a high explanative power which is also another unique contribution of this study.

TI Study on Sharing Characteristics and Sustainable Development
   Performance: Mediating Role of the Ecosystem Strategy
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB How the sharing economy can move toward sustainable development is an important research topic. This paper attempts to explore the mediating effect of ecosystem strategy on the relationship between sharing characteristics and sustainable development performance by applying the structural equation model and questionnaire survey of 90 sharing-economy enterprises. The research results show that the ecosystem strategy plays a complete mediating role in the relationship between sharing characteristics and environmental performance, a partial mediating role in the relationship between sharing characteristics and social performance, and an insignificant mediating role in the relationship between sharing characteristics and economic performance. The research results provide new knowledge for research on the sustainable development of the sharing economy, which are of certain reference value for the sustainable development of sharing-economy enterprises, and government's support to and supervision of the sharing economy.

TI The sharing economy: A critical review and research agenda
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB Despite their global emergence, sharing economy businesses do not consistently experience favourable outcomes across different geographical regions. Additionally, since the sharing economy is considered a contemporary business mechanism, unlike the traditional business model, there is a lack of constructive business frameworks for these businesses to contemplate in order to maintain or advance their business operations. This is particularly the case with respect to emerging economies. Accordingly, our study provides a comprehensive systematic review of the relevant sharing economy literature to determine influential factors and their impacts on sharing economy business performance. Our findings suggest a diverse context classification and research trend within the existing sharing economy literature and, thereby, we conceptualise a sharing economy epistemology to enhance comprehension of the different forces and mechanisms in place. With that, we develop a conceptual model based on the strategy and institutional literature where we uncover differences for emerging markets. Finally, we suggest a future research framework for the sharing economy field.

TI Key Influence Factors in the Shared Sustainable Consumption of Boutique
   Products
SO EKOLOJI
AB Sustainable consumption, also known as "green consumption," is a collective term for various consumer behaviors and consumption patterns based on ecological needs. It also includes health and ecological environmental protection and meets human health and environmental standards. The Shared Sustainable Consumption of valuable goods such as boutique products has also emerged as a new industry. However, unlike the automobile or housing industries, it is not supported by a mature supply chain; therefore, it is more likely to have problems of disputes over product damage, compensation, and other issues. Customer complaints are one of the major impediments of the development of this new industry. Considering the growing popularity of sharing economy around the world and the potential benefits of Shared Sustainable Consumption of boutique products, this study is conducted using the Delphi method and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to explore the key influence factors in the development of Shared Sustainable Consumption of boutique products by focusing on the Birkin bags as an example. Hopefully, the findings of this study can help to provide references for the industry and also for the diverse development of Sustainable Consumption.

TI Drivers of the Sharing Economy That Affect Consumers' Usage Behavior:
   Moderation of Perceived Risk
SO ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB In the access to peer-to-peer sharing of goods and services through a technology platform, which is known as the sharing economy, there is no consensus on the factors that motivate consumers. This study aimed to investigate the moderating effect of perceived risk on consumers' participation in the sharing economy in a developing country. Following a quantitative approach, a survey was conducted among 400 consumers in the Metropolitan Zone of Puebla City, Mexico. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the data. Economic benefits, enjoyment, and trust drove the usage behavior of consumers in the sharing economy. In addition, perceived risk significantly moderated the relationships that usage behavior has with the economic benefits and the feeling of the community. As predicted by social exchange theory, the consumers made choices based on a subjective cost-benefit analysis, showing flexibility in the type and amount of rewards. This study contributes to knowledge about customer behavior in the context of the sharing economy.

SO CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION MANAGEMENT
AB What's mine is yours. An increasing number of people are participating in sharing and exchanging information, knowledge, data and goods. As research addressing the so-called sharing economy' is still in its infancy, this article aims to shed light on it. To do this, a qualitative research approach comprising guided interviews with 14 companies from Germany, Austria and Switzerland provides detailed insights into different aspects of the sharing economy phenomenon. Our results make a direct contribution to sharing economy research, especially regarding the new business models of start-ups. Here, we find a clear difference between the relevance of economic and social orientation. The latter appears to be in higher demand among customers than entrepreneurs. The increasingly digitalized environment has led to a changed living situation characterized by urbanity, openness to new solutions, changed working situations and new mindsets. All of these aspects drive the sharing economy. The results of this paper are summarized in a framework highlighting the requirements, drivers and goals of the sharing economy. Considering the limited research in this field, the developed framework is a strong basis for discussion, critique and/or support of future research.

TI Tour guides' self-efficacy and resilience capability building through
   sharing economy platforms
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT
AB PurposeThis study aims to explore how the local tour guides (LTGs) operate through the sharing economy platform. This study explores how LTGs have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions using self-efficacy and other resources to improve resilience and performance. This study also delineates the working mechanisms of peer-to-peer (P2P) platform-enabled, dynamic capability building processes, in the tourism sharing economy. Design/methodology/approachThis research adopted an interpretive approach to understand the focal phenomenon using two types of data. A total of 40 semi-structured interviews with LTGs and 26,478 online tourist reviews from tour guide service participants' before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were used. FindingsThe findings of this study revealed that LTGs used sharing economy platforms to arrange flexible tour guide services. Resilience emerged through dynamic capability that addressed contextual factors in real time. LTGs coordinated different resources and customers during a time of uncertainty. Different sources of self-efficacy and types of dynamic capability were identified. The interplay between LTGs' self-efficacy and dynamic capability was also delineated. Practical implicationsThe findings provide guidance for LTGs on P2P platforms and other sharing economy sectors on how diverse resources enabled by the sharing economy can enhance resilience during times of uncertainty. LTGs that engage with contextual information and are dynamic can adopt itineraries and services that will benefit tourists and their business. Originality/valueThis study contributes to the sharing economy literature by theorizing the working flow that enables LTGs to exert self-efficacy and leverage dynamic capability on P2P platforms. This study also contributes by linking resilience to contextual factors in real time. The outcomes provide guidance for LTGs to remain competitive and establish resilience in uncertain environments.

AB The digital sharing economy has introduced opportunities for economic growth, productivity, and technological innovation. However, the adoption of sharing economy applications may be inaccessible to certain demographics, including older adults, low-income adults, and individuals who are not college educated. This research investigates how the demographic factors: trust, computer self-efficacy, and perceived ease of use, impact participation in the sharing economy. Drawing on survey data with 508 participants, we found that trust in institutions, computer self-efficacy, and perceived ease of use positively correlate to individuals' past use of and willingness to pay for future sharing economy services, but age is negatively correlated. Surprisingly, we do not find that sharing economy users are more likely to have higher trust in strangers, higher incomes, or more education. We compare our findings to existing research, discuss why institutional trust might negate other concerns about sharing economy use, and explore opportunities to support broader participation in the sharing economy.

AB The sharing economy is an emerging research field. The form of sharing economy that is emerged by using many information technologies such as the mobile Internet, the big data, the cloud computing, the block chain, etc. profoundly influences and changes the traditional economic form of human society with the emerging economic formats in the information age. Under the background of the new era, clarifying the basic connotation, performance characteristics and main functions of the sharing economy can attach a great significance on better promoting the high-quality development of the sharing economy and building a modern economic system. It is believed in this article that the connotation of the sharing economy can be grasped from the scope of development, motivation, ideas and models. The sharing economy has the characteristics of rapid development, diversified subjects, clear operating mechanism and differences in economic composition. We then derive 9 variables with almost equal importance which reflect the development of sharing economy through Factor Analysis. The development of sharing economy has entered a new era. While promoting the development of shared economy, we should promote the deep integration of new and old formats, foster the sharing of information and cultural genes, build a pragmatic and invasive system, apply an inclusive and prudent regulatory system, and create a social environment of joint construction and sharing. This article helps to deepen the understanding of the sharing economy and has certain reference value for theoretical research and practical development in this field.

SO SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM
AB The explosive growth of collaborative or peer-economy platforms has disrupted "business as usual" in tourism and triggered broad research interest in certain aspects or players of the sharing economy. This special issue explores diverse manifestations of the sharing economy in the context of its impacts upon and complex relationship with tourism spaces, by offering six, conceptually reflexive and empirically rich studies of how the sharing economy is transforming destinations, communities, consumers and tourism governance in Nordic and Mediterranean regions. The volume sheds light on the particular political, socio-cultural, demographic, organizational, institutional and technological conditions that are shaping new collaborative endeavours in tourism. Instead of fixating on sudden socio-spatial disruptions, the contributions are observant to changes unfolding over a longer period and in different geographical contexts. This longitudinal perspective also enables a more sophisticated discussion of the sharing economy's impact beyond tourism, and its entanglements with social welfare models, cooperative production systems, resilient communities and digital infrastructures.

AB The sharing economy is growing rapidly and in the meantime scepticism emerges questioning its alleged benefits with respect to inclusiveness, such as providing equal access, encouraging participation and building social connection. However, how inclusive the sharing economy is has yet to be adequately explicated. This paper examines the inclusiveness of the sharing economy using a conceptual framework of inclusive economy, highlighting potential risks and problems. It then proposes a model of a more inclusive sharing economy that comprises hybrid sharing platforms and integrates collaborative consumption and co-production in a local community. Following this, the model is translated into a neighbourhood prototype and then tested using a hypothetical urban design scheme for an ordinary neighbourhood in Singapore.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT
AB The aim of this research is to investigate the German sharing economy in its offline and online dimensions and the nature of its commercial and idealistic intentions. Using quantitative research, 505 cases were empirically gathered and analysed against the theoretical background of inherent features. In particular, the study investigates technology involvement within the sharing economy and how it varies between the online, offline, and hybrid interactions of users and the indicators of idealistic intentions, such as financial interactions and profit orientation. With the aid of 11 theory-driven variables, data is descriptively illustrated and subsequently evaluated within the scope of a two-step cluster analysis. The German sharing economy demonstrates a seven-cluster solution, with a majority of offline-organised cases. Evidently, idealistic sharing models exist, especially within the offline dimension, yet online and hybrid models also reveal idealistic characteristics, which stand contrary to theoretical assumptions.

TI Redundancy in the sharing economy
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB The success of the sharing economy in China has attracted worldwide attention. Alongside the standard model of the customer-to-customer sharing of idle/superfluous resources, the new model of business-to-customer sharing of new resources has been gradually thriving. However, beside the advantages, there are some drawbacks, such as system redundancy, which have so far been ignored. This paper addresses the problem of redundancy in the sharing economy. To do so, we have built a theoretical model indicating the determinants of redundancy, which are mainly affected by the market structure, multi-homing, competitive strategy, public cost, and externality. Furthermore, we support these results by analyzing two of the biggest companies in the sharing-bike sector in China: Mobike and OfO. This paper helps practitioners and the government to better understand the inherent economic logic of redundancy, so that they can harness and regulate the sharing economy more effectively.

This study aims to develop a multidimensional scale to understanding the tourist risk perception in the sharing economy (TPRSE). First, focus group interviews, and online text analysis were conducted to elicit the initial items. Second, pilot survey involving a sample size of 218 was conducted, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and item response theory (IRT) were applied to refine this preliminary item pool. Third, the TPRSE scale was further validated using the CFA and IRT (n = 745). The TPRSE scale was successfully developed and validated, which including five dimensions of financial risk, social risk, privacy risk, performance risk and physical risk. This study advances the theories of risk perception in the context of sharing economy and provides management strategies to reduce perceived risks in Airbnb accommodations.

SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB Sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) in sharing economy platforms supports resource management and achieves environmental sustainability. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is an essential pillar of sustainability, but the link between CSR and SSCM has been missing in the literature. Therefore, the current study intends to examine the connection between CSR and SSCM practices in sharing economy-based platforms. This study has applied the means-end theory to understand customer intention in the sharing economy. The data of 379 respondents from five main cities of Pakistan have been collected through convenience sampling. Partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) has been used to test the proposed conceptual model. The study results show that the corporate social responsibility approach adopted by the sharing economy platforms improves internal supply chain management that drives customers' intention to use sharing economy platforms. Green concern has a significant moderating effect on customers' tendency toward environmental issues and solutions. However, findings revealed that eco-design in the sustainable supply chain does not affect customer purchase intention in sharing economy platforms. The study findings provide practical implications to organizations focusing on sustainable supply chain management practices in the sharing economy.

SO AMCIS 2017 PROCEEDINGS

CY 2017
CL Boston, MA
AB Sharing economy platforms drive new consumption habits in the hospitality industry by attracting individuals through modern technologies and innovative business models. In this study, we examine the relationship between trust, perceived risk, and the consumers' intention to request an accommodation on the non-monetary hospitality platform Couchsurfing. We further separate intermediary and corresponding users from each other to investigate the influence of the two-sided market mechanisms on the consumers' intention. Based on a survey of 248 consumers, we propose a research model and perform structural equation modeling. Our results indicate that the influence of trust on the consumers' intention is fully mediated by perceived risk. Further, our results show that perceived risk of the intermediary and the corresponding users influences the consumers' intentions, despite the sharing service being free-of-charge. This study contributes to the sharing economy literature by demonstrating the important role of perceived risk on non-monetary sharing economy platforms.

AB The sharing economy is attracting increasing research attention. However, scholarly knowledge lacks understanding about the individuals who are the key players in this emerging phenomenon. This study uses an explorative approach to investigate the individual-level characteristics of sharing economy users and providers. We analyze a sample of 1170 respondents and reveal that socio-demographics (gender, age, and education), personality traits (Extraversion, Neuroticism, and Conscientiousness), and attitudes (interdependent self, materialism, sharing economy support, and perceived public value contributions) are significantly associated with people's activities in the sharing economy. Our results shed new lights into the academic debate about individual drivers of the sharing economy.

SO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR DEVELOPMENT
AB As the sharing economy develops rapidly, associated sharing economy driven digital platforms are becoming increasingly important and are linked to social and economic development. Identifying the influencing factors of sharing economy driven digital platforms to promote social and economic development can provide relevant knowledge and suggestions for firms running these types of platforms. Therefore, this paper proposes an approach based on text mining that uses different models to explore the influencing factors of sharing economy driven digital platforms to promote social and economic development. The results show that sharing economy driven digital platforms with consumer-to-consumer business models emphasize social connections, while platforms with a business-to-consumer model focus more on economic benefits. Technological and regulatory innovation is the new driving force for sharing economy driven digital platforms to promote social and economic development in the future. Suggestions for sharing economy driven digital platforms to promote social and economic development are provided.

TI Dominant Consumer Attitudes in the Sharing Economy-A Representative
   Study in Hungary
SO RESOURCES-BASEL
AB As a result of the digital revolution, new business models are emerging, and one of the most dynamic is the sharing economy. In many cases, the strategic communication of sharing economy firms is linked to current socio-economic trends, such as digital innovation, consumers' empowerment, experience gaining (instead of stock), environmental awareness, and community building. In our research (a nationwide representative sample of 3520), we aimed to determine how open the Hungarian population is toward sharing economy services. Furthermore, we explored the relationship between openness and consumers' socio-demographic factors, attitudes related to the current consumer trends and Internet usage habits. As a result, we found that 38.4% of the Hungarian population is open toward sharing economy services. From a socio-demographic point of view, wealthy, metropolitan, family-oriented, educated, and younger people are more open toward sharing activities. In terms of consumer attitudes, people who take risks, like having a social life, are environmentally and health conscious, spend their leisure time actively, enjoy quality things, and have a positive attitude toward digitalization are more open to using the sharing economy services. As a final result of the regression modeling, we found that the examined consumer attitudes and Internet usage habits determine openness, but socio-demographic factors largely lose their significant effect, except for generation and wealth, in the case of the integrated model. Our results show that a well-defined and relatively large segment is open to the sharing economy, and sharing economy companies could target them directly to achieve a more sustainable environment.

TI Impact of a sharing economy on sustainable development and energy
   efficiency: Evidence from the top ten Asian economies
SO JOURNAL OF INNOVATION & KNOWLEDGE
AB Changes over the last few decades around the globe highlight concepts such as sustainable economic devel-opment (SED). Globalization has accelerated the competition between firms and they require sustainable development (SD) in order to survive in such a competitive environment. In this scenario, SED and energy efficiency can be achieved through an effective sharing economy. This phenomenon has received wide global attention and is the focus of many recent studies. This article investigates the impact of a sharing economy, including the sharing economy users and sharing economy values, on energy efficiency and SED in the top ten Asian economies. It takes inflation, employment rate and population growth as control variables. The study extracts secondary data from the Statista and World Development Indicators (WDI) databases from 2006 to 2020 and uses the method of moments quantile regression (MMQR) to examine the nexus between these constructs. The results reveal that sharing economy users, sharing economy values, inflation, employ-ment rate and population growth have a positive association with energy efficiency and SED in the top ten Asian economies. This serves as a guide for policymakers establishing relevant policies related to the achieve-ment of SED and energy efficiency using a sharing economy.(c) 2023 The Authors.

SO SOCIOLOGY COMPASS
AB This article offers a state-of-art review of previous research in the field of sharing economy. It explores the definitional dilemma and presents the research field of sharing economy as a contested one. In an attempt to contribute to the numerous efforts of ordering, summarizing and characterizing sharing economy, the article further unpacks the debates driving the emergent sharing economy field. First, it is a debate on the role and place of ICT and platform technologies in sharing economy. Second, the article explores the role and place of economic interest in sharing economy, placing the empirical reality of sharing economy along a broad spectrum from for-profit enterprises to non-profit community sharing projects. Third, the paper analyses the question of ownership and its transfer in sharing economy, exploring its positioning vis-a-vis gift economy, and short-term renting and lending. It further analyses relationships between stakeholders (private individuals and business actors) participating in sharing economy, presents the overview of literature on the three transactional models in sharing economy, Business to Consumer (B2C), Business to Business (B2B), and Peer to Peer (P2P). Finally, the paper suggests future research avenues. This study highlights the lack of research looking at sharing outside of the purview of market exchange. It is suggested that the definition of sharing economy and research in the field should focus on P2P activities. Furthermore, it is suggested that the configuration of the sharing economy should be understood from a field perspective. Field-level studies of issues that bring together various actors in debates on sharing economy should allow for understanding further development of sharing economy.

AB The paper aims to generate insight about conceptualization of the sharing economy. With a field research of 76 online platforms associated with the German sharing economy (SE) a generalized conceptualization is formed. With the inferred attributes and developed categories, clusters are built. The German sharing economy is outlined as conglomerate of business models that are effecting classical consumption by online platform-using business organizations, peer-to-peer consumption without business intermediates, and hybrid forms between commercial and non-commercial users. Within these and their frequency, conclusions about possibilities for alternative consumption and social innovations are discussed. A minority can be directly linked to alternative consumption that acts without business intermediates or without monetary reward. Seldom cases can he interpreted as social innovations, because improvements in social concerns are enabled through online platform technology. The frame of the German economic system for the sharing economy is considered briefly to underpin assumed developments and effects, which led to the actual status and will influence the sharing economy's future. The study is theoretically based on the resource-dependence-approach and on related fields. Concluding hypotheses are derived from our results for further research on SE.

TI A legitimacy perspective on sharing economy consumption in the
   accommodation sector
SO CURRENT ISSUES IN TOURISM
AB This research adopts a consumer focus in examining the impact of perceived legitimacy of sharing economy platforms on attitude and behavioural intention in the accommodation sector. By investigating tourist adoption of sharing economy platforms from a legitimacy perspective, this research differs from past studies which focused on characteristics of new services to predict adoption. Results show that (1) tourists evaluate legitimacy through comparisons with traditional offers in the accommodation sector rather than with other sharing economy offers, (2) lack of legitimacy has a negative effect on guest behavioural intentions and (3) this effect is moderated by relativism. Even though sharing economy platforms' commercial success may imply that they are enjoying a high level of legitimacy in the eyes of tourists, our results suggest that tourists act as societal actors and that the legitimacy issues raised by the sharing economy are relevant to them and inform their decisions.

AB This paper provides a comprehensive understanding of the distinct features of sharing economy companies in China and how they differ from those in Europe. The report fills an important gap in the literature, which is deficient in explaining how the cultural and political environment of different countries impacts the sharing economy. Collaborative thinking pioneers such as Botsman and Rogers (2010), Chase (2015) as well as Liu and Wu (2016) provide theoretical framework in understanding the concept of the sharing economy and collaborative consumption. A set of extended qualitative research interviews with professionals and students with experience living in both Europe and China are presented. Themes from these discussions, which highlight the features of the sharing economy in both China and Europe, are explored. The Chinese sharing economy is in general found to be more service-based and fast moving than its European equivalent, which functions in a different framework based on concepts of community and sustainability. The importance of trust and understanding of the Chinese political system in this kind of business is highlighted. Strategies for carrying out business in the Chinese sharing economy are discussed. This paper is particularly aimed towards European companies who wish to do business within the sector of the sharing economy in China.

Although sharing economy was proposed thirty years ago, it has penetrated into finance, catering, housekeeping services, agricultural production and other fields in recent years. Against the background of wide-spread entrepreneurship and innovation, the development of sharing economy is of great significance to the steady growth of China's economy. This paper defines sharing economy, and describes its characteristics, the driving force of formation and the main business model by taking taxi-hailing Didi which is a typical case in the sharing economy as an example. This paper researches the business model of sharing economy. At last, we put forward some suggestions for the development of sharing economy in China.

TI How active social network site use affects green consumption: A
   moderated mediation model
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB A growing body of literature suggests a link between the usage of social networking sites (SNSs) and green consumption. However, researchers have shown that not all types of SNS usage have the same effect on individuals; therefore, to fully understand the relationship between a particular SNS use type and green consumption, as well as the mechanisms underlying the relationship, more research is required. This study examined a moderated mediation model based on self-awareness theory to explain the "how" and "why" of the relationship between active SNS use and green consumption. An offline survey (N = 210) and an online survey (N = 348) were conducted. The results suggest that active SNS use is positively associated with green consumption via public self-awareness and that impression management motives moderate the mediating role of public self-awareness in the relationship between active SNS use and green consumption. By examining the connection between a specific type of SNS use (active SNS use) and green consumption, our study adds to the body of literature on the causes of green consumption. The results have substantial implications for future research promoting socially responsible consumption behavior.

TI Incumbents and business model innovation for the sharing economy:
   Implications for sustainability
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB In addition to fostering the rise of new players in various sectors, the sharing economy has attracted the attention of established companies, the so-called 'incumbents'. Some incumbents have joined the sharing economy to both reap its emerging opportunities and tackle newcomers' competition. The entry of incumbents comes at a time in which the sharing economy, still in its initial stages, is the 'battlefield' between actors defending its original sustainability promise, based on the efficient use of resources, social bonding, non-monetized relationships and power of the communities, and those supporting the need to compromise on the principles, to ensure the sharing economy's expansion. Given incumbents' size and power, their entry is likely to significantly affect the shape of the sharing economy. Our study explores the implications for environmental, social and economic value creation of the different ways in which incumbents are changing their existing business models to join the sharing economy. We develop a typology of business model innovation for sharing, which stems from the literature on sustainable business models in particular, and present illustrative cases of incumbents' entry in the sharing economy. For every type adopted by incumbents, the sustainability dimensions are subsequently explored, considering both the benefits and drawbacks of incumbents' entry in the sharing economy. The final section concludes, and discusses implications for research, practice and policy. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The main objective of the article was to demonstrate and prove the role of the sharing economy in integrating local communities as well as in improving the quality of life of urban residents. The sharing economy is an alternative model of consumption entered around an access to given goods without the need to possess it. The concept fits excellently into the ideas that are at the core of the social economy. Internet groups operating in the area of the sharing economy were analysed for the purpose of the article. Their members either live in or have other bonds with Krakow. They are usually focused around issues important for local communities. In the research, a triangulation method was used, involving a desk analysis as well as a passive observation and a covered participative observation. Such choice of methods allowed for the topic of the impact that the sharing economy has on the integration and the quality of life of urban residents to be analysed. The research confirmed that the sharing economy; as a form of social innovation; influences the improvement of the quality of life. Online groups integrate local communities and have a significant impact on the quality of life of city residents (T1; T2; T3; T4). The bilateral nature of dependency between the sharing economy and the quality of life was noticed. Firstly; the sharing economy affects the shape and quality of the product or service that is the subject of the transaction. It is also crucial to create a general "ambience of a site" in the internet group; which supports and stimulates satisfaction of the needs related to the sense of individuality; authenticity and community. On the other hand; the sharing economy affects the satisfaction of residents through economic; psychological; political and social impacts as well as individual ones; related to, e.g., the development of creativity and the acquisition of new skills

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This study assessed relationship characteristics and social capital from the perspective of interdependent linkage between sharing economy businesses and consumers, which can create the social network and relationship competitive advantage. It verified the importance of the creative production process of the value network of sharing economy businesses. For this purpose, the statistical techniques were used to perform frequency, reliability/validity, suitability, and path analyses on 522 subjects active in sharing economy service communities. A structural model was thus proposed. The results of the study are as follows. First, the results of the path analysis between the relationship characteristics and social network (social relationships, social commitment) of sharing economy businesses showed that mutual influence and emotional connection had a significant effect on social relationships, and mutual influence, sense of belonging, and emotional connection had a significant effect on social commitment. Second, the results of the path analysis between social capital and social network (social relationships, social commitment) of sharing economy businesses showed that pursuit for self-fulfillment, social participation, and pleasure had a significant effect on social commitment. Third, the results of the path analysis between the social relationships, social commitment, relationship competitive advantage, and continuance commitment of sharing economy businesses showed that social relationships and social commitment had a significant effect on relationship competitive advantage, while relationship competitive advantage had a significant effect on continuance commitment.

TI Evaluation of the Impact of Sharing Economy on Hotel Business
SO JOURNAL OF TOURISM AND SERVICES
AB The sharing economy is growing in the hotel industry very fast. The study is important for the hotel's management - strategy formulation. The aim of this research is to evaluate the sharing economy effect on hotels in Lithuania. Correlation and regression analysis methods were used for achieving the aim. The study analyses if the sharing economy has caused any impact on accommodating tourists at hotels, hotels income from accommodation services, and room occupancy rate. Results reveal a positive relationship between the sharing economy and all investigated indicators of hotel activities, thus indicating that the hotel business is growing together with the sharing economy. The hotels' sector in Lithuania has continued to grow while more and more hosts and consumers joined the sharing economy. Results imply that the sharing economy is not a competitor for the Lithuanian hotels business as the sharing economy targets different tourist segment, moreover the market is capacious for both segments. Sharing economy in the accommodation sector - a niche with its own customer group. The research results are important for making correct decisions in the Lithuanian tourism industry as other researches in other countries show a negative impact on the sharing economy on the hotels' sector. The rapid growth of the sharing economy in Lithuania may oblige hotels to focus on the sharing economy and consider further actions.

TI The Effect of Green Values on Green Consumption Behaviour
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
AB Taking Zhengzhou residents as the research object through the structural equation model test and intermediary utility test, it can be seen that green values significantly affect customers' green consumption behavior; Green values have a significant active effect on public lifestyle, which plays a regulatory role in green values and green consumption behavior. The relevant conclusions are as follows: Firstly, the public's green consumption behavior is affected not only by their green values, but also by lifestyle, and the impact effect of lifestyle is higher than that of green values. Secondly, public green values can directly affect their lifestyle, which means that green values play a vital role in the change of public lifestyle. Thirdly, green values not only have a direct impact on the public's green consumption behavior, but also have an impact on the public's lifestyle which will indirectly affect their green consumption behavior. On the basis of the mentioned analysis, this paper proposes relevant countermeasures to promote the public's green consumption behavior.

TI Impacts of the Sharing Economy on Urban Sustainability: The Perceptions
   of Municipal Governments and Sharing Organisations
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB By changing the institutionalised practices associated with resource distribution, the sharing economy could support sustainable urban transformations. However, its impacts on urban sustainability are unknown and contested, and key actors hold different perceptions about them. Understanding how they frame these impacts could help solve conflicts and outline what can be done to influence the development of the sharing economy in a way that fosters urban sustainability. This study explores the diversity of these frames across actors (sharing economy organisations and municipalities), segments (accommodation, bicycle, and car sharing), and cities (Amsterdam and Toronto). A framework of the impacts on urban sustainability was developed following a systematic literature review. This then guided the analysis of secondary data and 51 interviews with key actors. Results show that accommodation sharing is framed most negatively due to its impact on urban liveability. Bicycle sharing is surrounded by less conflict. Still, in Amsterdam, which has a well-functioning bicycle infrastructure, it is viewed less positively than in Toronto. Car sharing is the most positively framed segment in Amsterdam as its potentials to lower emissions align with municipal sustainability agendas. Practical insights for negotiations between sharing economy organisations and municipalities to advance urban sustainability are proposed.

The aim of this paper is to describe the advantages and disadvantages of a sharing economy especially in the context unfair competition. In the first part, the principles of sharing economy are introduced. The second part is focused on Airbnb, the main player, which represents a controversial approach to "sharing accommodation", similar to Uber in the "carpooling" segment. The case study of Airbnb is aimed at the city of Prague. Data on the number of property owners, units, beds and prices are also mentioned. The monitored period is between April 2016 and April 2017. Comparison with traditional providers is mentioned. At the end of this paper, there is a discussion about potential restrictions of the accommodation segment and consequent recommendations, which correspond to the recommendations of the European Union, are proposed too.

TI A Profile-Based Approach to Understanding Social Exchange: Authentic
   Tour-Guiding in the Sharing Economy
SO JOURNAL OF TRAVEL RESEARCH
AB Authenticity in travel and tourism research is often explored at the tangible-existential nexus. However, the collaborative forces embedded within digital sharing economy platforms draw attention to how the promise of social exchange can stimulate authentic consumption. The role of tour guides has evolved accordingly, from professional designation to self-acquired identity enacted ad-hoc. This study therefore applies a deductive-inductive approach-investigating over 100,000 tour guide profiles on the digital sharing economy platform -to frame authenticity as the diverse manifestation of promised social exchanges. Combining automated qualitative analysis for large datasets with manual inductive reasoning, the findings identify four types of authenticity demonstrated within sharing economy tour guide profiles: situational, natural, personal, and positional. Doing so extends established understanding of tangible-existential and sincere-trustworthy tourism industry authenticity by capturing social exchanges in dynamic contexts; acknowledging the diverse nature of the promise of authentic tourism service delivery and consumption therein.

TI Exploring public attention about green consumption on Sina Weibo: Using
   text mining and deep learning
SO SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
AB Achieving the goal of carbon neutrality and carbon peak as scheduled puts forward new demands for the green transition of low-carbon lifestyle in Chinese society. In-depth practice of green consumption (GC) behavior can effectively promote the supply-side and consumption-side emission reduction work, but the phenomenon of "high awareness, low practice" is widespread in GC. The causes of consumers' low practice of GC need to be analyzed from the perspective of time and space from the actual media data. Furthermore, this process assists policymakers and stakeholders to understand the general attitude of the public towards GC, clarifying the propagation path of public emotions and the source of negative emotions. Based on the data from Sina Weibo, this paper applied text mining, a hybrid model of convolu-tional neural network and long and short-term memory neural network to analyze the public's attention, sentiment tendency and hot topics on GC. The results show that the vast majority of the Chinese public has a positive attitude toward GC; women and economically developed regions are more concerned about GC; the drivers of positive public sentiment toward GC include environmental awareness education, air pollution prevention and control, and online shopping; high green product prices, excessive time costs, chaotic sharing economy and one-size-fits-all solutions lead to negative public sentiment toward GC. By providing public sentiment analysis of GC, this research would assist decision-makers to understand the dissemination mechanism of public will in social media and clarify targeted solutions, which is of great significance for policy formulation and improvement.(c) 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

Paper points out different aspects of the sharing economy which are successively widespread globally. Sharing economy is the concept known already for several years, its concrete forms have been developed and changed in the meantime. There still not exist one accepted definition, as different factors of the sharing economy could be taken into account. In Slovakia, the "sharing economy" is still not very extended, even though it could serve as a solution for different issues which our economy is challenged with. Paper tries to look at economic background of the sharing economy in general, with special focus on the explanation of the need of private regulation within the sharing economy, compared to the public regulation needed in other sectors of economy. Last but not least, paper introduces the understanding of the sharing economy within the European Union, pointing out importance of it presented trough the different documents of the EU institutions.

TI Post-COVID reorientation of the Sharing economy in a hyperconnected
   world
SO JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING
AB The unbridled propagation of the sharing economy halted abruptly with the onset of the pandemic, forcing sharing economy companies to respond to the new set of challenges faced by them. There were marked differences between the pre- and post-COVID challenges. Post-COVID, sharing economy companies designed novel response strategies including tempering ambitions, adapting business models, designing new standard operating procedures, displaying empathy towards employees and partners, building trust, and sharing information with stakeholders. This signified a reorientation of sharing economy companies in the hyperconnected world where there is a blurring of boundaries as brand experiences and meanings are cocreated by stakeholders. Sharing economy companies would need to focus on different set of values to attain competitive advantage in the post-COVID world - partnership instead of confrontation, nurturing instead of destructive, open and sharing instead of closed, and empathetic instead of uncaring. This can help create meaningful differentiation and provide competitive advantage.

TI Sharing Economy: The Relationship between Airbnb, the Accommodation
   Industry and New Tourist Flows. The Case of Bologna Metropolitan Area
   (Italy)
SO ALMATOURISM-JOURNAL OF TOURISM CULTURE AND TERRITORIAL DEVELOPMENT
AB The aim of this paper is to assess the relationship between tourist accommodations managed through sharing-economy portals and the tourist facilities professionally managed (typically hotels) in terms of direct and indirect competition. Moreover, the analysis of the turnover associated with different kinds of facilities bookable on Airbnb, the most widely used sharing-economy portal for tourism, allow to assess the ratio of "core sharing" (the sharing-economy in its proper meaning) in Airbnb business and to estimate new tourist flows brought about by the portal. The analysis has been carried out for the metropolitan area of Bologna (Italy) in the years 2015-18. This work shows that only 20% of the turnover recorded by Airbnb in Bologna metro area can be associated to "pure" sharing-economy, meanwhile the remaining 80% have various levels of professional management that, in many cases (though not all), undermine the peer-to-peer nature of the relationship established between the parties involved (peer-to-peer relationship is a must of proper sharing-economy). Of this 80% of turnover, while 44% is associated with facilities that can be considered in direct competition with hotels, 36% is made by tourist accommodations that, to a various degrees, play indirect competition with hotels, thus activating new tourist flows towards Bologna metro area.

AB This study investigates the impacts of the sharing economy and vehicle automation on household vehicle ownership by considering the earning potential of household vehicles. While many studies have examined the impact of the sharing economy (namely ridesourcing) on vehicle ownership of ridesourcing customers, there is a gap in understanding its impact on vehicle ownership among ridesourcing suppliers. Data from an original survey are used to develop discrete choice models that evaluate the effects of earning potential, automation, and shared autonomous vehicle services on vehicle transaction decisions. The estimated models are applied to perform national-level simulations. It is found that, in comparison to a non-sharing economy context, individuals in the sharing economy tend to purchase more vehicles in times of income gain, and to preserve their fleets more readily in times of income loss. This study provides evidence that the sharing economy incentivizes some individuals to own more - not fewer - vehicles..

SO ECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAZIVANJA
AB COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the economies around the world and the economic fallout from preventive measures such as lockdown is enormous. It has massive repercussions for the sharing economy as well. This research paper empirically analyses the impact of lockdown restrictions on five major sectors of the sharing economy such as ride-hailing, accommodation, freelance work, entertainment and delivery services. To evaluate this impact, we employed the difference-in-difference estimation technique using the Google trends data for selected countries. Daily search data of 2019 and 2020 is reindexed to examine the change in search patterns that occurred after lockdown. The empirical results show that transportation and accommodation sectors are negatively impacted by COVID-19 related lockdown while the other sectors of the sharing economy such as freelance work, streaming services and online deliveries are seeing a surge in searches. The findings of this study provide vital insights into the economic disruptions caused by COVID-19 related lockdown. We have highlighted the sectors that are booming during pandemic thus the sharing economy platforms and government shave opportunities to invest in these sectors to jump-start the economy. The recently unemployed gig workers can also be employed in these sectors to address the problem of unemployment.

AB The notion of the sharing economy has been introduced in many sectors and provided significant benefits to consumers and asset owners. Despite the remarkable improvement of the sharing economy in recent years, its relationship with sustainability remains insufficiently researched. This study adopts a sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) perspective. A large-scale survey with 420 participants showed that investment recovery (IR) practices and corporate social responsibility (CSR) conducted by sharing economy platforms significantly and positively affect customers' intention to use sharing economy-based services/products, whereas internal green management (IGM), supplier green management (SGM), eco-design (ECD) and customer green management (CGM) practices do not. A follow-up qualitative study with ten participants provided further explanations and supported the findings of the survey. This study links the sharing economy and sustainability by testing the effectiveness of sharing economy platforms' sustainable practices and proposes the best practices for sharing economy platforms to maintain a long-term sustainable marketplace.

AB This paper discusses the concept of sharing economy, which is at the centre of the fourth industrial revolution, together with artificial intelligence, big data and 3D printing. The development of sharing economy has been determined by economic, social and cultural factors. The concept of sharing economy can be discussed from the view of consumer protection law, employment law, personal data protection, competition law, state aid and other areas. There is a necessity to re-evaluate traditional concepts in the new market circumstances. The existing concepts can hardly fit in the new models. This paper will try to specify the influence of the sharing economy on certain competition law issues. Rules about new business models have multiple effects on all market participants. Sharing economy affects undertakings, market structure, definition of the relevant market as well as finding of potential abuses and other competition law infringements. There is a need for reconsideration of existing definitions and their flexible application to innovative business models.

TI A systematic review and future directions of the sharing economy:
   business models, operational insights and environment-based utilities
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB With the emergence of a series of physical sharing platforms such as Uber and Airbnb, the business model of the sharing economy (SE) is rapidly developing globally. Existing research on the sharing economy mainly involves three main aspects: the connotation of the sharing economy, the business model of the sharing economy, and the impact of the sharing economy. We begin by introducing the reasons why the sharing economy is booming and why customers from different positions participate in the sharing economy. Then we summarize the basic mechanisms of the consumer-to-consumer (C2C) and business-to-consumer (B2C) aspects of the sharing economy. Regarding the main causes of the sharing economy, we specifically focus on the impacts of the sharing economy on the environment, i.e., whether sharing economy is eco-friendly to the society. We consider product life cycle assessment (LCA) technology as one of the frontiers and key technologies in the fields of green design and green manufacturing. Furthermore, combined with the impact of COVID-19 on the sharing economy and the actual problems in real life, we present the future development directions of the sharing economy.

TI Sharing Economy: For or against Sustainable Development
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The development of sharing economy business models is one of the features of the digital economy. The issue of sustainable development has been of particular importance in the intensively developed theory of the sharing economy. However, methodological approaches for examining the relationship between the sharing economy and sustainable development need further investigation. Economic and mathematical models that allow for a quantitative estimate of the impact of the development of the sharing economy on the sustainable development goals achievement have to be enhanced. This contribution attempts to fill the indicated gap. We have examined the relationship between the sharing economy and the sustainable development goals achievement in three directions, namely by analyzing the prerequisites for the sharing economy emergence, by tracing the sharing economy theory evolution, and by investigating the quantitative impact of the sharing economy development on the sustainable development goals achievement. To determine the sharing economy's impact on sustainable development, a three-dimensional indicator based on the triple-p concept was developed. The correlation between the sharing economy and the unemployment rate has been used as an indicator of the influence the sharing economy has on the social domain. The correlation between the sharing economy and waste generation has been used as an indicator of the influence the sharing economy has on the environmental domain. The correlation between the sharing economy and GDP has been used as an indicator of the influence the sharing economy has on the economic domain. As a result of the study, the insignificant influence of the development of the sharing economy on the achievement of the quantitative goals of sustainable development was established. The main reason for this is the lack of acceptable macroeconomic indicators. The rise of the digital economy has been made into standard macroeconomic indicators that are insufficient to assess the social, environmental, and economic areas of sustainable development. The existing problems of regulating the digital economy threaten its inherent positive features. The developed model can be used to diagnose the influence of the sharing economy on sustainable development goals achievement, and can also be finalized regarding the available statistical base.

AB In recent years, sharing economy has developed rapidly all over the world, which has attracted extensive attention from scholars at home and abroad. At present, most scholars focus on the internal mechanism and external influence of the sharing economy, lacking of relevant studies on the statistical accounting of the sharing economy. The statistical results of the sharing economy will directly affect the development of the sharing economy and the supervision of relevant departments on the sharing economy. Therefore, this paper attempts to analyze the three major problems existing in the statistical work of sharing economy in China, namely: lacking of a unified statistical caliber of sharing economy, lacking of a complete statistical index system of sharing economy and obtaining the statistical data is difficult. Finally, aiming at these three major problems, this paper establishes the statistical index system of the sharing economy by determining the statistical caliber and characteristics of the sharing economy, and then determines the source of statistical data. These works can provide solutions to the three problems, promote the development of the statistical work of the sharing economy, and provide suggestions for policies.

SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB While the sharing economy is often linked to the discussion on sustainable development, relatively little research has explored the potential of sharing economy business models to create sustainable value. Based on a review of the prior literature on sharing economy business models and sustainable value creation, in addition to exploring the empirical examples of companies under sharing sphere, this study shows that business model choices do matter; it is not self-evident that sharing economy business models advance sustainability. This study contributes to the current literature by introducing a specified categorization of 13 different sharing economy business models and a conceptual framework to help analyze the sustainable value creation potential of different business models. For managers, this study offers insights into the sustainability potential of different sharing economy business models and highlights the most crucial points to be considered in managerial decision-making.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT
AB Many organizations seek to position themselves as part of the sharing economy, due to positive conceptual connotations; however, in reality, some may more closely represent the exchange rather than the sharing economy. This research analyses the extent to which Airbnb and Fairbnb.coop represent the sharing economy by examining the characteristics of the sharing economy. We utilize a Sharing Index (SI) and a Sharing Economy Continuum (SEC) to measure each organization's degree of sharing and exchange. The analysis suggests that Fairbnb.coop is a stronger example of the sharing economy than Airbnb. This study offers a more robust characterization of the sharing economy and offers tools to help businesses assess and improve their business practices to more accurately align with the true sharing economy.

AB The paper deals with a sharing economy system with various management factors by using a bulk input G/M/1 type queuing model. The effective management of operating costs is vital for controlling the sharing economy platform and this research builds the theoretical background to understand the sharing economy business model. Analytically, the techniques include a classical Markov process of the single channel queueing system, semi-Markov process and semi-regenerative process. It uses the stochastic congruent properties to find the probability distribution of the number of contractors in the sharing economy platform. The obtained explicit formulas demonstrate the usage of functional for the main stochastic characteristics including sharing expenses due to over contracted resources and optimization of their objective function.

AB The rise of sharing economy has accelerated the growth of marketing analytics to match demand and supply in industrial markets. However, the conceptualization of marketing analytics remains unclear in the sharing economy. Theorizing market turbulence as the dark side of the sharing economy, this study presents a marketing analytics capability model using dynamic capabilities and contingency theories to advance thought and practice in industrial marketing research. Using a thematic analysis and a survey-based empirical study on B2B cloud sharing platforms (n = 252), the findings present pattern identification, real-time solutions and data governance as the antecedents of marketing analytics capability with its holistic effects on marketing agility and marketing effectiveness. The empirical findings further support the mediating role of marketing agility and the moderating impact of market turbulence on marketing analytics-effectiveness and marketing agility-effectiveness chain. Overall, our results contribute toward a more nuanced understanding of the dark side of market turbulence on marketing analytics capability dynamics in the sharing economy.

It presents its characteristic features, preconditions for the emergence of a contemporary form of sharing economy, advantages and disadvantages, development and crucial forms. It describes and analyses changes that were directly or indirectly determined by sharing economy in the economy and especially in the tourism sector. The second part focuses on the practical application of this phenomenon from the point of view of a young generation. We assumed that this segment would be characteristic with a higher potential for the use of shared products and service. Hypotheses were confronted with a questionnaire survey launched in October 2014 on a sample of 192 university students aged between 20-25 years. The results were quite surprising. Respondents had difficulties with the very term "sharing economy". They also tend to use sharing platforms rather rarely and still prefer standard ways. The results open a discussion if this phenomenon will be developing in the future in our conditions, or whether it will remain just a short-term trend with a marginal impact.

AB The sharing economy is an umbrella term for different business models that seem to have a positive impact on sustainability. To achieve sustainable development, the UN has created 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as an instrument and guide for countries and individuals. This paper sheds light on the relationships between the sharing economy, sustainability and SDGs through the content analysis of 74 papers from the database Web of Science that consider these factors through the topics of the environment, consumer values, business characteristics and urban impact regarding sectors such as mobility and accommodation. Results express that the sharing economy helps to achieve all SDGs. However, further research is needed because of the novelty of the topic and the existence of many gaps. The sharing economy has a positive effect on the dimensions of sustainability from the economic, social and environmental points of view.

Attempts are made to understand market orientation from cultural and behavioral perspectives to accelerate marketing innovation and identify measures for SCA and performance building. Frequency, reliability, validity, fitness, and path analyses were performed on 400 respondents, and a structural model was used. The results are as follows. First, functional coordination of the cultural market orientation of sharing economy business with consumer orientation significantly affected product innovation, but competitive orientation's effect on product innovation was not significant. Competitive orientation and functional coordination significantly affected communication innovation, but consumer orientation's effect on communication innovation was not significant. Second, market information generation and response to market information of behavioral market orientation of sharing economy business significantly influenced product innovation, but market information exchange's influence on product innovation was not significant. Even though market information exchange and response to market information had a significant influence on communication innovation, the influence of market information generation on communication innovation was not significant. Third, both product and communication innovation of the marketing innovation of sharing economy business significantly influenced SCA. Fourth, the SCA of sharing economy business significantly influenced market dominating power.

We identify indispensable aspects of the sharing economy to show its potential in fostering sustainability. This is in some contrast to existing definitions and applications of sharing economy business models, which do not place sustainability in their focus. The studies employ a variety of methods, covering quantitative and qualitative research to investigate building of communities on the consumer side, as well as trust-building and implementation of regulations in the interaction between providers and consumers in Asia and Europe. Some areas in the sharing economy foster sustainability, some foster social cohesion and in the end build social capital, but others focus at first sight on convenience and lifestyle.

AB Recently, the sharing economy market is becoming increasingly competitive due to the expansion on a global scale and entry of diverse categories and types of businesses. In Japan, companies from various sectors gathered together to establish the Sharing Economy Association, Japan in December 2015 for the purpose of popularizing and developing the sharing economy. Vigorous activities are also being carried out including the relaxation of regulations surrounding the sharing economy and the operation of a sharing economy certification system. Currently, its commercialization is under way in various sectors, one of which is ridesharing services mainly in provincial cities. However, businesses often fail to endure for reasons such as varying vehicle operation rates, insufficient revision of operation plans, and shortsighted business evaluations. Accordingly, Fujitsu offers the SPATIOWL On-Demand Transportation Service and works on data utilization, the linking of transfer and operation information, stimulation and creation of demand, and support for business improvement by connecting with other services. This paper presents the features of the SPATIOWL On-Demand Transportation Service technology developed and future prospects of this service.

SO JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES
AB The objective of this special issue is to expand our understanding of the sharing economy. To this end, we consider how the sharing economy can be demarcated and provide a definition that distinguishes the sharing economy from other forms of economic organization and resource orchestration. Specifically, the sharing economy entails multisided platforms that facilitate user access to - rather than ownership of - assets that are rivalrous in their use, and that are not owned by said platforms. Using this definition, we identify and show how the sharing economy creates and distributes economic value among participants and we summarize the six articles in the special issue. All in all, this introduction and the six studies clarify how the sharing economy and its three main constituencies - sharing platforms, asset providers, and users - reduce commercial friction by increasing trust, facilitating interaction, easing resource access and orchestration, and maximizing ecosystem-wide value.

SE ARCIALA Series on Intellectual Assets and Law in Asia
AB With the growing Internet technology, mobile payment, logistics infrastructure, and huge demographic dividends, China's sharing economy has been leaping forward in recent years, reshaping China's economic pattern and becoming one of the priorities in China's economic development in the future. However, with the expansion of the sharing economy and the continuous emergence of various business models, a series of legal risks and challenges are restricting the development of China's sharing economy. This chapter starts with an analysis of the concepts, features, operating principles, and conditions of the sharing economy. In the second part, we introduce the development process of the internet economy, and the germination and status of the sharing economy in China. We then identify the main challenges that the sharing economy in China is now facing, and propose solutions before we end with a conclusion.

TI Theoretical analysis framework of a shared economy supervision and
   management model using mobile information system data
SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
AB Through the use of Internet of Things technology, users and suppliers can be freely matched, and their idle resources can be traded in the display world to improve product utilization. A sharing economy means that organizations or individuals with idle resources transfer the right to use these resources to others for rewards; thus, sharers create value by sharing their idle resources with others. However, the development time of the sharing economy is short, and the entire development model has shortcomings. This paper aims to study innovation research on the sharing economy supervision mode based on mobile information systems. It links the mobile information system with the sharing economy model and regulates the sharing economy development model. A mobile information system is a model that reflects the internal structure of an information system and the connections between its parts. It generally refers to the structural model of an information system; thus, it is usually represented by a structural diagram. This paper proposes a theoretical analysis framework based on mobile information systems, which provides a theoretical basis for the exploration of the sharing economy. Starting from the intersection of supervision, this paper first discusses the rationality of the implementation of internet sharing economy supervision and points out the problems that exist in the development of the sharing economy. The test results of this paper show that only 18% of people think that the price of online car-hailing is high, and only 7.7% of people think that the price of online car-hailing is very high; these results indicate that the current price of shared transportation needs to be increased.

TI Disentangling the facets of sharing: A categorization of what we know
   and don't know about the Sharing Economy
SO INTERNET RESEARCH
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop a categorization of sharing practices from a structured interdisciplinary literature review on the Sharing Economy. Instead of striving for a new definition, the authors distinguish nine types of sharing practices and provide an overview of prior investigations on sharing practices across three levels of analysis and 15 research areas. The structured analysis is translated into opportunities for future research on the Sharing Economy.
   Design/methodology/approach The study follows a structured literature review approach to uncover practices related to the Sharing Economy and similar phenomena. The authors analyze 210 articles from a broad number of disciplines, and develop a categorizing framework for Sharing Economy practices.
   Findings The paper identifies nine different types of sharing practices and provides a structured way for analyzing, comparing and positioning research on the Sharing Economy and related phenomena.
   Research limitations/implications The categorization of sharing practices and the embedded interdisciplinary overview of studies on the Sharing Economy help to explain potentially contradictory research results and uncovers opportunities for future research in the topic area.
   Originality/value Given the variety of disciplines dealing with the Sharing Economy and the plenitude of definitions and related concepts, the categorization and research overview provides a consolidated view of the knowledge in the topic area and an effective tool for identifying paths for future research.

TI Airbnb's effect on hotel sales growth
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT
AB Disruption of existing industries by peer-to-peer sharing economy platforms, like Airbnb, has received extensive media attention primarily regarding the regulatory and the social aspects of the sharing economy. In this paper, we examine the substitution and complementary effects of Airbnb supply on hotel sales performance patterns in San Francisco, the birthplace of Airbnb. Our results, based on a mixed-model analysis using a saturated, unstructured covariance matrix, show that overall hotel RevPAR is unrelated to total Airbnb supply. Interestingly however, in certain segments, RevPAR is affected by the average price of Airbnb listings. More importantly, hotel sales performance is impacted by Airbnb customer reviews, which points to nuanced and contextual complementary and substitution effects. We outline suggestions for future research as well as practical implications for hotel firms operating in similar markets where Airbnb has high penetration rates.

TI Impact of ethics training and audits on the relationship quality of
   business-to-business partners in sharing economy
SO INDUSTRIAL MARKETING MANAGEMENT
AB Sharing economy is flourishing and increasingly customers are shifting towards "using instead of owning" products and services. The objective of our research is to empirically prove that low organizational trust can trigger strict organizational practices such as ethics training and audits but excessive use of both of these practices can negatively impact the relationship quality in sharing economy. In doing so, it has detrimental effects on co-creation and co-innovation particularly when the goals are related to emotional cognitive, material support and relationship building. This study, therefore, targets to scrutinize the dark side of B2B sharing economy platforms using the ethical theory of organizing. The unique contribution of this study is first, showcasing the relationships between ethical climate, ethical practices and consequences. Second, it highlights that B2B alliances that perceive strictness in ethics audits have a low level of willingness to enhance relationship quality. However, the effect of strictness in ethics training does not lead to the development of a low level of willingness to enhance relationship quality. This is an interesting finding and generates a theoretical debate. The findings of the study will promote the development of an ethical model that addresses the negative aspects of the B2B sharing economy.

Since 2008, Airbnb revolutionizes the travel industry; Airbnb is an enabled digital sharing economy platform that is a profoundly alternative to the lodging sectors. Have you ever used Airbnb services (as a host or guest)?. This study is an exploratory analysis study to understand the rental landscape in Austin, Texas (ATX) through various static and interactive visualizations methods. Our study focuses on the impact of a peer-to-peer accommodation platform on the local economy and the lodging industry; and how positives reviews promote the most lucrative listing, accommodation, or host. Our findings elevate Airbnb's colossal impact on the Austin economy and lodging sectors. We found that offering the entire property in a good location with high cleaning standards is attractive on the Airbnb platform, which means more lucrative.

AB Sharing economy platforms are rapidly scaling up by reaching increasingly diverse demographics. However, this expansion comes with great difficulties in adequately identifying and responding to everyone's needs. In this paper, we study gender-related behaviors of guests on the currently most prominent home-sharing platform, Airbnb. While our results confirm the efficacy of Airbnb's reputation system, we also find that the level of trust and participation on the platform varies by gender. In particular, female solo travelers are more likely to be conscious of review sentiment and choose more often female hosts than male solo travelers. Our findings are obtained by combining exploratory data analysis with large-scale experiments and call for further studies on the usage of sharing economy platforms among subpopulations, informing and improving both policy and practice in these growing online environments.

TI Selfish Sharing? The Impact of the Sharing Economy on Tax Reporting
   Honesty
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB In the last decade, advances in technology have significantly disrupted the way firms provide goods and services. At the forefront of this technological disruption is the sharing economy, where individuals earn income by providing services or sharing assets through peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms. With global revenues in the sharing economy projected to increase substantially in the next decade, income from this economy will continue to be an important source of tax revenues for governments around the world. However, sceptics argue that the sharing economy inherently lends itself to dishonest reporting of taxable income. We employ an online experiment, using 746 taxpayers, to observe whether the prosocial benefits often promoted by P2P platforms reduce honest reporting of taxable sharing economy income. Consistent with moral licensing theory, we find that earning income from a prosocial-oriented P2P platform liberates taxpayers to dishonestly report their sharing economy income, and this result is fully driven by taxpayers whose personal values are incongruent with values promoted by the P2P platform. Our paper contributes to the limited but growing research on the sharing economy and its implications for ethical decisions. It also adds to the moral licensing literature by identifying value congruency as an important moderator for moral licensing effect.

AB Sustainable development goals (SDGs) are the foremost requirement of the entire world, and a sharing econ-omy is potentially the best way to achieve them, a phenomenon which needs to be emphasized. This study empirically investigates the impact of the environmental, social and economic benefits of a sharing economy on SDG achievement, along with the mediating impact of innovative culture on the association between these benefits of a sharing economy and SDG achievement. This study gathered primary data from sample of employees of transportation industry of Vietnam. The study employs PLS-SEM using Smart-PLS to analyse the association among the constructs. The findings show that the social and economic benefits positively and significantly relate to SDGs achievement. Additionally, the findings also indicate that in the presence of inno-vative culture as a mediator, the determinants of sharing economy benefits are significantly correlated with sustainable development goals.

In the Single Market Strategy and the Digital Single Market Strategy actions are focused on different levels. One of the targeted measures concerns creating additional opportunities for consumers, professionals and businesses. The concept of a balanced development of collaborative economy is particularly stressed. This concept is also known as sharing economy, access economy or peer-to-peer economy. Sharing economy business models present new opportunities to consumers, professionals and workers in the areas that have been governed by traditional rules. The new model challenges the well-established procedures. Indeed, there are many open questions. This article puts emphasis on the impact of sharing economy on the workers' legal status and workers' protection, particularly on the category of crowdworkers.

The present research aims to explore the consumer responses to value co-creation in sharing economy such as satisfaction, brand preference and enduring buyer-platform relationships, amid consumer's CSR concerns.Design/methodology/approach Drawing on the sharing economy and value co-creation literature and rooted in the stimulus-organism-response framework, an online panel data provider was employed to recruit 393 actual sharing economy consumers from the United States. Empirical analyses are performed using structural equation modeling through Amos, version.27.Findings Findings confirm that value co-creation intentions contribute to consumers' satisfaction, brand preference and sustainable social relationships in the sharing economy. As expected, heightened concerns of corporate social responsibility (CSR) led to decreased consumer satisfaction with the sharing economy platform.Originality/value The study contributes to the digital sharing economy literature by emphasizing the role of CSR perceptions for building long-term relationships (buyer-platform relationships) where value co-creation is crucial.

TI Impacts of heterogeneous green consumers on green innovation in electric
   vehicle and charging pile firms
SO SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
AB Although the significant effect of heterogeneous green consumers on green innovation in electric vehicle firms and charging pile firms has been recognized, the influence of heterogeneous green consumers is still unclear. Therefore, we propose a two-dimensional model of vertically differentiated product preferences and horizontally differentiated green quality preferences. In the model, according to the heterogeneity in the perception of green awareness and anticipation of the green quality of charging pile firms, three green consumer segments, namely, light, medium and heavy, are considered. We use this economic model to examine the implications of green innovation by analyzing three green consumer innovation strategies. The findings show that when electric vehicle firms unilaterally implement green product innovation, the corresponding optimal price for charging pile firms decreases in the green consumer segment. The result also suggests that although three green consumer segments exist, it is wise for both types of firms to perform green product innovation. Furthermore, electric vehicle and charging pile firms should increase effort s in green innovation to satisfy consumers' diversified green demands. (C) 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

In addition to the economic aspects of such phenomenon, the activities of the sharing economy can have social and environmental impacts, which brings sustainability pillars into mind. In this paper, based on the system thinking approach, a causal loop diagram that is a part of system dynamics modelling is applied for visualizing the relationships between sharing economy and sustainability pillars. The reinforcing and balancing loops modelled show the dynamics in the system, which help decision makers to gain a deeper and more accurate understanding of the current and potential future mutual interactions between the sharing economy and sustainability.

TI Consumer's attitude to the sharing economy in Russia
SO ROSSIISKII ZHURNAL MENEDZHMENTA-RUSSIAN MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB This research focuses on the main characteristics of a sharing economy, which is one of the fastest-developing sectors of 4.0 industry in the world and in Russia. Because of the increasing role of the consumer as one of the key economic agents in a sharing economy, the research is focused on sharing economy adoption factors at a consumer level. Sharing economy development perspectives and adoption factors, including the drivers and impediments that consumers face, are analyzed in the paper. To identify the factors determining consumer behavior in the sharing economy in Russia, a quantitative survey with 2 576 respondents was conducted. The analysis of empirical data revealed six main factors in the sharing economy from the consumer's perspective: attitude to the sharing economy, difficulties in starting to participate in the sharing economy, perceived risks, the role of property, influence of referent groups, and hygienic factors of the sharing economy. After cluster analysis, three consumer clusters were determined: consumers with a neutral attitude to the sharing economy, skeptical consumers, and competent consumers. The results of the analysis are relevant both for academic research and management practice, and make it possible to draw conclusions about the problems and perspectives of the development of a sharing economy in Russia, which are based on the analysis of the impediments and stimulating development factors (drivers) in the context of the behavioral model of Russian consumers in the sharing economy.

TI The sharing economy: A comprehensive business model framework
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The sharing economy is seen as an important building block for transitions to sustainability. Although the sharing economy concept is widely used, comprehension varies about what makes a sharing economy business model. This study aims to review and categorize the field of sharing economy business model research, by reviewing the fundamentals of the concept of sharing and feeding them back into the business model literature. A comprehensive framework of business model categories is proposed, distinguishing four market segments of the sharing economy: Singular Transaction Models, Subscription Based Models, Commission-Based Platforms and Unlimited Platforms. The study's framework is grounded in an analysis of sharing economy fundamentals and business model literature, contributing to a better understanding of the potentials of sharing economy for sustainability transitions and the implementation of business model innovations.

TI The governance practices of sharing platforms: Unpacking the interplay
   between social bonds and economic transactions
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB The sharing economy represents a form of governance that combines practices which facilitate social bonds and economic transactions. Based on the understanding that enabling desired socio-economic relations between individuals forms the core of the governance of sharing activities, this paper develops a conceptual framework which shows how governance practices for sharing vary in terms of the weight given to social bonding development and economic transaction facilitation. Drawing on literature from management, marketing, economics and sociology as well as empirical studies on the sharing economy, this paper identifies the governance practices to which sharing economy organizations resort to different degrees and in different ways to structure their sharing activities. Potential contradictions and complementarities between governance practices are specified as they can be an important source shaping the specific governance mix of sharing economy organizations. The proposed framework contributes to a fine-grained understanding of the complexity of governance in the sharing economy, it highlights the relevance of the interplay between the social and economic governance practices, and it lays the foundation to empirically capture the governance mix of sharing economy organizations.

SO INTERNET POLICY REVIEW
AB In this study, based on survey data collected from twelve European countries (N=6111), we build on the digital technology access model to examine the role of gender in access to the sharing economy. Applying a "doing gender" perspective, we find that men capitalise on a stronger economic position and a more pronounced orientation to explore new technology to gain access to sharing services, while women rely more on cultural and social capital. We relate our findings to intersectionality theory by discussing how class and gender intersect in facilitating access to the sharing economy.

TI Influence of the Characteristics of Sports Sharing Economy Services on
   Intention of Use: The Mediating Effect of Consumer Attitude and Trust
SO SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL
AB This study empirically investigated the effectiveness of the characteristics of sports sharing economy services that has been highlighted recently. The study used consumers' attitude and trust as parameters of the association between the characteristics and use intention of consumers. There are three research questions in the study. The first question is whether the characteristics of sports sharing economy services affect the consumers' use intention. The second question is whether the characteristics of sports sharing economy services affect the attitude of consumers and the trust level in sports sharing economy services. The third question is whether the attitude and trust level of consumers mediate sports sharing economy services and use intention. A survey was conducted among college students using a convenient sampling method. We found that: (1) service characteristics such as usefulness, bonding, and consistency had a positive influence on use intention, and risk factor had a negative influence; (2) the service characteristics significantly influenced consumer attitudes and trust of the sharing economy services; usefulness, bonding, and consistency had a positive influence, and risk factor had a negative influence; and (3) the attitude and trust of consumers toward sharing economy services affected use intention; usefulness, bonding, and sustainability had a positive influence, while risk factor had a negative influence. Thus, it was confirmed that the attitude and trust level of consumers mediated sports sharing economy services and use intention. This study also suggested academic and practical implications to establish a more effective sports sharing economy service marketing strategy and develop quality content in relation to the service characteristics and consumers.

TI Reshaping Internationalization Strategy and Control for Global
   E-Commerce and Digital Transactions: A Hayekian Perspective
SO MANAGEMENT INTERNATIONAL REVIEW
AB As the sharing economy has grown rapidly and replaced the traditional businesses, new rules and norms for data and digital trade have emerged divergently in many countries. Such divergence in global e-commerce policies may be a major barrier to the internationalization of the sharing economy business. This paper aims to develop an internationalization theory that addresses how the sharing economy firms can internationalize under the condition of the divergence of global e-commerce policies. Drawing on Hayek's knowledge economy approach, we build a new internationalization theory for the sharing economy firms that facilitate autonomously self-organized business ecosystems and adapt to the lack of harmonized rules and norms for the sharing economy. We first theorize on the attributes of the digital platform-based transactions for the internationalization of the sharing economy firms and then provide some insights into the current international debates of e-commerce policies. Our theory offers two main insights: (1) the competitive advantages of the sharing economy firms stem mainly from digital platform algorithms to catalyze digital platform-based transactions between autonomous actors; (2) the divergence of global e-commerce policies and different internet regimes in different countries may affect the internationalization of business models based on such digital platform-based transactions.

TI Sharing economy in hospitality and tourism: a review and the future
   pathways
SO JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY MARKETING & MANAGEMENT
AB This paper aims to provide a systematic review of the academic literature on the sharing economy (SE) phenomenon within hospitality and tourism and identify knowledge gaps that may present opportunities for further research. Using Scopus and WOS, 486 articles published from 2010 to 2019 were identified, out of which three themes emerge as predominant: 1) drivers to participate in the sharing economy, 2) the sharing economy as a disruptive business model and 3) sharing economy impacts and corresponding regulatory issues. This review paper also reveals that the area of foci of extant literature is hospitality and, in particular the accommodation sector, with most studies drawing insights from the Airbnb context. Contrary to previous review papers on the sharing economy, the systematic review undertaken in this paper presents a holistic attempt to understand the SE phenomenon by exploring a wide range of dimensions related to the topic from multiple sources. Overall, the paper makes a theoretical contribution by providing directions for further research. In addition, it summarizes the key suggestions offered by pertinent studies; thus, offering significant practical insights to practitioners and policymakers.

TI The effect of the perceived risk on the adoption of the sharing economy
   in the tourism industry: The case of Airbnb
SO INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT
AB Smart tourism and the sharing economy within it are transforming human lives and are considered a huge innovation in the industry. This change inevitably creates huge resistance, which did not obtain much attention. Thus, this study focuses on sharing economy's risk aspects, which have become a social issue. It investigates how risks affect the development and diffusion of the sharing economy, especially in Airbnb. This study adopts extended model of goal-directed behavior and depicts the decision-making process of potential Airbnb users to analyze risk effect. Results of structural equation modeling applied to 300 potential customers indicate that privacy and financial risks negatively affect the intention to use the sharing economy. However, physical and performance risks are positively related with behavioral intention or desire. This risk paradox can be explained by the disruptive innovation of the sharing economy and the characteristics of risk engagement in tourism. Implications for research and practice are discussed along with the findings of the study.

Adopting an integrated bibliometric approach of citation, co-citation, and co-word analysis, this study analyses 941 articles published on Web of Science from 1978 to 2019. Findings reveal that despite there being a latent concentration in citations distribution, the ascending and descending influence patterns discovered over time indicate a dynamic flow and healthy growth of the field. The analysis of the intellectual structure identifies four main areas of research, with hospitality and tourism being the most developed, and the journals about hospitality being the preferred channel for research into the sharing economy. Finally, for the cognitive structure analysis, in-depth strategic diagrams, thematic evolution, and trend analysis disclose some research gaps. Thus, we contribute to the sharing economy literature by inductively synthesizing, and organizing SE research, and by proposing future research directions.

TI The impact of sharing economy practices on sustainability performance in
   the Chinese construction industry
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB The sharing economy is gradually reshaping the construction industry. This study identifies the use of digital platforms, internal sharing practices with project stakeholders, and external sharing practices with unfamiliar companies as three critical elements of sharing economy practices from a socio-technical perspective. The impacts of these three elements on sustainability performance, including economic performance, environmental performance and social performance, are investigated. Based on a survey of the Chinese construction industry, proposed hypotheses are tested using structural equation modelling. The results indicate that the use of digital platforms can promote both internal and external sharing practices in the construction industry. While internal sharing practices have positive impacts on the three dimensions of sustainability performance, external sharing practices can positively influence only environmental performance. The findings enhance the understanding of sharing economy practices and provide empirical evidence of the relationships between sharing economy practices and sustainability performance in the construction sector.

SO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR DEVELOPMENT
AB Information technologies (ITs), including digital platforms and the Internet of things have dramatically supported prosumption behavior in value co-creation (VCC) development under the sharing economy perspective. However, privacy-safety risk (PSR) and prosumers' trust may significantly impact this transaction through digital platforms under the sharing economy. Therefore, this study examined the prosumption role as a mediator between PSR and VCC through a digital platform under the sharing economy. Moreover, the moderating role of prosumers' trust between prosumption and VCC has been explored. This study used quantitative methodology and data collected from Uber customers in Pakistan and DiDi customers in China. This study found that prosumption mediates the relationship between PSR and VCC and trust moderates the relationship between prosumption and VCC. This study portrays the influence of PSR and prosumers' trust factors to understand the prosumption and VCC relationship through a digital platform that provides a win-win outcome for customers and the company under the sharing economy perspective.

TI Impact of a sharing economy and green energy on achieving sustainable
   economic development: Evidence from a novel NARDL model
SO JOURNAL OF INNOVATION & KNOWLEDGE
AB Recently, the sharing economy has become a significant factor in sustainable economic development (SED), and green energy plays a role in this regard, a phenomenon which requires researchers' frequent emphasis. Thus, the present research investigates the impact of a sharing economy (sharing economy users and sharing economy values) and green energy (renewable energy production and consumption) on achieving SED in China. The article takes inflation and foreign direct investment (FDI) as the control variables. The research uses secondary data extracted from World Development Indicators (WDI) and Statista from 1991 to 2020. It applies the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lagged (NARDL) model to examine the linkages among the constructs. The results reveal that sharing economy users, sharing economy values, renewable energy pro-duction (REP), renewable energy consumption (REC), FDI, and inflation are positively linked with SED achievement in China. This article can help regulators develop regulations related to the achievement of SED using the sharing economy and green energy.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB The emerging sharing economy has important policy implications. To strengthen the basis for policy making, we present an interview study involving sharing economy service owners, policy maker representatives, and research experts. Here, we analyse sharing economy services as human-machine networks, with particular attention to the networked actors and the relations between these, as well as the extent and structure of the sharing economy networks. The study illuminates key challenges and goals for sharing economy services from the perspective of service owners. Implications for policy making are discussed in terms of government regulation as well as self-imposed policies within and across sharing economy service providers.

TI Roles of consumer trust and risks on continuance intention in the
   sharing economy: An empirical investigation
SO ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
AB This empirical study explores the roles of trust, risks and attractiveness of alternatives on customer confirmation, satisfaction and continuance intention in the sharing economy. The interacting effects of physical and psychological risks on them are also examined. Data from an online consumer survey of 458 valid responses were analyzed by structural equation modeling. The results show that the relationship between satisfaction and continuance intention is partially mediated by platform-based trust, driver-based trust and the attractiveness of alternatives and inconsistently mediated by structural assurance. Physical and psychological risks can positively moderate the relationship between driver-based trust and continuance intention. This study provides new insights on specifying which types of trust and risks can affect consumers' intention to reuse in the sharing economy. The study also suggests new ideas for service providers to retain their consumers in this emerging sharing economy.

CL San Diego, CA
AB Information and communications technology has fostered the rise of the sharing economy, enabling individuals to share excess capacity. In this paper, we focus on Airbnb.com, which is among the most prominent examples of the sharing economy. We take the perspective of an accommodation provider and investigate the concept of trust, which facilitates complete strangers to form temporal C2C relationships on Airbnb.com. In fact, the implications of trust in the sharing economy fundamentally differ to related online industries. In our research model, we investigate the formation of trust by incorporating two antecedents - Disposition to trust' and 'Familiarity with Airbnb.com'. Furthermore, we differentiate between 'Trust in Airbnb.com' and 'Trust in renters' and examine their implications on two provider intentions. To seek support for our research model, we conducted a survey with 189 participants. The results show that both trust constructs are decisive to successfully initiate a sharing deal between two parties.

TI COMPARISON OF THE ENVIRONMENT OF EU COUNTRIES FOR SHARING ECONOMY STATE
   BY MODERN MULTIPLE CRITERIA METHODS
SO AMFITEATRU ECONOMIC
AB The rapid growth of the sharing economy attracts attention from scientists, businesses, and governments. The European Commission acknowledges the benefits of the sharing economy and emphasises that European countries should be open to the new opportunities that the sharing economy brings. The sharing economy makes an essential contribution to job creation and growth in the European Union. The sharing economy creates new markets and expands existing ones. It makes the use of resources more efficient due to the extensive sharing of assets. Sharing improves resource conservation and efficiency of use, reformats consumption patterns, raises the spirit of entrepreneurship and responsibility of every capital owner, and improves social trust among people worldwide. Despite the focus of researchers on the sharing economy, there is still a lack of research on conditions that stimulate the sharing economys growth. The article lays the foundation for creating a more comprehensive methodology for assessing the growth of the sharing economy. The authors apply multi-criterion decision-making methods for research purposes, such as EDAS and PROMETHEE II, and recently developed CILOS and IDOCRIW for criteria weight calculation. A hierarchy structure of criteria for evaluating sharing economy growth was created and presented in the paper. The resulting weights of criteria of performance of sharing economy growth were obtained. The prominent features of hierarchy structures and the methodology for calculating ultimate weights are described and demonstrated. The results reveal that the environment is more favourable for sharing economy growth in the Netherlands, Germany, and Sweden among the chosen European countries.

TI Green entrepreneurship in the sharing economy: utilising multiplicity of
   institutional logics
SO SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS
AB The green potential of the sharing economy to exploit underutilised or redundant resources has generated a considerable interest and expectations on the part of government institutions, investors and consumers. Alongside the emerging green logic, more established economic and social logics appear to be critical for growth of sharing platforms. Applying an institutional logics approach, this paper investigates how entrepreneurial teams in the sharing economy deal with this complexity of expectations of various constituents and institutions. Based on 30 semi-structured interviews with founders and executives of UK sharing platforms, we examine the strategies used by entrepreneurial teams to utilise and combine the green logic with other institutional logics present. The results demonstrate that sharing platforms are able to grow via utilising the green logic together with the economic and social logics in a flexible manner, applying complexity reducing and complexity absorbing strategies as well as temporal adjustments in the use of logics.

AB Motivated by the growing significance of the sharing economy, we discuss the roles the public sector may play within the sharing economy and the corresponding implications for public values. The sharing economy represents a transformative agent for the public sector within the current landscape of digital transformation. While the public sector has so far acted mainly as a regulatory body in the sharing economy, we here discuss implications for other roles the public sector may take on, including the roles of customer, service provider, and platform provider. Framed within the context of the public value ideals (professional, efficiency, service, and engagement), we examine the opportunities and challenges of each role for the four public values. Finally, we identify areas for future research, focusing on the implications of public values for the public sector in the sharing economy.

TI Macroeconomic Factors Influencing the Development of the Sharing Economy
   in the Lithuanian Tourism Sector
SO JOURNAL OF TOURISM AND SERVICES
AB The sharing economy expands and becomes a significant part of tourism, contributing to economic development. The Lithuanian tourism sector is changing from an internal perspective and is influenced by various external macro-environment factors. Currently, as the tourism sector recovers, not only on a national but also international scale, to achieve rapid development of the tourism sector, and assess the importance of one of the biggest catalysts of the tourism sector -the sharing economy, the research aim is to determine the macroeconomic factors that have the influence on the sharing economy in the tourism sector, Lithuania. This research will help policymakers and other stakeholders to create conditions for the sharing economy in the tourism sector for future development and growth in Lithuania. The paper is carried out in the following logical order. First, the literature analysis identifies the macro-environment vectors that significantly impact the development of the sharing economy. The further analysis identifies specific parameters that, according to various literature reviews, influence sharing economy's development in the tourism sector. Further research is aimed at verifying coefficients of influential macroeconomic factors and impact directions by experts. The authors found a positive, most substantial medium-term relationship: between 21-49 years old population growth; increase in monthly income; higher education level of population; the number of households with children; consumer confidence index. The results suggest that the growth of these and other analyzed parameters would have the most influence while encouraging sharing economy's development in the tourism sector. The authors also analyzed other political, economic, sociocultural, technological, environmental, and legal parameters.

AB The sharing economy has extended to all fields during the last decade, indicating a rapid development. However, many sharing economy firms are facing operational difficulties even bankruptcy, leading to more and more attention have been paid on the sustainability of the sharing economy. Scholars have realized that the collaboration of stakeholders is a potential way to promote the sustainable development of sharing economy. The basis and key rest with understanding the influencing factors of the sharing economy and clarifying the relationships between stakeholders and factors. Only in this way we can put forward specific and practical suggestions based on the research results. Existing studies lack such thinking. Therefore, this paper firstly establishes the value net model of the sharing economy to identify the stakeholders and corresponding influencing factors of the sharing economy. Then a two-mode social network method is used to solve the problems of relationship analysis among different types of elements (stakeholders and factors). The results show that individual suppliers, firm suppliers, and sharing economy platforms are the most influential stakeholders in the sharing economy. The security mechanism, economic benefits, and social motivation are the key factors affecting the sustainability of the sharing economy. Core stakeholders should actively lead and coordinate other stakeholders to establish collaborative relationships and formulate sustainable development strategies based on these key factors.

AB Sharing economy platforms like Uber and Airbnb are being subjected to regulations by governing bodies to safeguard the interests of their local communities. While existing research suggests that such regulations are detrimental for the sharing phenomenon, platforms like Uber and Airbnb have continued to grow and thrive. Theorizing on the basis of signaling theory and uncertainty reduction theory we argue that regulations can be beneficial for sharing services. Treating the case of the city of New Orleans that implemented regulations for licensing Airbnb listings in April of 2017 as a natural experiment, we conducted a difference-in-differences analysis at a micro level using balanced panel data sets and a suitable control group. Our findings show regulations had a positive effect and it led to an increase in the performance of the service providers by 23%. Our study provides empirical evidence in support of regulations for the sharing economy.

AB This study aimed to identify and explain different facets of the sharing economy and to differentiate between micro- and macro-mobility services. We also aimed to examine the correlation between the sharing economy and subjective well-being, cultural beliefs, and COVID-19. An exploratory research technique with face-to-face semi-structured interviews was used to collect data from a sample of 22 rideshare app users in a developing country between January and May 2020 and in July 2020. The data were analyzed using the NVivo 12 application. The major findings suggest that, considering their scope and use, sharing economy technology and services can be divided into four major domains: (1) hospitality and dining, (2) retail and consumer goods, (3) media and entertainment, and (4) automotive and transportation. In ridesharing services, the well-being of users is influenced (and suppressed) by eight factors. In addition, socio-cultural beliefs are prevalent in developing markets, and the impact of COVID-19 on the sharing economy is evident. However, the pandemic has promoted the use of micro-mobility services. This study, which contributes to the existing knowledge on the theory of subjective well-being and cultural beliefs, has major theoretical and managerial implications and offers a rich future research agenda.

TI Peer-to-peer electricity trading and the sharing economy: social,
   markets and regulatory perspectives
SO ENERGY SOURCES PART B-ECONOMICS PLANNING AND POLICY
AB Peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity trading is a new data-driven business model currently being trialed within the energy sector. Introducing P2P transactions to an essential service such as energy supply could have far-reaching implications for individuals and the grid. This paper raises considerations and questions from social, market design and regulatory points of view, which should be understood and addressed by societies and policymakers. It does this by considering under what circumstances it is reasonable to conceptualize P2P electricity trading as part of the sharing economy, and drawing parallels to the sharing economy experience in other sectors. In order to reap the full societal benefits, while avoiding considerable risks to infrastructure and individuals, a policy approach promoting dialogue and innovation is necessary. We suggest the regulatory sandbox is the most appropriate tool to achieve this and would help avoid the breakdown of trust between policymakers and platform companies observed in other sectors.

TI Value configurations in sharing economy business models
SO REVIEW OF MANAGERIAL SCIENCE
AB The sharing economy gains momentum and develops a major economic impact on traditional markets and firms. However, only rudimentary theoretical and empirical insights exist on how sharing networks, i.e., focal firms, shared goods providers and customers, create and capture value in their sharing-based business models. We conduct a qualitative study to find key differences in sharing-based business models that are decisive for their value configurations. Our results show that (1) customization versus standardization of shared goods and (2) the centralization versus particularization of property rights over the shared goods are two important dimensions to distinguish value configurations. A second, quantitative study confirms the visibility and relevance of these dimensions to customers. We discuss strategic options for focal firms to design value configurations regarding the two dimensions to optimize value creation and value capture in sharing networks. Firms can use this two-dimensional search grid to explore untapped opportunities in the sharing economy.

AB There is limited systematic research examining whether the face disclosure of a provider can influence the customers' intention to purchase thereby reflecting in the demand for the service provided in a sharing economy platform. If there is a provider's face presented in a profile picture, how the facial expression of emotion can further influence the demand? In this paper, we drew from social presence theory and the trust literature to explore the mechanism through which the face disclosure and facial expressions of a provider influence the demand for service provided by a sharing economy platform. Using data from Airbnb.com, we find that the face disclosure of a host will have a positive influence on the property demand and positive facial expressions of a host will have a positive influence on the property demand at Airbnb. We interpret and discuss the implication of this study for theory and practice.

AB Collectively termed the "Sharing Economy", collaborative platforms are said to be challenging and redesigning traditional business models and ridding the tourism industry of monopolies and resource inefficiencies as they efficiently allocate assets and human resources. This paper explores the global "disruptive" brand Airbnb by utilizing the concept of cultural capitalism to ask questions as to how disruptive and innovative this platform is. We conclude that research about Airbnb and the sharing economy needs to overcome ahistorical, static, and narrow perspectives to integrate critical theories using diverse intellectual approaches to more fully explore platform's that seek enclosure and control so as to allow market capitalism to function more expediently.

TI Mapping the Sharing Economy in China
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Harnessing the rapid development of mobile internet technology, the sharing economy has experienced unprecedented growth in the global economy, especially in China. Likely due to its increasing popularity, more and more businesses have adopted this label in China. There is a concern as to the essential meaning of the sharing economy. As it is difficult to have a universally accepted definition, we aim to map the sharing economy and demystify the use of it in China in this paper. We propose seven organizing essential elements of the sharing economy: access use rights instead of ownership, idle capacity, short term, peer-to-peer, Internet platforms mediated, for monetary profit, and shared value orientation. By satisfying all or only parts of these elements, we propose one typology of sharing economy, and to differentiate bona fide sharing economy from quasi- and pseudo-sharing economy. Finally, there are still many problems that need to be solved urgently in the real sharing economy from the perspective of the government, companies and individuals.

TI The Sharing Economy towards Sustainable Tourism: An Example of an Online
   Transport-sharing Platform
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The sharing economy enables the sustainable development of tourism and at the same time contributes to social well-being and economic growth. It also helps to reduce negative impact on the environment and society, and at the same time reduces costs. The purpose of this study is to find out how the sharing economy can contribute to the development of sustainable tourism. This article is intended to identify the opportunities and benefits of the sharing economy in the tourism sector and to describe the impact of the sharing economy on the travel and tourism sector. To achieve this goal, a systematic scientific analysis of literature and quantitative research methods was applied. Seeking development of sustainable tourism, the authors present a theoretical conceptual model that illustrates the contribution of the sharing economy through benefits and factors influencing sharing economy perspectives in tourism. Empirical research was conducted based on factors influencing sharing economy perspectives in tourism transportation services as one of the sharing economy areas. Analysis of the empirical research results showed that the most important factors influencing the respondents' choices of the ORSC transport sharing platform were price, general approach and comfort.

TI SHARING ECONOMY PLATFORMS IN GEORGIA: DIGITAL TRUST, LOYALTY AND
   SATISFACTION
SO MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT OF INNOVATIONS
AB The presented paper discusses the complex processes and challenges of the modern world, which are directly related to the development of sharing economy business models in digital platforms. It also explains the main features of the concept and describes the peer-to-peer effects globally and in the context of local cases in Georgia. Georgia is a developing country where the digital trust-forming process has started within the last few years. The COVID-19 pandemic has influenced digital business by increasing transactions over the Internet, which creates enormous opportunities for platforms from the sharing economy. The paper focuses on two areas: the problems of involvement in the sharing economy and the obstacles that directly or indirectly hinder the entities participating in the sharing economy. The research concentrates on consumer experiences and the prospects for developing the current model of the economy even more in future. The combination of consumer values is a dilemma that needs exploration to ensure the successful functioning of sharing economy services. Therefore, research outcomes fill the literature gap related to consumer behaviour on the local sharing economy digital platforms. In order to better understand consumer behavioural characteristics, this study examines motivational factors (technical, customer, trust-based) that individualy influence satisfaction and the intention to use a platform in a peer-to-peer (P2P) accommodation again. Based on relevant literature and an online survey of 259 questionnaire respondents, who actively use sharing services localy in Georgia, this study confirms that technical prepositions, consumer values attributes and platform trust-based characteristics are positively associated with customer satisfaction and loyalty. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that satisfaction positively correlates with future intentions mediated simultaneously by the above-mentioned factors. The research findings can be developed in future academic research to study the digital trust-building process and analyse the complex nature of the sharing economy markets.

AB Sharing economy is a relatively new phenomenon that completely changed urban hospitality market. New providers that operate on the micro scale without any state-controlled quality certificates, offering limited service and using just intermediary brand represent a major competition to incumbent players. From scholarly perspective sharing economy growth challenges, many pillars of service and transportation economics and one of them is rationale for its regulation. Based on the extensive literature review this paper evaluates the rationale for regulation of sharing economy and provides a typology of arguments both for and against public regulation of sharing economy. The results suggest that (1) there is no universal solution to sharing economy regulation and (2) decision about the regulation characteristics must be taken in the state of imperfect information.

TI THE USE OF DIGITAL MARKETING STRATEGIES IN THE SHARING ECONOMY: A
   LITERATURE REVIEW
SO JOURNAL OF SPATIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL DYNAMICS
AB In recent years, the emergence of new digital platforms of sharing economy has given rise to considerable changes in consumer behavior. These new ways of consumption in online environment have to be driven by specific digital strategies adapted to sharing economy. This Systematic Literature Review aims to cover an existing gap in the literature and to organize the main digital marketing strategies, techniques, or tactics that can be implemented on these platforms in accordance with the objectives and core values of this business model. First, we outline a framework of the sharing economy, including a discussion of the definition of the concept of SE, objectives, importance, and implications for consumer behavior. Then, a methodology of the literature review is developed based on previous literature on the two key terms-"sharing economy" and "digital marketing"-retrieved from databases such as Web of Science and Scopus. The interpretation and analysis of the results allow for the identification of the main digital marketing strategies and techniques to apply on collaborative platforms. Finally, the conclusion outlines the importance of digital marketing in the online environment, as well as of enhancing the user-generated content and e-wordof-mouth on these platforms.

AB The sharing economy is a term used to describe an IT-fueled, rapidly growing social movement around collaborative consumption. This movement has the potential to significantly affect economic opportunity and broader culture. In this research-in-progress paper, we pose as a key question: how does technology mediation of the sharing economy movement change over time? What explains this change, and what difference does technology mediation make? We draw upon the concepts of technology mediation, and computerization movements, in two comparative industry case studies: car sharing, and room sharing. We outline future research steps, and begin the process of critically examining the role of IT in social movement mediation. Is the sharing economy likely to create positive new economic alternatives? Or is it simply another strategy to intensify the role of global finance in everyday life, and fuel the high rates of growth demanded by venture-backed technology startups?

SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB The development of social economy and Internet information technology has made the development of the sharing economy relatively rapid. This article aims to study how to promote the sharing economy based on neural networks to play a role in new business models. This article proposes that the sharing economy and the new business model are inseparable. It also discusses how to analyze the relationship between the sharing economy and the new business model based on the BP neural network. With the development of the economy and society, new economic development models have developed, and the sharing economy model has risen. The sharing economy model has brought an impact to the traditional economic development model, affecting the business model. The results show that with the development of society and enterprises, the development of the sharing economy is getting faster and faster. Today, some sharing economy companies are bound to face various obstacles in the process of copying other business models and development. Sharing economy enterprises have made various adjustments and responses to various problems, but they have not found a better model to adapt to the modern social market and environment. Therefore, the business model of the sharing economy requires further analysis and investigation.

AB In the era of "sharing economy", college students often play the role of consumers to pay for the knowledge they want, but they have little sense to become providers or creators of knowledge In addition, many students in campus do not have effective ways to obtain excellent experience of their peers. Therefore, this paper is dedicated to studying the feasibility of the implementation of the "knowledge payment" platform in universities, so that students can become the "creator" and "beneficiary" of knowledge at the same time. In the end, both parties of the transaction can get what they need and benefit together.

TI Political economies and environmental futures for the sharing economy
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL
   AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB The sudden rise of the sharing economy has sparked an intense public debate about its definition, its effects and its future regulation. Here, I attempt to provide analytical guidance by defining the sharing economy as the practice that consumers grant each other temporary access to their under-utilized physical assets. Using this definition, the rise of the sharing economy can be understood as occurring at the intersection of three salient economic trends: peer-topeer exchange, access over ownership and circular business models. I shortly discuss some of the environmental impacts of online sharing platforms and then articulate three possible futures of the sharing economy: a capitalist future cumulating in monopolistic super-platforms allowing for seamless services, a state-led future that shifts taxation from labour to capital and redistributes the gains of sharing from winners to losers, and a citizen-led future based on cooperatively owned platforms under democratic control. The nature and size of the social and environmental impacts are expected to differ greatly in each of the three scenarios.

TI No Uber, No Tourists? Public Attitudes toward Municipal Regulation of
   the Sharing Economy
SO LOCAL GOVERNMENT STUDIES
AB The rise of the sharing economy has led to political fights between users of these platforms, local government officials, city residents, and members of the traditional taxi and hotel industries. Municipalities have crafted policies that restrict the operation of sharing economy companies in a variety of ways. However, scholars have not systematically analysed public attitudes regarding these policies. What local-level regulations of the sharing economy, if any, do citizens support? What factors explain citizen support for municipal regulation of the sharing economy? Further, given that these services are popular with travellers, what impact do local sharing economy restrictions have on tourism intentions? In this article, I analyse a series of survey questions from the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) and find that a majority of Americans support some, but not all, sharing economy regulations. Additionally, local restrictions on sharing economy companies are associated with decreased tourism intentions.

TI Sharing economy-based service triads: Towards an integrated framework
   and a research agenda
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Sharing economy has gained momentum in recent years. In this paper, a concept and a synthesised conceptual framework are developed for Sharing Economy-based Service Triad (SEST). Service triads have increasingly become an interesting topic in supply chain management literature. The study adopts a systematic literature review method carrying out content analysis of 100 peer-reviewed journal article focused on triad and sharing economy in order to propose a concept and develop a conceptual development of SEST. Case examples identified from secondary sources are used to illustrate the model. Based on the literature review and case example, the research first coins the term 'Sharing Economy-based Service Triad' (SEST) by differentiating it from traditional manufacturing triads and manufacturing service triads. Then, building on social-capital and balance theories, the study develops a conceptual framework, which proposes two types of strategy for sharing-economy platforms (commitment- and control based platform strategies). These strategies reveal five service-triad structures/archetypes, which lead to different outcomes (e.g., service quality and social capital), which eventually lead to triple bottom line performance and avoid negative externalities. Finally, the study argues that SEST should not only follow economic logic, i.e., economic benefits but also adopt a social and environmental sustainability logic given the negative externalities.

AB In recent years, several scholarly attempts have been made to conceptually outline the contours of the sharing economy. However, there is still limited consensus on fundamental characteristics of sharing models, the markets they create, and the controversies surrounding them. Based on an assessment of existing typologies of the sharing economy, this paper outlines a new theory-driven framework for describing and analyzing business-to-consumer and peer-to-peer sharing models that draws on the nascent literature of partial organization. Emphasizing the core organizational characteristics of sharing models (membership, rules, monitoring, sanctioning, and hierarchy), this new framework moves beyond existing definitions and scales used to map and analyze the fast-growing sharing economy field.

AB With the popularization and application of new generation information and communication technologies, the sharing economy has become an important form of economic and social development. The fundamental reason why the sharing economy can grow so rapidly in a short period of time lies in its unique earning mode. This article, taking Mobike as an example while coupling with the profit- making experience of the sharing economy industry, deeply analyzes its earning mode, unearths multiple driving factors of corporate earnings, and summarizes many earning modes including "periodic lease + deposit" earning, advertising earning, financing expansion earning, listing value-added earning and etc. However, at present, the earning mode of the sharing economy is not yet mature, and there are problems such as weak profitability and lack of long-term profitability. This requires bike-sharing companies developing the concept of "user first" and form a comprehensive earning mode through a multi-channel operation and development approach. At the end, this paper provides reasonable and feasible suggestions for the sustainable profitability of Mobike.

AB The rapid development of the sharing economy has brought positive effects to many people, but it has also led to some negative consequences. Among them, the negative externalities to society caused by disorderly development of the sharing economy are particularly evident. This paper uses the qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) method to study the sources of negative externality in the sharing economy, and puts forward three paths for the negative externality source. It is clear that the costs and benefits of individual behavior, convenience of behavior, and extent of public goods attribute, degree of separation of property rights, and restraint mechanisms contribute to these negative externalities. Findings reveal that negative externalities in the sharing economy come from the joint effect of the sharing degree of the product or service and the constraint mechanism, indicating that the current main modes of the shared economy increase the possibility of negative externalities.

AB The sharing economy is a relatively new trend that occurs practically all over the world. It involves a complete change of organizational and distribution models. The main structure focuses on a distributed network of people and communities. This includes mutual service provision, sharing. This is definitely to use resources more efficiently. In recent years, we have seen a great popularity of systems based on the idea of the sharing economy. Crowdsourcing is a process related to the sharing economy in terms of obtaining information/knowledge. It is a process in which a given organization, a public entity, or a company performs outsourcing of tasks. The inquiry is usually directed to an unidentified, usually very wide group of people in the form of an open call. In the article, the author wonders if the sharing economy is the new economy? What is the impact of the sharing economy on Smart City? Is Crowdsourcing part of the sharing economy or is it the reverse? Will the sharing economy and crowdsourcing be the future of Smart City and what motivates residents to share together? There is a correlation between the development of the idea of the sharing economy and crowdsourcing and the development of Smart City. The article analyzes the relationship between these two trends and their impact on Smart City. The verification is carried out on the example of the city-state of Singapore, which has been occupying leading places in the Smart City rankings in recent years. An interesting aspect discussed in the article is also the exchange of knowledge in Smart City and the cycle of information between residents, decision-makers, and stakeholders and third parties, such as education or business.

TI The politics of sharing: Sociotechnical imaginaries of digital platforms
SO INFORMATION POLITY
AB This paper looks at the role of sociotechnical imaginaries surrounding the governance of the sharing economy in two different locations: Canada and United States. Policy makers are trying to tackle the sharing economy without potentially creating negative impact on innovation. While much of the recent discourse around the sharing economy portrays it negatively, early peer-to-peer digital platforms were envisioned as new pathways toward grassroots, inclusive, fair and low-impact economies (Schor, 2016). However Jasanoff & Kim argue that the evaluation of the positive and negative aspects of technological change have always been influenced by specific tacit or explicit political imaginations of nations in terms of how to power modern social life (Jasanoff & Kim, 2013, p. 190). Using a comparative approach, this paper analyzes these imaginations as they are expressed through policy reports and recommendations. The study shows that the sharing economy appears to be seeking a set of diverse imaginaries including new economic freedom, sustainable consumption, decentralized society, demise of social hierarchies and regulatory freedom.

TI A 2020 perspective on "The limits of trust -free systems: A literature
   review on blockchain technology and trust in the sharing economy"
SO ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
AB Blockchain technology has reached a trough of disillusionment, especially with regard to sharing economy platforms. Following up on our reasoning in the limits of trust-free systems, we provide propositions as to why. In particular, we suggest three common misconceptions on the applicability of blockchain technology to the sharing economy as well as the broader platform economy. First, blockchain technology does not inherently solve all trust issues when it comes to real-world interactions between human beings: the trust-free fallacy. Second, the role and importance of platforms as the broker and curator must not be neglected, but often is: the disintermediation fallacy. Third, unlike tech enthusiasts, main street consumers do not put much weight on the underlying technology: the consumer will fallacy.

TI Sharing economy platforms: creating shared value at a business ecosystem
   level
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB Sharing Economy Platforms (SEPs) are, in general, easily challenged by social ethics and culture, and are vulnerable to social and institutional uncertainties. Drawing from the Creating Shared Value (CSV) concept (Porter and Kramer, 2011), this article investigates whether CSV activities assist SEPs in retaining sustainable innovation at a business ecosystem level. Based on the Polanyian embeddedness framework, we specifically examine how SEPs' CSV co-evolves and aligns with virtue ethics and local culture across three growth stages: Community stage, Scaling-up stage, and Legitimation stage. Data for this research were collected from multiple case studies from two major sectors: the bike-sharing platform sector and the ride-sharing platform sector. Our findings indicate that SEPs should co-create shared values by embedding virtue ethics and local culture into their work with key ecosystem partners in order to preserve sustainable innovation. The research contributes to an evolving understanding of CSV activities in the sharing economy literature on SEPs, as well as proposing some practical implications for industrial practitioners and policymakers.

SO ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH
AB The sharing economy is established as a new economy in the digital era. Many reviews on the sharing economy avail, but none, to date, has shed enough light to illuminate understanding pertaining to the similar and dissimilar characteristics of consumers and producers in the sharing economy. To address this gap, this paper aims to provide a one-stop, state-of-the-art overview of existing research on the sharing economy through the lens of consumers and producers. To do so, this paper conducts a systematic review of 148 articles on the sharing economy identified through the snowballing technique and organized using the antecedents, decisions, and outcomes (ADO) and theories, contexts, and methods (TCM) frameworks. In doing so, this paper unpacks the trust, personal, economic, social, entrepreneurial, environmental, legal, and technological factors that impact on behavioural performance, loyalty, and impact factors among consumers and producers in the sharing economy. Finally, this paper also reveals the theories, contexts, and methods that avail for sharing economy research, as well as the potentially fruitful directions for future research.

TI Consumer Choice Modelling in Sharing Economy
SO REVISTA GEINTEC-GESTAO INOVACAO E TECNOLOGIAS
AB Development of sharing economy creates new challenges and opens unprecedented business opportunities. In this economic environment, industrial enterprises can expand their direct selling strategies with the new business model "product as a service". This option is the result of a shift in consumer preferences among clients of industrial enterprises. The development of the consumer choice model applied to sharing economy is a topical agenda, perhaps now more than ever. Such a model, if available, would help predict multiple scenarios of consumer behaviour and prepare the manufacturing companies for better interaction with their target market. This article makes an attempt to offer a consumer choice model in sharing economy, based on 4 types of possible consumer behaviour. The results of the article serve as a foundation of multi-agent modelling and quantitative assessment of abstract situations in the business-to-consumer market.

TI A social licence for the sharing economy
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB The emergence of community concerns around a range of sharing economy platforms have led to calls for more research into the so-called "dark side" of the sharing economy, including the development and application of analytical frameworks. In this article, we present one such framework based around social licence to operate (SLO), a concept that has been applied most extensively in the mining, forestry and energy sectors. We argue that, despite requiring some adaptations and refinements for application to the sharing economy context, social licence is a relevant and suitable concept for analysing community acceptance of sharing economy platforms and provides an opportunity for mutual learning between different sectors. We present a Sharing Economy SLO Framework and outline a research agenda that includes defining communities of interest and place that are affected by sharing economy practices, analysing the complex relationships between social acceptance and regulatory requirements, identifying and measuring key variables that determine SLO, and developing strategies for building and maintaining SLO for sharing economy practices.

AB In recent ten years, sharing economy has had continuous long-term development throughout the world, and become the latest irresistible commercial economic trend sweeping global economy and society. Its main spirit is to lease currently-unused items to other people in need. In this way, idle assets or devices are used to make money and profit. Meanwhile, sharing economy exerts increasing influence on each industry under the impetus of technological progress such as internet technology, social media, network community, client side and mobile terminal device. Therefore, business managers urgently need to know consumers' sharing-economy-related motivations and demands to seize the opportunity in future commercial trend. In the same way, it can be found in many areas of social and economic services/activities. Especially the sharing economy is the young user favorite talking point in many transportation/travel circles now, such as Didi Chuxing, Uber, sharing cars and homes, and EatWith grows in popularity and reach. However, the sharing economy is still in a newbie state, so a review of the extant literature suggested that relatively little research has been known about it. By exploring the existing and potential users, the purpose of this research is to analyze the effects of impact perceptions on word of mouth, convenience, trust, privacy risk, and intention to participate in sharing economy services. The questionnaire was examined with 118 active users who have participated in car-sharing economy service with Didi Chuxing. And then measured with structural equation modeling (SEM), and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was also applied, using SmartPLS 2.0, to examine if the empirical data conform to the proposed model. Our results provide empirical evidence that Trust, word of mouth, convenience, and privacy risk influence the users' intentions to participate in sharing economy services. All the results of this study with implications for theory and practice would be further discussed, too.

TI Inherently unstable? Scaling, mission drift, and the comparative
   performance of community-based platforms in the sharing economy
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB Digital platforms have enabled sharing among strangers as a means to satisfy economic needs. This development was expected to allow traditional, community-based sharing to be taken to a much larger scale, providing a mechanism to address a variety of societal and environmental concerns. However, this early optimism seems misguided, as commercial sharing economy platforms are increasingly criticized for their negative societal consequences and ambiguous environmental impact. Testing claims made in the literature, we investigate whether this mission drift in community-based platforms can indeed explain this shift towards an increasingly commercial orientation in the sharing economy. Building on a comprehensive geographical mapping, the quantitative analysis of our granular dataset does not support these claims. Rather, we find that communitybased platforms perceive increased scaling potential while avoiding mission drift. By complementing these quantitative findings with an in-depth case study, we explain the underlying mechanisms allowing for this alternative scaling strategy of community-based platforms.

TI Shedding light on sharing ECONOMY and new materialist consumption: An
   empirical approach
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING AND CONSUMER SERVICES
AB In the last decade, the sharing economy has emerged as a business model that improves the use of goods, uses fewer resources than traditional markets, increases social interactions and promotes more responsible and environmentally friendly consumption. This has led various authors to propose that the sharing economy could be a business model that will change consumers' relationship to objects and the materialistic lifestyle. This exploratory research is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to specifically identify a new consumer materialism with the sharing economy. To this end, a survey was conducted among 384 participants in the sharing economy, identifying not only the drivers of the new materialism but also their impact on consumption.
   Our conclusions show that we are currently experiencing a new materialism in which the main elements of traditional materialism-property and the accumulation of goods and the happiness derived from the accumulation of goods and their exhibition as a status symbol-are losing importance. Thus, materialism is evolving from a mere static accumulation of goods towards a hybrid model in which property and the enjoyment of goods coexist with the enjoyment of experiences, which are becoming increasingly more important. Last, participation in the sharing economy drives this new materialism through its contribution to a greater awareness of consumption. In other words, the consumer has a greater consumption awareness.
   This paper proposes theoretical foundations to conceptualize the new materialism and a new materialist consumer profile that represents a break from the traditional conception, provides evidence on the dynamics of the feedback and empowerment of the sharing economy, and finally contributes by shedding light on its impact because the dynamics and impact of the sharing economy are more complex than they initially seem and thus it is necessary to analyse different angles and concepts.

AB Blockchain, as the core technology of cryptocurrency, provides a novel idea for the sharing economy. A user pays the agreed money to the property owner without any trust third party in blockchain, which leads to the leakage of privacy due to openness of the blockchain. To alleviate the privacy concern, a protocol is proposed to not only protect privacy through breaking the link between the user and the property owner but also ensure the fairness among parties joined in transaction. In addition, double-spending and double-usage are detected and prevented by applying smart contract in the protocol. Compared with the existing related works, the proposed protocol is secure, effective and practical.

TI Generation millennials and the sharing economy: a new look at the
   symbolic meaning of consumption
SO REVISTA DE GESTAO E SECRETARIADO-GESEC
AB Increasingly, there is a search for understanding the symbolism of products, consumer habits and choices, and understanding the role of consumption. In this context, the objective of this article is to understand how the symbolism of consumption of young people of the millennial generation takes place from the advent of the sharing economy. The specific objectives are: i) Understanding how young people from the millennial generation understand symbolic consumption; ii) Analyze how the sharing economy is accepted by the young people of the millennial generation; and iii) Ensure new forms of expression of a social status by the millennials, in the context of sharing products, as opposed to owning them. The analyzes show that young people appropriate the products as part of the construction of personal identities, often translating into the ostentation that is carried out today through social networks. As for joining the sharing economy, it is noted that young people, especially those with higher incomes, are supported in this business model, despite having restrictions, especially related to products considered for more personal use.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT
AB Despite Airbnb's popularity as a sharing economy platform, few studies have simultaneously examined its customers' attitudes toward its website and satisfaction with their Airbnb stay. Adopting the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT), this study attempts to examine Airbnb customers' psychological behavior toward the entire Airbnb experience. Researchers conduct a self-administered online survey and obtain 212 valid responses. The results indicate that personal innovativeness is a significant antecedent of perceived ease of use, usefulness, and trust. Customers' attitudes toward the Airbnb website are determined by perceived usefulness and trust, and their satisfaction with the Airbnb stay is affected by amenities and host-guest relationship, leading to loyal customers and repeat business. The findings extend extant literature in sharing economy and provide practical implications for Airbnb website developers and Airbnb hosts to increase customers' intentions to choose Airbnb again as an accommodation option.

AB The self-defined "sharing" platforms increasingly cover important sectors of the economy such as transportation, accommodation and rental, retail, office space and logistics, finance and consumer credit, and the labour market. There has been some debate as to why people participate in the 'sharing economy' and whether these activities generate social capital and generalized trust. Trust and distrust influence the operational of organizations positively and negatively. Regulatory questions affect the welfare of all the stakeholder groups involved. Users/consumers supposedly benefit from cheaper and more convenient choices as a result of more competition but face risks due to the lack of consumer protection and liability rules. Our research question was if managers deal with the economics of trust and distrust and how the idea of sharing economy influences the outputs of companies. The survey was continued by quantitative methods on the basis of questionnaires, comparing Slovakian and Hungarian companies. The results of questionnaires were evaluated by SPSS method. A narrow part of the results will be shown in this paper.

AB In this short paper, we present a set of recommendations derived from a qualitative analysis of the PROMISE framework based on trust in sharing economy systems. Sharing economy has been very successful in the past years, reaching an increasing number of users around worldwide. However, problems with trust among users and sharing economy systems have caused many issues for participants. Thus, the PROMISE framework was proposed to organize and capture the relevant aspects about trust in sharing economy systems. This paper briefly describes an analysis on how these trust aspects are dealt with in two popular sharing economy platforms: Airbnb and Couchsurfing. These results led us to propose a set of recommendations to designers of sharing economy systems who may want to address trust in their design.

   sharing economy
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB The sharing economy can be regarded as a discontinuous innovation that creates increased abundance throughout society. Extant literature on the sharing economy has been predominantly concerned with Uber and Airbnb. As little is known about where the sharing economy is gaining momentum beyond transportation and accommodation, the purpose of this paper is to map in what sectors of the economy it is perceived to gain traction. Drawing on data from social and traditional media in Sweden, we identify a long tail of 17 sectors and 47 subsectors in which a total of 165 unique sharing-economy actors operate, including sectors such as ondemand services, fashion and clothing, and food delivery. Our findings therefore point at the expanding scope of the sharing economy and relatedly, we derive a set of implications for firms.

AB The sharing economy started to evolve significantly as a new trend at the end of last decade. An important impulse for this evolution was the technological development, which made it possible, together with the arrival of Web 2.0, to create platforms of the sharing economy. The sharing economy appears in a lot of variations, with local and worldwide accessibility, and the number of shared items is growing continuously. The focus of this paper is to map the spread of this new trend in the Czech Republic. It aims to identify individual areas of the sharing economy and to show their strengths and weaknesses. The paper includes the outcomes of a research dealing with identification of the areas of the sharing economy in the Czech Republic and with the experience with its use.

AB Nowadays, more and more people choose the possibility of sharing goods and services. This trend is on the one hand utilized by the possibilities given through the digitalization and on the other hand forced by restricted resources and environmental issues. This development already caused significant changes in many markets and businesses but has not yet been holistically established in the field of supply chain management of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This paper aims to evolve a strategy to integrate the main idea of the sharing economy and its platform-based business model into the supply chain management of SMEs. Therefore, the requirements of SMEs among their supply chains are classified and the idea of the sharing economy is implemented and evaluated. This research presents the applicability and contribution of the principals of the Sharing Economy to the sector of supply chain management in SMEs. This will empower SMEs to improve their current market value.

AB Blockchain's properties in addressing trust in highly decentralized environments can make it an enabler for novel sharing economy services. In this paper, we demonstrate the practicality of blockchain-based Secure IoT as a Service ( SIoTaaS), where an IoT device can be rented from a service provider, securely and in a privacy-preserving fashion. Our framework allows the simultaneous operations of distinct providers of IoT-based sharing economy services at a large scale. Multiple parties can securely share text and multimedia in the context of location and point-of-interest sharing, perform financial transactions by hiding true identity of parties involved in various online transactions, perform user and IoT registration, transfer value transactions via Ethereum tokens between providers and consumers, as well as raw IoT data payload. This can turn smart room IoT devices, such as smart locks, light bulbs, air conditioning and fans into rentable business entities within a secure sharing economy platform. We will demonstrate such a proof of concept IoT sharing economy framework, which is specifically designed to support the temporary IoT needs of very large numbers of users, such as Hajj pilgrims concentrating for a short period of time at a single area in Saudi Arabia.

AB The peer-to-peer nature of the sharing economy encourages participants to alter their behavior in ways that resemble traditional notions of emotional labor. A key element in this shift lies in the coercive nature of feedback mechanisms which condition both providers and consumers to perform emotional labor during service encounters. Using survey data from 207 sharing economy consumers in the US, we show how different facets of the feedback mechanisms employed by sharing economy services influence consumers' emotional labor. In addition, we show how platforms and their policies matter in encouraging emotional labor, indicating the need to analyze the topic on a fine-grained level. We conclude by deriving propositions for future research and practical recommendations.

TI The Effect of Preceding Self-Control on Green Consumption Behavior: The
   Moderating Role of Moral Elevation
SO PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCH AND BEHAVIOR MANAGEMENT
AB Background: Studies have shown that individuals restrain their egoistic desires to benefit others (eg, the natural world), which require a higher-order psychological process, such as self-control. Therefore, performing a preceding self-control task may subsequently decrease green consumption behavior. However, whether and how moral elevation, which is an important type of positive incidental emotion, moderates the negative effect of exerting self-control on green consumption behavior remains unknown.
   Purpose: The present study aimed to examine how exerting self-control and moral elevation influenced green consumption behavior.
   Methods: The product choice task that requires participants to make choices between buying environmentally friendly (eco-friendly) and cheaper (self-interest) products is an index of green consumption behavior. In Experiment 1, we adopted the incongruent Stroop task to induce the exertion of self-control, and participants were asked to make choices in the product choice task. In Experiment 2, participants were provided with moral elevating videos to elicit moral elevation during the interval between the Stroop and product choice tasks.
   Results: Experiment 1 indicated that, relative to the congruent Stroop task (the control condition), completing the incongruent Stroop task led to less environmentally friendly choices. Experiment 2 indicated that the participants who watched the elevating video in the incongruent Stroop task condition chose environmentally friendly products with greater frequency compared to those who watched the neutral video. Furthermore, the analyses showed that self-reported moral elevation partly moderated the effect of the exertion of self-control on green consumption behavior.
   Conclusion: Our findings indicate that the exertion of self-control has a negative effect on green consumption behavior; however, moral elevation can counteract this negative effect of exerting self-control on green consumption behavior.

SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB Stakeholder theory has called for more research on competing interests. This research contributes by investigating investor preferences that affect the competing positions of incumbents and sharing-economy firms. The sharing economy promises wider distribution of benefits across stakeholders, which may influence investor attractiveness. So this research asks when sharing-economy firms are competitive for investor support in comparison with incumbents. Value creation and value capture are employed to develop hypotheses predicting investor interests. Using data from a matched sample of 334 firms, we find evidence of conditional investor preference for non-sharing firms, and conclude implications for the sharing economy and sustainable development.

AB Drawing upon key insights from the resource orchestration framework as a dynamic perspective on the resource-based view (RBV), we investigated the value creation dynamics found in sharing economy platform firms. By performing multiple-case analyses on platform firms operating in the sharing economy in China, we identified three main mechanisms by which sharing economy platform firms orchestrate their external resources (i.e., crowds of suppliers and consumers) to create value and gain a competitive advantage-constructing on-demand resource adaptation, building big-data-driven network effects, and enabling ecosystem resource coordination. We contribute to the emerging literature on the sharing economy while extending the RBV to the digital platform context, in which the value creation process is significantly shifted to beyond the boundaries of the firm.

TI The sharing economy: A pathway to sustainability or a nightmarish form
   of neoliberal capitalism?
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB The sharing economy seemingly encompasses, online peer-to-peer economic activities as diverse as rental (Airbnb), for-profit service provision (Uber), and gifting (Freecycle). The Silicon Valley success stories of Airbnb and Uber have catalysed a vibrant sharing economy discourse, participated in by the media, incumbent industries, entrepreneurs and grassroots activists. Within this discourse the sharing economy is framed in contradictory ways; ranging from a potential pathway to sustainability, to a nightmarish form of neoliberalism. However, these framings share a common vision of the sharing economy (a niche of innovation) decentralising and disrupting established socio-technical and economic structures (regimes). Here I present an analysis of the online sharing economy discourse; identifying that the sharing economy is framed as: (1) an economic opportunity; (2) a more sustainable form of consumption; (3) a pathway to a decentralised, equitable and sustainable economy; (4) creating unregulated marketplaces; (5) reinforcing the neoliberal paradigm; and, (6) an incoherent field of innovation. Although a critique of hyper-consumption was central to emergence of the sharing economy niche (2), it has been successfully reframed by regime actors as purely an economic opportunity (1). If the sharing economy follows this pathway of corporate co-option it appears unlikely to drive a transition to sustainability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Examining the Impact of Marketing Motives and Concerns on User
   Satisfaction and Re-Purchase Intentions in a Sharing Economy
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In a fast-growing global economy, there is much debate in the socio-economic models about the sharing economy, which is a digital platform that benefits society and improves people's quality of life. A significant benchmark of the sharing economy is that it enables individuals to monetize their assets that need to be used fully. This highlights an individual's ability and perhaps their preference to either rent or borrow goods rather than own them. This study investigated Saudi Arabian students' User Satisfaction (US) and their Re-Purchase Intentions (RPI) in the context of the sharing economy. We employed a deductive approach that utilized cross-sectional data collected through online sampling. The results were derived from 324 acceptable completed questionnaires. We used a Structural Equation Model (SEM) to confirm the positive and significant predictive power of Trust, Economic Benefits (EBs), Sharing Economy Philosophy (SEP), Service Quality and Net Benefits (NBs) on US and RPI. The results also demonstrated a positive and significant effect of concerns such as Lack of Trust (LoT) and Expected Effort (EE) on US. Finally, among Saudi Arabian students, US is a positive and significant predictor of RPI. In the context of a developing country such as Saudi Arabia, this study's insights to the practical and theoretical spheres contribute to operational management and the literature about online digital learning.

TI Differences, Constraints and Key Elements of Providing Local Sharing
   Economy Services in Different-Sized Cities: A Hungarian Case
SO RESOURCES-BASEL
AB The business models of sharing economy services can differ from each other in different-sized cities. This paper provides a deeper understanding of the implementation of locally operating services for car, bicycle and office sharing in the urban environment. Our goal is to reveal the differences between the capital city and an economically well-developed city in order to provide beneficial findings to the development of the presently operating services, or to the possible implementation of future services. Methodology of the paper applies the Business Model Canvas approach (BMC). We introduce a comparative analysis using data from the Hungarian database, which records details of all the publicly visible sharing economy services countrywide. The results show that BMC can reflect the main differences, constraints and key elements in the business models of sharing economy services. We can say that, in the case of a bike sharing service operated in the non-capital city, there is more segmentation than seen in the same service in the capital. There are significant price differences, especially in the case of long-term tickets. The number of inhabitants and private capital remain the biggest constraints in the case of car-sharing services, but there is also a possibility of implementation in the non-capital cities by applying small-scale services with a good value proposition and segmentation.

TI Sharing economy research in hospitality and tourism: a critical review
   using bibliometric analysis, content analysis and a quantitative
   systematic literature review
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose
   This study aims to conduct a critical review of the research on the sharing economy to identify its key intellectual foundations and their evolution and offers thematic and methodological recommendations for future research to advance the domain.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A tri-method approach using bibliometric (co-citation) analysis, thematic content analysis and a quantitative systematic literature review was conducted on sharing economy research in hospitality and tourism journals, up to and including May 2020.
   Findings
   The findings from the three methods were coherent and provide a clear picture of the fact that while research on the sharing economy in hospitality and tourism has achieved significant depth, the breadth of the understanding of this area remains somewhat limited. Each of the three periods of research on the sharing economy identified in the study were marked by a focus on specific thematic areas, with largely Western-situated researchers demonstrating limited theoretical engagement and using a limited range of methods and perspectives (disciplinary, stakeholders and sectors) to examine these themes.
   Research limitations/implications
   Recommendations for future thematic research opportunities are provided using a multi-level perspective. The present review does not include research that incorporates the impacts of COVID-19, which has significantly disrupted the hospitality and tourism industry and is the focus of current research in the field. However, the review represents the largest and most comprehensive assessment of the state of research on the sharing economy prior to COVID-19, and, as such, can serve as a valuable baseline for future reviews of sharing economy research during and after the pandemic.
   Originality/value
   In contrast with previous literature reviews, the present review is comprehensive in its scope, methodology and temporal coverage of sharing economy research.

TI Can sharing economy mode advance the transition of China's energy sector
   effectively: A case of PV technology transition?
SO ENERGY REPORTS
AB Driven by the development of global Energy Internet and the requirement of energy transition, the sharing economy mode in energy sector has turned into a novel inspiration. This paper aims to explore whether the sharing economy model advance China's energy transition effectively. We describe the system of Energy with Uber-like mode, and introduce the Uber-like Mode into the PV power sector. By using the Analytic Network Process method, a set of comprehensive benefit evaluation system for the Uber-like mode plus renewables project is put forward from aspects of the technical and economic benefit, the social and environmental benefit, the energy benefit and the safety (reliability) benefit. The Uber-like mode plus PV project, as one specific application, is chosen as a case study to verify the effectiveness of the evaluation model. Based on the evaluation results, SWOT is adopted to discuss the internal conditions and the external environment for Renewables Sharing Economy in China. Finally, this article puts forward a series of suggestions to realize the goal of the proper adjustment of energy structure with respect to the renewables' sharing economy mode. (C) 2021 The Authors.

AB The continuous development of the sharing economy calls for the attention of the design community. Practical knowledge of where, how and what roles designers could play, in developing the phenomenon out of its infancy into a full-grown alternative way of consuming and living with social and ecological benefits, remains absent. This article reports upon an exploration to match product-service system design with the sharing economy. A literature study was needed toward understanding the sharing economy from a designer's point of view. A link was formed by focusing on different kinds of stakeholders. The result is a framework of five operable levels concerning PSS. One level concerns the product-service characteristics (0), while the other four concern levels of stakeholders mapped according to their involvement with the product-service. These four levels are the users (1), the ecosystem (2), the organization (3) and society (4). The framework results in an overview of workable parameters and leverage points: an attempt to support designers in understanding and designing PSS in a sharing economy context. (C) 2018 The Authors.

TI Established Companies' Strategic Responses to Sharing Economy Threats
SO MIS QUARTERLY EXECUTIVE
AB Many industries are being disrupted by the sharing economy, with online platforms connecting and facilitating transactions between owners of underused assets and users who pay to use those assets for a limited duration. This sharing platform model threatens the way established firms do business, and they need to devise strategic responses to the threats. From an analysis of the responses to the sharing economy by established firms in two industries, we identify the strategies incumbent firms can consider when reacting to the threats.(1)

TI Four Models of Sharing Economy Platforms
SO MIS QUARTERLY EXECUTIVE
AB Sharing economy platforms combine organizational and market mechanisms in innovative ways to gain competitive advantages over incumbents. These mechanisms are combined on two key dimensions: tight or loose control over participants, and high or low rivalry between participants. We call the resulting four sharing economy models "Franchiser," "Principal," "Chaperone" and "Gardener." Each model focuses on a different value proposition and strategic intent, but they all exploit the growing fluidity of organizational boundaries. Understanding the sharing economy in these terms enables businesses to identify, and respond to, the threats and opportunities provided by sharing economy platforms. The lessons learned from our research will help businesses to engage with the sharing economy.(1,2)

AB The purpose of this study is to empirically investigate what factors that affect consumers' adoption intention of sharing economy in the tourism industry from the perspective of social learning theory. By presenting the concept of consumers' self-efficacy of sharing economy, a model has been developed that explores the effects that explain the consumers' self-efficacy of sharing economy and their adoption intentions. For this, this study surveys 332 Korean consumers using Airbnb and analyzes the data using AMOS 24. In the results, First, learning from forums and communities, learning from ratings and reviews, and learning from social recommendations increase their self-efficacy of sharing economy. Second, consumers' self-efficacy of sharing economy increases their adoption intention. Finally, learning from forums and communities and learning from social recommendations among the antecedents of consumer's self-efficacy of sharing economy increase their adoption intention through their self-efficacy of sharing economy.

TI Happy Hosts? Hedonic and Eudaimonic Wellbeing in the Sharing Economy
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB Sharing economy platforms mediate exchanges between service providers and consumers. The experiences of service providers in the sharing economy have been extensively studied. Nevertheless, our knowledge in regard to the extent to which providers' participation influences their wellbeing remains incomplete. This study focuses on the peer-to-peer accommodation platform Airbnb and explores why and how different aspects involved in hosting can contribute to or hinder hosts' hedonic and eudaimonic wellbeing. To that end, I conducted a netnography and depth interviews with Airbnb hosts. Based on a qualitative analysis of the overall dataset, I identify three sources of positive affect associated with hosting, namely, the sociability involved in the host-guest interaction, the act of providing hospitality, and positive feedback from guests. However, I also identify four conditions, which can turn hosting into a source of negative affect, namely, customer misbehavior, high volumes of guests, negative reviews, and income dependency. In addition, I elaborate on the relationship between hosting and life satisfaction in regard to the income that hosts generate through hosting and the working conditions of Airbnb hosts. Last but not least, I show that being a provider on Airbnb can contribute to (and in some cases hinder) eudaimonic wellbeing, focusing on four dimensions of eudaimonia, namely, self-realization, personal growth, a sense of purpose and meaning, and relationships. Theoretical and managerial implications for service providers and sharing economy platforms are discussed.

TI Sharing economy: A review and agenda for future research
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT
AB This paper provides an objective, systematic and holistic review of the sharing economy (SE) academic literature to uncover the theoretical foundations and key themes underlying the field by using co-citation analysis and content analysis. Sixty-six publications on sharing economy with ten papers related to tourism and hospitality from 2010 to 2015 (inclusive) have been identified. This paper revealed three broad, areas of foci with sharing economy research in general: (1) SE's business models and its impacts, (2) nature of SE, and (3) SE's sustainability development as well as two areas of foci in tourism and hospitality specifically: (1) SE's impacts on destinations and tourism services (2) SE's impacts on tourists. The sharing economy has a strong intellectual tradition from lifestyle and social movement field, consumption practice and sharing paradigm. This paper presents a more robust framework and holistic understanding of the sharing economy field and calls for a new theory-informed research agenda on sharing economy to coalesce multi-level perspectives.

TI Fostering sustainability through technology-mediated interactions
   Conviviality and reciprocity in the sharing economy
SO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & PEOPLE
AB Purpose This article addresses the lack of scholarly attention paid to the sharing economy from a sociological perspective, with respect to the technology-mediated interactions between sharing economy users. The paper provides a critical overview of the sharing economy and its impact on business and communities and explores how information technology can facilitate authentic, genuine sharing through exercising and enabling conviviality and non-direct reciprocity. Design/methodology/approach The paper begins with a critique of the technology-mediated sharing economy, introduces the concept of conviviality as a tool to grow and shape community and sustainability within the sharing economy and then explores reciprocity and sharing behaviour. Finally, the paper draws upon social exchange theory to illustrate conviviality and reciprocity, using four case studies of technology-enabled sharing. Findings The paper contributes to the emerging debate around how the sharing economy, driven by information systems and technology, affects social cohesion and personal relationships. The paper elucidates the central role conviviality and reciprocity play in explaining the paradoxes, tensions and impact of the sharing economy on society. Conviviality and reciprocity are positioned as key capabilities of a more sustainable version of the sharing economy, enabled via information technology. Originality/value The findings reveal that information technology-mediated sharing enterprises should promote conviviality and reciprocity in order to deliver more positive environmental, economic and social benefits. The diversity of existing operations indicated by the findings and the controversies discussed will guide the critical study of the social potential of sharing economy to avoid treating all sharing alike.

TI The impact of incumbents' operational and governance responses on the
   sharing economy: An asset orchestration perspective
SO JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT
AB Leveraging an asset-sharing operating model, sharing economy platforms have disrupted incumbent firms in many industries. This research draws on the asset orchestration perspective to examine incumbents' asset orchestration (i.e., operational and governance actions) as they respond to threats from the sharing economy and the effectiveness of these actions in curbing a sharing economy firm's performance. We also analyze how the sharing economy firm's competitive moves counteract incumbents' asset orchestration responses. Our longitudinal empirical analysis in the accommodation industry demonstrates that the growth of sharing economy increases incumbent hotels' asset-based operational actions, which reduce the sharing economy's performance. Although incumbents' asset governance actions increase as the local sharing economy grows, they do not seem to hinder sharing economy's performance. This research highlights the role of asset orchestration in the competition between incumbents and the sharing economy and contributes to the operations and sharing economy literature.

AB The adoption of the sharing economy by organizations is of central importance to energy efficiency. However, previous studies ignore the role of user adoption of the sharing economy. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the role of energy efficiency through user adoption of the sharing economy to promote environmental sustainability. This objective is achieved using a quantitative research method. Data collection is managed using a survey questionnaire. Area cluster sampling is used for the data collection because this sampling technique is suitable for dealing with a widespread population. The sample size of the study is 178. Scale items taken from previous studies are used to measure the relationships between herd behaviour, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, trust, behavioural intention, and environmental sustainability. The results show that energy efficiency through user adoption of the sharing economy is of key importance in the behavioural intention of users. User adoption of the sharing economy has the potential to promote environmental sustainability. The results provide valuable insights for practitioners designing strategies for energy efficiency and the sharing economy. & COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB We follow recent research (e.g. Mair and Reischauer, 2017) showing that the global sharing economy has activated economic and socially significant underlying forces, altering current markets. Using the data from BLS, ChunkofChange, Edison Research, Marketplace, National Technology Readiness, The Office for National Statistics (UK), and Statista, we performed analyses and made estimates regarding annual on-demand economy spending (billions), the proportion of the gig economy, and the share of generational groups who think that the gig economy is good thing for everyone in the U.S. Empirical and secondary data are employed to support the claim that sharing economy entities operate a digital platform that enables workers to share resources. Culture shapes the option of organizational configurations and gives a reason for the heterogeneity of sharing economy entities. The sharing economy is a network of markets in which workers utilize diverse types of compensation to carry out the reallocation of and access to resources, facilitated by a digital platform administered by a company. A sharing economy entity supplies the infrastructure that people employ to distribute resources. The underlying forces of the sharing economy entail processes of market transformation, may encompass mechanisms of market emergence, and may comprise deliberate and unexpected effects of organizations' behavior. Sharing economy entities adhere to rule-like instructions ascendant in their cultural setting, resemble widespread requirements in their economic systems, and use manifold routines to assimilate digital platform users.

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Looking at the contradiction between the prevalence of self-quantification and unclear applicable boundaries, the objective of this study is to examine the internal mechanism of how self-quantification influences consumers' participation and behavioral decision-making in green consumption activities. Based on the goal setting theory, a series of research hypotheses were proposed. Four experiments were designed and performed in different situations with different subjects. Through the analysis of variance and bootstrap testing, the experimental data were analyzed and processed. The results show that, under specific goals, consumers with low self-quantification participate more in promotional activities and less in defensive activities. In promotional green consumption activities, self-quantification enables consumers with (without) goal requirements to reduce (enhance) their participation performance, and choose high-intensity promotional activity categories less (more) with better (worse) participation experience. In defensive green consumption activities, self-quantification enables consumers with (without) goal limitations to enhance (reduce) participation performance and choose high-intensity defensive categories more (less) with better (worse) participation experience. The conclusions can provide enlightenment for enterprises to guide consumers to participate in green consumption activities.

AB Sharing is an act that has accompanied us since the dawn of humanity, however, with the technological explosion and its constant evolution, new terms based on sharing have appeared, namely the Sharing Economy. However, the literature shows us that this term is mostly used in the wrong way, being generalized for each and every act of sharing. With its growing notoriety, the Sharing Economy has been largely exploited by the scientific community, especially regarding the reasons that lead individuals to share. However, there is a lack of research that differentiates all terms associated with the Sharing Economy, whether they are Collaborative Consumption, Access-Based Consumption, among others. The present essay aims to make this differentiation, thus contributing to the correct use of terms and avoiding the generalization of the Sharing Economy for all acts. For this, a literature review was carried out in which the various terms used as Sharing Economy were compared between the various authors, as well as between companies that practice or contribute to the sharing of goods and services.

AB The sharing economy is transforming economies around the world, entering markets for lodging, ride hailing, home services, and other sectors that previously lacked robust person-to-person alternatives. Its expansion has been contentious and its meanings polysemic. It launched with a utopian discourse promising economic, social, and environmental benefits, which critics have questioned. In this review, we discuss its origins and intellectual foundations, internal tensions, and appeal for users. We then turn to impacts, focusing on efforts to generate user trust through digital means, tendency to reconfigure and exacerbate class and racial inequalities, and failure to reduce carbon footprints. Though the transformative potential of the sharing economy has been limited by commercialization and more recently by the pandemic, its kernel insight-that digital technology can support logics of reciprocity-retains its relevance even now.

TI Measuring value created by business models in the sharing economy
SO UPRAVLENETS-THE MANAGER
AB The sharing economy forms a modern sustainable trend, combining the economic and social-ethical benefits of using, rather than owning. The article studies such factors as social approval, economic choice and digital coordination influencing the effectiveness of business models of the sharing economy, but the full value of which has not yet been established. The methodological basis of the research includes neoclassical and neoinstitutional economic theories and the concept of economic collaboration. Among the research methods applied are a value-based approach to discussing the substance of collaborative consumption business models, a critical analysis of the peculiarities of the economic choice between saving and consumption, and a qualitative analysis of demand on the basis of a socially confirmed interest in collaborative consumption. The research develops five types of models for creating and redistributing income in the sharing economy and finds that the key advantage of the sharing economy is the confirmed demand of a new class of consumers, which reduces the probability of marketing mistakes. The authors state that any form of collaborative consumption for ensuring transparency of transactions and correctness of taxation should be regarded as a service. We design an alternative model for assessing the lower bound of the value created, which takes into account the frequency of consumers' repeated requests to previously provided services, assuming that social approval shifts the line of choice and does not create a new value. The theoretical and practical significance of the research lies in the contribution to the value measurement of shared consumption based on consumer signals in the form of public approval (social initiative or testing) and profitability evaluation (lower bound) of the shared use by the consumer.

AB Peer-to-peer sharing economy platforms potentially have big effects on values in society. Policymakers need to develop governance arrangements to benefit from the positive effects, while simultaneously mitigate the negative effects. This requires having a structured overview of the effects of these platforms on the diversity of values that are involved. Currently no theoretical overview of these effects on values is available. The objective of this article is to structure the research into the effects of sharing economy platforms. We use a theoretical mapping that was developed by using a Grounded Theory approach. By positioning the literature onto the map, we derived an overview of the extend in which each effected value has been studied so far. Based on this mapping, we propose five research themes into specific effects of peer-to-peer sharing economy platforms: social values, consumer and societal risks, working conditions and labor market dynamics, environmental sustainability and innovation.

TI Prospects and challenges of sharing economy for the public sector
SO GOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY
AB The sharing economy entails peer-to-peer exchanges for renting goods and services utilizing the Internet. In this paper, we critically examine the sharing economy's prospects and challenges for public sector, and explore the policy responses to the sharing economy. The sharing economy is innovative in capitalizing on underutilized assets using Internet platforms, but has adverse impacts as well (e.g. it could exacerbate inequality). As users, public agencies could adapt internal procurement processes focused on renting, and partner with sharing platforms to complement and supplement public services. As regulators, government agencies have a paradoxical role to maintain the sharing economy's innovation while addressing its downsides. Our study shows mixed policy reactions to sharing economy in three prominent sectors (mobility services, accommodation sharing, and gig labor). We suggest a research agenda that e-government scholars should focus on in order to critically examine the different facets of the emerging sharing economy.

TI Unraveling sustainable behaviors in the sharing economy: An empirical
   study of bicycle-sharing in China
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Sustainable behaviors in the sharing economy have attracted attentions from both researchers and practitioners. Prior literature has mostly focused on sustainable development in the traditional economy and treated sustainability as an influential factor of participation in the sharing economy. Based on the self-determination theory and the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) framework, this paper explores the formation mechanisms of sustainable behaviors in the bicycle-sharing economy. An online survey was conducted in China and data were collected from 387 shared-bicycle users. Structural equation modeling was employed to examine the research model and research hypotheses. The study presents three critical findings. First, environmental stimulation (including government laws, enterprise regulations, and social ethics) have a significant and positive impact on user's sense of self-determination (including perceived autonomy, perceived competence, and perceived relatedness). Second, both perceived competence and perceived relatedness can help promote user sustainable behaviors. Third, this study also supports that both perceived competence and perceived relatedness have a mediating effect on the relationship between environmental stimuli and sustainable behaviors of shared-bicycle users. The paper offers insights to both government and firms supporting bicycle-sharing on how to effectively elicit user sustainable behaviors in the bicycle-sharing economy.

SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Agri-food systems are in constant movement, constituted by practices that are shared by actors; however, in a context where new practices are established by the sharing economy, it is necessary to understand them. Thus, this article identifies and describes the sharing economy practices adopted by agrifood rural settlements. Using as basis a systematic review and a multiple case study, the literature revealed 11 practices although the multiple case studies just did not find the practice of housing sharing in the settlements; on the other hand, uncover a new practice, labor sharing, that was not yet mentioned in the literature. This study reveals that the sharing economy practices in agri-food production are strongly linked by the integration of resources and this reality generates the interdependence and interdefinition of the actors in rural settlements.

   analysis from the perspective of trust theory"
SO ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
AB Knowledge sharing economy has been revolutionizing the way people obtain knowledge. As the foundation of sustainable development of sharing economy, factors influencing trust are worth studying, especially in paid Q& A since users (buyer) barely have no information about the knowledge commodity (answer) except for the price. From the perspective of knowledge contributor, the previous article has examined the role of knowledge contributor characteristics and reputation on trust and user pay decisions in paid Q&A, and we have highlighted the importance of trust in knowledge sharing economy. Now, with massive data in sharing economy platforms, researchers have the opportunity to take advantage of advanced methods like text analysis, sentiment analysis, computer vision and deep learning to uncover the effect of self-reported information, facial features, and social influence on trust. Moreover, in combination with neuroscience, researchers can reveal the mechanism of how trust-related factors affect payment decisions more objectively and accurately.

TI First-mover firms in the transition towards the sharing economy in
   metallic natural resource-intensive industries: Implications for the
   circular economy and emerging industry 4.0 technologies
SO RESOURCES POLICY
AB The dilemma between consumption and preservation of natural resources has been repeatedly highlighted in recent literature, and is still an open discussion. The emerging concept of the circular economy brings new opportunities and business models for firms, such as the sharing economy. These new concepts are capable of promoting sustainable practices which aim to optimize and ameliorate basic resource consumption, especially in industries which are intensive in metallic natural resources. However, this topic remains relatively unexplored, especially considering genuine case studies in countries with emerging economies. There have been calls for more qualitative research in operations management to investigate real-world cases of companies transitioning from linear manufacturing towards the sharing economy. Addressing these contemporary knowledge gaps, this work unveils drivers, challenges, and opportunities for the sharing economy based on original evidence gathered from exemplary, "first-mover" cases in the Brazilian manufacturing industry which use metallic natural resources. The main contributions of this study can be summarized thus: (i) there is no homogeneity in companies' understanding of the sharing economy's potential as a win-win approach; (ii) transitioning towards the sharing economy relies on radically changing the way firms develop and upgrade their portfolio of products; (iii) transitioning towards the sharing economy is more complex - due to its challenges, drivers, and barriers - than has been reported by the literature; (iv) more advanced companies in terms of sharing economy operations management practices have mastered the capability of combining key principles of the circular economy and key elements of the sharing economy, creating an important synergy between the circular economy and the sharing economy; (v) emerging industry 4.0-related technologies seem to play a vital role in unlocking the sharing economy, as applied to product development. This work offers novel implications for both the theory and practice of operations management for the sharing economy.

SO REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE INOVACAO
AB The Sharing Economy represents a new form of consumption whose dissemination is explained by the growing ubiquity of digital platforms and applications. This article has three objectives: 1) to build an indicator capable of measuring countries' entry into the sharing economy; 2) to characterize the entry of countries in this new consumption model and 3) identify the factors that influence its spread. Descriptive data analysis and six ordinary least squares regressions are used to identify the factors that explain the expansion of the sharing economy, measured by building a Sharing Economy Index, based on 14.9 billion traffic data on the websites and specialized sharing apps for 175 countries. Descriptive statistics show that the sharing economy is spreading mainly among the countries with the highest income. Estimated regressions indicate that internet access, property rights and the presence of an over-regulated environment are the main factors that contribute to the access to this new consumption pattern.

TI The Impact of Trust on Public Participation in Sharing Economies
SO CHINA-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB From a survey of public participation in a sharing economy, the authors extracted from the factor analysis on a questionnaire three factors: particularised trust, generalised trust and institutional trust. The authors also classified three categories of sharing economy and utilised a structural equation model to study the impact of trust on public participation in the different types. The general observation made is that trust helps to increase public desire to participate in a sharing economy. Compared with participants in a narrow sharing economy, particularised trust and generalised trust increased the public desire to participate in a generalised sharing economy. In contrast to participating in the low trust-based demand-side (LTBD) sharing economy, particularised trust and generalised trust promote greater public participation in the high trust-based demand-side (HTBD) sharing economy. It is also noteworthy that institutional trust has a positive impact on a low trust-based demand-side sharing economy. Based on the findings, two policy recommendations are offered.

AB Blockchain is a distributed system with efficient transaction recording and has been widely adopted in sharing economy. Although many existing privacy-preserving methods on the blockchain have been proposed, finding a trade-off between keeping speed and preserving privacy of transactions remain challenging. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Fast and Privacy-preserving method based on the Permissioned Blockchain (FPPB) for fair transactions in sharing economy. Without breaking the verifying protocol and bringing additional off-blockchain interactive communication, FPPB protects the privacy and fairness of transactions. Additionally, experiments are implemented in EthereumJ (a Java implementation of the Ethereum protocol) to measure the performance of FPPB. Compared with normal transactions without cryptographic primitives, FPPB only slows down transactions slightly.

SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB The transition of the energy sector towards more decentral, renewable and digital structures and a higher involvement of local residents as prosumers calls for innovative business models. In this paper, we investigate a sharing economy model that enables a residential community to share solar generation and storage capacity. We simulate 520 sharing communities of five households each with differing load profile configurations and find that they achieve average annual savings of 615e as compared to individual operation. Using the gathered data on electricity consumption in a sharing community, we discuss a fixed pricing approach to achieve a fair distribution of the profits generated through the sharing economy. We further investigate the impact of prosumers' and consumers' load profile patterns on the profitability of the sharing communities. Based on these findings, we explore the potential to match and coordinate suitable communities through a platform based sharing economy model. Our results enable practitioners to find optimal additions to an energy sharing community and provide new insights for researchers regarding possible pricing schemes in energy communities.

TI Trust, Transparency and Security in the Sharing Economy: What is the
   Government's Role?
SO TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB To obtain access to goods or services between people or stakeholders, some collaboration between actors is a necessary component. Sharing and a sharing economy is closely related to trust. Within the context of "the" sharing economy, especially digital trust is assumed to play a crucial role. Access to information is a crucial digital cue which can lead to trust yet, sharing economies are subject to asymmetry of information, wherein certain actors have limited access to market information on the consumption behaviour of users, the pricing of a product and, the reliability of peers. The lack of confidential market information between actors is thus limiting the potential for collaboration, as it reduces trust between them. Governments are amongst the (usually more trustworthy) candidates to undertake critical roles in enhancing the sharing of sensitive data. This paper aims to identify the role of government in facilitating and enabling data sharing between various actors in sharing economies. In this paper, we analyse the adequacy of a government's potential role in enabling transparency, trust and security, while operating within a sharing economy scenario, based on two case studies. Additionally, the role of technology is briefly defined for digital platforms and for blockchain-based opportunities for sharing economies. The use cases for the paper concern a digital platform for industrial symbioses, and peer-to-peer electricity trading based on blockchain technology.

This paper takes its motivation from the increased variety of sharing economy business models to develop a typology of sharing economy business model transformations. It does so through creating a timeline of the sharing economy development, capturing business model configurations as activity systems along that development, and tracing mechanisms affecting sharing economy business model transformations. The paper thereby interlinks the sharing economy development on the phenomenon level with transformations of its business models. The paper contributes to past research by presenting a systematic account of the development of the sharing economy and its resulting business model configurations and by developing a typology focusing on the types of changes that have transformed the sharing economy business models and resulted in the plethora of business models.

TI Building trust in sharing economy platforms: trust antecedents and their
   configurations
SO INTERNET RESEARCH
AB Purpose - The sharing economy is the internet-enabled business model that has changed the way people travel, work and interact. Similar to other internet-enabled settings, trust is of paramount importance for the sharing economy as it leads to continued use and positive word-of-mouth. The main objectives of this research are twofold: (1) to identify the most relevant antecedents of trust in the sharing economy; and (2) to identify which combination of these antecedents allows repurchase intention and positive word-of-mouth to be achieved.
   Design/methodology/approach - Through revision of trust theories and complementary frameworks, and an analysis of the sharing economy, the authors develop a model of trust for the sharing economy. The authors propose a model assuming that different types of trust will form a limited number of pathways valid for the creation of positive behavioural intentions. The authors use qualitative comparative analysis to empirically assess the proposed model on a sample of 235 sharing economy users.
   Findings - The authors find two configurations that jointly suggest the key role of website quality and usability in generating consumer trust. The authors propose that, on the one hand, platforms might focus on creating value-added services and increasing the reliability of the platform brand. On the other hand, platforms can focus on creating good signalling mechanisms and educate their service providers towards reliable behaviour.
   Originality/value - The authors build a conceptual model of trust in the sharing economy setting, that considers the feedback loops among the combination of several dimensions. The authors define specific strategies for platforms in the sharing economy that lead to repurchase intention and positive word-of-mouth.

TI The New Sharing Economy: Creation of a New Serfdom?
SO PERSPECTIVES ON GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Hailed as the embodiment of a non-capitalist and more ethical economic system, the new sharing economy appears to be far from the ideal economic dispensation and revolution it is supposed to usher in. It rather seems to be the beginning of a ruthless capitalist system of global transfer of capital and power from workers to rich investors. Applying the most recent literature and original research, this article delves into the underlying tenets of the sharing economy as a system, and highlights its shortcomings and ramifications that are leading to the creation of modern serfs and dangerous capitalist behemoths and ideologies.

TI Promises and paradoxes of the sharing economy: An organizing framework
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB In this article, we take stock of the ambivalent and contested nature of the sharing economy. Considering the 'sharing economy' as an umbrella construct and an essentially contested concept, we position the sharing economy as resting on three foundational cores: (1) Access economy, (2) Platform economy, and (3) Community based economy. We show how each core holds distinct promises and paradoxes. This organizing framework shows how combining the cores can help sharing-economy initiatives to navigate certain tensions, but can also lead to new ones. We highlight the paradoxical nature of the sharing economy and make a case for balanced initiatives that combine the promises of each core while mitigating contradictions. We conclude by introducing the nine articles of the special issue, connecting their contributions to our organizing framework.

SO EKONOMIA I SRODOWISKO-ECONOMICS AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Although the recent rise of sharing economy platforms revolutionized hospitality market around the world, its impact is unevenly distributed, as a majority of new P2P accommodation providers emerged in urban areas. The aim of this study is to provide sharing economy development paths in areas surrounding all 23 national parks in Poland. This study is conducted basing on data from online observation of 2 sharing economy platforms development with data gathered from official census. Results show that (1) sharing economy is still in its nascent stage in non-urban areas; (2) there is a strong positive relationship between sharing economy accommodation establishments and both the population density and income per capita, (3) population density and income per capita have no effect on the ratio between the number of traditional and sharing economy accommodation establishments. This study contributes to existing literature in following areas: (1) it assesses the sharing economy phenomenon in areas with natural attractions, (2) it validates the relationship between area population density and sharing economy proliferation, (3) it examines the connection between area economic performance and sharing economy proliferation.

AB Sharing economy is mainly supported by the involvement of three parties: platform, users, and resource suppliers. Since all the transactions are lending the right of use instead of exchanging goods' possession, trust is still playing a key role in the running of sharing economy, but with it comes the risks for both use side and the supplier side. The public's embracing of the sharing economy has created a frenzy over the past few years, during which only a tiny group of them were luckily survived due to the issues such as the sustainability of business and the safety of the participators. To discover a more effective systematical way in managing risks of sharing economy, this study analyzes how trust in sharing economy is established in the sharing economy business model, and how information technology could be leveraged to improve the service for the stakeholders as well as avoid such problems arisen from personal unsteady recognition risks. On the other hand, key drivers (emphasized on the Chinese market) of the sharing economy business model are also studied therefore lowering the risks in its operation and looking for an optimized solution for its business continuity.

TI SLA-Based Sharing Economy Service with Smart Contract for Resource
   Integrity in the Internet of Things
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Recently, technology startups have leveraged the potential of blockchain-based technologies to govern institutions or interpersonal trust by enforcing signed treaties among different individuals in a decentralized environment. However, it is going to be hard enough convincing that the blockchain technology could completely replace the trust among trading partners in the sharing economy as sharing services always operate in a highly dynamic environment. With the rapid expanding of the rental market, the sharing economy faces more and more severe challenges in the form of regulatory uncertainty and concerns about abuses. This paper proposes an enhanced decentralized sharing economy service using the service level agreement (SLA), which documents the services the provider will furnish and defines the service standards the provider is obligated to meet. The SLA specifications are defined as the smart contract, which facilitates multi-user collaboration and automates the process with no involvement of the third party. To demonstrate the usability of the proposed solution in the sharing economy, a notebook sharing case study is implemented using the Hyperledger Fabric. The functionalities of the smart contract are tested using the Hyperledger Composer. Moreover, the efficiency of the designed approach is demonstrated through a series of experimental tests using different performance metrics.

TI Contrived Surplus and Negative Externalities in the Sharing Economy
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB The modern-day sharing economy delivers a multitude of benefits to users and providers worldwide. While there is much discussion about its benefits (e.g., convenience, access, and income), due to its largely unregulated/ under-regulated status, the increasing commercialization of the sharing economy spawns negative effects which must be mitigated to foster long-term sustainability. Based on externalities and concerned markets, this conceptual paper examines the implications of contrived surplus for stakeholders in ridesharing, home sharing, and bike sharing and presents managerial implications for developing these sectors in a reasonable and sustainable manner.

AB At the present moment, the sharing economy is actively expanding all over the world, and Russia is not an exception. There are hundreds of collaborative consumption companies which operate in the majority of countries. In this paper, we focus on the sharing economy business models. Nowadays literature in this sphere is intensively developing and up to now many definitions and frameworks have been introduced for the business models which operate on sharing economy basis. The approach of business models framework has particular popularity among academics and practitioners. There were proposed many kinds of business models canvas, including those for sharing economy companies. At the same time the literature on business models and particularly on P2P business models is still immature and so it is an opportunity to contribute to it. In this short paper, we introduce our classification of sharing economy business models and offer for the consideration our variant of business models framework. Now we are in the process of qualitative research of ten P2P Russian companies with an aim to adjust the proposed business models framework.

TI Green Consumption Practices Among Young Environmentalists: A Practice

SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB We examined the subjective experiences of young environmentalists who engage in green consumption practices from the theoretical lens of Warde's (J Consum Cult 5(2):131-153, 2005) practice theory. Data were gathered through 21 photo-elicited, in-depth interviews with young environmentalists. Based on our findings, we postulated a theoretical framework to understand green consumption practices among our informants as a process with three interrelated phases: green credibility seeking, green procurement and prosumption, and green whispers. This inductive investigation revealed various symbolic meanings of green consumption (e.g. happiness and empowerment) that are instrumental in effectively engaging in green consumption practice and are widely shared among our informants. Our investigation extends the existing literature on green consumption with an alternative theoretical perspective and provides managers with insights into the motivations and practices of green consumers.

TI The sharing economy and sustainability - assessing Airbnb's direct,
   indirect and induced carbon footprint in Sydney
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM
AB A peer-to-peer sharing approach for the accommodation sector such as Airbnb has been suggested as a more environmentally sustainable alternative to conventional forms of accommodation services. This study evaluates the carbon footprint of Airbnb hosts in Sydney. The Airbnb platform and its hosts together generate direct and indirect carbon footprints in the range of 7.27 to 9.39 kg CO(2)e per room and night. The extra income of Airbnb hosts leads to additional, induced carbon footprints. By modelling four different scenarios, the induced carbon footprint of Airbnb hosts range from 3.84 to 602 kg CO(2)e/room-night. Findings challenge the prevalent notion provided by many previous studies that the sharing economy helps to use under-utilized resources, thus decreasing environmental impacts. This study contributes to peer-to-peer accommodation literature and to the widening public debate on the environmental sustainability of the sharing economy.

TI Materialism and the sharing economy: A cross-cultural study of American
   and Indian consumers
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB The global rise of the sharing economy has attracted widespread attention among managers, marketers and researchers as non-ownership modes of consumption are increasingly being adopted by consumers. Building on previous research that distinguishes non-ownership consumption programs, this article investigates the role of materialism in participation in sharing-based programs of the sharing economy cross culturally. Unlike previous research that stated that materialism is in contrast with sharing, this research shows that under certain circumstances, both in America and India, materialism will lead to greater participation in the sharing economy. However, the reason why is different for each culture. For Americans, this effect is expected to surface for programs that resemble sharing as they don't compete with ownership of products but rather encourage materialist consumers to seek out transformative and hedonic experiences that are expected to improve their self-image and well-being. For Indians, materialism will lead to participation in sharing-based programs through increased perceived utility. Managerial and theoretical implications are discussed.

AB The sharing economy represents a phenomenon which is increasing in importance as time goes by, even from the point of view of less developed countries. The aim of the study is to evaluate the knowledge of traditional and developing segments of the sharing economy and their platforms and to analyse and evaluate the level of their use employing the example of customers (the younger and the older generation) in one of the post-communist countries - the Czech Republic. Data was collected on the basis of a questionnaire survey (N=614). This was processed using descriptive statistics tools. The study shows that respondents are the most familiar with forms of sharing not only from traditional segments (passenger transportation and accommodation) but also from the financial segment. The best-known platforms include Uber, Airbnb and Zonky. Platforms from traditional segments are used the most. The younger generation has better awareness, both about possible forms of sharing and also about the existing platforms. However, the study did not prove any differences in the level of use of platforms between the younger and older generation.

AB During the last five years, the sharing economy has emerged as one of the main business models to offer goods and services. Indeed, delivery and transportation are industries for which "sharing" has had one of the biggest impacts, with companies such as: Uber, Lyft or Cabify. However, like in any traditional company, human resource management is an issue for sharing economy firms. Our work aims to infer patterns regarding the performance of human resources in this context. We used unsupervised classification techniques over employee records from a delivery company that uses a sharing economy business model. We propose an automatic and scalable framework to discover efficient groups of workers, using features from logistic, geographical and temporal information. Although previous similar works have presented promising results, unlike them, we do not use demographic information about the employees. Our results suggest that deliveries per day, the kilometers covered by the worker and the companies that occupy a delivery agent are important features to determine outstanding workers. The framework proposed can turn into a key point to keep the exponential growth of these kind of companies during the time.

AB This article explores innovative applications of sharing economy services that have the potential to support a population aging in place, especially the "oldest old," aged 85 and older, and their caregivers. A mixed-methods study conducted by the MIT AgeLab examined perceptions of and experiences with sharing economy services, ultimately finding opportunities and barriers to use. Thus, although sharing economy services have potential to support aging in place, to do so successfully will require reconstructing how older adults, family caregivers, aging service professionals, gerontology educators, and gerontology students conceptualize and deliver care to an aging population. We suggest examples for gerontology educators to integrate into their classrooms to further cultivate an appreciation among students of multiple approaches to intervention, including those that leverage sharing economy and technology-enabled platforms to support older adults and their caregivers.

So far, most of research are focused on the economic models or market strategies about sharing economy, few research works have been done from the perspective of information technologies. However, information system offers the essential platform to realize goods and services access and sharing. This paper aims to analyze the characteristics of sharing economy information systems, and propose a system framework, which could be considered a reference model to analyze or build new applications in this sector. In this paper, different collaboration models are firstly identified, then the success factors enabled by information technologies are introduced. Finally, a hierarchical system framework and its components are introduced, which can be considered as a reference model when researchers and engineers study or build sharing economy systems.

TI DISRUPTIVE AND PARADOXICAL ROLES IN THE SHARING ECONOMIES
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT
AB The sharing economy could be said to disrupt who does what in exchanges. This paper categorises the roles played by users, providers, and platforms in different interpretations of the sharing economy. It asks: What different roles do the users, providers, and platforms play in the sharing economy? And: How do the roles differ in various interpretations of the sharing economy? The paper classifies the different interpretations based on their market/non-market logic and concludes that roles are more extensive for users and providers in non-market logic interpretations, while market logic suggests that the platform acts more roles. The user is, despite the peer-to-peer connotation of the sharing economy, often quite passive. Contributions are made to the emerging literature on the sharing economy through highlighting its many different interpretations, where roles help to systematise these. The paper furthermore contributes to the literature on roles through highlighting them as transitory and expanding beyond expectations related to digitalisation. Practically, the systematisation of roles helps to navigate among various business model designs and makes informed decisions when launching platforms in the sharing economy. Additionally. the focus on roles raises important questions on risk sharing, resource provisions, and the creation of value for each participating party.

SO ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
AB Current studies reveal that the sharing economy has faced new barriers and issues in its development, such as the trust and privacy issues. By integrating theories of sharing economy and service science, in our work "Service quality management of online car-hailing based on PCN in the sharing economy", we explored how to deal with the service issues of online car-hailing based on process chain network (PCN). We also studied services in the sharing economy at three different levels: the personal behavior, the platform's service and the regulations. With service-dominant logic replacing product-dominant logic, we suggest that research in the sharing economy and e-commerce calls for further systematical application of important service science theories and should make use of emerging technologies to develop new research methods.

TI Competitiveness of sharing economy companies in emerging markets
SO COMPETITIVENESS REVIEW
AB Purpose - This paper aims to explore the competitiveness of the sharing economy in emerging markets from the perspective of actual and potential consumers.
   Design/methodology/approach - It is not surprising that most sharing economy businesses may not follow traditional competitiveness approaches. Consequently, their entry strategies and competitiveness methods might face modern, unique and unexpected challenges vis-a-vis securing sufficient consumer willingness to purchase goods and services.
   Findings - A novel theoretical research model is developed which posits that people's willingness to use the sharing economy is negatively related to liabilities of newness and positively related to consumer innovativeness and interpersonal trust. The relationship between cost and willingness to use is likely to vary on a case-by-case basis depending on the nature and extent of substitutes available or, in other words, the novelty or lack thereof embedded in the particular good or service. Other potential determinants are also best viewed as case-specific such as ethical/sustainability concerns, which vary as a function of target consumers' preferences for ameliorating social and environmental externalities.
   Originality/value - Sharing economy businesses have expanded to numerous countries around the world. There is growing evidence to suggest that this diffusion will most likely be maintained. The competitiveness of these businesses in emerging markets may depend on several variables but there is a dearth of literature in this domain which this paper seeks to address while concomitantly highlighting important avenues for future research.

TI TURNING CONSUMERS INTO PROVIDERS IN THE SHARING ECONOMY: EXPLORING THE
   IMPACT OF DEMOGRAPHICS AND MOTIVES
SO EKONOMSKA MISAO I PRAKSA-ECONOMIC THOUGHT AND PRACTICE
AB The sharing economy is an emerging industry with potential for ensuring sustainable economic growth since it is based on underused resources. The aim of this study is to explore the impact of demographic characteristics (age, gender, education and income) and motives (financial benefits, fun, meeting people and social responsibility) on turning a sharing economy consumer into a provider. Descriptive and multivariate statistical analysis has been carried out on data from a large survey conducted in twelve European countries on the state of the sharing economy. The empirical results show that men and individuals under 35 years of age are more likely to participate in the sharing economy as providers. Moreover, consumers who are more driven by altruistic motives and less by financial benefits are more likely to offer their services as providers. This research can be useful to policy makers and managers in exploring the opportunities of supporting broader participation in offering services as providers in the sharing economy.

TI Knowledge Sharing Practices for Corporate Sustainability: An Empirical
   Investigation of Sharing Economy Firms in Japan
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Qualitative studies of sharing economy research are mostly descriptive case studies in the context of the United States and Europe. Although Asian economies are vibrant and expanding, rarely sharing economy research focuses on Asian contexts. Furthermore, quantitative analysis of sharing economies is rare. For this reason, our research aim is to examine the corporate sustainability of sharing economy companies through qualitative and quantitative analyses. It also shows how knowledge-sharing practices affect corporate sustainability in the context of emerging sharing economy firms in Japan. The contribution of this paper is threefold: (1) to provide a conceptual framework for sharing economy practices in general; (2) to present a specific research model in a Japanese context; (3) to report the qualitative case study findings and discuss the empirical results of testing of hypotheses with statistical validation. The research results suggest that the knowledge creation context has a positive effect on both explorative and exploitative knowledge-sharing practices. Explorative knowledge sharing has a positive effect on sustainability which in turn shows a negative effect on financial performance in the short run but a positive impact in the long run. Theoretical and managerial implications provide valuable insight into how sharing economy firms achieve sustainability goals. Future research issues are also summarized.

TI A moral householding perspective on the sharing economy
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB In this paper, we scrutinise the sharing economy from a moral householding perspective and evaluate the moral justifications for a sustainable form of the sharing economy. We consider the emergence of normative moral justifications through householding practices that rest on local mobilisation of people in defence of communities and commitments against the adverse impacts of neoliberal market capitalism. Our perspective draws on Karl Polanyi's conceptualisation of householding, that is, autarchic, communistic provision in a closed community. Using timebanking as an example, we illustrate how a moral sharing economy can be mobilised in collective battles against the current neoliberal system of economic crisis. We contribute to the amassing sharing economy literature emphasising a central, yet missing element of the current discourse: householding as practices creating self-sufficiency and autonomy as well as combining both kin and stranger.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB In the last few years the phenomenon of the Sharing Economy rapidly gained momentum. The reasons for this success are multiple but the most important is the tendency to faster exchanges and economic relationships both on the real and the financial market. This awareness made it essential to start the study form the crisis of the hyper-capitalism and of the concept of ownership which is being replaced with that of a more fluid sharing. In this way, we will analyze the words, the concepts and the values at the basis of the sharing economy which influence the effects this new way of acting and living has on the economies and on the socialization processes of the countries involved. In this perspective, we will also try to consider if and to what extent the sharing economy can have a positive impact on sustainable development.

TI Toward a Geographic Understanding of the Sharing Economy: Systemic
   Biases in UberX and TaskRabbit
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-HUMAN INTERACTION
AB Despite the geographically situated nature of most sharing economy tasks, little attention has been paid to the role that geography plays in the sharing economy. In this article, we help to address this gap in the literature by examining how four key principles from human geography-distance decay, structured variation in population density, mental maps, and "the Big Sort" (spatial homophily)-manifest in sharing economy platforms. We find that these principles interact with platform design decisions to create systemic biases in which the sharing economy is significantly more effective in dense, high socioeconomic status (SES) areas than in low-SES areas and the suburbs. We further show that these results are robust across two sharing economy platforms: UberX and TaskRabbit. In addition to highlighting systemic sharing economy biases, this article more fundamentally demonstrates the importance of considering well-known geographic principles when designing and studying sharing economy platforms.

AB Since Industrial Revolution, humans' unfriendly behaviours of overdevelopment and exhaust emission from factories to the earth have resulted in environmental pollution, exhausting natural resources, and fundamental changes in the environment. Not only is the natural ecologic equilibrium on the earth destroyed, but globally environmental crises are caused. Under the effect of changing natural environment, humans' environmental awareness starts to rise; consumers stress more on the environmental protection and energy saving of products and promote green consumption as the country-wide movement. Aiming at the mass society consumers in Taiwan, total 500 copies of questionnaire are distributed in this study, and 376 valid copies are retrieved, with a retrieval rate of 75%. The research results conclude significantly positive effects of: (1) environmental belief on environmental value; (2) environmental value on green consumption, and (3) environmental belief on green consumption. According to the results, suggestions are proposed, expecting to provide reference for the government promoting environmental protection policies, manufacturers producing products, and individuals purchasing green environmental products.

AB In recent times, the notion of a sharing economy has become more prevalent. It is based on the underutilization of resources which could otherwise be distributed to those who do not have them but need them. One of the target segments is car sharing. It is not clear from academic articles and publications what generation of respondents is the target customer of car-sharing platforms. We based the primary research on the assumption that not every generation of customers wants to use car sharing. The research focused on three generations of respondents (X, Y, and Z) to identify which generations of customers are prospective for this segment. The research showed that Generation Y and Generation Z would be more likely to use car sharing compared to Generation X. We found that Generation X and Y have the most significant differences in willingness to car share between themselves, followed by Generation X and Z. These findings are valuable for platforms that mediate car sharing. It will enable them to target their marketing campaign correctly to the age group that is more likely to become the platform's customers and attract those customers with the right marketing communication strategy. At the same time, this knowledge will enhance the theoretical anchoring of the sharing economy with factual information that links the sharing economy to marketing. The Kruskal-Wallis test and descriptive statistics were used to evaluate the research. The research was conducted from December 2021 to March 2022 and involved 741 respondents.

TI Building Trust toward Sharing Economy Platforms beyond the COVID-19
   Pandemic
SO ELECTRONICS
AB The sharing economy has seen a worldwide boom in recent years. In tourism, such platforms are being increasingly used; however, analysis of consumers' behavior toward such platforms in the context of technological innovation since the COVID-19 pandemic is almost non-existent. The aim of the present research is to fill this gap by studying, with the aid of structural equations, factors that influence the attitudes and behavior of consumers of tourist services offered through sharing economy platforms. Under the impact of the adoption of new technologies, the perceived value generated by these platforms is considered in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Trust in tourism sharing economy platforms and their perceived value is determined by consumers' experience of using them, the authenticity of platforms, propensity toward technological innovation, and users' demand for novelty. Data collected from 548 respondents were modeled using structural equations in SmartPLS. Results show that experience, the authenticity of platform, openness to new things, and technological innovation are the determining factors that influence consumers' behavior on sharing economy tourism platforms. The originality of the research consists of the implementation, in a sharing economy context, of a new construct for this sector, which can also be used in other fields, namely that of pandemic fear. Furthermore, the way in which other constructs are included in the proposed conceptual model and the links between them presents additional novelty. Given the trend of increasing demand for such platforms and tourists' appetite for technological innovation, it will become a managerial challenge for businesses in this field to keep up with the constant evolution of cutting-edge technologies.

AB Sharing economy platforms are incorporating gamification as a strategy to encourage people to participate in it, i.e., to offer their idle goods/services/space through their sharing platforms or provide access to such products/services offered by others. 'Critical mass' is one of the underlying key principles that is responsible for the success of sharing economy platforms. That means it requires people to participate and engage in it. This paper investigates the role of gamification in sharing economy platforms that aim towards encouraging people to participate in it as hosts. By investigating Airbnb as a case, the study intends to understand the role played by game elements in engaging and motivating the hosts for sustained participation. The findings from this research would offer some essential touchpoints for using gamification in sharing economy platforms to encourage people to participate in it by offering their underutilized products, services and other resources.

TI Sharing versus collaborative economy: how to align ICT developments and
   the SDGs in tourism?
SO JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM
AB Great hopes have been placed in the sharing economy to provide a new business model based on peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges of underutilized assets. As a model, the sharing economy has been expected to make significant contributions to sustainability, providing new opportunities for entrepreneurship, more sustainable use of resources, and consumer co-operation in tight economic networks. However, in recent years, digital platforms have turned into the most important actors in the global sharing economy, turning global corporations, such as AirBnB, Booking, or TripAdvisor into intermediaries controlling and profiting from most transactions. Focused on accommodation, this paper conceptualizes the sharing economy in comparison to the wider collaborative economy, and discusses its social, economic, environmental, and political impacts in comparison to the sustainable development goals. It concludes that the sharing economy has great potential to make very significant contributions to sustainability, though the model is increasingly being replaced by the collaborative economy, which performs as an extension and acceleration of neoliberal economic practices.

TI The sharing economy: Your business model's friend or foe?
SO BUSINESS HORIZONS
AB The sharing economy, a rising pattern in consumption behavior that is based on accessing and reusing products to utilize idle capacity, presents both tremendous possibilities and significant threats for emerging as well as incumbent businesses. As of today, it is unclear whether this economy is merely another ephemeral trend in consumption or whether we are experiencing a real shift in how goods are accessed, distributed, and used. Furthermore, little is known about how existing business models are affected by the sharing economy. These two issues represent the central motivation for the development of this article. Consequently, an examination of why the sharing economy has the potential to produce a long-term transformation in consumption behavior is followed by a consideration of how this change might affect companies' business models. Based on a renowned business model framework and a variety of current illustrative examples, we propose central questions managers must ask themselves in order to be prepared to respond to changes brought about by this new economic trend.

AB The application of sharing economy in developing countries has the potential to increase the social capital and economic growth. It can assist with economic development and enable entrepreneurship. However, there are still some barriers to the sharing economy in developing countries. They include a lack of trust, social and cultural norms regarding ownership, inadequate technology, lack of electronic payment systems, insufficient assets, skills, and inappropriate regulations. The aim of this research is to better understand the differences between the ride-hailing value co-creation process typically found in developing countries, and prevailing ride-hailing value co-creation process in developed countries. The insights provide useful information, which allow harnessing sharing economy for the benefit of developing countries.

TI The Impact of Information and Communication Technology Factors on the
   User Intention to Participate in the Sharing Economy
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND HUMAN INTERACTION
AB The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of system and interaction quality, security factors, trust, and perceived ease of use on the user intention to participate in the sharing economy. Information and communications technology (ICT) promotes the development of a sharing economy. Such influential factors include system and interaction quality, security factors, and ease of use of ICT. In this work, a questionnaire survey was administered with 318 sharing economy users with multiple hypotheses investigated via a structural equation model (SEM). Results show that system and interaction qualities have a significant positive impact on the perceived ease of use (PEU). Safety factors and group psychology also have significant positive effects on perceived trust (PT). Altogether, PEU and PT have significant effects on the users' adoption of a sharing economy. The paper contributes to the sharing economy and consumer behaviour literature in a comprehensive perspective.

TI A nexus between airbnb and inequalities in water use and access
SO ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
AB The emergence of digital tourism platforms through the sharing economy has brought into focus the potential opportunities it could promote and the inequalities it could exacerbate. Sharing economy platforms such as Airbnb are increasingly being utilised as alternative tourism accommodations. Though the sharing economy is promoted as economically beneficial and environmentally sustainable, its realised impacts are questioned. These realised impacts are of particular concern in water-scarce contexts such as Cape Town, South Africa as while water use may be virtually forgotten, its actual consumption remains predominately placed-based. This study explores these issues of inequality through the lens of the impact of Airbnb in Cape Town during one of the most severe droughts in over a century. Using a triangulation of mixed methods including web-based listing profile analysis, questionnaires, interviews and media analysis, Airbnb hosts were found to undertake the role of water ambassadors as concerned citizens and responsible tourism accommodation providers. However, spatial inequalities around outsourcing rental linen to marginalised areas of Cape Town and the power-laden training of domestic staff originating from outlying low-income areas, highlight the perpetuation of historically based understandings and considerations of water use.

AB This study investigate how service recovery affect customer loyalty of Uber customers in Ghana and how trust mediate the relationship between recovery and customer loyalty. With the aid of quantitative research design, data was collected from 601 clients of Uber in Accra the capital City of Ghana, situated in the western region of Africa. Structural equation modelling was used to analyze the relationship among the variables. This study reveals a positive and significant relationship exists between procedural justice and trust; distributive justice and trust; interactional justice and trust; and interactional justice and customer loyalty. Trust mediates the relationship between service recovery performance and customer loyalty in the Uber sharing economy in Ghana.

TI Winning strategies for customer loyalty in the sharing economy: A
   mixed-methods study
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB Loyalty is key for sharing economy (SE) platforms, as their success depends on gaining and retaining a critical mass of users. Using a sequential design of quantitative (exploratory factor analysis) and mixed methods (qualitative comparative analysis), a sample of 208 users of SE platforms was analysed. The results indicate that loyalty is achieved at the intersection of website (app) organisation, platform responsiveness and reliability, and customer interaction with the peer service provider. Three strategies are proposed to achieve loyalty, each comprising two out of the three mentioned antecedents. Sensitivity analysis of the loyalty antecedents suggests specific customer segments (millennials versus baby boomers and males versus females).

AB Building on 152 input studies, this meta-analysis investigates customers' and providers' intentions to engage in the sharing economy. We herein examine the influence of 26 factors (e.g., trust, perceived ease of use, altruism, and price) on sharing intentions. Our results indicate substantial differences regarding these sharing antecedents. Moreover, we perform subgroup analyses and study the moderating effect of the 1) sharing sector (ride-sharing, home-sharing, fashion-sharing, and car-sharing), 2) locations (China, Europe, South/Southeast Asia, and the USA), and 3) the platform side (customers and providers). These findings should help platform managers apply potential segmentation criteria for their users. Finally, we identify several avenues for future research on the sharing economy.

TI Sharing economy and optimal investment decisions for distributed solar
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB This paper presents three different models to address the distributed solar photovoltaic (PV) investment problem: the status-quo of net-metering, a sharing economy model, and a cooperative PV decision problem faced by an aggregator participating in wholesale electric markets. In the status-quo case, firms can sell back their excess generation to the utility at a retail tariff. This case is subject to the constraint that firms cannot be net producers of electric on an annual basis. In our sharing economy model, firms can pool their excess generation and trade it in a spot market among themselves. However, the collective does not get paid for selling electric back to the utility. In the cooperative case, an aggregator decides where to optimally invest PV among the participants. Our main goal in studying these three cases is that net-metering (also referred as feed-in) programs are under threat and being phased out, which places future distributed PV investment at risk. In this event, we show that new business models, such as the sharing economy model or a cooperative participation, offer a plausible pathway to maintain and even accelerate PV investment. Several case studies with numerical results are presented to discuss the characteristics of the three proposed models.

TI CITIES IN THE ERA OF SHARING ECONOMY: FROM A PERSPECTIVE OF URBAN SPACE
SO LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE FRONTIERS
AB The city, where modern urban life happens, not only allows for the exchange of goods and information, but also accommodates the production and consumption of social relations. The gathering of goods, information, people, and social relations in cities has promoted the growth of sharing economy. From Airbnb, Uber, to shared bicycles and shared office space, the idea of "sharing" seems to have become a new economic model and paradigm which, along with the mobile Internet, is rolling into everyone's daily life. In facing the new economy, which is characterized by sharing economy, and the more open social relations, urban life is inevitably undergoing dramatic changes. When we examine the city through the lens of sharing and apply the concept of sharing into urban design and management, it will not only bring great changes to the city's internal dynamics and socio-economic process, but also lead to a reconstruction of urban space. Responding to these changes and challenges, a number of cities are seeking for a more shared and open future, yet which could not be supported by the current urban space. This article tries to discuss the sharing economy and its characteristics with the study of contemporary urban space in order to envision the future of urban space within this revolution of sharing.

TI An empirical analysis of factors affecting sharing economy growth
SO OECONOMIA COPERNICANA
AB Research background: There are widely recognized benefits of sharing economy for entrepreneurs and consumers. The European Commission emphasizes the importance of European countries being open to new opportunities that sharing economy brings. In order to promote the development of sharing economy, it is important to understand what factors contribute to its development.
   Purpose of the article: The presented paper aims to identify the main factors relevant for the growth of sharing economy and to determine whether there are factors which are more significant for the development of the sharing economy than others. Based on reviewed literature, the Authors compiled a set of indicators and employed them for research purposes. The selected indicators were assigned into four main groups: technological, political and regulatory environment, economic and social-cultural environment.
   Methods: The authors used two multicriteria methods (SAW and APH), which were applied to the set of indicators and modeled five different situations by attributing significance to the indicators. The Authors have applied this set of indicators for assessing the following selected countries: Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and the United Kingdom. The data covers the years 2011-2015.
   Findings & Value added: The results of the research show that technological readiness and social-cultural environment are significant for the development of sharing economy. For further research the Authors recommend the creation of a composite Sharing Economy Index (SHEI).

In light of recent developments in the use of IT-mediated technologies, such as crowdsourcing and the sharing economy, this manuscript examines their similarities and differences, and the challenges regarding their effective use in developing countries. We first examine each individually and highlight different forms of each IT-mediated technology. Given that crowdsourcing and sharing economy share aspects such as the use of IT, a reliance on crowds, monetary exchange, and the use of reputation systems, we systematically compare the similarities and differences of different types of crowdsourcing with the sharing economy, thus addressing a gap in the current literature. Using this knowledge, we examine the different challenges faced by developing countries when using crowdsourcing and the sharing economy, and highlight the differences in the applicability of these IT-mediated technologies when faced with specific development issues.

AB Subject/topic. The sharing economy is a new format of social interactions in the 21st century. The subject of the research is the sharing economy (shared consumption) and its development in the 21st century. The paper is aimed at studying the concepts of the modern sharing economy and considering its influence on the formation of a new general consumption model based on empirical analysis. Methods. The following methods were used in this article: empirical, systemic, analytical, economic, and other research methods for the development of the sharing economy (shared consumption) in the 21st century. Results. The article provides the concept of sharing economy (shared consumption). The current state and development of the sharing economy have been analyzed. The types of sharing economies have been characterized. The volumes of sharing economies are increasing rapidly leading to integrated management, which will be as economical as possible. Therefore, within the framework of the sharing economy model, economic agents will independently look for opportunities and contribute to saving resources, materials, energy efficiency, and things like that. Economic and environmental crises are forcing people to find new consumption solutions, and the concept of sharing economy becomes an obvious response in dealing with such processes.

AB Prof. Ivana Pais was interviewed by Ivan Pavlyutkin, associate professor at the National Research University Higher School of Economics. The conversation occurred at the Department of Sociology of Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan. Pais introduces us to her career path as an economic sociologist, and explains challenges that economic sociologists encounter while teaching economics students and why it is more insightful than teaching sociology students. She also talks about directions and peculiarities of economic sociological thought in Italy. There is a strong tradition in Italy to study industrial districts with their network of small firms and labor markets.
   In the interview, Pais shares her previous and current research projects. She points out the significance of the digital economy for a better understanding of some market processes happening within the local community and describes her current research concerning the sharing economy. Applying Karl Polany's theoretical perspective, she argues that the Italian sharing economy is embedded in noneconomic institutions. A pure digital sharing economy model that lacks social interactions (the Silicon Valley type) does not work in Italy.
   Finally, Pais provides information about her participation in the conference arranged by the European commission and the organization of future mini-conference in Berkley.

AB The idea of sharing economy is associated with the provision of goods, information or skills by some people to other people on a non-profit, profit or barter basis using virtual tools adapted for this purpose. Actions taken in the area of sharing economy are highly diversified, which is reflected in different ways of classifying sharing economy business models. Assuming the area of sharing as the model classification criterion, four categories can be distinguished: recirculation of goods, increasing the use of fixed assets, exchange of services and making production assets available. The mentioned criterion and the classification based on it became the basis for further analyses and empirical research. The aim of this article was to analyse the functioning of virtual groups that operate within social networking sites. This made it possible to confirm the following thesis: virtual groups, performing similar functions to sharing economy internet platforms, operate on the basis of specific business models, with the difference that they do not charge for access and for enabling relationships between transaction partners. The article also attempts to identify the key features of sharing economy business models characteristic of social groups operating in cyberspace. The research used the triangulation method (literature analysis, passive observation and covert participant observation).

TI Destructive sharing economy: A passage from status to contract
SO COMPUTER LAW & SECURITY REVIEW
AB On the surface, the sharing economy only enables users to make the transactions of underutilized resources over their two-sided platforms. An in-depth exploration of its sudden success reveals three distinctive features of this new business model, namely web search engine, proliferation of smart handhelds and user-generated reputation feedback mechanisms. All of these technological innovations not only inflict destructive changes to our social structure, but also lead to difficulties in an automatic inclusion of the sharing economy into the current regulatory framework. Two changes have raised particular attention. First, sharing platforms are capable of building a democratized private trust mechanism, in addition to the traditional government-monopolized public licensing system. Second, the vertical disintegration feature of the sharing economy considerably blurs the borderline between business and consumers, and between employers and employees. For the purpose of establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for all online and offline activities, it is necessary to differentiate the sharing economy into those with offline competitors and those without offline competitors. With regard to the former, regulators are encouraged to embrace the sharing economy and meanwhile deregulate offline competitors. In relation to the latter, a three-condition analytical framework is proposed in order to strike a balance between promoting innovation and protecting the existing rights of others.

TI How to Create Value(s) in the Sharing Economy: Business Models,
   Scalability, and Sustainability
SO TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB By organizing peer-to-peer exchanges and promoting access over ownership, the sharing economy is transforming a great variety of sectors. Enjoying fast growth, the sharing economy is an umbrella term encompassing heterogeneous initiatives that create different types of economic, environmental, or social value. This heterogeneity triggers tensions and intense disputes about the perimeter of the field. Do Airbnb and Uber belong to the sharing economy? How do we consider practices such as gifting, renting, and swapping that existed before the sharing economy boom? To sort out this complexity, we have adopted a pragmatic and grounded approach examining 27 initiatives that claim to be part of, or are perceived as emblematic of the sharing economy. We develop a typology of sharing economy business models revealing four configurations: shared infrastructure providers, commoners, mission-driven platforms, and matchmakers. Each configuration exhibits specific value-creation logics, scalability issues, sustainability impacts, and potential controversies. Our results provide guidance for sharing entrepreneurs, for established businesses that want to embrace the principles of the sharing economy, and for public actors wishing to regulate or support the field.

TI THE SHARING ECONOMY DILEMMA: THE RESPONSE OF INCUMBENT FIRMS TO THE RISE
   OF THE SHARING ECONOMY
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION
AB Objective of the Study: This paper explores whether and to what degree incumbent firms innovate in response to competition from the sharing economy.
   Methodology/Approach: Data on incumbents' actions related to the sharing economy between 2011 and 2015 was collected from multiple resources. Two conceptual frameworks, the OECD Oslo Manual and Pisano's Innovation Landscape Map, were jointly used to determine whether incumbents' actions could be considered as innovation and their level of innovativeness.
   Originality/Relevance: As the sharing economy has grown rapidly in the last decade, offering new ways to create value, so has the discourse about its disruptive capacity. Yet, not enough is known about the sharing economy's impact on incumbent firms beyond the disruptive capacity narrative.
   Main Results: The study identified 187 actions related to the sharing economy that were taken by 134 incumbent firms between 2011 and 2015. Less than half of these actions are considered innovative, and the majority among them are at the lowest end of the innovation continuum.
   Theoretical/Methodological Contribution: This study contributes to the literature on the sharing economy by developing a synthesized innovation-based framework to evaluate incumbent firms' response to sharing economy entrants.
   Social/management contributions: The results of this study and the methodology it uses provide benchmarking opportunities for incumbents in similar circumstances, and also puts into question the disruptive narrative around the sharing economy.

SO B E JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS & POLICY
AB This paper presents an agent-based model for the sharing economy, in the short-term accommodations market, where peers participating as suppliers and customers follow simple decision rules about sharing market participation, according to their heterogeneous characteristics. Simulations results show that, in the competition between the sharing economy and the traditional industry, low substitutability occurs between goods if consumers are differentiated in preferences. The main determinant for market performance in both sectors is the demand level, with minor influence of price setting and competition within and between markets.

TI Defining the Sharing Economy for Sustainability
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB (1) Background: The sharing economy has emerged as a phenomenon widely described by academic literature to promote more sustainable consumption practices such as access over ownership. However, there exists great semantic confusion within academic literature surrounding the term sharing economy, which threatens the realisation of its purported sustainability potential. (2) Objective: The aim of this paper is to synthesise the existing academic definitions and propose a definition of the sharing economy from the perspective of sustainability science in order to indicate sharing practices that are consistent with the sustainability claims attributed to the sharing economy. (3) Methods: We conduct a database search to collect relevant academic articles. Then, we leverage qualitative content analysis in order to analyse the authors' definitions and to synthesise the broad dimensions of the sharing economy in the discourse. (4) Results: We propose the following characteristics, or semantic properties, of the sharing economy for sustainability: ICT-mediated, non-pecuniary motivation for ownership, temporary access, rivalrous and tangible goods. (5) Conclusion: The semantic properties that inform our definition of the sharing economy for sustainability indicate those sharing practices that promote sustainable consumption compared to purely market-based exchanges. This definition is relevant for academics studying the sustainability impacts of the sharing economy in order to promote comparability and compatibility in research. Furthermore, the definition is useful for policy-makers, entrepreneurs, managers and consumers that have the sharing economy on the agenda in order to promote social enterprise and support sustainable consumption.

AB With the increasing influence of sharing economy in China and throughout the world, its definition, objectives, and development methods have become one of the topics for the science of urban public management. This interview points out that the sharing economy has emerged under the background of the transition of consumer society from possession-orientation to use-orientation, and the revolution of consumption mode and lifestyle with an ultimate aim of improving the efficiency and well-being. As a result, in China's urbanization process which is now shifting from incremental planning to inventory planning, the key for urban development lies in the promotion of the sharing economy and achieving maximum utility with minimum material possession.

   of sharing business models
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The study aims to explore the interaction between business model dimensions and the financial attractiveness of sharing economy platforms, to understand if business models with certain dimensions are more able to attract investment. The research has been developed taking into account the difference between true sharing and pseudo-sharing, to establish to which type of sharing economy platform more investment has been directed to date. The main dimensions of sharing economy business models were identified from the literature. These variables were used to classify the business models of 161 sharing platforms. A one-way ANOVA was performed to infer results. Results from the analysis show that business models that offer rational benefits; increase the utilization of durable assets; have a C2C process and adopt a transaction model, have received more funds. In conclusion, the research suggests that different sharing business models can affect the financial attractiveness and the empirical results show that "pure exchange" platforms are more financed compared with the "pure sharing" platforms.

TI Exploring stakeholder collaboration based on the sustainability factors
   affecting the sharing economy
SO SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
AB Stakeholder collaboration is receiving increasing attention due to its promoting effect on the sharing economy. However, what forms do stakeholders take to collaborate in light of the sustainability factors affecting the sharing economy on the economic, environmental and social dimensions is not clear. Therefore, this paper proposes a methodology that integrates the value net model and two-mode social network analysis to study stakeholder collaboration by analysing the network structure of stakeholders and sustainability factors. The research finds that the core stakeholders in the sharing economy consist of individual suppliers, firm suppliers and sharing economy platforms. The social motivation, security mechanism, industry supervision, economic benefits and level of cooperation are the key factors of sustainable development, which provide more paths for stakeholders to take measures for collaborative development. Regarding the encouragement of sustainable development of the sharing economy, more stakeholders, such as suppliers and platforms related to sharing economy, have the ability to generate economic and social value rather than environmental value. However, economic, social and environmental value can to some extent be simultaneously improved by adjusting the strategy of stakeholder collaboration.(c) 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

TI Does sharing economy promote sustainable economic development and energy
   efficiency? Evidence from OECD countries
SO JOURNAL OF INNOVATION & KNOWLEDGE
AB The sharing economy is a new phenomenon considered to stimulate sustainable practices. It is viewed as the synergy between technology, information and marketing that promotes a new culture where customers favor access over ownership enabling them to use resources more efficiently. Therefore, it represents an innovative business model that can act as a potential pathway to sustainable economic development and energy efficiency. However, economic, and ecological impacts of the sharing economy remain controversial and need further investigation. In fact, sharing economy has disrupted the prevailing economic paradigm soliciting questions about the advantages and the risks of this new behavior. This study aims to fill this gap in the literature and quantitatively assesses the potential implications that the sharing economy has on sustainable economic development and energy efficiency. It builds a proxy indicator for the annual level of sharing economy use per country using internet search data from Google Trends. In addition, it uses annual secondary data for a balanced panel of 18 OECD countries for the period 2014-2018 to test the proposed models' hypotheses. The positive impacts of the sharing economy on sustainable economic development and energy efficiency are supported by the results of the fixed effect regressions with Driscoll-Kraay standard errors. The findings suggest that the sharing economy represents a socio-economic trend that has the potential to stimulate sustainable economic development and energy efficiency. Therefore, they highlight the power of the sharing economy and offer important theoretical and practical implications for researchers, individuals, and policy makers.

TI The Prosumer in the Sharing Economy: A New Way to Participate in the

SO PALABRA CLAVE
AB The concept of prosumer can be grasped as a liaison between communi-cology -anchored in the understanding of traditional communication media- and transformed communicology -aimed at the study of communications in digital environments-. While it seems to have been losing its sense of usefulness and relevance in the communicology imaginary, stu -dies carried out by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) recognize that the new digital agents have updated and extended the concept of prosumer towards the sharing economy, thus becoming a fundamental piece. This si-tuation entails a deep reflection for the communication scientist, revealing a setting for producing never-before-seen contents, services, and products. We need to discuss the concept of prosumer from a new perspective that supposes complexity, interdisciplinarity, and a holistic sense. Therefore, this paper intends to explain the validity of this renewed concept, inserted in the imaginary of the sharing economy.

AB The adoption of ride-sharing apps is critical to the survival of taxi drivers in the mobile-driven sharing economy. Based on survey data collected from 1195 licensed taxi drivers in Beijing, the authors present an integrated technology adoption model that combines technology and use factors (perceived usefulness and ease of use), social factors (word-of-mouth, peer adoption and subjective norms), system factors (socioeconomic and digital inequality), and audience factors (demographic characteristics and innovative personality traits). The results showed that adoption was innate, inherited, and socially driven. Adoption was positively associated with income, access to technologies, innovative personality trait, peer adoption, word-of-mouth, and perceived usefulness of the apps. The implications of the findings for inequality in the sharing economy are discussed.

TI Changing Employment in the Sharing Economy: The Case of Airbnb
SO JAVNOST-THE PUBLIC
AB The paper explores how new digital business models of the sharing economy are challenging the nature of employment. This discussion is set within the context of the tourist accommodation sector, specifically examining the case of Airbnb. Arguably, a significant change in working practices is occurring because of the rise of the so-called sharing economy. We present the debate on whether this is representative of "sharing" in such an economy, and argue that in the case of Airbnb the term "platform economy" is a more valid description of the phenomenon. We postulate that the way in which Airbnb specifically challenges traditional employment relationships is through three processes that have existed prior to the rise of the platform economy business models: free or minimally payed digital labour and related redefinitions of work; consumers' commentaries as the main elements of managerial attempts at controlling the quality of service work; and social media use and accompanying commodification having an increasing role in blurring of life and work boundaries.

TI Paradoxes of openness and distinction in the sharing economy
SO POETICS
AB This paper studies four sites from the sharing economy to analyze how class and other forms of inequality operate within this type of economic arrangement. On the basis of interviews and participant observation at a time bank, a food swap, a makerspace and an open-access education site we find considerable evidence of distinguishing practices and the deployment of cultural capital, as understood by Bourdieusian theory. We augment Bourdieu with concepts from relational economic sociology, particularly Zelizer's "circuits of commerce" and "good matches," to show how inequality is reproduced within micro level interactions. We find that the prevalence of distinguishing practices can undermine the relations of exchange and create difficulty completing trades. This results in an inconsistency, which we call the "paradox of openness and distinction," between actual practice and the sharing economy's widely articulated goals of openness and equity.

TI The dark side of the sharing economy: Balancing value co-creation and
   value co-destruction
SO PSYCHOLOGY & MARKETING
AB The sharing economy disrupts the marketplace and brings both benefits and disadvantages into service ecosystems. We discuss principles of the S-D logic and transformative service research and explore the processes of value co-creation and co-destruction of well-being within the ecosystem of the accommodation sharing economy. Following a brief period of euphoria, the dark side of the sharing economy emerges, defined as the socially, environmentally, or economically undesirable effects introduced by the sharing economy. Airbnb introduced new realities for visitors, neighborhoods, the accommodation industry, and city councils, whereby some stakeholders are frequently found to maximize their own value at the expense of others. Value co-destruction prevails often due to uncontrolled and rapid expansion. We seek to promote a more balanced process, and the optimization of value co-creation, while seeking to prevent value co-destruction. Using a literature review, netnography, and a case study, we investigate co-creation and co-destruction, as expressed by different stakeholders, and focus on the socio-psychological implications in the use of sharing platforms that affect the well-being of individuals and community. A conceptual framework is proposed to manage future research addressing well-being, value co-creation and co-destruction in complex ecosystem service networks.

TI The Sharing Economy and Sustainability of Urban Destinations in the
   (Over)tourism Context: The Social Capital Theory Perspective
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This article contributes to the discussion on the sustainability of the sharing economy by adopting the Social Capital Theory to expand explanations of the sharing economy's role and scope of relations with local communities in the context of overtourism. As mutual relationships have not been fully recognized through a theoretical perspective, the article aims to examine the sustainability of the process of the sharing economy impacting urban tourism communities in light of Robert Putnam's approach to Social Capital Theory. On the basis of a selective systematic review, the article discusses the sustainability of the sharing economy through the lens of bridging and bonding social capital. We argue that a new configuration of social capital, i.e., a sharing platform-modified social capital, arises from the unsustainable and disruptive power of the sharing economy implemented by virtual platforms, thereby contributing to an overtourism syndrome. However, from a medium- and long-term perspective, the sharing economy also impacts the bridging nature of social capital, which should lead to a more sustainable balance in its structure. This initial framework for understanding the impact of the sharing economy on sustainability of local communities provides an alternative approach to studying residents' perceptions and attitudes towards tourism in the areas affected by overtourism.

TI Looking at the 'sharing' economies concept through the prism of
   informality
SO CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF REGIONS ECONOMY AND SOCIETY
AB How do the 'sharing economies' relate to the long history of informal economic practices as understood in the social sciences? This article examines conceptions of the sharing economy in terms of its relation to scholarship on informality. By using two case studies of informal economic practices that originated in socialist-era societies and continue to the present day in modified forms, we critique the notion that sharing economies are significantly novel in form or logic, other than technologically. We draw attention to the variety of informal economy practices to discuss how they may be socially embedded or disembedded. The main focus on global technological leveraging of productivity and connectivity in sharing economy practices would suggest that many aspects are akin to disembedded forms of informality. Scholarship needs to address the ongoing disciplinary parallelism on prefixed 'economies'-in doing so it would provide a better contextual and theoretical understanding of 'sharing economies'.

TI Role of sharing economy in energy transition and sustainable economic
   development in China
SO JOURNAL OF INNOVATION & KNOWLEDGE
AB The sharing economy is a relatively recent phenomenon that aims to promote environmentally friendly prac-tices. The sharing economy is characterized by the convergence of information, marketing and technology to create a new paradigm in which customers value access above ownership, allowing them to make better use of resources. It provides a modern business strategy that can pave the way for energy efficiency and sustain-able economic development. However, the economic and environmental effects of the sharing economy are debatable and require more research. Indeed, the sharing economy has upended the current economic stan-dard, raising concerns about the benefits and disadvantages of the new behaviour. Therefore, the present study fills a gap in the literature by quantitatively assessing the possible impacts of the sharing economy on sustainable economic development and energy efficiency in China over the period 2000 to 2019. Recently introduced QARDL estimation methodology is applied to achieve the objective, controlling for population growth, unemployment, energy prices, and inflation. The sharing economy is shown to make a positive con-tribution to promoting sustainable development across all quantile ranges, while it contributes to enhanced energy efficiency at higher quantiles only. According to the findings, the sharing economy turns out to be a socioeconomic phenomenon with the potential to promote energy efficiency and sustainable development. Therefore, we emphasize the potential of the sharing economy and recommend the Chinese promote sharing economy models to reach their full potential for sustainable development in energy efficiency and economic terms by enacting suitable taxation and legislation policies.(c) 2023 The Authors.

TI Platform Ideologies: Ideological Production in Digital Intermediation
   Platforms and Structural Effectivity in the "Sharing Economy"
SO TELEVISION & NEW MEDIA
AB Drawing from three sets of literature (critical economy of platformization, labor organization, and digital activism), this article introduces an integrated framework to analyze ideological production in digital intermediation platforms, particularly in relation to the sharing economy. We analyze documents, fieldwork interviews from twenty-eight actors, and observation of events in Barcelona, Paris, and Berlin during 2015-2017. We find that there are three dominant ideological strands: "sharing economy," "commons," and "platform cooperativism," within a spectrum that ranges from legitimizing neoliberalism and/or reasserting a reformist, more humane capitalism to more radical visions: cooperative society to commons-oriented production, and resisting privatization, through the recapturing of public space as commons. The actors we interviewed can be seen as part of an intermediate class, dependent on platforms for their survival, and who end up involuntary promoters of their own alienation and exploitation, consolidating the deterioration of the very digital labor conditions they seek to transform.

TI Building trust in the sharing economy: Current approaches and future
   considerations
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The sharing economy could be an answer to the challenge of sustainability; it can facilitate the sharing and reuse of resources, create new ways of earning money, and enhance social connections. For example, by reducing the use of natural resources without having to acquire or own everything, the sharing economy can positively affect sustainability. At the core of this type of economy lies trust among users and between users and the platformdthe system cannot reach its full potential without trust. In fact, businesses or organizations in the sharing economy can even fail due to trust issues, although more information is needed to make better use of the existing platforms. The aim of this systematic literature review is to study how trust is built in the sharing economy. For this purpose, we introduce 28 solutions to support trust in sharing economy platforms, develop a preliminary model for evaluating trust in this context, and present a few considerations for future research. Platform developers and managers can use our preliminary model to identify trust issues in their platforms. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Mapping out the sharing economy: A configurational approach to sharing
   business modeling
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB Sharing economy businesses have emerged in recent years as a disruptive approach to the traditional way of planning, modeling and doing business. The phenomenon has gained significant traction within a wide range of domains including entrepreneurship, innovation, technology and management more broadly. Despite this surge and interest, there is a lack of empirical research regarding the increasing diversity of sharing economy business models and the implications for business growth, community impact, sustainability and public policy. With this research, we sought to leverage a rigorous comparative method, fs/QCA, to assess the business models of 36 firms in the sharing economy. Leveraging a rich set of qualitative data, our analysis leveraged seven dimensions of sharing economy business models drawn from extant research, revealing a typology comprising five ideal types that collectively account for the constellation of possible, empirically-relevant business models across the sharing economy. The emergent dilemmas and paradoxes as well as implications of these typologies of business models for startups, investors and policymakers are explored. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the possibilities of prioritizing tasks, actual sharing of libraries, collaboration policies and the directions via quantifying the relative importance of services for each value based on users' perceptions observed from in-depth analysis of the investigation results. Through this, the study expects that libraries will provide high - level the sharing economy services, reflecting users' needs. Design/methodology/approach This study surveyed public library users across the country have through the survey method and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method to examine the perceptions of users on the roles of libraries in the sharing economy's environment to deduce the directions and priorities to activate the roles and functions of libraries in the era of the sharing economy. Findings The research results are as follow: first, public library users' awareness of the concept of the sharing economy was low, but they observed a relation between the two concepts after understanding the concept of the sharing economy. Second, The users' personal characteristics were observed to mostly affect knowledge information service, experience talent sharing, material sharing and space sharing. Lastly, the study sought to identify the relative importance (preference) of various library services which pursue the value of the sharing economy through AHP analysis method. The values of the sharing economy were preferred in the order of social>economic>technical>relational values which can be enumerated to convenience>knowledge>space>education>contents>new technology>experienced talent>object>network. Originality/value This study has a great significance in that it analyzed actual library users' perceptions on the concept of the sharing economy and the functions and roles of libraries in the era of the sharing economy from a multifaceted angle. In addition, this study carries an important meaning as it provided an opportunity to vitalize libraries and explored the measures to actualize the roles of libraries in tandem with the environment of the sharing economy by recognizing the values of libraries based on the new concepts and values of the sharing economy and presenting the functions and roles of the libraries from the aspects of the sharing economy.

TI The Legitimacy of a Sharing Economy-Enabled Digital Platform for
   Socioeconomic Development
SO JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH
AB A sharing economy based on improved ICT is an emerging economic-technological concept. Sharing economy-enabled digital platforms in China have changed patterns of consumption, exploited under-utilized resources, and increased employment. Previous studies on sharing economy-enabled digital platforms mainly focused on the positive and negative effects, users' perception and behavioral intention, and the business model, but few studies have addressed these platforms for socioeconomic development from the perspective of legitimacy. This study applied legitimacy to analyze a typical sharing economy-enabled digital platform in China for socioeconomic development via a longitudinal interpretive case study. A process model of variation and evolution of an online car-hailing platform for socioeconomic development was inductively derived, allowing elucidation of the complexities and interplay of regulative challenges, normative challenges, and cognitive challenges in each developmental phase, resulting in improving and enriching the way people go out, optimizing resource allocation, increasing employment, and undertaking social responsibility. The findings of this case study provide a comprehensive and supported framework and demonstrate a successful model for managers and other peer organizations for future business efforts in the sharing economy.

We argue that there is a need for HCI research to engage with the whole lifecycle of sharing services, from inception and design to operation and use. In particular, we motivate the need for an open design approach for IoT-enabled sharing services that fosters intelligibility, accountably and control with respect to the mechanisms and algorithms that govern a sharing service.

TI Achieving sustainable development goals through identifying and
   analyzing barriers to industrial sharing economy: A framework
   development
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB Various sustainable development goals (SDG's) that have been achieved with current economic business models initiated the new socioeconomic system known as the "sharing economy." This collaborative economy system shares resources among communities and further assists to reduce both negative environmental and societal impacts and to reduce costs. The importance of this endeavor urges researchers to investigate the sharing economy more fully through different applications, primarily including transportation and customer service. However, these studies fail to attempt to explore the perspectives of the sharing economy through industrial applications. Industrial sectors are more prone towards negative sustainability; hence, it is necessary to address strategies to promote and to implement the sharing economy with an industrial perspective. Hence, this study seeks to identify the barriers of sharing economy implementation in industries, particularly with small and medium scale enterprises (SME) located in India. Common barriers are identified through the combined assistance of literature review and experts' opinions. These common barriers are shortlisted through Best Worst Method (BWM) and further analyzed through proposed solution methodology, DEMATEL, with the support of case industrial managers. Among 15 shortlisted barriers of sharing economy, "Lack of trust" was identified as the most influential and "Capital cost" was identified as the least influential barriers. This study contributes to both academic and practitioner levels by identifying the most common barriers of the industrial sharing economy. Further, we present strategies so practitioners can evade such barriers through customized practices instead of providing a generic treatment. In addition, this study provides a new approach to the literature; insight into the 'industrial sharing economy' could be a scientific breakthrough for upcoming studies. Finally, the study concludes with various useful recommendations and suggestions on the implementation of sharing economy in industries, particularly with SMEs. These recommendations shed light into various key research areas, which can be examined more fully in future studies.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the views of Barcelona residents who have been impacted by the proliferation of Airbnb rentals.
   Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative approach was adopted, involving semi-structured interviews with residents of Barcelona.
   Findings - It highlights the problem of unregistered Airbnb rentals throughout the city, carrying implications for the gentrification of neighbourhoods, the displacement of local residents and anti-social guest behaviour. This study points to a consequent rise in anti-tourist feeling. It also reveals that the authentic experience promised by the sharing economy is illusory.

AB whether you are renting a text book (textbookrentals. com), sharing a ride (Uber), or looking for a safe and convenient place to spend the night (Airbnb) you are part of a growing economy referred to as the "Sharing Economy". There are an increasing number of emerging startups that have embraced this economic model and have become giant enterprises with record-breaking revenues in an abnormally short period of time. But is the Sharing Economy sustainable enough to grow and prosper in the future? This paper investigated the critical success factors behind the promising prospects of the Sharing Economy and concludes that the Sharing Economy is a sustainable economic model. There are various factors behind this premise such as a new emerging class of consumers with a keen interest in sharing; price consciousness; a robust business model; a growing perception of the eco-efficiency of the sharing economy; and an emergent business-to-business (B2B) sector that contributes to operating at maximum capacity. All the aforementioned factors coupled with advances in information technology and software engineering, especially in social media and digital platforms, have created a unique environment for the growth and acceleration of the sharing economy.

SO GOSPODARKA NARODOWA-THE POLISH JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
AB The so-called sharing economy is one of the most important and widespread manifestations of technological progress, reflecting the growth of the "new economy." It can be understood as a socio-economic model based on the grassroots initiatives of individual people (P2P relationships) that refer to not fully utilised resources, with sharing taking place through technology platforms, for a fee or free of charge. The aim of this article is a detailed description of trust, which is a foundation and an inalienable element of the sharing economy. The definitions and features of the sharing economy are presented, followed by the concept and functions as well as selected mechanisms of trust building. Subsequently, the concept of the so-called inter-intermediary trust, characteristic of the sharing economy, is introduced and outlined, and the mechanisms of its creation are described. Next, we discuss differences between trust and credibility and problems with building the credibility of digital platform users. The study finds that intermediary trust is inseparably connected with the sharing economy.

In order to better understand how Law can interplay with the expansion of activities usually labeled as part of the sharing economies movement, the article suggests that the constitutional principle of social function of property as well as the strengthening of the principle of objective good faith could serve as two relevant guides to such an analysis. The compliance requirements stated in some constitutional and other legal provisions concerning the social function of property can lead to a better way to examine the impact of sharing economies activities in the cities. On other hand, the principle of objective good faith can emphasize how typical sharing economy initiatives might increase transparency and trusts in contractual relationships.

TI Sharing Economy: Promote Its Potential to Sustainability by Regulation
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The sharing economy is an emerging economic form with the potential to promote sustainable development; it is highly malleable but tends to not be environmentally friendly or necessarily lead to saving resources. Therefore, to give it the inherent logic of sustainable development and realize its great potential, the sharing economy must be made to meet the necessary conditions and be appropriately regulated in the current window of opportunity. This paper proposes that the potential factors of the sharing economy that can promote sustainable development are mainly improving resource utilization efficiency, market impetus and plasticity and transforming consumption patterns and concepts, while the main limiting factors are the excessive demand that is likely to result from to the descending consumption threshold, lack of maintenance motivation due to the sharing of property rights, and uncertainty in the proportions of increased welfare levels and resource consumption. Then, the paper explores the necessary conditions to promote sustainable development in the sharing economy, namely, the required characteristics of shared products and the need to place constraints on consumers. Next, it discusses how to incorporate these conditional factors into the regulatory framework for the future development of the sharing economy and proposes overall principles and ideas for the governance and regulation of producers, consumers, and platform operators in the operation of and participation in the sharing economy. Finally, the paper emphasizes that the line of regulatory thinking should change because the sharing economy differs from traditional economic forms, and it also emphasizes the importance of exploring conditions and explores the related research prospects for studying regulation with environmental sustainability as the regulatory objective.

By encouraging the empowering benefits of labour flexibility and entrepreneurialism for women, these companies exemplify a type of neo-liberal feminism, which endorses individualization and market-based solutions to employment. Given the contingent working conditions resident in the sharing economy, a more apt descriptor is the 'gig economy'. The article also examines policy aspects of the sharing economy, including legal debates about worker status and platform discrimination.

A hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between data analytic usage and absorptive capacity with innovation performance. Findings show that both data analytics usage and absorptive capacity are important to organizations operating in the sharing economy, with data analytic usage accounting for a higher variance in innovation performance.

TI Stereotypes, same-sex struggles, and sustainable shopping: intrasexual
   competition mediates sex differences in green consumption values
SO BALTIC JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT
AB PurposeThe present study aimed to investigate whether male consumers report weaker green consumption values than their female counterparts, and whether such a presumed sex difference, at least in part, can be explained by different levels of intrasexual competition. In other words, the study tested the notion that intrasexual competition acts as a psychological mechanism explaining why male (vs female) consumers are sometimes less prone to prefer and purchase sustainable goods, with their higher tendency to compete with same-sex rivals making them less likely to engage in green consumption.Design/methodology/approachThe study was based on a large cross-sectional survey, in which a final sample of 1,382 participants (823 female and 559 male) provided complete responses on well-validated scales measuring intrasexual competition and green consumption values. The large sample size implies that even small effect sizes could be detected with high statistical power. The data were analyzed using a series of Mann-Whitney U tests to compare the responses made by male and female participants. Subsequently, multiple linear regressions as well as regression-based mediation and moderation analyses were performed with control variables added to show robustness of the results, test the proposed chain of events, and demonstrate generalizability.FindingsMale (vs female) participants expressed significantly higher levels of intrasexual competition both generally and on the two subdimensions corresponding to superiority striving and inferiority irritation. Further, they were slightly less inclined to express green consumption values. Importantly, the sex difference in green consumption values was mediated by inferiority irritation as well as the entire intrasexual competition scale but not by superiority striving. Thus, men's inferiority irritation, in particular, and their more pronounced propensity to compete with same-sex rivals, in general, drove them away from green consumption, whereas women's weaker willingness to compete with same-sex rivals instead increased their inclination of "going green."Originality/valueDrawing on findings from the domains of competitiveness and gender stereotypes, the current research demonstrates a novel mechanism through which green consumption responses can be understood. Specifically, this study provides empirical evidence for the mediating role of intrasexual competition, especially regarding the more negatively charged subdimension of inferiority irritation, in explaining why male and female consumers may differ in terms of their green consumption values. The present research also contributes to the literature by questioning the unidimensional structure of the intrasexual competition scale and showing that the negative (vs positive) subdimension of this scale is more influential in explaining sex-differentiated patterns in consumers' green consumption values, thereby supporting the notion that "bad is stronger than good."

AB The sharing economy is a widespread concept of commonly used resources either among individuals or across organizations putting efforts into jointly utilizing existing resources. Within digital networked organizations, trust behavior needs to be supported by mechanisms to establish and sustain the collaborative network. This paper presents methods for visualizing and scoring collaborative behavior as steps towards operationalizing the trust relationship within networked organizations. Using a case study involving a sharing digital laboratory, we investigate how transparency influences collaborative work and how it affects digital collaborations as a whole. We apply Social Network Analysis (SNA) and the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model to visualize and score trust behavior within a case study for digital laboratories. The result of the trust behavior will be extended to an overarching sharing economy business model that promotes the network effect for networked organizations.

TI The sharing economy ideal Implementing an organization-sponsored sharing
   platform as a CSR program
SO INTERNET RESEARCH
AB Purpose Bridging noted gaps in the sharing economy and corporate social responsibility (CSR) literatures, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how an organization-sponsored sharing platform - a new class of information technology (IT) and the sharing economy ideal - is given meaning as a CSR program for internal stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach The research involves phone interviews conducted with site coordinators of the Zimride by Enterprise (R) ridesharing platform in 25 organizations. Findings This case study reveals that two component processes of organizational sensemaking - sensegiving and sensebreaking - are underlying micromechanisms used by organizations to enact a sponsored sharing platform as a CSR program. Qualitative analyses demonstrate that every meaning given to Zimride remained open to sensebreaking during its implementation. As such, site coordinators were continuously drawn into sensemaking about Zimride's cognitive, linguistic and conative dimensions as a CSR program and had to exert ongoing effort to stabilize its socially (re)constructed meaning within their organization. Furthermore, site coordinators' sensegiving narrative about Zimride was often undermined by their sensebreaking communications and organizational actions, albeit unintentionally. Originality/value This paper provides valuable insights into these sensemaking processes and develops a prescriptive framework for enacting an organization-sponsored sharing platform as a CSR program.

TI Offline biases in online platforms: a study of diversity and homophily
   in Airbnb
SO EPJ DATA SCIENCE
AB How diverse are sharing economy platforms? Are they fair marketplaces, where all participants operate on a level playing field, or are they large-scale online aggregators of offline human biases? Often portrayed as easy-to-access digital spaces whose participants receive equal opportunities, such platforms have recently come under fire due to reports of discriminatory behaviours among their users, and have been associated with gentrification phenomena that exacerbate preexisting inequalities along racial lines. In this paper, we focus on the Airbnb sharing economy platform, and analyse the diversity of its user base across five large cities. We find it to be predominantly young, female, and white. Notably, we find this to be true even in cities with a diverse racial composition. We then introduce a method based on the statistical analysis of networks to quantify behaviours of homophily, heterophily and avoidance between Airbnb hosts and guests. Depending on cities and property types, we do find signals of such behaviours relating both to race and gender. We use these findings to provide platform design recommendations, aimed at exposing and possibly reducing the biases we detect, in support of a more inclusive growth of sharing economy platforms.

TI What if everyone becomes a sharer? A quantification of the environmental
   impact of access-based consumption for household laundry activities
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB In order to meet the EU's climate and resource efficiency targets, changes in our daily-life behaviours, as well as business models, are urgently necessary. More insights are needed to make real changes based on research with a systems perspective. We developed a system dynamics model to analyse the environmental benefits of a transition from ownership-based to access-based household laundry activities. The model considers demographic, technological and behavioural aspects and thereby assesses the environmental impact of laundry activities. The model is applied to the Swedish as well as the European context and allows cross-country comparisons. The results indicate a significant potential of the sharing economy. The higher utilisation of shared machines and extended lifespans of the machines can cut greenhouse gas emissions by a third and lower raw material usage overall and lower primary raw material in production due to higher recycling rates. The carbon intensity of the energy mix is a crucial factor for the environmental consequences that arise through changes in energy usage due to sharing economy practices. This case study shows the value of adopting policies that could promote sharing and extended life spans.

   SHARING ECONOMY
SO UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES LAW JOURNAL
AB The short-term rental accommodation market has experienced incredible growth as a result of technological innovations. This article explores the impact of this phenomenon on property and the concept of ownership in Australia. It does so, first by drawing on Kellen Zale's framework of sharing, which breaks down the activities associated with the sharing economy and applies it in the Australian context. This helps us understand that in many respects, short-term rental accommodation is better characterised as part of the sharing-for-profit economy. This characterisation explains and justifies the choices that Australian states and territories have made in regulating the short-term rental market. This article also analyses disputes that have arisen in Australia concerning short-term rentals, and concludes that whilst the sharing economy prioritises access to property over ownership of it, property law continues to protect the privilege of ownership.

AB Sharing Economy (SE) systems use technologies to enable sharing of physical assets and services among individuals. This allows optimisation of resources, thus contributing to the re-use principle of Circular Economy. In this paper, we assess existing SE services and identify their challenges in areas that are not technically connected to their core functionality but are essential in creating trust: information security and privacy, personal data protection and fair economic incentives. Existing frameworks for elicitation of non-functional requirements are heterogeneous in their focus and domain specific. Hence, we propose to develop a holistic methodology for non-functional requirements specification for SE systems following a top-down-top approach. A holistic methodology considering non-functional requirements is essential and can assist in the analysis and design of SE systems in a systematic and unified way applied from the early stages of the system development.

TI Investigating the impact of home-sharing on the traditional rental
   market
SO INTERNET RESEARCH
AB Purpose The sharing economy has enjoyed rapid growth in recent years, and entered many traditional industries such as accommodation, transportation and lending. Although researchers in information systems and marketing have attempted to examine the impacts of the sharing economy on traditional businesses, they have not yet studied the rental housing market. Thus, this research aims to investigate the impact of the sharing economy (i.e. home-sharing) on traditional businesses (i.e. rental housing market). Design/methodology/approach The authors assemble rich data from multiple sources about the entry of a leading Chinese home-sharing platform (i.e. Xiaozhu.com) and local housing rental price index. Then, econometric models (i.e. linear panel-level data models) are employed for empirical investigation. Instrumental variables are used to account for potential endogeneity issues. Various robustness checks are adopted to establish the consistency of the findings. Findings Overall, the estimation results show that the entry of a home-sharing platform will decrease the local housing rental price. Moreover, this impact would be strengthened in a more developed city. Additionally, this impact would be strengthened with higher prices of new houses or second-hand houses. Originality/value First, this research is one of the first to study the impact of the sharing economy (i.e. home-sharing) on traditional markets (i.e. housing rentals). Second, it contributes to the relevant literature by documenting that the impact of a platform's entry is not uniform but contingent on city and housing market characteristics. Third, practically, the findings also offer important implications for platform operators and policy makers.

TI Collaborative innovation in the sharing economy Profiling social product
   development actors through classification modeling
SO INTERNET RESEARCH
AB Purpose With the emergence of the sharing economy paradigm, the process of innovation is no longer unidirectional, but cyclical. This paradigm shift requires a better understanding of social actors to fully leverage the promise of co-innovation in the sharing economy. To this end, the purpose of this paper is to develop a classification model to profile social actors based on their motivation to participate in different co-innovation activities. Design/methodology/approach A preliminary case study was first conducted to identify actors' motivations to continuously participate in co-innovation activities. Next, a survey was administrated to validate the measurement model and then a discriminant analysis was run on a sample of 244 actors to classify actors based on their willingness to participate in three forms of co-innovation activities. Lastly, the resultant classifiers were cross-validated. Findings The results indicate that financial gains, entrepreneurship and learning are significant predictors of ideation (sharing new ideas). Enjoyment and learning are strong indicators of collaboration (sharing knowledge or experience), whereas networking, enjoyment, and altruism are most strongly related to socialization (sharing network and connections). These findings highlight three classes of social actors - ideators, collaborators and networkers - based on motivational differences. Originality/value Co-innovation among individual inventors is an understudied aspect of the sharing economy. This study provides a theoretically parsimonious classification model to profile social actors, predict the sharing activities in co-innovation networks, and highlight the importance of platform design to appeal to different classes of potential contributors in collaborative innovation.

TI Toward a Composite Measure of Green Consumption: An Exploratory Study
   Using a Korean Sample
SO JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB This study developed a composite measure of green consumption behaviors, incorporating multiple dimensions of green consumption behaviors. As a result of an extensive literature review, four value orientations were proposed: health-related egoistic value orientation, resource-related egoistic value orientation, altruistic value orientation, and biospheric value orientation. And a composite measure of green consumption which measured green consumption behavior manifesting the suggested value orientations were proposed and empirically tested using a Korean sample. After empirical testing and validating the proposed composite measure according to the measurement validation procedure proposed by Nunnally (New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1978), the composite measure of green consumption behaviors was revised to three dimensions of green consumption behaviors: health-conscious green consumption behavior, resource-conscious green consumption behavior, and socially conscious green consumption behavior that combined originally suggested altruistic and biospheric value orientations. A multivariate regression analysis was employed to test the usability of the composite measure of green consumption behaviors and to identify the determinants of green consumption behaviors. As hypothesized, the results of regression analysis showed that perceived consumer effectiveness, reference persons, and perceived market situation are significant determinants of green consumption behaviors, and the effects of environmental concern and socioeconomics are limited. Based on these findings, public policy and marketing implications that promote green consumption are also proposed.

TI The origin of the sharing economy meets the legacy of fractional
   ownership
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The sharing economy is changing the consumption and ownership of goods. As consumption becomes more and more characterised by sharing and access-based consumption, ownership is becoming more concentrated. The literature on the sharing economy focuses almost exclusively on shared consumption practices and rather overlooks the question of ownership despite a substantial body of work on forms of shared ownership, that is, fractional ownership. In this paper, I study the extent of the linking between these two streams of work and whether they have a common conceptual base. I analyse the citations networks of these academic literatures, using the Leiden algorithm of community detection and main-path analysis. I find that the sharing economy literature originated in consumer research that debates over sharing as opposed to possession, and in work on transaction costs. I draw on the strand of work on fractional ownership and identify three sharing economy aspects: psychological ownership, anticommons and exclusion of group cooperation. The findings allow a better understanding of the characteristics of the sharing economy and open avenues for future research on fractional ownership models in the sharing economy.

TI Value Co-creation for sustainable consumption and production in the
   sharing economy in China
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) has traditionally treated consumption and production as separate domains of economic activities with different solutions for sustainability. In the emerging sharing economy, consumption activities are more and more integrated into the production process of shared goods and services, which provides novel arenas for sustainability in cities. Increasingly, these sharing business models are aiming to solve long-standing urban sustainability problems, such as insufficient daily transport, and its problems of polluttion. In this article, we integrate theories of the sharing economy, value co-creation and SCP to argue that the emergent forms of value co-creation between consumers and sharing businesses provide new opportunities for SCP. We use two emergent and representative sharing mobility businesses in China a bike-sharing scheme called Mobile and an electric-vehicle-sharing scheme called EVCARD as case studies to analyze the sustainability potentials of value co-creation. The social, behavioral, economic, and infrastructural obstacles encountered in realising such potentials are also identified. Based on these empirical results, we propose a framework to conceptualize the emerging patterns of value co-creation between governments, sharing business firms, and consumers in the sharing economy. We highlight the importance of understanding value co-creation for development of SCP theory and practice to guide the evolving sharing economy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Collaborative fashion consumption in the sharing economy: Philosophical
   and aesthetic perspectives
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL FASHION MARKETING
AB The sharing economy is becoming more important due to the development of reasonable consumption and environmental recognition, and diverse business models are attempting to describe and predict how to apply the sharing economy. In this context, collaborative fashion consumption (CFC) is a part of the sharing economy trend to temporarily use fashion products in various ways. Few studies attempt to understand the CFC as a part of the contemporary social and cultural trends. In this context, the major objective in the present study is to describe the current situation of CFC, based on several philosophical and aesthetic dimensions regarded as macroscopic perspectives, and to understand the contemporary social and cultural trends. This study examines prior research to understand the concept of the sharing economy. In this process, applying three major perspectives can boost the development of the sharing economy: Walter Benjamin (deconstruction of aura), Nicoloa Bourriaud (relational aesthetic), and Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari (rhizome).An online platform, communal relationship, and interchangeable values, are selected to link the related philosophical and aesthetic dimensions. The study analyses 41 CFC services from 7 countries via the content analysis method using3 philosophical and aesthetic dimensions to understand the current trends of CFC in the sharing economy.

TI Consolidated, systemic conceptualization, and definition of the "sharing
   economy"
SO JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The "sharing economy" has recently emerged as a major global phenomenon in practice and is consequently an important research topic. What, precisely, is meant by this term, "sharing economy"? The literature to date offers many, often incomplete and conflicting definitions. This makes it difficult for researchers to lead a coherent discourse, to compare findings and to select appropriate cases. Alternative terms (e.g., "collaborative consumption," "gig economy," and "access economy") are a further complication. To resolve this issue, our article develops a consolidated (based on all prior work) and systemic (relating to the phenomenon in its entire scope) definition of the sharing economy. The definition is based on the detailed analysis of definitions and explanations in 152 sources identified in a systematic literature review. We identify 36 original understandings of the term "sharing economy." Using semantic integration strategies, we consolidate 84 semantic facets in these definitions into 18 characteristics of the sharing economy. Resolving conflicts in the meaning and scope of these characteristics, we arrive at a consolidated, systemic definition. We evaluate the definition's appropriateness and applicability by applying it to cases claimed by the media to be examples of the sharing economy. This article's definition is useful for future research and discourse on the sharing economy.

This new form of consumption started a decade ago, following the 2008-2009 crises, the development in mobile communication and a trend toward sustainable consumption exhibited by more and more people. Today sharing economy is widely debated in academic journals and popular press. In this paper we analyse the marketing of the sharing economy companies. Our goals are twofold: to identify particular marketing tools that explain the success of the sharing economy companies and to spot differences with the "conventional" marketing tools. The marketing within sharing economy context has its particularities concerning the marketing mix and relationships with the customers. Marketing is part of the transformation that led consumers to embrace the sharing economy. Among the marketing tools used in sharing economy we can mention: customization and product-as-a-service, dynamic pricing mechanism, interactive communication on digital environment, multichannel customer interactions, rethinking of the consumer participation in company-customer relationship.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT
AB The paper employs a Systematic Literature Review approach to investigate the evolution of the term sharing economy and to identify the future potential research pathways. Analysis of the key publications reveals high emphasis on conceptual studies and qualitative methodologies within the academic literature on sharing economy. This study classifies the literature into five main categories of sustainability, participant behavior, regulatory framework, business models and conceptual studies. Highlighting the research gaps, this study also calls for further research on understanding the roles of other stakeholders such as government and municipalities, analyzing the influence of cultural background and exploring the possibilities for B2B businesses to engage in sharing economy.

AB The digital-sharing economy presents opportunities for individuals to find temporary employment, generate extra income, increase reciprocity, enhance social interaction, and access resources not otherwise attainable. Although the sharing economy is profitable, little is known about its use among the unemployed or those struggling financially. This paper describes the results of a participatory-design based workshop to investigate the perception and feasibility of finding temporary employment and sharing spare resources using sharing-economy applications. Specifically, this study included 20 individuals seeking employment in a U.S. city suffering economic decline. We identify success factors of the digital-sharing economy to these populations, identify shortcomings and propose mitigation strategies based on prior research related to trust, social capital and theories of collective efficacy. Finally, we contribute new principles that may foster collaborative consumption within this population and identify new concepts for practical employment applications among these populations.

TI Internet Use on Closing Intention-Behavior Gap in Green Consumption-A
   Mediation and Moderation Theoretical Model
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB The rapid development of the Internet as an information medium has provided new opportunities for promoting green consumption. Therefore, a study on the theoretical mechanism is helpful to make better use of the Internet media to promote green consumption and close consumers' green consumption intention-behavior gap. In this study, data from 419 valid questionnaires were collected and analyzed through PLS-SEM within the framework of the theory of planned behavior. The results show that there are two pathways of Internet media promoting green consumption, namely the moderating effect and the mediating effect. First, through the moderating effect, Internet use can promote the conversion of intention to behavior and perceived behavioral control to behavior, thus closing the intention-behavior gap. Second, through the mediating effect, Internet use promotes green consumption behavior through the mediator of personal perceived environmental threats. The research indicates that the potential of Internet information media should be fully explored in promoting green consumption, disseminating environmental knowledge, reporting environmental issues, and guiding the transformation of individual green consumption intention into behavior.

AB The sharing economy is a new business model based on the integration of offline idle resources. Since 2010, the sharing economy has developed rapidly on a global scale. The capital of various parties has been injected one after another. Many shared economic derivatives and shared brands have been born. However, under the rapid development of the sharing economy, problems such as incompatibility with the institutional environment have emerged. This paper takes shared bicycle as an example to analyze the current situation of domestic shared bicycle operation and learn from the successful experience of foreign shared bicycle operation and then put forward the specific countermeasures for the sustainable development of domestic shared bicycle.

AB Information and communication technology (ICT) has transformed our consumption patterns. The widespread use of smart devices has enabled practicing a wide variety of "sharing economy" activities, a development that brings new ways of resource consumption to our everyday life. The increasing participation in sharing economy activities calls for studies that research the sustainability of this new consumption trend. Although the concept is associated with a more collaborative resource consumption, this may in practice be limited to some resources being shared. The present paper sets the stage for better understanding of the ICT-enabled sharing economy in the context of environmental sustainability. In this work, we present a line of thought that starts with perceiving resource sharing as the core of the sharing economy and continue with a sustainability analysis using a conceptual framework of ICT impacts on sustainability. This study provides a first step towards conceptualizing the sharing economy in a sustainability context and delineates further analysis of the sustainability of digital sharing.

TI A systematic literature review of AI in the sharing economy
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SCHOLARS OF MARKETING SCIENCE
AB Although artificial intelligence (AI) has been adopted in sharing economy platforms, few studies have investigated this phenomenon in this context. Consequently, there is no thorough overview of how AI has been used in the sharing economy. To address this research gap, a systematic literature review was performed for this paper. This method can be useful for the exploration of new and emerging trends within disciplines and allows boundaries to be mapped on what is known thereby identifying gaps on what is yet to be known. After screening, 28 English journal articles were selected in a qualitative synthesis. Results show AI can help the sharing economy platforms by enhancing trust, matching assets, and understanding participants' preferences and attitudes. Based on these findings, potential directions are established. The current study will contribute to both the sharing economy and AI literature, and the results may help practitioners and academia to achieve a greater understanding of this topic.

TI The institutionalization of sharing economy platforms in China
SO JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT
AB Recent past has witnessed a great proliferation of sharing economy platforms with great successes, but also many failures on their journey toward institutionalization, that is, their establishment and acceptance in society. To develop insight on factors contributing to this institutionalization process, this paper relies on the literature in institutional entrepreneurship and investigates sharing economy platforms in China, highlighting institutional voids that are encountered, and suggesting ways on how they can be overcome. These insights are derived through a multiple case study approach involving 61 semi-structured interviews with managers from eight sharing economy platforms (DiDi, Uber China, Huochebang, Yunmanman, OfO, Mobike, Evcard, and Zhida) across four sharing economy industries in China (ride-sharing, logistics-sharing, bike-sharing, and car-sharing). The findings highlight the importance of exchange and collaboration with stakeholders (allies) in the network, as well as the effective response to emerging issues through the adaptation of the business models. In addition, mergers and acquisitions, and the role of government are identified as critical components in aiding platforms in their progression toward institutionalization. Further cognitive, regulative, and normative factors are found to represent valuable institutional pillars that serve as a fertile foundation throughout the institutionalization process. Overall, the findings provide an intriguing insight into the journey of Chinese sharing economy platforms toward institutionalization.

TI DEVELOPMENT OF SHARING ECONOMY-BASED BUSINESS MODELS IN THE TOURISM
   SECTOR
SO MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT OF INNOVATIONS
AB The sharing economy is rapidly gaining popularity, especially in the tourism sector. The sharing economy transforms functioning business models, giving businesses new economic activities and development opportunities. However, while sharing economy-based models are spreading in the world, not only the advantages but also the disadvantages are seen. This paper summarizes the arguments within the scientific discussion on the economic characteristics of sharing economy. It identifies the actions determining the development of sharing economy in the tourism sector. Since it is known that the sharing economy is developing rapidly, the development o f the sharing economy is usually analyzed as a whole, regardless of the different sectors. However, the developmen t of the sharing economy in the tourism sector is found to be the fastest. Besides, there is the largest number of stakeholders. Systematization of scientific treatises and approaches concerning the investigated issue indicated tha t the main drivers for the sharing economy development in the tourism sector are the Internet and technology among tourists, the cyclical nature of the economy, the change of societal values, and environmental friendliness. The methodological base of this research was secondary data analysis. The research empirically confirmed and theoretically proved that the sharing economy in the tourism sector develops rapidly, attracts more and more consumers in the tourism sector, and outpaces traditional business models. The obtained results could be used for analyzing the most favorable conditions to develop new business models in the market, analyze the response of market participants (consumers and traditional business model), promote new business initiatives in the tourism sector, research the sharing economy phenomenon in narrower tourism (transport, entertainment, and touris t information platforms).

Started as a movement with promises of a more sustainable, democratic, and inclusive economy, the sharing economy, and its impact on issues such as privacy, discrimination, worker rights, and regulation, is now the subject of heated debate. Many of these issues root in the changes that digital technologies have brought and the unresolved moral and ethical questions emerging therefrom. This special issue contributes to this ongoing debate with five articles that develop theoretical frameworks and conduct empirical investigations, providing fine-grained analyses of urgent issues in the sharing economy. In this article, we highlight these and other issues that we believe deserve further attention from business ethics scholarship.

TI Sharing Economy in the Dimension of Sustainability and Trust
SO SOSYOEKONOMI
AB The factors such as how consumers buy things and where they buy products have changed in parallel with the development of mobile internet technologies. Digital interactions among individuals have gained strength thanks to the internet, in which social networks increase interactions. A new economic approach called sharing economy has emerged thanks to these strong interactions. Individuals prefer to temporarily own goods or services rather than permanently via digital sharing platforms. In this context, it is observed that resources are utilised efficiently to meet specific needs. In this way, it can be said that the formation of idle resources is reduced significantly. Sharing economy is examined conceptually based on sustainability and trust. And also, the effect of Covid-19 on the ecosystem of sharing economy and what sorts of ramifications Covid-19 created for sharing economy are examined.

TI Navigating through difficult times with ethical marketing: Assessing
   consumers? willingness-to-pay in the sharing economy
SO JOURNAL OF RETAILING AND CONSUMER SERVICES
AB The pandemic has severely disrupted the activity and economic growth of co-working spaces, ridesharing, couch surfing, and other services known collectively as the "sharing economy." Academicians and managers are exploring and experimenting with various strategies to recover losses, build meaningful connections with consumers, and optimize consumer engagement. As the sharing economy strives to recover from pandemic-induced losses, it is crucial to consider factors that might help sharing-economy firms navigate through difficult times. Moreover, value-co creation has been addressed previously in sharing economy research as a unidimensional construct with constrained applicability. Guided by the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) framework, the present study focuses on ethical marketing as a strategy for identifying consumer responses-including value cocreation, self-brand connection, and consumers' willingness to pay-that may benefit sharing-economy firms. We have collected the empirical data from n = 403 consumers in the sharing economy. Analyses through structural equation modelling tests reveal that ethical marketing influence value co-creation, self-brand connection, and consumers' willingness to pay. Contrary to our expectations, value co-creation has no influence on consumers' willingness to pay; however, the relationship between value co-creation and consumers' willingness to pay is fully mediated by self-brand connection. Based on empirical results, this study contributes to existing theoretical knowledge regarding ethical marketing and value co-creation literature in the sharing economy and proposes practical implications, including how consumers would be willing to co-create value, establish a self-brand connection, and are more likely to pay in response to ethical marketing.

TI Learning to share: Pedagogy, open learning, and the sharing economy
SO SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW
AB The sharing economy is fertile sociological ground for studying important themes like labor, exchange, consumption, and inequality, as well as larger political-economic trends that are reflective of this post-recession era. The multifaceted research agenda of the sharing economy can provide lessons around many themes relevant to sociologists, but what does the sharing economy teach to those who participate in it? What is learned from the sharing economy and how do participants lawn it? In this article, the author explores the pedagogic elements of one case study within the sharing economy: open learning. Drawing from 51 interviews with 34 participants and roughly 300 hours of participant observation, the study uses Bernstein's theory of pedagogic discourse to ask how open learners learn to share. The author argues that an ethos of communalism and cooperativism dominated moral discourse for learners and regulated social order. Entrepreneurialism was learned through a flexible sociality, where participants contributed to each other's learning as a means of validating and legitimizing that learning. The need to contribute or give back was taken for granted by participants, who felt compelled to give their own expertise or labor to the commons after taking something from it. This study depicts a tension between a neoliberal entrepreneurial frame and a communalist, cooperativist frame that is also present within the larger sharing economy. The author suggests that a similar pedagogic approach that asks how participants learn to share could be developed in the larger sharing economy in order to better understand learning and economic relations as two sides of the same coin in contemporary capitalism.

TI Digital literacy and survival mechanism of micro-small enterprises in
   practicing sharing economy
SO COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, Micro-Small Enterprises (MSEs) have faced severe challenges and many are on the brink of collapse. To address this issue, this study investigates the survival mechanisms of MSEs in the digital economy platform, including the barriers they encounter when adapting to sharing economy practices. Additionally, the study examines the digital literacy capabilities of MSE actors and the extent to which these capabilities impact the continuity of businesses involved in the sharing economy. Using a descriptive research approach with 300 MSE actors in East Java Province as respondents, this study reveals that, aside from receiving financial assistance, digitization is essential for MSEs to avoid failure. MSE actors, who previously relied solely on traditional channels for product marketing, are now compelled to use digital platforms and encouraged to participate in sharing economy practices. The study indicates that, despite the perceived benefits of MSE actors' engagement in the sharing economy practice, the profit earned must be shared with the application owner, without any guarantee of proportionality to the risks they bear. Digital transformation, however, presents a unique opportunity for both new and established MSE actors to upgrade their businesses. Notably, online promotion is much more accessible and cost-effective, with options such as Instagram, Facebook, and Google Business. Nevertheless, the readiness of MSE actors to adopt digital transformation is uneven, as some possess outdated gadgets and inadequate digital literacy. Therefore, digital literacy training for MSE actors is a crucial need.

AB Online car-hailing has successfully integrated the sharing economy into the transportation industry. However, with its rapid development, service issues remain a challenge, and continuously improving service quality is a key factor for the sustainable growth of online car-hailing and the sharing economy. In this study, we implement LSTM text classification, sentiment analysis and frequent itemset mining of the electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) of the online car-hailing platform, Didi Chuxing (DiDi), to identify existing service issues. Then, we depict the service process network of online car-hailing by using process chain network (PCN) to analyze and locate service issues. Finally, we analyze service optimization and innovation for online car-hailing by proposing corresponding service quality optimization suggestions based on the optimization principles of PCN. By constructing a service quality management research framework of online car-hailing in the sharing economy, we contribute to the literature on service science and the sharing economy and provide practical implications for sharing economy platforms to establish data-driven strategies of operation management.

They analyze Airbnb's entry into the state of Texas and quantify its impact on the Texas hotel industry over the subsequent decade. In Austin, where Airbnb supply is highest, the causal impact on hotel revenue is in the 8%-10% range; moreover, the impact is nonuniform, with lowerpriced hotels and hotels that do not cater to business travelers being the most affected. The impact manifests itself primarily through less aggressive hotel room pricing, benefiting all consumers, not just participants in the sharing economy. The price response is especially pronounced during periods of peak demand, such as during the South by Southwest festival, and is due to a differentiating feature of peerto-peer platforms-enabling instantaneous supply to scale to meet demand.

TI Cooperative platforms as an attempt to revise the corporate model of
   sharing economy
SO E-MENTOR
AB Sharing economy was supposed to be a phenomenon leading to a reform of the socio-economic system. However, monetization of work performed by online communities collaborating towards creation and maintenance of portals such as Uber and Airbnb triggered the formation of a model of capitalism which rests upon the idea of corporation as a broker in transactions between individual providers and the recipients of services. The adverse effects of, "platform capitalism", i.e., excessive concentration of ownership and relaxation of employment, have led to a countermovement, namely platform co-operativism. This article analyses the phenomenon of platform cooperativism, that is, the movement which aims at revising the current direction of the development of sharing economy by suggesting an alternative, socially-distributed ownership and management model. In order to achieve that, we expose the main tensions accompanying the expansion of sharing economy which is interpreted as a "double movement" in Karl Polanyi's terminology, or public opposition to the commodification of further spheres of social life. We contend that the tensions between corporate sharing economy and platform cooperatives touch upon issues critical to economic theory, such as the boundaries of work, management and profit distribution, as well as the meaning of innovation.

TI Building trust in the sharing economy: Current approaches and future
   considerations
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The sharing economy could be an answer to the challenge of sustainability; it can facilitate the sharing and reuse of resources, create new ways of earning money, and enhance social connections. For example, by reducing the use of natural resources without having to acquire or own everything, the sharing economy can positively affect sustainability. At the core of this type of economy lies trust among users and between users and the platformdthe system cannot reach its full potential without trust. In fact, businesses or organizations in the sharing economy can even fail due to trust issues, although more information is needed to make better use of the existing platforms. The aim of this systematic literature review is to study how trust is built in the sharing economy. For this purpose, we introduce 28 solutions to support trust in sharing economy platforms, develop a preliminary model for evaluating trust in this context, and present a few considerations for future research. Platform developers and managers can use our preliminary model to identify trust issues in their platforms. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The sharing economy is known as collaborative consumption or the peer-to-peer based activity of acquiring, providing, or sharing goods and services. To improve the consumer-based sharing economy, researchers study customer reviews about their experiences of provided services. Expectation-confirmation theory (ECT) suggests that customers use mental comparison standards to evaluate the real performance of provided services, which ultimately influences customer satisfaction. Recommendations made in customer reviews have emerged as a critical feature of a business-to-consumer website, however there is a lack of empirical evidence supporting their influence on customer satisfaction. In this study, we contribute to the sharing economy knowledge base by adding a consumer recommendation component to the original EC.

AB No clear, univocal distinction between the phenomena of "crowdfunding", "crowdsourcing" and "sharing economy" emerges from an analysis of the literature. For example, the term "crowdfunding" appears to be used incorrectly to designate other processes of "crowdsourcing" or, more generally, "sharing economy". The research goal, after carrying out a more detailed analysis of the individual phenomena, is to offer a more precise outline of the characteristics of "crowdfunding" by identifying the needs that it satisfies.

SO SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW
AB This essay introduces the subject and interpretative perspective of the monograph 'Unboxing the Sharing Economy', and is divided into three parts. The first part illustrates the evolution of the concept of the 'sharing economy' and the main analytical implications. The second part outlines the key findings of a systematic review of the literature, which indicates both that academic research on the sharing economy has expanded considerably since 2013, and that sociology's contribution to this debate remains underdeveloped and somewhat incoherent. The final part both locates the contributions to the monograph in the context of other studies and summarizes its content.

AB Sharing economy as one of the Circular economy business models has great potential in reducing the need for physical assets whilst at the same time increasing the availability of different services. The Sharing economy does not require giving up the benefits and conveniences of using material assets because of more efficiency, but as a side effect; it also causes an increase in the consumption of goods and services provided. This paper discusses the benefits of the Sharing economy and how problems induced by it can be solved. The aim of the research is to discover drivers and obstacles in developing the Sharing economy and suggest solutions. We use literature study, observations and consumer survey as the research methods. The findings of this research suggest that the main drivers to engage in the Sharing economy are the opportunities to save or earn money. The main obstacles are worries about personal safety and mistreatment by platform members. We suggest building trust between sharing platform members, providing a system of credible reviews about service providers and users, as well as providing more comprehensive information about sharing platforms to enable further development of the Sharing economy. Clear rules should exist for participants in a collaborative economy to separate sharing activities from illegal entrepreneurship and set a fair tax system. The results of the study can help to develop better sharing platforms and for policy makers to work out suitable regulation of the Sharing economy.

TI Performing the sharing economy
SO GEOFORUM
AB The sharing economy converges around activities facilitated through digital platforms that enable peer-to-peer access to goods and services. It constitutes an apparent paradox, framed as both part of the capitalist economy and as an alternative. This duplicity necessitates focusing on the performances of the sharing economy: how it simultaneously constructs diverse economic activities whilst also inviting the deconstruction of ongoing practices of dominance. Such performances hold open the question of what the (sharing) economy is, suspending it as a space for both opportunity and critique. Drawing on participant observation at a sharing economy 'festival' and analysis of the vocabularies of online platforms, the paper outlines three performances of sharing through community, access and collaboration. It argues through these performances that the sharing economy is contingent and complexly articulated. It has the potential to both shake up and further entrench 'business-as-usual' through the ongoing reconfiguration of a divergent range of (economic) activities. Whilst offering an antidote to the narrative of economy as engendering isolation and separation, the sharing economy simultaneously masks new forms of inequality and polarisations of ownership. Nonetheless, the paper concludes in suggesting that by pointing to wider questions concerning participation in, access to and production of resources, the sharing economy should not be dismissed. Instead, it should serve as prompt to engage with 'digital' transformations of economy in the spirit of affirmative critique that might enact the promise of doing economy differently.

TI How retailer ownership of vs. collaboration with sharing economy apps
   affects anticipated service quality and value co-creation
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB The sharing economy has disrupted the retailing industry by increasing competition as an emerging platform of service innovation. Today's retailing is transforming to play a role in the sharing economy as consumers can complete transactions more easily among one another. However, it is unclear whether retailers should own sharing economy platforms or partner with other, independently owned platforms. Thus, the purpose of this research is to better understand how retailer involvement in the sharing economy (i.e., ownership of vs. collaboration with sharing economy apps) affects anticipated service quality and value co-creation. The current study examines the effects of retailer ownership vs. collaboration on service quality and customer value co-creation, respectively, and documents perceived credibility as an important mediator. The findings suggest that full ownership (vs. collaboration with an independent app) can lead customers to anticipate higher service quality and greater value co-creation due to higher perceived credibility.

TI Leveraging Consumption Intention with Identity Information on Sharing
   Economy Platforms
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Sharing economy platforms enable individuals to collaboratively consume underutilized resources by linking peer-providers and peer-consumers. One interesting observation on sharing economy platforms is unprecedented amount and use of identity information about peer-providers. Peer-providers offer rich information about themselves, and a sub-set of such identity information is verified on some sharing economy platforms. However, there has been little research on such identity information sharing and the impacts of such information on peer-consumers' decision making. In this study, we propose a research model to explain the role of identify information on sharing economy platforms, and empirically test the proposed model in the context of a lodging service sharing economy platform, Airbnb. Our results show that identity information shared by peer-providers contributes to peer-consumers' consumption intention through social presence and trust. The implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.

TI Sharing Economy and New Business Model Development Based on Internet of
   Things Big Data
SO MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB The sharing economy and new business models have emerged as a result of the economy's rapid growth in recent years. The sharing economy and innovative business models have enabled people to transact with one another, saving both time and money. The growth has been aided by the introduction of IoT big data. This study will look at how to use big data from the Internet of Things to examine the growth of the sharing economy and new business models. This study proposes a BP neural network algorithm based on the big data of the Internet of Things (IoT), which can not only effectively classify a large amount of data in the sharing economy but also predict the development direction of the sharing economy and new business models. The experimental results of this study show that the economic benefit of shared office in 2017 is 11 billion yuan, and the economic benefit of shared office in 2018 is 20.6 billion yuan, an increase of 87.3% in 2018 compared with 2017. The economic benefit of knowledge and skills in 2017 was 138.2 billion yuan, and the economic benefit of shared office in 2018 was 235.3 billion yuan, an increase of 70.3% in 2018 compared with 2017. It can be seen that the economic benefits brought by the sharing economy to the country are very high, and there is also a lot of room for growth. Therefore, based on the background of IoT big data, it is essential to conduct research on the development of sharing economy and new business models.

AB The paper discusses the topic of sharing of digital content as part of a sharing economy. The phenomenon of last decade is the sharing economy. Originally, the sharing in offline communities was replaced by the sharing in online communities. The most famous are areas such as accommodation services or transport services. One of the area of the sharing economy is the sharing of digital content (especially movies, music, electronic books etc.). This area interferes with the lives of almost every one of us, especially the digitally literate people of the younger generation. The described research shows the extreme involvement of the young generation (secondary and primary school pupils) in sharing digital content. Other analyses also show key players on the Czech market. Research has shown that, although a perfectly competitive environment could be expected, it is not. Although there are no formal barriers to entry, digital content sharing is characterized by a monopoly or oligopolistic position. A specific problem area is the issue of the legality of the sharing digital content, especially these days when the new EU directive came into force and EU Member States should implement it in national legislation.

TI Blessing or curse? Sharing economy and its impact on the community of
   customers and suppliers
SO DECISION SCIENCES
AB Sharing economy offers an alternative to customers with on-demand services and opens up a new way for owners of underutilized resources to generate revenue. However, there is little evidence on whether sharing economy benefits the community of customers and suppliers or not. Our work is motivated by the ongoing stories of conflicts related to the ride sharing platforms (e.g., Uber, Lyft) and the information we collected from industry practitioners. We propose an economic model that describes how a price manipulating ride sharing platform crowdsources and matches supply to demand. Furthermore, our model captures how sharing economy's manipulative power impacts the community of customers and suppliers. Sharing economy platforms allow customers to make purchase decisions after evaluating the search cost, which depends on other customers' purchase decisions and leads to endogenous demand for sharing economy services. A comprehensive theoretical analysis of such models can be extremely challenging due to the endogenous demand. However, we provide such analysis by assuming that the customers evaluate the search cost with the estimated or "exogenous" demand instead of the realized or "endogenous" demand. Moreover, we support our theoretical findings in more realistic settings by performing various numerical analyses. Our results suggest that the financial objective of sharing economy may conflict with the welfare of the affected community, which can be mitigated by government regulations that impose upper bounds on price surges. Our work helps researchers, practitioners, and public policy makers more comprehensively understand the challenges that sharing economy brings and suggests possible regulatory intervention.

TI Just transitions through digitally enabled sharing economies?
SO ERDE
AB Digital technologies have become central to social interaction and accessing goods and services. Development strategies and approaches to governance have increasingly deployed self-labelled 'smart' technologies and systems at various spatial scales, often promoted as rectifying social and geographic inequalities and increasing economic and environmental efficiencies. These have also been accompanied with similarly digitalized commercial and non-profit offers, particularly within the sharing economy. Concern has grown, however, over possible inequalities linked to their introduction. In this paper we critically analyse the role of sharing economies' contribution to more inclusive, socially equitable and spatially just transitions. Conceptually, this paper brings together literature on sharing economies, smart urbanism and just transitions. Drawing on an explorative database of sharing initiatives within the cross-border region of Luxembourg and Germany, we discuss aspects of sustainability as they relate to distributive justice through spatial accessibility, intended benefits, and their operationalization. The regional analysis shows the diversity of sharing models, how they are appropriated in different ways and how intent and operationalization matter in terms of potential benefits. Results emphasize the need for more fine-grained, qualitative research revealing who is, and is not, participating and benefitting from sharing economies.

The regulation of the network car should jump out of the traditional taxi-based regulation idea, and "start another stove" to find a balance between respecting technological innovation and government regulation of the market. At the same time, the relevant specifications of the network car should be both the enterprise regulation law and the enterprise promotion law, not just the regulation law. It is necessary to distinguish between full-time network vehicles and part-time network vehicles, and to establish access standards and regulatory measures, and to adjust the quantity and price of the network vehicles to the market.

AB This paper offers a holistic review of the role of big data analytics in sharing economy (SE). Academic literature in this field is analyzed to show the theoretical foundation, important papers, and key themes underlying the field by using various bibliometric analysis tools. We conduct a citation and co-citation analysis on literature concerning big data analytics in sharing economy, which published in the 12-year period from 2010-2021. A total of 205 papers were screened from Web of Science (WoS) database for our analysis. In the citation analysis, we depend on the degree centrality and betweenness centrality to identify 48 important papers. In the co-citation analysis, four major research themes are identified: sustainable business model, efficient match-making, trust building and innovation and value cocreation. The research also highlights future research directions and critical areas for the application of big data analytics in the SE context, which may help to produce in-depth studies.

Findings point out a seamless, unobtrusive pattern echoing characteristics of the sharing economy business model across distant sectors to avoid competition while reproducing activities in ever-new resource settings. The paper continues the exploration of the sharing economy related to industrial marketing through moving from the individual platforms to the way they lead to new ones while acknowledging how the innovative model for new platforms is highly based on mandates created through acknowledging oneself as a role model successor. Such a spread mechanism redefines innovation newness, adaptation and diffusion, and raises new insights to understand how current business landscapes would be under the possible transition into a new logic of operations.

TI Sharing Economy vs Sharing Cultures? Designing for social, economic and
   environmental good
SO INTERACTION DESIGN AND ARCHITECTURES
AB This paper explores the story behind a crowdfunding service as an example of sharing technology. Research in a small neighborhood of London showed how locally-developed initiatives can differ in tone, scale, ambition and practice to those getting attention in the so-called sharing economy. In local accounts, we see an emphasis on organizing together to create shared spaces for collaborative use of resources and joint ownership of projects and places. Whereas, many global business models feature significant elements of renting, leasing and hiring and focus only on resource management, sometimes at the expense of community growth. The service we discuss is based in the area we studied and has a collective model of sharing, but hopes to be part of the new global movement. We use this hybridity to problematize issues of culture, place and scalability in developing sharing resources and addressing sustainability concerns. We relate this to the motivation, rhetoric and design choices of other local sharing enterprises and other global sharing economy initiatives, arguing, in conclusion, that there is no sharing economy, but a variety of new cultures being fostered.

TI Capturing the dynamics of the sharing economy: Institutional research on
   the plural forms and practices of sharing economy organizations
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB To date, management research has paid little attention to dynamics of the sharing economy: how markets for sharing resources emerge and change, and the intended and unintended consequences of resource sharing. We propose a definition of the sharing economy that brings the role of organizations as infrastructure providers to the fore and helps us to assess the culturally rooted pluralism of forms and practices in these organizations. We introduce two perspectives in research on organizational institutionalism that focus on culture and pluralism institutional complexity and institutional work and argue that unpacking the pluralism of organizational forms and practices is critical to examine the dynamics of the sharing economy. We propose an agenda for research to capture the dynamics of the sharing economy at the organizational, field, and inter-field level. Such an agenda helps to document and analyze how the sharing economy manifests and evolves across various economic systems and has the potential to refine and recast existing management theory.

TI A springboard for entrepreneurs? Gig and sharing economy and
   entrepreneurship in Russia
SO JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB Purpose The growing popularity of gig and sharing economy changes not only consumption models but also employment patterns. This study aims to analyze the potential entrepreneurial nature of gig and sharing economy initiatives. As such, the authors compare the entrepreneurial intentions of gig and sharing economy workers to the general population. Further, the authors consider commonalities and differences in terms of the driving forces of both intentions to start-up and participation in gig and sharing economy, treating them as connected phenomena. Finally, the authors look into gig and sharing economy experience as a direct antecedent to entrepreneurial intentions formation. Design/methodology/approach The empirical settings for this study are derived from the sample of 1,257 individuals who participated in the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Adult Population Survey 2018 in Russia. Methodologically, the authors rely on analysis of variance-test and binary logistic regression analysis to test the study hypotheses. Findings The results indicate that entrepreneurial intentions of gig and sharing economy workers are significantly higher when compared to the general population. In terms of antecedents to gig and sharing economy participation and startup intentions, similar effects of age, entrepreneurial social capital, prior entrepreneurial exit and intrapreneurial experience were revealed, while perceived self-efficacy was associated only with engagement into digital platforms. Finally, gig and sharing economy experience showed significant and positive effect on entrepreneurial intentions formation. Originality/value This study represents a first substantive effort to systematize antecedents to gig and sharing economy participation through an entrepreneurship perspective. Beyond that, this research adds to the contextualization of entrepreneurship literature stream, further defining the mechanism of entrepreneurial intentions formation in empirical settings of an emerging market with a relatively low propensity of population to develop intentions to start-up.

TI FROM OFFLINE TO ONLINE COLLABORATION: THEORETICAL APPROACH ON HUMAN
   COOPERATION STUDIES AND THE SHARING ECONOMY
SO REVISTA DE COMUNICACION DE LA SEECI
AB Since the mid-60's, several scientific approaches based on social experiments, observational techniques and ethnographic methodologies have been issued seeking to explore and understand (offline) human behaviours in terms of cooperation and community building as well as selfish rational actions. However, over the last decade, an innovative socio-economic system, technologically driven and entirely based on online platforms, the sharing economy, appears to disrupt stablished manners of collaboration. This study considers that, given the novelty of the sharing economy, there is still a lack of empirical studies attempting to compare and connect both offline and online forms of acting together. Thus, the main goal of this paper is to understand to what extent relevant theories on human cooperation, formulated from 1965 onwards, might be suitable for explaining the collaborative behaviour of the digitally driven sharing economy.

AB Advances in computer science prompt the creation of new economic models. One of them in urban life is Sharing Economy. This new economic model receives high attentions and has been applied to a wide range of fields in recent years. We argue that sharing economy, and its applications, may be taken as a way for researchers to understand human behavior, and thus this paper targets a growing issue on the relationship between sharing economy and its impacts on human behavior. It especially looks at the change of behaviors while the sharing economy comes into our daily lives. The Airbnb, one of the most significant examples of sharing economy, is taken as a starting point of this survey, and results are revealed that young generation tends to accept this new economic experience as well as willing to be involved, not only as traveler but host, in this new phenomenon.

TI Social and ecological approaches in urban interfaces: A sharing economy
   management framework
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB Urban interfaces have undergone changes due to the population growth and business models brought about by the sharing economy. The sharing economy benefits many sectors of society. Sustainable practices, servitisation, and disruptive technologies work together with the sharing economy to improve the sustainable value chains. This research study proposes a sharing economy management framework with social and ecological approaches in urban interfaces. The literature review was developed between October 24th, 2018 and March 19th, 2019. The first stage of the search was based on the terms "share OR sharing" and "sustainability OR sustainable." In the second stage, the search was based on the terms "share OR sharing" AND "sustainability OR sustainable." Based on the literature review, the authors created seven sustainable sharing factors: landscape, mobility, knowledge, production and consumption, sustainable practices, digital, and geographical which are the foundations of the management framework. The connections between these sustainable sharing factors can help to create sustainable value chains. The authors conclude that this connection is based on the need for digital insertion and disruptive technologies, enabling the sharing of knowledge and the support of new transportation models. Sustainable practices also enhance this connection, encouraging responsible production and consumption together with other factors. This transformation impacts the variables of the landscape factor. The management framework presents the analysis of the sustainable sharing factors and the social and ecological approaches in the urban interfaces. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

SO CURRENT ISSUES IN TOURISM
AB Despite the popularity of entrepreneurship in tourism and hospitality and the increasing usage of meal-sharing economy platforms by locals, there is no research combining both in the extant literature. This research ascertains the main entrepreneurship motivations in the meal-sharing economy platforms. To attain our aim, a qualitative research approach was adopted, and thirteen interviews were conducted with service providers in the meal-sharing economy platforms. The data was examined through thematic analysis. As a result of the inspection, two main motives and eight sub-dimensions were determined: social and cultural motives (e.g. the gratification of hosting, altruism, source of cultural capital and, social interaction) and economic motives (e.g. monetary, facilitators, network, and independence). Theoretical implications were discussed as well as limitations and future research lines.

Hence, this paper seeks to explore family experiences of the daily local-guided tours offered on a sharing economy platform, Withlocals, utilizing online narratives. To attain this aim, this study applies netnography approach and involves a total of 867 family experience reviews. As a result of the analysis, eight components revealed: local guides' attributes, awe, learning, memorable, child-friendly activities, engaging tour members, family-friendly tips, and novelty. The outcomes serve as indicators for local guides in addressing the essentials and expectations in family local-guided experience. As well as having practical implications, the results yield valuable theoretical insights for family tourism literature by opening a new door for future studies.

TI Is the Sharing Economy a Field? How a Disruptive Field Nurtures Sharing
   Economy Organizations
SO THEORIZING THE SHARING ECONOMY:VARIETY AND TRAJECTORIES OF NEW FORMS OF
   ORGANIZING
SE Research in the Sociology of Organizations
AB Is the sharing economy a field? Answering this question is crucial to understanding how sharing organizations look and behave, as well as how the sharing economy might develop. In this chapter, the authors applied two different field conceptions - organizational field and issue field - as a starting point for an explorative empirical analysis. To capture both field concepts, the authors collected relational data and data on organizations' self-representations to see how organizations engaged in the debate on the sharing economy relate to each other. The observed network of organizations suggests that the sharing economy is an issue field. In addition, the core of this network shows the relational structure of an organizational field. Surprisingly, it is not an organizational field of the sharing economy. Instead, it is a field of organizations heavily engaged in proselytizing new organizational forms that will change other fields. What the authors observed is a new field configuration - the authors call it a disruptive field - that is, less inward-oriented than other fields but much more engaged in changing other fields' structures and dynamics. With these insights, the authors contribute to institutional research on field configuration and shed light on the phenomenon of the sharing economy and its potential development.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURIAL VENTURING
AB The sharing economy has received increased attention in entrepreneurship research, resulting in a complex research landscape that is hard to overlook. Using a bibliometric analysis, we aim to further synthesise the field by: 1) summarising the most important definitions given by extant literature to capture the common understanding of the sharing economy; 2) identifying three thematic clusters based on the top 20 most cited publications; 3) conducting a citation analysis to show interdependencies between all authors; and 4) identifying the research methods used in the SE publications. Our results show: 1) many definitions with different emphases; 2) conceptualisation, collaborative consumption/ownership and the disruptive character of the sharing economy as three dominant research clusters; 3) a fairly even citation practice allowing for unbiased future research; and 4) that conceptual publications and quantitative as well as qualitative studies are fairly evenly published.

TI Sharing with perfect strangers: The effects of self-disclosure on
   consumers' trust, risk perception, and behavioral intention in the
   sharing economy
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB The transactional and disposable nature of liquid consumption has placed trust as the lifeblood of sharing economy service innovation, enabling billions of strangers across the globe to connect and share in the face of transaction risks. However, managers and service providers may not realize that self-disclosure acts as a basis to build trust and mitigate risk in the sharing economy. In four studies across different nations, we demonstrate that service providers' self-disclosure not only generates consumer trust but also reduces their risk perception, which subsequently encourages legitimate transactions on sharing platforms. The findings reveal that when consumers and service providers are objectively similar, consumers do not pay much attention to service providers' disclosed information. Conversely, in the case of objective dissimilarity, consumers are more attentive to personal and intimate information shared by service providers. Consumer self-esteem plays differential moderating roles in the link between service providers' self-disclosure and consumer responses.

   Social Influence on Airbnb
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Despite a multitude of studies on the motivators of sharing economy participation, we understand little about how cultural and social drivers affect an individual's use of sharing services on an online platform. This paper examines the influence of cultural and social factors on a consumer's participation in a sharing economy. We used Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory and Ajzen's theory of planned behavior to formulate the research model to predict the behavioral intention to book an accommodation using the Airbnb platform. To test the model, an empirical study was conducted by collecting survey data on Amazon Mturk from 401 participants. Findings provide evidence that all the cultural dimensions except for masculinity were found to have significant relationship with attitude toward booking on Airbnb. Moreover, social influence has no significant effect on booking intention on Airbnb. We offered academic and practical implications and suggested future research directions based on our findings.

The findings suggest that travellers do not use Airbnb because of distrust in the providers, in the platform and in other users, as well as perceived risk and unfamiliarity. Loss of service quality, lack of local experience, legal and regulatory issues, and disinterest also prevented consumers to book Airbnb accommodations. A cluster analysis divided nonusers into three segments: Traditional travellers, Sharing economy misbelievers and Airbnb prospective users. Significant differences based on age confirmed that young travellers are more confident in using peer-to-peer accommodation platforms and more interested in the philosophy.

TI Indian Travellers' Adoption of Airbnb Platform
SO INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS
AB Much of the existing scholarly debate on sharing economy to date has focused on the use of technology in developed countries. However, the recent upsurge of mobile technology adoption in developing countries has provided suitable breeding ground for sharing economy. The lack of native theories in tourism and hospitality sector with scare utilization of unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) provide necessity for this research. This study adapted meta-UTAUT model as theoretical lens and extended the model with hedonic motivation, trust, and self-efficacy. Based on data from 301 potential Indian consumers, the results underscored the central role of attitude that significantly mediated the effects of effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions on consumer intention to use Airbnb. Meanwhile, performance expectancy emerged as significant direct determinant of intention alongside attitude, trust, and self-efficacy. The proposed model explained as much as 65% variance on Indian consumer's intention to use Airbnb.

TI Terms of reference: The moral economy of reputation in a sharing economy
   platform
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL THEORY
AB Reputation is often seen as central to the coordination of transactions in sharing economy platforms. Participants perform a double role regarding reputation management: while engaging in exchanges with other peers, they build their individual reputation capital' and simultaneously execute community oversight. In Couchsurfing (CS), a network often cited as paradigmatic of the sharing economy, there is, however, a clear bias for positive references. In the digital economy literature, participants' friendly behaviour is understood as motivated by self-interest and an incentive to maintain a positive reputation. Social research on reputation in CS attributes the bias to fear of retaliation, but also hints at norms of reciprocity leading travellers to require positive feedback for hospitality. This article analyses the lived experience of reputation management in CS and argues that participants seek to reconcile direct and general reciprocity. It proposes breaking these practices down into boundary-work and creative avoidance and argues these result in insufficient protection of inexperienced participants against problematic members.

AB In the digital age, a number of sharing activities have emerged and are forecast to accelerate further. According to experts' estimations, the value of the sharing economy will increase 23 times worldwide. The main reason for this success is that all sectors of the population are involved in the practices of the sharing economy and participate in it to a greater or lesser extent. The examples of the most well-known and successful businesses with a small number of employees show that companies often achieve the best results if they utilize sharing technologies. Researchers and practitioners argue that the sharing economy creates new advantages and potential sources of revenue and profit which include expanding markets, the willingness of customers to pay more in order to get higher quality goods and services, and lack of governmental regulation that allows sharing businesses to act with relative freedom and without limitations. According to the statistics, 44% of sharing businesses fail after 5 years of work. Only 10% of sharing companies stay in the market after 10 years of their activity. In the view of the experts, one of the main reasons for it is a wrong business model chosen by companies. It can be concluded that sharing economy startups should focus more on possible risks related to their market entry. The purpose of the paper is to identify failures of on-demand sharing economy business startups at the A series around the world. In order to collect and systemize data about the most significant international sharing economy startups for the period from 2001 to 2018, we used CrunchBase and Business of Apps platforms. At the next stage, we employed a case study method to describe businesses' activities by using companies' sites which made possible to identify strengths and weaknesses in their business models. Then the Business Model Canvas has been used to provide visualization of the business model and describe links between various segments of the organization. We utilized Canvanizer online software to create Business Models Canvas that allowed us to reflect the most typical failures of the sharing businesses. In total 126 failed sharing economy companies were investigated. We identified critical challenges and problems they faced and found the most typical mistakes which led them to failure. The following mistakes have been identified and presented as Business Models Canvas: lack of strong networks, underestimation of local culture, unwillingness to work on technologically undeveloped market, failure to use pioneer business models/ technologies/ services/ goods, reluctance to be able to revenue-generating from the first day, inability to have scalable effect (business model, goods, services); unclear regulatory framework. Based on the investigation we can propose some areas of improvement in this field: utilizing Business Models Canvas to plan sharing economy business; investigation of not only best practices of successful sharing economy companies but also their failure experience; starting business it is worth changing the existing business model constantly even if you have achieved sustainable development.

AB Promoting the principles of circular economy and the new business models advocated by the circular economy can represent a solution for a more prosperous society, less dependent on primary and energy resources and more environmentally friendly. The sharing economy, which primarily involves the transformation of traditional market behaviors into collaborative consumption models, that ensure a more efficient and sustainable use of resources, is part of the circular economy and has generated business models that are compatible with it. This article discusses the possibility for the sharing economy to bring about profound changes in consumer behavior towards products and services and to highlight the factors that drive consumers' shift towards the sharing economy. For this purpose we developed and tested a model in which the change in consumer mindset has as the main direct determinants the satisfaction with the services of the sharing economy and the intention to access such products and services. The study uses data collected through a questionnaire, applied to a sample of 320 customers of Uber - a symbol of the sharing economy, and processed using structural equation modelling. Research results show that there are premises for switching to an access-based consumption model.

TI The influence of environmental cognition on green consumption behavior
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB With rising consumption and environmental problems, there is an increasing need for green consumption. From a micro perspective, the influence of environmental cognition on consumers' green consumption behaviors and the related mechanisms are examined through multilayer linear analysis and 2010 China General Social Survey (CGSS) microdata with the theory of planned behavior (TPB) as the model framework. The study shows that (1) environmental cognition positively influences attitudes toward green consumption, green consumption subjective norms, and green consumption perceived behavioral control, which leads to increased intentions to engage in green consumption and actual green consumption behaviors. Environmental cognition can either promote the intention toward and lead to green consumption behavior or directly promote green consumption behavior. (2) The more developed a region's economy is, the stronger people's attitudes toward green consumption will be; additionally, the greater the perceived external pressure to engage in green consumption becomes, the greater the likelihood that people will develop the intention to engage in green consumption behavior. Regional environmental quality inhibits green consumption intention to a certain extent. (3) The influence of environmental cognition on green consumption shows regional heterogeneity.

TI The impact of political ideology on consumer perceptions of their rights
   and responsibilities in the sharing economy
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB Purpose Despite consumers being essential stakeholders in the exponential growth of the sharing economy, consumers' attitudes towards their rights and responsibilities are relatively unknown. This study aims to test a novel hypothesised model mapping consumers' attitudes towards their consumer rights and responsibilities with that of their political ideology (liberalism, conservatism and libertarianism) and moral foundations (avoiding harm/fairness, in-group/loyalty, authority/respect and purity/sanctity). Design/methodology/approach Two survey studies were conducted with consumers of the Uber ride share service; the first being to test measures of political ideology and consumer rights/responsibilities. These measures were then taken into the second study along with the Moral Foundations Questionnaire. The hypothesised model was tested using structural equation modelling. Findings The findings suggest that political ideology associates with similarities and differences in how consumers perceive their rights and responsibilities in the sharing economy, including mutual self-regulation. Support for these findings is established by identifying links with specific moral foundations. Research limitations/implications This study considers a single participant in the sharing economy.

TI Supplier Resources in the Sharing Economy: Three Regulatory Concerns

AB This article explores three legal and regulatory concerns that primarily affect the supply side of marketing channels in the sharing economy. The sharing economy depends on resources and relationships between and among numerous networks and actors, including government regulators, emerging businesses, service providers, and end users who interact directly with the supply chain. Although providing economic prospects for companies and contractors, the sharing economy presents a variety of challenges for all parties, including the proper classification of the employment relationship; the use of, and access to, private property; and data privacy and security. The nascent state of theory and regulation means that companies and other stakeholders are potentially and unwarily assuming significant risk in the structure and implementation of the supply chain.

AB The phrase 'sharing economy' has grown to become an umbrella term for a wide range of nonownership forms of consumption activities such as swapping, bartering, trading, renting, sharing, and exchanging. In spite of such a wide spectrum of behaviors, there is limited practical knowledge about how individual sharing economy practices should be managed. Building on a framework that categorizes sharing economy practices based on their detailed characteristics, this article provides extensive recommendations to managers and practitioners. We argue that each practice is a hybrid of sharing and exchange, and provides several recommendations based on the nature of each practice's offering.

AB The purpose of this article is to evaluate the main drivers of the sharing economy through an exhaustive weighting and meta-analysis of previous relevant quantitative research articles, obtained using a systematic literature review methodology. The authors analysed 22 quantitative studies from 2008 through. Out of the 249 extracted relationships (independent - dependent variable), the paper identifies the "best" predictors used in theoretical models to study the sharing economy. These include: attitude on intention to share, perceived behavioural control on intention to share, subjective norm on intention to share, economic benefit on attitude, and perceived risk on attitude. Geographically, Germany and the United States of America were found to be the nations with the highest number of respondents. Temporally, an increasing trend in the number of articles on the sharing economy and respondents was observed. The consolidation of the drivers of the sharing economy provides a solid theoretical foundation for the research community to explore existing hypotheses further and test new hypotheses in emerging contexts of the sharing economy. Given the different conceptual theories that have been used to study the sharing economy and their application to different contexts, this study presents the first attempt at advancing knowledge by quantitatively synthesizing findings presented in previous literature.

SO VINE JOURNAL OF INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
AB Purpose
   As sharing economy has become increasingly popular, researchers from various disciplines begin to pay more attention to this important phenomenon. However, the current literature is fragmented and lacks a framework to integrate previous studies and guide future research. This study aims to systematically review the literature to better understand what one knows and what one need to know about sharing economy and provide a road map for future research in the context of sharing economy.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A systematic review was conducted with EBSCO and science direct database. In total, 91 studies were identified.
   Findings
   The review shows that previous studies focus on different stakeholders, including consumers, peer service providers, platform providers, and competitors. The authors further identify the main topics and limitations of the literature (integrated into a framework) and provide possible directions for future studies. For example, the authors find that few studies have examined individual and technical factors. The findings also show that consumers' other activities and outcomes have received little attention. To address these limitations, future studies that examine how individual and technical characteristics influence sharing economy's usage intention/behaviors are suggested. The authors also suggest future studies to explore other activities during the process of sharing economy services.
   Research limitations/implications
   The framework and directions provided can further the sharing economy research by addressing important gaps in the current literature.
   Originality/value
   This review identifies many opportunities for researchers to better understand the phenomenon of sharing economy.

TI Exploring opportunities of using the sharing economy in sustainable
   urban freight transport
SO SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB Reliance on the sharing economy is becoming crucial to the functioning of modern cities. Certain sharing economy-based solutions can contribute to the development of sustainable urban freight transport by reducing the number of delivery vans in service and using green vehicles. This paper evaluates the potential of the sharing economy for freight deliveries in the Polish cities. The authors examine two types of sharing platform-based solutions for light commercial vehicles (LCV), namely LCV-sharing and crowdshipping, along with the general perception of sharing platforms by the Polish citizens and their motivation to use them. Two research methods have been employed. The multi-case study method has been applied to assess the LCV-sharing market and identify the best crowdshipping practices. General interest of the public in the sharing economy has been examined by means of a survey analysis. The results show that, albeit with little market presence, the LCVsharing is continuously winning new customers in the major Polish cities. Provided by car-sharing operators who have expanded their offering with delivery vans, or by operators who target the freight market alone, the service is a more environmentally-friendly and economical alternative to leasing, especially for companies which do not need extensive use of delivery vans. Further development of LCV-sharing depends largely on availability of the service and its price, as well as on the general awareness of benefits from the sharing business model and the strengthening of confidence in it.

AB Driven by the Internet technology, the sharing economy, as a new type of economy, has contributed many positive effects on the harmonious and sustainable development of China. However, at the same time, there are also a series of problems in information security, privacy, resource allocation, protocol setting and other aspects, resulting in resource waste, information leakage and other phenomena. These problems are huge obstacles to the sharing economy. To address these issues, it is based on the weakening of authentication barriers, decision centers, fidelity, and automatic contract execution. Firstly, the mechanism and approaches to solve these problems are discussed in theoretical details. Based on this, the viewpoint of this paper is proved by the practical examples of the application of block chain technology. Finally, from the whole process of the sharing economy operation, through the summary of the specific application scenarios and key links of the existing application cases, the specific methods and strategies of the application of block chain technology are given.

AB The sharing economy model and the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) represent important phenomena in the world of business today. The aim of this article is to characterise the current state of knowledge of the context of the sharing economy and CSR, to identify research gaps and to suggest possible directions for future research in this area. Using a standalone literature review, an analysis was performed of studies published on this topic in publications indexed in the Web of Science and Scopus databases. In view of the fact that this topic is not yet part of mainstream research, only 20 publications published between 2017 and 2021 were analysed. The analysis performed shows that the context of the sharing economy and the concept of CSR are being investigated by researchers both in a general context and from the perspective of sharing economy platforms. However, significant research gaps exist in the investigation of the context of these two phenomena, which could be filled by investigation in the areas specified in the article.

TI FIRST PRINCIPLES FOR REGULATING THE SHARING ECONOMY
SO HARVARD JOURNAL ON LEGISLATION
AB This Article posits ten first principles on which a regulatory response to the sharing economy must rest. Given the rapid diversification of products in the sharing economy, this Article gives particular focus to the short-term rental market, typified by Airbnb, as one lens through which to illustrate these principles. This Article then turns to review existing regulatory responses to the sharing economy. Here again, the Article focuses on regulations related to the short-term rental market with a particular emphasis on the two strictest, existing local government regulatory structures: those of San Francisco, California and Portland, Oregon. This Article next proposes a response beyond such traditional regulatory strategies that are not well suited to regulating the sharing economy. Instead, this Article proposes a markets-based mechanism, transferable sharing rights, which is better suited to internalize externalities in the short-term rental market. Finally, this Article examines the corporatization of the sharing movement and the implications for regulations as sharing evolves from a peer-to-peer enterprise to a place where established market participants seek to assert themselves in the sharing economy's new domains.

TI Tomorrow 3.0: Transaction Costs and the Sharing Economy (an excerpt)
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC SOCIOLOGY-EKONOMICHESKAYA SOTSIOLOGIYA
AB According to Michael Munger, there is some evidence of the Third Great Economic Revolution, which can be traced within two dimensions: the sharing economy and the brokerage economy. Although in many industries, these two dimensions are far from each other, in some spheres where they interact, their intersection results in extending the new economy. In his book, Prof. Munger describes the features of the sharing economy; entrepreneurship is oriented toward cuts of transactional expenses rather than production expenses, use of new basic program tools, a business running with the help of mobile intellectual equipment, and an internet connection. In turn, the emergence of a brokerage economy results from skills used to sell cuts of transactional costs, opening new opportunities for mutually gained exchanges that have not yet been perceived as commercial.
   The Journal of Economic Sociology publishes the first chapter, "The World of Tomorrow 3.0," where the author describes key features of the new economy resulting from the Third Great Economic Revolution. It means that innovations with the usage of digital technologies come to the fore, allowing more intensive usage of durable goods and reducing the total number of circulated goods. As a result, the human experience turns out to be more important than the obtained things, thus changing the idea of private property dramatically.

TI It's About Distributing Rather than Sharing: Using Labor Process Theory
   to Probe the "Sharing" Economy
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB The sharing economy has been examined from many angles, including the engagement of customers, the capabilities of the technological platforms, and the experiences of those who sell products or services. We focus on labor in the sharing economy. Labor has been regarded as one type of asset exchanged in the sharing economy, as part of the customer interface when services are sold, or as a party vulnerable to exploitation. We focus on labor as a position in relationship to owners of capital. While new typologies to characterize the sharing economy are emerging, we argue that a well-established framework that has been applied across historic types of work arrangements can offer a robust analysis of enduring and new labor issues. We draw upon labor process theory (LPT) from early formulations to recent applications to guide an analysis appropriate to the sharing economy. We use both central and less explored concepts from LPT (obscuring and securing surplus value, technology as control, invisibility of owners and managers, and possessive individualism) and use Uber as a case to illustrate application of the framework. By considering labor, capital, and the power dynamics between them, we draw attention to unequal exchange and distributive justice, fundamental for taking a business ethics approach to labor in the sharing economy.

TI Why are customers loyal in sharing-economy services? A relational
   benefits perspective
SO JOURNAL OF SERVICES MARKETING
AB Purpose - This study aims to provide a taxonomy of relational benefits that drive customer loyalty in sharing- economy services, assess the relative strengths of these relational benefits in influencing customer loyalty and examine whether commitment mediates the influence of relational benefits on customer loyalty in this context.
   Design/methodology/approach - Relational benefits of sharing-economy services were explored through a focus group interview, followed by an online survey completed by 440 respondents in China. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses.
   Findings - This study shows that confidence and social benefits have significant and positive effects on commitment in sharing- economy services. In addition, safety benefits, a new type of relational benefits, also significantly affect commitment in this context. Furthermore, the findings suggest that commitment acts as a mediator between confidence, social and safety benefits and customer loyalty. Special treatment benefits had no effect on commitment and loyalty in the sharing-economy context.
   Practical implications - This paper provides sharing-economy service providers with insight on how to better create and sustain loyal relationships with customers through the provision of relational benefits.
   Originality/value - This study offers initial insight into why customers would stay in peer-to-peer relationships in the sharing economy, and suggests how to strengthen relationships between customers and peer service providers.

TI Green consumption practices for sustainability: an exploration through
   social practice theory
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL MARKETING
AB Purpose
   By applying social practice theory to green consumption, this paper extends our understanding of consumer insight on green consumption processes beyond linear decision-making. The purpose of this paper is to provide knowledge about how best to mitigate perceived barriers to green consumption processes including the purchase and disposal of household products and to contribute to current discourse about widening social marketing research beyond a predominant focus on individuals' behaviours.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Thematic content analysis exploring the lived experiences of participants' green consumption was undertaken by conducting 20 in-depth interviews of Australian consumers. These interviews were analysed through a social practice lens.
   Findings
   The research identified six emergent social practice themes of green consumption. By using social practice theory, a different paradigm of social research than the linear models of behaviour is used. This unconventional investigation into the green consumption process, including the purchase and disposal of household products, extends literature past the attitude-behaviour gap and highlights the importance of aligning green consumption processes with social practice.
   Originality/value
   By integrating social practice theory into the marketing discipline, this paper explores consumption as part of sustainable marketing and provides suggestions about how best to mitigate perceived barriers to green consumption processes. These insights have relevance to micro-, meso- and macro-levels of social marketing, and can help alter consumption practices making them more sustainable.

TI Funds sharing regulation in the context of the sharing economy:
   Understanding the logic of China's P2P lending regulation
SO COMPUTER LAW & SECURITY REVIEW
AB "Sharing economy" is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide range of digital platform-based activities that includes P2P lending and other forms of internet-based lending. The core aim of the sharing economy is to leverage the utilization of idle capacity. P2P lending can not only be used to leverage small amounts of money on the lender's side, but also be used to promote financial democracy and inclusion both on the lender and borrower's sides. P2P lending regulation, therefore, should place an emphasis on the utilization of dead money and promotion of financial democracy. This article scrutinizes the regulation of P2P lending in China. The existing regulatory system for P2P lending in China is built upon rules and regulations that have been designed solely with traditional brokers in mind. The article contends that the rigid rules placed on lending platforms limited their ability to maintain their roles as brokers and, in turn, heavily endangered the commercial sustainability of P2P platforms, thereby harming the sharing economy's openness and inclusivity. Additionally, the article argues that the fact that there is no limit on the amount a lender can invest poses a threat to the notions of leveraging idle money and financial inclusivity. The closed-ended P2P lending regime in China would cause some chilling effects to financial innovation in the P2P lending industry, and in a wider sense, the rising FinTech sector. Regulators in China need to cope with these challenges in a flexible but pragmatic manner, and particularly make use of the benefits the sharing economy may bring to the Chinese economy more broadly.

SO ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVES
AB In the past decade, we have seen a spectacular increase in the number of companies described as being part of the "sharing economy." The emerging academic research on the topic reflects the importance and the far-reaching implications of this phenomenon but also demonstrates a lack of conceptual clarity about what the sharing economy represents. By addressing the main conceptual tensions that exist in this field, our paper integrates the body of knowledge on the sharing economy, clarifies the concept, and develops a typology of sharing-economy organizations. We map out the antecedents and effects of the sharing economy, identifying empirical research that has been done at the consumer, provider, and platform levels of analysis, and develop avenues for future research.

TI Dilemmas of defining the sharing economy
SO TER ES TARSADALOM
AB As a combined effect of comprehensive technological, economic and social changes, we have seen in recent decades how consumer behaviour has changed. Due to increasing economic and social pressures, more and more people in developed societies are realising that their consumption patterns are not sustainable. They, therefore, question the emphasis on private property and their desire to accumulate goods. Instead of buying and owning products, they are increasingly willing and interested in sharing and leasing them. This process - called the "Sharing Turn" - has significant implications for the capitalist economy, as this new economic model represents a transition from traditional individual ownership of most assets to an accessibility-based economic model. However, the spread of sharing as a practice is not only based on changing consumer demand, but on a combination of social, economic and technological factors. We are witnessing the emergence and spread of a new type of sharing culture, a new socio-technological system. This economic technological phenomenon is called the Sharing Economy.
   The Sharing Economy and related businesses and services are increasingly becoming part of everyday life. However, there is great uncertainty as to what the concept of the Sharing Economy is, what it already includes today and which services actually fall under the Sharing Economy concept. The term Sharing Economy is often used as an umbrella expression for all activities that have arisen as a result of recent technological change. However, this framework is too broad, and research calls for a more precise interpretation that identifies the technological, social and economic changes that underpin the concept of the Sharing Economy. However, as yet, there is no comprehensive and generally accepted definition in the literature. Therefore, this study aims to review the existing Sharing Economy definitions and conceptual issues and to identify the problems that may help demarcate the definition of the concept. In addition, we also show what framework we consider appropriate to allow for a useful interpretation of the Sharing Economy. The results should help to clarify the boundaries of the Sharing Economy and its enterprises in order to validly define the Sharing Economy as a category.

SO BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Purpose The study examines the role of attitude, perceived relative advantage and perceived risk on intention to participate in the sharing economy-based cab services in India. Further, it investigates the impact of intention to participate in the sharing economy on transformation expectations of consumers. Finally, the study tests the moderating role of materialism in the relationship between intention to participate in the sharing economy and transformation expectations of consumers. Design/methodology/approach This study used cross-sectional survey research design to collect data from 408 respondents through online questionnaire in India, an emerging market. The study analysed the data using structural equation modelling technique using IBM AMOS software. Findings The findings of the study suggest that perceived relative advantage and attitude influences the intention to participate in the sharing economy. Intention to participate in the sharing economy positively influences transformation expectations. Materialism moderates the relationship between intention to participate and transformation expectations of consumers. Research limitations/implications In a departure from previous studies, this study establishes that perceived risk may not be an important factor driving the intention to participate in the sharing economy. Further, it is among the first studies to establish the role of intention to participate in the sharing economy as a possible driver of transformation expectations. Practical implications The importance of transformation expectations can be communicated as an outcome to encourage participation in the sharing economy. Managers can highlight the relative advantages to promote participation in the sharing economy. Originality/value This study is probably the first attempt to understand the transformation expectations of consumers in the sharing economy. Further, the study tests the moderating role of materialism in the relationship between intention to participate and transformation expectation of consumers.

AB The enormous growth of sharing economy in the second decade of the twenty-first century undoubtedly revolutionized the tourism and accommodation market around the world. The current research focuses on the sharing economy development, and it is mostly limited to popular cities and metropolis while its development and impact on other areas are neglected. The main aim of this article is to examine a relationship between the current size of sharing economy and population density, urbanization, development of professional hospitality base and tourism attractiveness. The research was based on the data from Statistics Poland and AirDNA. The results show that the number of sharing economy active rentals is not correlated with population and population density, but it is correlated with the number of traditional accommodation establishments and tourism attractiveness index. Moreover, the number of active rentals per capita is five times higher in urban than in other counties. The spatial distribution of sharing economy rentals is much more concentrated than a traditional hospitality market.

AB Sharing has become a new trend in business that heavily affects the ways how firms do business. Despite this important development, research by now only provides rudimentary insights into value configuration mechanisms applied in the sharing economy. Our paper that is inspired by extant research on value creation configurations as well as recent business model research develops a model of an integrated value network for the sharing economy. We explain that focal firms in sharing economy networks ground their business model configuration in the application of web-based technology. We further point to two dimensions that determine the positioning of the business model: the degree of individualization vs. standardization of the content and the degree of completeness of property rights.

SO EKONOMIA I PRAWO-ECONOMICS AND LAW
AB Motivation: The issue of sharing economy is the subject of a broad debate in the circle of politicians and economists who see it as an opportunity for boosting economic development. Simultaneously, there have been discussions about non-economic significance of this phenomenon and its impact on other areas of social life.
   Aim: The aim of this paper is to show that the dispute concerning the values for this area of phenomena is mainly a result of lack of unresolved issues related to an adopted axiological perspective. The author's intention is to present argumentation supporting the thesis that the term,sharing economy' may by referred to two - relating to various normative beliefs - categories of social phenomena: business practice and social movement.
   Results: Inclusion of various axiological contexts leads to diverse characteristics of the phenomena belonging to the sharing economy practice and the identification of their social significance.

TI A Social Marketing Framework for the Sharing Economy
SO SOCIAL MARKETING QUARTERLY
AB Background: Socio-economic issues; such as social economic inequality, sustainability of resources, and environmental concern are major social concerns and the call for economic reforms to address these issues is growing louder. Sharing economy, as a socio-economic system, presents a solution to the current linear economic model having the potential to address the aforementioned socio-economic issues. Sharing, being environmentally friendly and sustainable in nature, bridges the gap of social economic inequality prevalent in society. The attributes of the sharing economy are different from the traditional economic model which is more "social" in nature, hence making social marketing techniques more suitable than the conventional marketing approach.
   Focus of the Article: The conceptual paper is focused on the application of social marketing in the sharing economy to address socio-economic issues and in doing so presents a framework to achieve its goal.
   Research Question: How can social marketing effectively influence social behavioural changes as they relate to socio-economic changes?
   Program Design/Approach: The framework developed outlines three levels of intervention for the successful implementation of social marketing in the sharing economy. The downstream intervention focuses on influencing consumer behavioural traits necessary for the adoption of the sharing economy by applying an appropriate marketing mix strategy. The upstream intervention focuses on policy and lawmakers, social and economic institutions, environmental groups, advocacy bodies, and lobbying organisations capable of addressing the root cause of the issue. The midstream intervention focuses on integrating upstream intervention with downstream through service providers.
   Importance to the Social Marketing Field: The research paper extends social marketing application from influencing social behavioural issues to addressing and influencing socio-economic issues with its proposed application in sharing economy. The study provides a framework to address key socio-economic (social economic inequality) and consumer behavioural issues (materialism and ownership) that are prevalent in society.
   Method: The proposed social marketing framework for the sharing economy is created after carrying out a systematic literature review on social marketing and sharing economy. The extant literature analysis focussed on key definitional parameters and their evolution over time. With the identification of key elements and benchmark framework, the three levels of social marketing intervention are developed and presented for the actionable implementation of a successful marketing strategy.
   Future Research: The research paper provides an initial framework for the social marketing intervention in the sharing economy and in influencing socio-economic change which opens the door for future research direction; what additional upstream and midstream social marketing intervention is necessary to bring socio-cultural and socio-economic change to tackle the issue of social economic inequality?
   Paper type: Conceptual paper.

TI Study on the impact of haze pollution on resident's green consumption
   behavior: the case of Shandong Province
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB At present, Chinese residents have been suffering from the influence of air pollution, especially haze pollution. However, residents' consumption is also one of the main sources of haze pollution. Therefore, residents' green consumption can reduce haze pollution. This paper is to explore the impact of haze pollution on residents' green consumption behavior. Shandong Province is taken as the illustrative case to carry on the empirical analysis. Firstly, the grounded theory is used to develop the residents' green consumption behavior model affected by haze pollution. Secondly, based on the data obtained by investigation, the structural equation model is used to test the theoretical model. Finally, the hierarchical regression model is utilized to study the moderating effect of situational variables on resident's green consumption behavior. The green consumption willingness (GCW) has a significant positive driving effect on green consumption behavior. Furthermore, the haze pollution perception (HPP) plays the most positive role in promoting green consumption willingness, followed by behavioral constrain (BC) and haze mitigation responsibility (HMR). Among all situational variables, the government incentive (IM) has a positive moderating effect on the relationship between green consumption willingness and invested green consumption behavior (IGCB). However, publicity and education activities (PEA) have a reverse moderating effect on the relationship between green consumption willingness and invested green consumption behavior. The difference of the impact of age, income, occupation and household structure on habitual green consumption behavior (HGCB) is significant. However, there are significant differences in the effects of age, income, and educational background on invested green consumption behavior. According to the results received in this paper, more policy recommendations are presented. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Is sharing the solution? Exploring public acceptability of the sharing
   economy
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Advocated as a solution to a range of economic, environmental and social problems, the sharing economy has grown rapidly in recent years. However, despite rising up the political agenda, the concept has been increasingly critiqued in relation to unintended economic and social consequences. Whilst existing research has explored the motivations of existing participants in sharing-based practices and business models, little is yet known about wider public perceptions of the sharing economy. Investigating public discourses, this paper explores how citizens may respond to attempts to mainstream the sharing economy, discussing wider desires and concerns surrounding the concept. In a series of four two-day workshops (n = 51), we utilised deliberative research methods to engage participants in discussion surrounding the sharing economy and its role within a more sustainable, resource efficient future. Overall, positive perceptions dominated discussions, with participants independently highlighting reduced waste and resource use, increased access to unaffordable goods, and increased community cohesion as key benefits of sharing. However, echoing existing critiques, a number of concerns were also raised. Our findings suggest that, in addition to personal interests (such as affordability, convenience, and hygiene), public acceptability of the sharing economy was contingent on it meeting a number of broader social values. These include desire to: foster social equality, in relation to both the opportunity and benefits promised by the sharing economy; encourage and support the development of strong and independent local communities; and ensure that business practices operate fairly in the shared interest of business, consumers and the environment. Given the implications for everyday life and consumption practices, we argue public perspectives need to be given consideration within the debate surrounding which aspects of the sharing economy should, and should not, be fostered.

TI Is sharing up for sale? Monetary exchanges in the sharing economy
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB Past research has neglected the question of whether different exchange mechanisms and consumption or service contexts (CSCs) in the sharing economy may lead to different outcomes. The authors develop a novel theoretical framework that proposes that willingness to participate in the sharing economy will be lower if exchange mechanisms and CSCs do not match-that is, if monetary/social exchange mechanisms are applied in hedonic/utilitarian CSCs, taking into account the moderating role of materialism. Moreover, the authors propose that in the sharing economy, monetary exchanges may cause a crowding-out of prosocial behaviors and that this effect will be especially pronounced for highly materialistic individuals. They test their hypothesized framework in three experimental studies that support the theorizing and provide results with important implications for the design of sharing economy offers as well as for society.

TI Modeling user concerns in Sharing Economy: the case of food delivery
   apps
SO AUTOMATED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
AB Sharing Economy apps, such as Uber, Airbnb, and TaskRabbit, have generated a substantial consumer interest over the past decade. The unique form of peer-to-peer business exchange these apps have enabled has been linked to significant levels of economic growth, helping people in resource-constrained communities to build social capital and move up the economic ladder. However, due to the multidimensional nature of their operational environments, and the lack of effective methods for capturing and describing their end-users' concerns, Sharing Economy apps often struggle to survive. To address these challenges, in this paper, we examine crowd feedback in ecosystems of Sharing Economy apps. Specifically, we present a case study targeting the ecosystem of food delivery apps. Using qualitative analysis methods, we synthesize important user concerns present in the Twitter feeds and app store reviews of these apps. We further propose and intrinsically evaluate an automated procedure for generating a succinct model of these concerns. Our work provides a first step toward building a full understanding of user needs in ecosystems of Sharing Economy apps. Our objective is to provide Sharing Economy app developers with systematic guidelines to help them maximize their market fitness and mitigate their end-users' concerns and optimize their experience.

AB Sharing economy businesses are increasingly important, but the relationships between their strategies and their platforms' structure has received insufficient attention. To address this gap, we develop testable hypotheses building on following expectations. 1) Sharing economy businesses are attacking mature markets; 2) most sharing economy businesses follow one of Porter's two basic strategies, seeking a price advantage or a differentiation advantage; and 3) platforms that support differentiation-based strategies must provide more information to their users than platforms that support cost-based strategies. We located a database of 100 investment-grade sharing economy businesses to test our hypotheses. Our hypotheses received strong support from this database.

TI Examining recent research in the field of sharing economy in tourism:
   Bibliometric and content analysis
SO TOURISM
AB Sharing economy has become a rather troublesome concept and business model in the process of tourism development during the recent years. Despite its undoubtful economic benefits for service providers and consumers, there are numerous negative impacts which can be related to the sharing economy, ultimately leading to unsustainable tourism development on destination level. In general, sharing economy can be attributed numerous benefits, but in terms of tourism, it recently became closely related to the issue of overtourism, thus becoming one of the initiators of negative attitude of the local community towards the future tourism development. Therefore, the concept of sharing economy has been in the focus of numerous researchers during the last several years, with increasing number of papers being published since 2016. This research is focused on analyzing the evolution and importance of sharing economy within the tourism study. The focus is given to the bibliographic analysis of journal articles within the "sharing economy in tourism" search. Additionally, based on qualitative content analysis the aim is to identify current state of the research in this field and to determine research gap with respect to the issue of overtourism and to identify future research potentials.

TI Macro-level Differences in Participation in Sharing Economy Factors
   Affecting Contributions to the Collective Intelligence Wikipedia
   Platform across Different Asian Countries
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB Different countries embrace the sharing economy with differing enthusiasm and effects due to factors ranging from the development level to government policies and society's cultural values. This research measures the participation of Asian countries in this phenomena through their contributions to a global sharing economy platform-Wikipedia. This study uses language as a proxy for each country, which allows for a macro-scale comparison of factors related to participation in sharing economy. The study finds that in addition to expected factors related to the global digital divide and the country's development level, other factors such as country's size, dominant language, and cultural factors also play a significant role. Lower development levels, multi-ethnic (multi-language) and smaller populations can be a severe impediment to the development of the sharing economy. Government policy (China) or unique Internet structure (South Korea) can create significant outliers. Contributing to the sharing economy is also more common in countries located near the self-expression and rational-secular ends of the Inglehart-Welzel model, and the uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, and long-term orientation dimensions of the Hofstede model.

TI Coupling relationship between green production and green consumption:
   Case of the Yangtze River Delta area
SO NATURAL RESOURCE MODELING
AB Green production and green consumption have always been topics of concern. This study explores the coupling relationship between green production and green consumption by setting up a coupling coordination degree model using 2006-2015 panel data for the Yangtze River Delta area. The results highlight that, first, the contribution rate of the tertiary industry to the gross domestic product index is the key factor influencing green production. Meanwhile, passenger volume in the public traffic index is the main factor impacting green consumption. Second, while both green production and consumption levels have somewhat improved in the area, the gap between them continues to widen. Furthermore, the improvement in green consumption lags behind that in green production. Finally, the coupling coordination degree between green production and consumption in the area shows an increasing trend, although at a low level. These findings suggest that governments should focus on improving green consumption to increase the coupling coordination degree.

AB In digitalization, trust is a necessary factor in economic and social development in general that determines the content of public relations and ensures their positive effect. In sharing economy, due to the specifics of the emerging relations, the issue of creating a digital environment of trust is especially relevant. The objective of the research is to determine the directions for improving the mechanism of civil law regulation of certain aspects of the collective use of goods and services, including studying the possibilities of the influence of the main provisions of civil Law on the provision of the necessary trust between the turnover participants; research on the transformation of legal institutions, including the protection o reputation, in the context of digitalization processes; establishment of the specifics of regulating relations on the use of blockchain and other latest technologies aimed at creating and increasing the level of digital trust in collaborative consumption of various assets. The main research methods are deduction (the study of general legal provisions and their application to some regions of collaborative consumption), induction (the study of the rules for organizing the work of specific Internet platforms in the sharing economy, and the subsequent allocation of general principles). Based on the results, the effective development of the sharing economy in digitalization presupposes a high level of trust, which has several interrelated manifestations that require differentiated approaches to their legal support. In addition to trust in digital technologies and services, the security of remotely performed transactions, and the preservation of the confidentiality of personal data, trust in society is essential for the sharing economy since only those who trust are trusted.

TI People, power and politics: Developing a public sector sharing economy
SO GEOFORUM
AB In this paper, we explore how a local authority in the North of England attempted to develop a public sector sharing economy to deliver welfare services in new and innovative ways. The study examines how and why public sector sharing differs from commercial and not-for-profit sharing, and assesses the implications of this for getting public sector sharing economies off the ground. Our analysis suggests that public sector sharing comprises hybridized forms of sharing, in which some aspects align with a 'collaboration' style of sharing economy, not too dissimilar to typical marketplace exchange relationships. In other aspects, however, public sector sharing resembles a 'reciprocity' style of sharing more usually associated with the 'sharing culture' in evidence in not-forprofit sharing economies. In the public sector sharing economy under investigation, characteristics of state 'redistribution' also linger, as the local authority seeks to move away from traditional economic arrangements towards the sharing economy. Overall, our study shows that public sector sharing appears to exhibit a much higher degree of complexity than other types of sharing economy, which arises from the different motivations, values and ways of working among the various organizations and community groups involved. We conclude that an imperative of heterogeneity in governance strategies is needed to match the heterogeneity in evidence in the public sector sharing economy being developed.

TI "The war of the worlds won't occur": Decentralized evaluation systems
   and orders of worth in market organizations of the sharing economy
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB Market organizations of the sharing economy have gained economic and social prominence. Most of these market organizations incorporate decentralized evaluation systems into their digital platform. However, these market organizations involve users and organizers with different ideas on what is valuable and what is not in sharing-economy transactions. Building on neo-institutional insights coupled with French pragmatist sociology, we investigate the role of decentralized evaluation systems in supporting/solving the co-existence and/or competition of several conceptions of worth in market organizations of the sharing economy.
   In a case study on the French peer-to-peer carpooling platform BlaBlaCar, we show that its decentralized evaluation system embodies the organizer's conception of what is valuable and only supports limited pluralism among users. We argue that incorporating a decentralized evaluation system in the digital platform of a market organization is not neutral: certain users prefer to self-exclude rather than to use the system to discriminate between potential future interlocutors. Although evaluations do not incorporate imposed criteria, they constitute proofs of worth in some worlds but not in others. Finally, this evaluation system creates room for several market organizations to co-exist.

AB Based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour, this study explains sharing economy platform usage intention. Our results based on PLS-SEM estimations with survey data (N = 655) from the carpooling context show that sharing orientation (i.e. sharing usage instead of owning/buying), grassroots engagement (i.e. non-profit organisation driven by volunteers), and platform authenticity (i.e. loyalty to the original carpooling practice) are strong determinants of people's attitudes towards the carpooling platform, while trend orientation (e.g. the 'sharing economy' paradigm) is not significant. This implies that while digitalisation can optimise older practices (e.g. hitchhiking), online platforms facilitating contemporary sharing practices need to be embedded in the original sharing ethos and values to raise usage intention - even though the sharing economy has become mainstream.

TI Psychological science for a responsible sharing economy
SO CURRENT OPINION IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB The sharing economy is fueled by trust, which allows strangers to cooperate. To share responsibly, one needs to be aware of the various consequences sharing has on interacting and third parties. When transparency about such consequences is lacking, mutual trust among interacting parties may encourage people to cooperate and share, in turn, creating unintended negative impacts. Psychologists have long studied trust and cooperation, yet few insights from psychological science have been used to understand the sharing economy. Here, we propose that evoking trust may paradoxically increase motivated information processing leading people to share irresponsibly by ignoring the negative consequences sharing has on others. We review three conditions under which evoking trust may lead to irresponsible sharing: ethical blind spots, willful ignorance, and misinformation. We propose that transparent information is key to enable and encourage responsible sharing. More psychological research is needed to better understand how this flourishing, trust-based industry can be shaped to encourage safe, cooperative, and responsible sharing.

TI Owning, Using, and Renting: Some Simple Economics of the "Sharing
   Economy"
SO MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB New Internet-based "sharing-economy" markets enable consumer-owners to rent out their durable goods to nonowners. We model such markets and explore their equilibria both in the short run, in which ownership decisions are fixed, and in the long run, in which ownership decisions can be changed. We find that sharing-economy markets always expand consumption and increase surplus, but may increase or decrease ownership. Regardless, ownership is decoupled from individual preferences in the long run, as the rental rates and the purchase prices of goods become equal. If there are costs of bringing unused capacity to the market, they are partially passed through, creating a bias toward ownership. To test our theoretical work empirically, we conduct a survey of consumers, finding broad support for our modeling assumptions. The survey also allows us to offer a partial decomposition of the bring-to-market costs, based on attributes that make a good more or less amenable to being shared.

AB Mobile applications and Internet-based platforms continuously foster the rise of the sharing economy business model that can nowadays be found in various industries. In this paper, we focus on potential customers in the ridesharing industry. We use the setting of `BlaBlaCar', a popular ridesharing platform, to investigate the implications of 'trust' and 'distrust' on the users' intention to engage in a sharing encounter. In particular, we extend the research model by Mittendorf (2017) which investigates the influence of trust and risk in the sharing economy. In this regard, we differentiate between the platform and the sharing partners, while incorporating both trust and distrust. Our study employs survey data (n = 238) and structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Our results provide empirical evidence that trust and distrust have unequal effects on the respective user intention, which contributes to the understanding of two-sided market platforms. Academic and practical implications are discussed.

TI The sharing economy and China's antimonopoly law: from the Didi case to
   regulatory challenges*
SO ASIA PACIFIC LAW REVIEW
AB The sharing economy is a new industrial model that has been booming in China over the past decade. China's antimonopoly law, however, has stayed relatively dormant while this innovative business has been expanding. For this article, I have chosen Didi Chuxing (Didi), the largest online ride-hailing service provider in the Chinese market, as my research subject. Didi's rapid development mirrors the sharing economy's prosperity in China as well as challenges faced by antimonopoly law. Based on my observation of Didi's business expansion, I point out three major anticompetitive concerns: predatory pricing, abuse of a dominant position, and undue interference by government authorities. This article concludes by suggesting three ways to address these concerns. Firstly, it suggests strengthening the antimonopoly law's core value of efficiency, which could help law enforcers escape from the confinement of traditional antitrust concepts and adopt more flexible and efficient approaches to analyse companies' behaviours. Secondly, it suggests adjusting the merger control thresholds and developing more flexible rules to review behaviours related to a dominant position in the sharing economy. Thirdly, the Fair Competition Review System is expected to be an effective mechanism to prevent governments from unduly interfering in competition in the sharing economy.

TI Envisioning the 'Sharing City': Governance Strategies for the Sharing
   Economy
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB Recent developments around the sharing economy bring to the fore questions of governability and broader societal benefit-and subsequently the need to explore effective means of public governance, from nurturing, on the one hand, to restriction, on the other. As sharing is a predominately urban phenomenon in modern societies, cities around the globe have become both locus of action and central actor in the debates over the nature and organization of the sharing economy. However, cities vary substantially in the interpretation of potential opportunities and challenges, as well as in their governance responses. Building on a qualitative comparative analysis of 16 leading global cities, our findings reveal four framings of the sharing economy: 'societal endangerment,' 'societal enhancement,' 'market disruption,' and 'ecological transition.' Such framings go hand in hand with patterned governance responses: although there is considerable heterogeneity in the combination of public governance strategies, we find specific configurations of framings and public governance strategies. Our work reflects the political and ethical debates on various economic, social, and moral issues related to the sharing economy, and contributes to a better understanding of the field-level institutional arrangements-a prerequisite for examining moral behavior of sharing economy organizations.

AB There is relatively little known about conflicts that characterize the sharing economy in developing countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. This exploratory paper seeks to addresses this knowledge gap, drawing from the conflict experiences of actors (e.g. service providers, service demanders and platform aggregators) in the Ghanaian sharing economy. The study will be conducted using a grounded theory approach which involves a systematic inductive method for conducting qualitative research aimed toward theory development. This paper's potential contribution is the theorization of actors' conflicts within the sharing economy, especially developing economies in Sub-Sahara Africa, where the phenomenon has been understudied. It will also pave way for further research in the area.

TI Investigating the disruptiveness of the sharing economy at the
   individual consumer level: How consumer reflexivity drives re-engagement
   in sharing
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF MARKETING SCIENCE
AB The sharing economy represents an emerging technology-enabled socioeconomic system. Given its disruptive nature, the sharing economy not only challenges traditional marketing theories but also alters consumer norms and beliefs related to consumption concepts. Whether, when, and how the sharing economy transforms consumption remain important questions for managers to investigate. This study examines how sharing experiences influence consumers' critical self-reflection and shape their intentions to re-engage in sharing practices. With data collected from two surveys and four experiments (including three pretests and one main study), we show that consumers' perceived economic utility, social value, and sustainability potential in the sharing economy influence their intentions to re-engage in sharing practices, thus forming a loyal customer base. In addition, consumer reflexivity mediates this effect. We also show that past experience with business-to-consumer sharing practices moderates the proposed mediating effect. Overall, we demonstrate the disruptive impact of the sharing economy on individual consumers with meaningful managerial implications and contributions to marketing theories.

TI Sharing economy and incumbents' pricing strategy: The impact of Airbnb
   on the hospitality industry
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB In this paper, we examine how the emergence of sharing economy platforms influences incumbents' price responses. Grounding on the literature on price reactions to new entrants and on the unique characteristics of the sharing economy, we argue that the effect of the penetration of the sharing economy on incumbents' prices is not straightforward, and actually depends on the type of incumbents as well as certain product/service offer characteristics. Indeed, relying on a large sample of hotel price offerings from the Italian market, we find that the effect of the growing relevance of the sharing economy (exemplified by Airbnb) on incumbents' prices depends on the type of incumbents (low/medium-end versus high-end hotels) as well as on the accommodation period (weekend versus weekdays), and thus on the type of consumers looking for accommodation. Specifically, low/medium-end incumbents set lower prices in geographical areas where sharing economy has a higher penetration, but this occurs only for weekend accommodation search. In contrast, high-end incumbents tend to set higher prices in geographical areas where sharing economy has a higher penetration, irrespective of the accommodation period. We discuss the important implications of our findings for incumbents, sharing economy platforms, consumers, and policy makers.

TI Coopetition in the platform economy from ethical and firm performance
   perspectives
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB The platform economy facilitates a model of sharing economy, where competition and cooperation among the competitive firms are very common. Nevertheless, there are very few studies to date which investigate how competition and cooperation influence firms' ethical dilemmas, and how these in turn affect performance outcomes. As such, there is a lack of understanding of the outcomes of platform-based sharing economy from conflict management and firm performance perspectives. Thus, the aim of this study is to examine the coopetition in platform economy from ethical and firm performance perspectives. Building on literature from the relational view and resource-based view, we perform an empirical analysis on a dataset of 328 Indian platform-based firms. The study finds that there is a significant impact of coopetition in platform-based sharing economy which creates conflicts and increases the firms' ethical dilemma that eventually decreases the performance of firms.

TI New forms of luxury consumption in the sharing economy
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB This study contributes to literature on luxury in the sharing economy by holistically examining new forms of luxury consumption which includes on-demand and the product-service economy, second-hand consumption, and co-ownership. Twenty-five depth semi-structured interviews with consumers reveal that the concept of luxury is disrupted in these new luxury contexts. Specifically, the findings challenge the traditional view of ownership as the ultimate form of luxury, and demonstrate the appeal of the temporality reflected in new forms of luxury consumption. Two types of sharing emerge-simultaneous versus sequential- each has its own challenges and opportunities. The findings identify value hedonism, hedonistic egoism, and hedonic escalation as drivers of such consumption, thereby contributing a deeper understanding of the complex nature of hedonism in new forms of luxury consumption. This research empirically supports a more inclusive, less elitist conceptualization of luxury and discusses implications for luxury brands.

TI Reputation Cues as Signals in the Sharing Economy
SO SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Reputation cues, like star ratings, signal qualities of service providers in the sharing economy and may affect user behavior. Guided by concepts from signaling theory and using a repeated measures experiment (N = 221), this study manipulated the level of star ratings of ride sharing drivers. Intuitive findings are perceived service quality and willingness to use the service provider are higher when the star rating is high versus low. Extending prior work, perceived service quality mediates the effect of reputation on willingness, explaining 83% of the total effect. Also, the direct effect of reputation cues on perceived service quality depends, albeit weakly (eta (2)(p) = 0.02), on how much users say they pay attention to them. These novel findings clarify the kinds of mental processing that occur when users of shared services evaluate reputation cues. We discuss findings in terms of costly signaling and consider practical implications for users and providers.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL DISTRIBUTION & LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore sustainability paradoxes in sharing economy initiatives by focusing on logistics management in last-mile logistics. Design/methodology/approach In this exploratory study, a total of 10 case studies were conducted in three categories of companies: anti-waste platforms, food delivery platforms and bicycle delivery companies. Twenty-seven face-to-face interviews with founders and/or managers and contractors (couriers, logistics service providers or volunteers) were the primary source of data collection. The heterogeneity of the sample enabled the authors to build an understanding of sustainability paradoxes in the logistics of sharing economy initiatives. Findings The findings indicate how logistics management impacts the sustainability of sharing economy initiatives in last-mile delivery. The authors identify seven paradoxical tensions (five of them social) generated by the contradictions between the organizations' promised environmental and social values and the impacts of their operations. Research limitations/implications This exploratory research is based on a qualitative study of 10 cases and 27 interviews from heterogeneous samples; further empirical research is needed to ensure generalization. Practical implications The paper increases the understanding of environmental and social paradoxical tensions and awareness of logistics challenges. Social implications The paper helps identify ways to reconcile promised values and impacts generated by sharing economy initiatives while managing last-mile delivery. Originality/value The results enrich the literature about the paradoxes in sharing economy initiatives by providing illustrations in last-mile logistics and exposing the underlying challenges for sharing economy logistics actors.

The academic and business circles have a strong interest in how the sharing economy has exerted such a huge effect. In practice, a number of unicorn companies in sharing economy have emerged explosively in China and have quickly become leaders in related industries. Why did these companies have explosive growth? What are the characteristics of the business model behind them? What are the differences in the driving logic of sharing economy companies with different business models?

TI Governing the sharing economy: Towards a comprehensive analytical
   framework of municipal governance
SO CITIES
AB The sharing economy is having a transformative impact on our cities, and many municipalities are facing a challenge - how to systematically engage with the sharing economy to both mitigate its negative and enhance its positive impacts. Academic understanding of municipal governance mechanisms of the sharing economy remains poor. To address this gap, we develop a comprehensive analytical framework for municipal governance of the sharing economy, comprising five mechanisms (regulating, providing, enabling, self-governing, collaborating) and eleven roles. We employ a mixed-method approach comprising literature analysis, 139 semi-structured interviews, five workshops, three focus groups, and seven mobile research labs conducted in Amsterdam, Berlin, Gothenburg, London, Malmo, San Francisco and Toronto. We then go on to demonstrate how municipalities have positive and negative interactions with SEOs through various mechanisms. Explaining why municipalities differ in their governance approaches towards SEOs is an important area of future research. The framework contributes to knowledge on municipal governance by offering a holistic classification of mechanisms and roles of municipal governance relating to the sharing economy. In addition to its academic value, the framework has value for urban policy and planning, as it can help municipalities navigate the governance complexity and become more agile when engaging with SEOs.

TI The Energy System and the Sharing Economy: Interfaces and Overlaps and
   What to Learn from Them
SO ENERGIES
AB The dissemination of decentralized renewable energy generation, storage and smart metering devices has led to the need for new business models and coordination mechanisms in the energy sector. At the same time, the emerging sharing economy focuses on using digital platforms to coordinate value creation on a decentralized level. While sharing concepts have already been applied to specific energy technologies and microgrids, a more general understanding of what the sharing economy means in the context of the energy sector is still missing. This paper aims to bring these two topics together and to analyze their interfaces and overlaps. For this purpose, this paper draws from existent scientific publications, reports, blog posts, and websites as well as company workshops to discuss which activities and characteristics of the sharing economy might be applicable to the energy sector. Results show that there are significant overlaps in characteristics of the sharing economy and of the transitioning energy system. Furthermore, a broad range of business models within the energy system were found to be based on sharing resources. The findings of this study open up a range of new research and business opportunities at the interface of the sharing economy and the transitioning energy system.

TI Is Airbnb a Sharing Economy Superstar? Evidence from Five Global Cities
SO URBAN POLICY AND RESEARCH
AB The sharing economy concept has been embraced by governments, entrepreneurs and commentators as delivering new forms of opportunity for local and national economies. Accommodation-sharing platform Airbnb is often considered a sharing economy exemplar, and has promoted itself as helping middle-class residents to gain and retain a foothold in expensive housing markets. This narrative is particularly salient in global cities, where poor housing affordability and high tourist demand inevitably coexist. However, critics claim many Airbnb listings are actually permanent short-term rentals. Thus, instead of enabling new efficiencies in the use of housing assets and providing financial security for existing residents, Airbnb may be a variation on an old theme: removing properties from the market for long-term rental or purchase. This paper has three aims: it critically interrogates the sharing economy concept in relation to Airbnb; it reviews the regulatory responses to Airbnb in five global cities; and it examines Airbnb listing data in each city. Ultimately, the paper argues that while some Airbnb listings do fit the sharing economy narrative, others are part of the traditional economy of short term letting. Policy makers need to recognise the different impacts of these uses in their responses to Airbnb and the sharing economy.

TI Algorithmic management: The case of Airbnb
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT
AB Algorithmic management is rapidly emerging as a strategic management tool in the digital economy; however, little is known of the outcomes of algorithmic management for users of the sharing economy platforms. With a focus on one of the most rapidly growing peer-to-peer platforms, this research investigates how Airbnb hosts have responded to and adapted to the algorithmic management strategies employed by Airbnb. Findings suggest that asymmetry of algorithmic information can increase Airbnb's power to influence and control Airbnb hosts' practices. Further, such information asymmetry can significantly hinder Airbnb hosts' sense of control. This study contributes to the emerging academic dialogue on the algorithmic management in tourism and hospitality and advances the academic research on the human resources aspect of the sharing economy.

AB IoT applications that act on behalf of people are becoming reality. In this workshop we explore the opportunities and challenges that arise when these proactive technologies become increasingly embedded in our world and carried on our bodies, particularly when converging with the emerging 'sharing economy' paradigm. IoT sensors enable new sharing economy services that are personalised, hyperlocal, and can be delivered at short notice, for example food sharing among neighbours to prevent waste. Yet, there are many design challenges and ethical concerns that the HCl community needs to address to make these proactive services intelligible and accountable. In this workshop we seek to begin a dialogue to gather and respond to these challenges, collect design examples and ideas, and learn from each other.

AB The labor alienation will inevitably make the differentiation between the rich and the poor, which will make the contradiction deepen between the trend of unlimited expansion of production and the demand of laborers with purchasing power, that is why the economic crisis will eventually outbreak again and again. It was no accident that the contemporary sharing economy just rose in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008, the reason was that there contained the correction force for labor alienation in the business model of the contemporary sharing economy which can better meet the individual and customized needs of both supply and demand through everyone's participation and the use of internet sharing platforms. This paper analyzes the basic conditions for the change of labor share and the improvement of relations between labor and capital through the game model of labor cooperation. It reveals the deep causes of the sharing economy, and explains the corrective effect of the sharing economy on the alienation between the laborers and their labor products, the laborers and their labor behaviors and the relationship between people. This study can provide theoretical support and policy suggestions for the government's working direction and supporting levels on the sharing economic development.

TI A Critical Framework for Examining Sustainability Claims of the Sharing
   Economy: Exploring the Tensions Within Platform Brand Discourses
SO JOURNAL OF MACROMARKETING
AB The sharing economy represents a market-driven response to the perceived inefficient resource use arising from materialism, and as such, offers the possibility of a more environmentally sustainable form of consumption. However, the sustainability benefits attributed to the sharing economy remain contentious and fraught with paradox. Drawing on a critical discourse analysis of three sharing economy brands (Lime, Rent the Runway and BlaBlaCar) we identify that sustainability discourses compete with claims arising from the espoused benefits of immateriality and platform brands' desire for rapid growth. We identify and explore three platform brand discourses (disrupting unsustainable leaders, guilt-free choice, and non-commercial appeals) and their associated practices. In doing so we identify that tensions between these discourses and practices give rise to three sustainability-related contradictions: displacement of sustainable alternatives, hidden materiality, and creeping usage. Our findings contribute to our understanding of the sharing economy and its role in sustainability.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT
AB Drawing on the services marketing and sharing economy literature, the study identifies the leading reputational attributes that boost popularity in sharing economy platforms. As popularity stands as a purchase decision making tool, the purpose of this paper is to jointly examine the influence of personal reputation and product description. A sample of Airbnb listings was collected in November 2016 in Italy and UK (n = 502). The database consists of popularity variables along with personal reputational attributes and the description of the product being offered. The findings of the study, based on the Shapley Value Regression, suggest that personal reputation is of paramount importance, explaining alone almost 40% of popularity variation. The paper concludes with theoretical implications on self-branding and, given the importance weights of the different attributes in popularity building, practical implications for sellers operating in sharing economy platforms.

TI Operations research on the sharing economy: A bibliometric analysis and

SO ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
AB Previous studies on the sharing economy have not utilized bibliometrics to classify the main stakeholders from the perspective of operations research (OR). In this study, we utilize the bibliometric method to review the supply side, demand side, the platform, and their optimization models. Based on the bibliometric network, we propose a complete multi-level framework to study the optimization decisions of stakeholders and the key factors that may influence optimal decisions in the sharing economy. The pricing, behavioral characteristics, operating strategies, and incentive methods of the three stakeholders will affect the optimal decisions and models. Multi-party interaction significantly affects the decision-making behavior of stakeholders. The sharing economy in-troduces a new business model to traditional industrial applications, such as transportation and trade, and has both positive and negative effects on the economy, environment, and society. We identify future research in the ecosystem of the sharing economy, hybrid methods, and breakthrough technologies, such as blockchain, AI, and data-driven optimization.

TI SPACES OF COMPETITION IN THE SHARING ECONOMY : TAXI MARKETS AND UBER
   ENTRY IN NYC
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT ECONOMICS
AB Multisided platforms are among the main drivers of the growth of the so-called 'sharing economy' and their diffusion is apparently also changing the profitability and spatial structure of traditional markets. This paper investigates the spatial effect of Uber on the taxi industry in New York City, using a large data set consisting of all taxi and Uber rides from April to June 2014. Our results indicate that Uber had a positive and significant effect on the number of taxi trips, whereas no significant effect was detected for average trip fare and distance. These findings are consistent with the view that new operators in the sharing economy, and Uber in particular, do not directly compete with traditional operators and can potentially generate spillover effects.

TI Marketing without trust?-Blockchain technologies in the sharing economy
   as assemblage and pharmakon
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB Blockchain technologies are of great interest to marketers uncovering opportunities in the context of the sharing economy. The novel appeal of blockchain is that it provides an immutable audit trail of digital tokens and contracts via a peer-to-peer (P2P) network without the need for a market intermediary. It thus enables digital exchange without the need for a trusted central authority or third party, affording an infrastructure for a variety of applications. We assess how blockchain technologies facilitate sharing beyond its role as a technological protocol and how it instead operates as a social machine. We explore these implications for marketing philosophically through the lenses of assemblage and pharmakon. We identify two contradictions for marketers: (1) how marketing with blockchain technologies in the sharing economy challenges past institutional roles of marketers and seeks to eradicate them, and (2) how these technologies produce a new notion of capitalized sociality devoid of trust.

AB The sharing economy (SE) has been variously described as a disruptive, discontinuous, and social innovation. Now, more than a decade since the emergence of seminal platforms such as Airbnb, and amid heightened competition and macroenvironmental pressures, service innovation has become a strategic priority. Our editorial essay is guided by three objectives. First, as a prelude to this Special Issue, we examine the current state of SE service innovation literature. Despite some important contributions, especially in relation to business model innovation, other salient types of service innovation remain underexplored. Second, we position the contributions of the 13 papers in this Special Issue on our novel Sharing Economy Innovation Framework, which stipulates both the type of service innovation examined, and the focal dyadic relationships involved. Third, based on remaining gaps in the framework, we outline an agenda for future research on SE innovations.

TI A Study on Factors Affecting the Value Co-Creation Behavior of Customers
   in Sharing Economy: Take Airbnb Malaysia as an Example
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Starting with corporate and customer factors, this paper establishes a research model of the influencing factors that affect the customers' value co-creation behavior in a sharing economy. Guided by this model, this study conducted a questionnaire survey on 587 Malaysian Airbnb customers, and analyzed the valid data with software such as SPSS26 and AMOS24. The results show that although the operators of sharing economy platforms do not directly provide products and services, their ethical management, corporate authenticity and corporate image still positively influence customer value co-creation behavior, and that sharing economy customers, whether they are suppliers or demanders, have their own characteristics that influence value co-creation behavior. Based on these results, this study suggests that sharing economy corporations should pay attention to their business operations and customer behavior as well as their APS (Application product services), so as to achieve sustainable and virtuous development.

TI The Impact of Platform Protection Insurance on Buyers and Sellers in the
   Sharing Economy: A Natural Experiment
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB The sharing economy has radically reshaped marketing thought and practice, and research has yet to examine whether and how platform-level buyer protection insurance (PPI) affects buyers and sellers in this economy. The authors exploit a natural experiment involving an unexpected system glitch during a PPI launch and estimate difference-in-differences models using over 5.4 million data points from a food sharing platform. Results suggest that PPI significantly increases buyer spending and seller revenue, affirming the benefits of this platform-level insurance in the sharing economy. The authors also uncover multifaceted buyer-side and seller-side responses that enable such benefits. PPI increases buyer spending by boosting product orders and variety-seeking behavior. Furthermore, it enhances seller revenue by increasing customer retention and acquisition. This work contributes to the literature by (1) putting a spotlight on the topic of PPI, a platform governance policy that reduces consumer risks and improves the efficacy of sharing platforms; (2) accounting for how PPI alters buyer and seller behaviors on a platform; (3) addressing what types of buyers and sellers benefit more or less from PPI; and (4) offering guidance for managers to improve platform reputation, marketplace efficiency, and consumer welfare in the context of the sharing economy.

TI U.S. workers weigh-in on the issue of portable benefits
SO JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS
AB As the sharing economy continues to grow and diversify, various institutes and members of government are contemplating the need for new employment regulations, including those related to portable benefits. However, there has been no known inquiry into this issue with those U.S. workers in the sharing economy. This paper presents exploratory research on the subject of portable benefits for workers engaged in the sharing economy and is intended to inform the development of future research questions and to determine the best research design and data collection method for a more extensive study. Arguably, rideshare drivers represent a large constituency of sharing economy workers in the United States and were utilized as the study population. Through authorized access to closed social media sites, this study explored the desire among rideshare drivers for portable benefits, how these benefits should be funded, and how such programs would be administered. The findings indicate that the majority of respondents were interested in the availability of portable benefits, although the preference for specific benefits varied widely among respondents. More than half believe companies, along with workers, should fund these benefits, and slightly less than half believe private sector third parties like insurance companies should administer these programs. However, given the transient nature of this workforce, administering such programs could prove to be quite challenging for organizations and plan administrators alike.

This study approaches smart work as a form of the sharing economy, with a central concern on its spatial disruption to inform planning implication, based on a case study of Canberra, Australia. The analysis combines spatial clustering of smart workers at small community level with the practice and perception of smart work. The results suggest an emerging spatial disruption of smart work on both land use and space use, which implies a need for some new planning thinking for urban-suburban relationship, infrastructure provision, localised economic development, and spatial reconfiguration for communities and spaces. This study also suggests a cautious and critical approach to sustainability aspirations, which have in part elevated the recent enthusiasm in smart work and the broader sharing economy.

TI Dimensions of digital inequality in the sharing economy
SO INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY
AB Sharing economy platforms have grown to offer various commercial opportunities to a growing but still limited user base. We conceptualize engagement in the sharing economy as a form of online participation, and apply a digital inequalities perspective to examine the social stratification of commercial sharing. Based on the Internet access model established by Van Dijk, we analyze the effects of social structural antecedents on various access stages. Initial studies indicate that the sharing economy is characterized by second-order consumption, addressing user wants more than needs. Therefore, we draw on Bourdieu to complement Van Dijk's model through a habitual perspective. Analyzing data collected in a survey of more than 6000 individuals from 12 European countries, we find that while social structural antecedents are critical in explaining initial usage of sharing services, their effect on repeat usage is less evident. Some indicators, such as education and social capital, even negatively relate to usage intensity. In turn, we find that a habitus of innovativeness and community-orientation significantly bolsters initial usage, but materialism, rather than material requirements, characterizes higher levels of engagement in the sharing economy.

TI Destination sustainability in the sharing economy: a conceptual
   framework applying the capital theory approach
SO CURRENT ISSUES IN TOURISM
AB The introduction of the sharing economy has been seen as a potential pathway to destination sustainability. However, without a holistic measurement, its impact on destination sustainability is unclear. This study introduces the capital theory approach to define destination sustainability via four capitals: natural, manufactured, human, and social. Each capital is further deconstructed into five stakeholders, their assets, and co-created service values supported by well-established theories (stakeholder theory, resource theory, and service-dominant logic) to fit the context. Based on a layer-by-layer analysis, a comprehensive conceptual framework is proposed to delineate the relationship between the sharing economy and destination sustainability from a destination capital's perspective. The framework provides knowledge advancement and practical guidance for destination sustainability in the sharing economy.

AB Taking college students as experimental objects and selecting the green consumption of "quilt cover laundering" in the hotel as the research scenario, this study discusses the effect of information frame and motivation attribution on the green consumption behavior of hotel consumers by the scenario experiment of 3 (Gain frame/ loss frame / nonframe) x2 (self-interest attribution / altruism attribution). The results show that the framing effect exists extensively in the hotel green consumption scenario, and the loss frame can promote the green consumption behaviors of the hotel consumers better than the gain frame. Moreover, the loss frame can promote the green consumption behaviors of the hotel consumers better than gain frame when the hotel consumers make the altruistic attribution to the corporate motives. However, when hotel consumers make the self-interest attribution to corporate motives, there is no significant difference between the loss framing effect and gain framing effect, and it is hard for them to promote consumers' green consumption behavior intentions. This study will help hotels guide consumers to implement green consumption

TI Sharing economy: Studying the social and psychological factors and the
   outcomes of social exchange
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB Against the backdrop of the growing reliance of consumers on the sharing economy, the literature still has little evidence on the psychological and social factors of use behaviour and outcomes. Given the gaps in the research, this study adopted an overarching approach to comprehensively investigate the role of the factors facilitating social exchange, reciprocity expectation and social value in use behaviour. The effects of the sharing economy on social inclusion and subjective well-being were also tested. The data were collected from 487 users of different sharing economy platforms in the United States. Structural equation modelling was employed to analyse the correlation of the examined variables. The findings indicated that the use of the sharing economy was conditioned by the positive effect of egoistic belief, reciprocity norm, social value, and the negative effect of identification. Also, the study found strong relationships between use behaviour and outcomes, moderated by age, use frequency and use intensity. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are provided.

TI Digital attrition: The negative implications of the sharing economy for
   the digital options of incumbent firms
SO INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL
AB One of the key competitive advantages of sharing economy platforms stems from their superior IT capabilities, which enable operations that are more efficient and/or effective than the incumbent firms. However, given that many of the incumbents tend to be established market leaders or resource-rich multi-nationals, their general inability to acquire the appropriate digital options (ie, the IT capabilities that enable the launch of, and response to, competitive actions) to meet the challenge of the sharing economy platforms is puzzling. This study explores this phenomenon by posing the research question: How do the "forces at work" associated with the sharing economy paradigm impact the digital options of incumbent firms? Based on the case of Qiangsheng Taxi and how its IT capabilities have been affected by the emergence of ridesharing platforms, the evidence uncovered suggests that the sharing economy can influence the digital options of incumbent firms through a process of digital attrition, which may be induced by a blend of unfavorable contextual influences (ie, an unbalanced regulatory regime, evolving market preferences and the resourcing advantages of sharing economy platforms). A framework is inductively derived from the data collected that depicts digital attrition as a process of three phases: (a) deinstitutionalization, (b) technological incapacitation, and (c) competitive erosion. In doing so, our study suggests that digital attrition may culminate in IT-induced competitive disadvantages for incumbent firms, which in turn, could exacerbate the unfavorable contextual influences to complete a vicious cycle that reinforces the negative influence of the sharing economy even further.

TI Challenges of the Sharing Economy for SMEs: A Literature Review
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The sharing economy is becoming increasingly popular in many sectors also thanks to the fact that not only young generation, but people of almost all ages are digitally literate, and therefore they readily participate in sharing economy practices. A very important part of their motivation comes from the knowledge that it is a great way to save money, but a no less important reason is the philosophical aspect, which is consistent with efforts to promote more sustainable consumption practices that prioritize access over ownership. The sharing economy has become a subject of interest not only among researchers and practitioners but also among policymakers and stakeholders who are concerned about the further extension of digital ecosystems. Fortunately, theorists from many fields, such as the commercial economy, gift economy, entrepreneurship, digital transformation, etc., pay due attention to this phenomenon. However, there is still room for focused exploration of this entrepreneurial and innovative approach from specific views in order to bring useful findings and insights on given issues. The intention of this study is to analyze the existing related literature and categorize sharing economy-based business models in relation to traditional business models. Potentially, this study can also contribute to a better understanding of the perspectives of the sharing economy in the transition of SMEs towards the Industry 4.0 paradigm.

TI Sociomaterial practices for value co-creation in the sharing economy
   Evidence from Xbed's access-based accommodation service
SO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & PEOPLE
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to address the research question of how human actors and technology interact together in practices in the context of a sharing economy. The theoretical foundation of this paper is based on the existing literature about the sharing economy and studies that have been carried out examining value co-creation and sociomateriality. Design/methodology/approach This paper adopts a qualitative case study method for the empirical investigation. Using theoretical sampling, Xbed, an internet, unmanned and self-service hotel platform based in Guangzhou, China, was chosen for the empirical investigation. The case was built on multiple sources of data, including archival materials, on-site fieldwork and in-depth interviews. Then, the case was interpreted based on a number of theoretical concepts, with a particular emphasis on the sociomaterial perspective. Findings This paper shows how human actors and technology interact with one another in a number of interrelated ways, which collectively result in the value co-creation necessary for creating a sharing economy. The authors have found that various forms of sociomateriality (the intersection between technology, work and organization) play a key role in co-creation and that interactions between these sociomaterial assemblages (assemblage-to-assemblage (A2A)) drive the development of a sharing economy. These sociomaterial assemblages have dynamic and evolving characteristics. Originality/value This paper conceptualizes the sharing economy as a system of value co-creation practices and empirically examines such practices from a sociomaterial perspective. This paper adopts the concept of sociomaterial assemblages to investigate sharing practices, through which the knowledge of the role of technology in the development of a sharing economy is enhanced. This paper also expands the knowledge of service-dominant logic by using a microfoundation perspective to look at the value co-creation that emerges as a result of the interaction between sociomaterial assemblages. These assemblages also act as constitutive elements of a service ecosystem.

AB In this paper, we present an evolutionary trust game to investigate the formation of trust in the so-called sharing economy from a population perspective. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to model trust in the sharing economy using the evolutionary game theory framework. Our sharing economy trust model consists of four types of players: a trustworthy provider, an untrustworthy provider, a trustworthy consumer, and an untrustworthy consumer. Through systematic simulation experiments, five different scenarios with varying proportions and types of providers and consumers were considered. Our results show that each type of players influences the existence and survival of other types of players, and untrustworthy players do not necessarily dominate the population even when the temptation to defect (i.e., to be untrustworthy) is high. Our findings may have important implications for understanding the emergence of trust in the context of sharing economy transactions.

TI Assessing Resources Management for Sharing Economy in Urban Logistics
SO RESOURCES-BASEL
AB Sharing economy requires cities to redefine their management strategies. As a consequence of the development of new ideas, the main aim of modern cities should focus on achieving the sustainable use of resources. In the existing literature, only a partial analysis of resources management in cities can be found. For this reason, the authors decided to prepare the framework for empirical research about resources management in sharing economy in cities, especially in the urban logistics system. The main aim of the study is systematizing criteria related to the assessment of the management of urban resources in the era of sharing economy. To achieve the goal of the research, a systematic literature review was made according to chosen approaches and procedures. This resulted in creating a set of criteria for the analysis and evaluation of resources management in urban areas. It contains five areas with 26 criteria and a map of assumed correlations between them. Those outcomes can be used by local authorities or even other urban logistics stakeholders to define or improve their actions aimed at developing a sharing economy services portfolio on the local market. Additionally, they constitute a set of initial information for further scientific research.

TI Bridging the gap between evacuations and the sharing economy
SO TRANSPORTATION
AB This paper examines the opportunities for addressing evacuations by leveraging the sharing economy. To support this research, we use a mixed-method approach employing archival research of sharing economy actions, 24 high-ranking expert interviews, and a survey of individuals impacted by Hurricane Irma in 2017 (n = 645). Using these data, we contribute to the literature in four key ways. First, we summarize sharing economy company actions in 30 U.S. disasters. Second, we discuss results from 24 expert interviews on 11 sharing economy benefits (ranging from resource redundancy to positive company press coverage) and 13 limitations (ranging from driver reliability to the digital divide). Experts included six directors/executives of emergency/transportation agencies, two executives of sharing economy companies, and eight senior-level agency leaders. Third, we use these interviews, specifically negative opinions of the sharing economy, to inform our Hurricane Irma survey, which contributes empirical evidence of the feasibility of shared resources. Despite just 1.1% and 5.4% of respondents using transportation network companies (TNCs, also known as ridesourcing and ridehailing) and homesharing respectively during the Irma evacuation, some respondents were extremely willing to offer their own resources including transportation before evacuating (29.1%), transportation while evacuating (23.6%), and shelter for free (19.2%) in a future disaster. We also find spare capacity of private assets exists for future evacuations with just 11.1% and 16% of respondents without spare seatbelts and beds/mattresses, respectively. Finally, we conclude with practice-ready policy recommendations for public agencies to leverage shared resources including: communication partnerships, surge flagging (i.e., identifying and reducing unfair price increases), and community-based sharing systems.

TI Booking experiences on sharing economy platforms: an exploration of
   tourists' motivations and constraints
SO CURRENT ISSUES IN TOURISM
AB The tourism sector is being currently characterized by the introduction of tours and activities provided by sharing economy platforms (e.g. Airbnb) and non-professional local guides. Since this recent introduction, no study has so far explored what motivates and constrains travellers to book this type of experiences. This paper contributes to fill this gap by investigating travellers' motivations and constraints for choosing these experiences over traditional tour providers. Adopting a qualitative approach, Italian prospective travellers' perspectives were explored through semi-structured interviews. The findings confirm the importance of authenticity, social interaction, location, and trust as factors influencing the use of sharing economy tourism services, beyond accommodations. When considering to choose peer-to-peer guiding, travellers are also motivated by novelty, quality and personal interest, logistics, and the social dimension of sharing economy philosophy. Sharing economy use constraints such as product scarcity, effort and independence expectancy prevent the choice of peer-to-peer tours and activities. Lack of awareness and distribution, timing, and lack of economic benefits also constrain the choice of these experiences through their platforms. Recommendations for marketers and operators are made to improve the promotion and delivery of tours and activities by sharing economy platforms.

TI Innovating the innovated: Business model innovation process in sharing
   economy companies
SO CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION MANAGEMENT
AB Business model innovation (BMI) allows firms to rethink the mechanisms of value creation and proposition and capture in order to adapt to the ever-changing environment and increase competitive advantage. Despite already innovative compared to the incumbents, sharing economy platforms also feel the need to continuously innovate their business model (BM) to ensure their survival. However, these platforms are often studied under a static perspective, focusing on the outcome of the innovation rather than on the process underlying it. The purpose of the paper is to unveil the process of BMI in the already innovative BM of sharing economy platforms, focusing on the different degrees this innovation can take place. In so doing, a mixed-methods was applied, clustering a sample of 72 sharing platforms, and completing the results with a qualitative analysis on a subsample of those. What this research demonstrates is that sharing economy platforms do feel the need to innovate their BM just as strongly as incumbents, giving rise to an innovation-in-the-innovation that fills the gap between the process- and the outcome-oriented interpretations of BMI. The four identified clusters shed light on the different forms of BMI that happen in sharing economy platforms.

TI Market, Hierarchy, or Clan? Types of Governance in the Sharing Economy
SO THEORIZING THE SHARING ECONOMY:VARIETY AND TRAJECTORIES OF NEW FORMS OF
   ORGANIZING
SE Research in the Sociology of Organizations
AB The rise of the sharing economy has brought with it a huge variety of new organizational forms and innovative business models. An integral part of these forms and models is the communities and members of sharing-economy organizations, since they significantly contribute to value creation for these organizations. Relying on community member contributions, though, is a challenge for these organizations because fluid community boundaries and voluntary membership makes it difficult to coordinate their activities. This chapter investigates the under-researched question of how sharing-economy organizations govern the actions of their community members. Following an abductive approach that included site visits, participant observations, and 67 interviews, we develop a framework that illustrates four different types of governance: pure market, pure clan, market-hierarchy hybrid, and clan-hierarchy hybrid. The framework explains differences among these types depending on the main activity (providing resources or producing jointly) and the primary aim of the community (business orientation or social orientation). This study thus contributes to research on both governance in general and to sharing-economy organizations in particular by capturing the variety and diversity of community forms, governance practices, and business-model configurations.

AB Recent evidence has revealed that Sharing Economy platforms such as Uber, Airbnb, and TaskRabbit, have become active hubs for digital discrimination. This new form of discrimination refers to a phenomenon where a business transaction is influenced by race, gender, age, or any other non-business related characteristic of providers or consumers. Existing research often tackles this problem from a socio-economic and regulatory points of view. However, the research on the design aspects of Sharing Economy software, which enable such complex socio-technical problems to emerge online, is still underdeveloped. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a new perspective on digital discrimination, tackling the problem from a Requirements Engineering point of view. Specifically, we analyze a large dataset of online user feedback as well as synthesize existing literature to identify and classify pervasive discrimination concerns in the Sharing Economy market. Based on this analysis, we devise a crowd-driven domain model to represent these concerns along with their relations to the functional features and user goals of Sharing Economy platforms. This model is intended to provide requirements engineers, working on Sharing Economy software, with systematic insights into the complex types of socio-technical problems that can emerge in the operational environments of their systems.

An important reason for sharing economy's rise to prominence is the operational efficiencies it introduces, and the related savings and other economic benefits it unlocks. In this paper, we provide a framework identifying and describing the forces of sharing economy that fuel the success of the novel business models of the concept. In addition, we study two applications, namely ride sharing and group buying, in more detail, analyzing the operational efficiencies created by each business model with the framework we introduced and providing evidence from recent related literature for the efficiency gains they bring about. Finally we discuss some potential downsides and pitfalls that arise as the side effects of these operational efficiencies of sharing economy business models, and the related regulatory issues ahead that may need attention.

TI SHARING ECONOMY AND CIRCULAR ECONOMY. HOW TECHNOLOGY AND COLLABORATIVE
   CONSUMPTION INNOVATIONS BOOST CLOSING THE LOOP STRATEGIES
SO ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB Sharing economy business experiences are rapidly rising worldwide and deeply changing structures and models of customers purchasing attitudes and needs. Inspired by principles of sustainable consumption, its starting point is the idea that every underutilized resource is a wasted resource. Beyond the digital services implemented by sharing platform, there are also social and physical places where communities are experimenting the potential of collaborative and innovative solutions: purchasing groups, time banking, social street, co-working spaces. Goods and services access promoted by sharing business models are emerging in the place of older model based on private propriety and a consumerist view of society. This is strongly connected with circular economy strategies, particularly referred to waste prevention, reduction and resources valorisation European goals. This paper gives an overview of sharing economy including drivers and barriers which can affect its effective expansion. Moreover, collaborative models in the most strategic and critical sectors (such as mobility, agro-food, buildings and goods production and consumption) by a resources perspective, will be analysed to show how sharing economy can contribute to circular economy. At this end, this paper explores the circularity approach and in particular it identifies the role of sharing economy in products and services from a life cycle thinking (LCT) approach. The focus will be the benefits of the sharing economy models considering mainly two aspects; a) the length of the product's use phase (lifetime) and b) the intensity of use. A review of available data considering the most strategic sectors in terms of environmental impacts, will also be presented from a sharing economy point of view.

TI Digitalisation and the sharing economy. A survey-based research on
   Airbnb in Romania
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL
AB The collaborative (or sharing) economy continues to shape the tourism industry, challenging both the traditional areas of supply, but especially the trust and digital skills of users, the acceptance of platforms and new inter-personal and community relationships. In the present paper a crosssectional quantitative research was conducted with non-random convenience sampling in order to determine the impact of the collaborative Airbnb platform among Romanian tourists, how wellknown it is and what elements motivate tourists to choose this platform. We also want to analyse the extent to which the benefits and innovations brought by this new phenomenon are in line with the needs and expectations of tourists and whether they are interested in this phenomenon, the extent to which tourists have chosen the Airbnb platform to stay in Romania or abroad.

TI The challenges of applying turnover threshold to the sharing economy for
   control of concentrations between undertakings in China
SO COMPUTER LAW & SECURITY REVIEW
CT Conference on The Sharing Economy in China - Regulation or De-Regulation
   for Innovation?
CY MAR 27, 2018
CL Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB The existing notification threshold for Chinese control of concentrations between undertakings is a turnover threshold, complemented by a market share threshold. The business model adopted by platform enterprises in the sharing economy, where services are provided free and subsidies are given to the platform's basic users, make it very hard for platform enterprises to produce notable turnover for a long period of time; therefore, the turnover threshold is unlikely to be satisfied in the context of concentrations. On the other hand, it is also not appropriate to apply the traditional methodology of constitutionality analysis and the SSNIP (Small but Significant and Non-Transitory Increase in Price) test to define the relevant market for the sharing economy, which is characterized by a two-sided market and cross-group network externalities. The size-of-transaction threshold reflects the importance of the number of basic users to the market power possessed by platform enterprise and has the same advantages of transparency and certainty. Therefore, legislation can be used to introduce the size-of-transaction threshold to Chinese control of concentrations between undertakings in addition to the traditional turnover threshold.

TI The Business Model of Digital Platforms for the Sharing Economy:
   Intensive Case Study Methodology for Rover.com Pet Boarding Platform
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The sharing economy has allowed idle resources to be used again and is known as a model for the new economy. Advances in network technology have allowed the scale of the sharing economy to be expanded through digital platforms. To our best knowledge, no studies in the literature have explored a pet boarding platform for the sharing economy. This research selected the emerging pet care industry as its scope and took the Rover.com pet boarding digital platform, with the highest market share in the world, as the research object for an intensive case study. Three types of secondary data analysis were used: industry profile analysis, case information, and papers and journals. The business model and value proposition of the platform summarizes the key to the success of digital platforms, which is expected to be helpful to entrepreneurs who want to create a sharing economy marketplace. The research results showed that the sharing economy needs to use digital platforms as a matching intermediary between supply and demand to establish a personal-to-personal transaction pattern and it also needs digital platforms to establish a sense of trust and a guarantee mechanism for participants in the sharing economy. For the digital platform to be profitable, it must identify the platform's unique value proposition and business model, and set up monitoring of transaction parties and evaluation functions, as well as insurance systems and digital platform IT support.

TI Understanding public relations in the 'sharing economy'
SO PUBLIC RELATIONS REVIEW
AB In spite of the macro-economic impact of the so-called 'sharing economy' there is a nearly complete dearth of contributions from the communication academy to its discourse. More attention is overdue, particularly for the conceptual pressure the 'sharing economy' is exerting on the public relations function. The authors propose a reconceptualization of public relations by identifying the constitutive aspects of the sharing economy and bringing together the explanatory concepts 'circuits of commerce' and 'viable matches' from economic sociology and communicative constitution of organizations theory to develop the notions of 'deliberate disintermediation' and 'circuits of communication' in public relations. The contention is that by doing this, communicative acts not only contribute meaning in the sharing economy, but have economic value. Furthermore, the sharing economy poses challenges to the traditional forms of organizing public relations functions, but offers opportunities to realize different potential when public relations facilitates circuits of communication and becomes a meta-communicative competence embedded within the organization.

TI Inequalities, limits and possibilities for the transformation of capital
   in the sharing economy
SO REDES COM-REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS PARA EL DESARROLLO SOCIAL DE LA
   COMUNICACION
AB The economic crisis that began in 2008 has affected, although in different ways, the majority of the population. In general, people have lost purchasing power. This context has facilitated the development and growth of the sharing economy, opening a new market where the population can consume at a lower price and earn extra income by offering various types of services. This study aims to analyze the possibilities of the population to earn extra income through the so-called sharing economy. It is suggested that the income in these economies depends on four factors: the possibilities of access, the costs of participation, the potential benefits and the profitability. It also raises the question that these four factors, in turn, depend on the socio-economic conditions of the person, mainly its economic capital and, to a lesser extent, its human capital. Analyzing the magnitude of the economic capital and then human capital incorporated by the various forms of sharing economy, along with the costs of transformation of these capitals in greater magnitudes of capital, a typology has been developed that allows us to classify different models of sharing economy. We reach the conclusion that people do not have the same capacity to earn extra income through thre sharing economy, emerging a duality: for people with greater economic-and human-capital, sharing economies constitute a new market in which to accumulate greater magnitudes of capital than in the traditional economy; for people with less economic-and human-capital, sharing economies become a form of precarious, vulnerable and unprofitable type of work through which to earn extra incomes. Thus, it is concluded that the sharing economy is creating a radically unequal market that reproduces and expands social inequalities of the traditional economy.

TI The Trap of Success: A Paradox of Scale for Sharing Economy and Degrowth
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Over the recent years, the sharing economy has been discussed as a community-based solution for a more sustainable future. Supported by the development of information technologies and defined by a large range of activities based on the access of underutilized resources over ownership, the sharing economy has been framed as a socio-economic model that is able to increase social bonding and collaboration and to reduce the inefficient allocation of resources. Within this framework, the sharing economy seems to align with the ideas of degrowth, broadly defined as a downscaling of production and consumption activities oriented to increase environmental quality and social collaboration. Despite the connections existing between them, no previous studies investigate the two concepts together. By considering the evidence provided by previous literature, this paper maps the links and similarities existing between sharing economy and degrowth and analyzes the discrepancies existing between the promises of the sharing economy and the impacts generated by practices. A paradox of scale, where the sharing activities fail to deliver as a consequence of success is also discussed together with future research directions. This paper contributes to the existing debate around alternative economic models and can support the design of sustainable practices.

AB The present study explores the relationships between entrepreneurship motives, attitude, and behavioral intention of Indian residents toward the meal-sharing economy. The study implements a self-administered questionnaire to collect quantitative data. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) were binarily performed to test the aforementioned relationships. The PLS-SEM results show that the gratification of hosting, social interaction, and independence positively impact residents' attitudes toward sharing economy. Moreover, social interaction, source of cultural capital, and gratification of hosting also positively influence the intention to participate in the meal-sharing economy. Moreover, the fsQCA results demonstrate that several configurations of the dimensions of entrepreneurship motivations generate the attitude toward the meal-sharing economy and the intention to participate in the meal-sharing economy. Based on the results, several theoretical and practical implications were suggested.

AB The sharing economy, a term we use to refer to business models built around on-demand access to products and services mediated by online platforms that match many small suppliers or service providers to many small buyers, has emerged as an important area of study in operations management. We first describe three "canonical" applications that have garnered much attention from the operations management community. We use these applications to highlight distinguishing features of sharing economy business models and to point out research questions that are new. Then we draw connections between classical operations management theory and models and those that have been used to study sharing economy applications. We do so to put in context some of the recent work on the sharing economy and to showcase the underlying modeling toolkit and identify opportunities for future research.

It further validates the relationships between service quality, satisfaction, and loyalty in the sharing economy driven business context. Building on relevant literature and 71 qualitative interviews, we identified information congruity, competence, and empathy as key factors in online service quality. Offline service quality factors include structural assurance and platform responsiveness. These five factors were included in a model for user loyalty investigation, which was tested on data from 294 questionnaires from Chinese mobile car-hailing service users. Attitudes towards the sharing economy were validated to moderate the relationship between service quality and loyalty. This study contributes to the theoretical development of service quality management, specifically in the context of emerging sharing economy driven carhailing mobile markets.

TI Efficient Decentralized Sharing Economy Model based on Blockchain
   Technology: A Case Study of Najm for Insurance Services Company
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB Blockchain is an emerging technology that is used to address ownership, centrality, and security issues in different fields. The blockchain technology has converted centralized applications into decentralized and distributed ones. In existing sharing economy applications, there are issues related to low efficiency and high complexity of services. However, blockchain technology can be adopted to overcome these issues by effectively opening up secure information channels of the sharing economy industry and other related parties, encouraging industry integration and improving the ability of sharing economy organizations to readily gain required information. This paper discusses blockchain technology to enhance the development of insurance services by proposing a five-layer decentralized model using Ethereum platform. The Najm for Insurance Services Company in Saudi Arabia was employed in a case study for applying the proposed model to effectively solve the issue of online underwriting, and to securely and efficiently enhance the verification and validation of transactions. The paper concludes with a review of the lessons learned and provides suggestions for blockchain application development process.

AB The sharing economy (SE) has been studied from various perspectives, but ridesharing is a particularly popular type of SE that has manifested around the world. Prior studies of the SE have largely explored customers' perspectives, with drivers' perspectives remaining largely unexplored. Due to its various business models, cultures, driver traits, and consumer groups, the Middle East is an important area for SE research. This study, therefore, aims to explore the drivers' perceptions of the sharing economy in Qatar and how culture, public transport, regular taxi services, and unexpected incidences affect the sharing economy in Qatar. Based mainly on 31 face-toface interviews with SE drivers, this study reveals several insights into the SE in Qatar. It identifies the main perceptions that drivers have of SE firms, driving distress, and customer hassles, as well as why drivers are motivated to engage with the SE and the system for drivers to rate customers and vice versa. Based on the findings, this study discusses the implications and some potential directions for future research.

TI Sharing Economy for Tackling Crypto-Laundering: The Europol Associated
   'Global Conference on Criminal Finances and Cryptocurrencies'
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This article examines the compatibility of the Global Conference on Criminal Finances and Cryptocurrencies with a sharing economy model. The analysis is based on the claims presented in Europol documents and public statements of Europol executives that this initiative serves as a platform for knowledge exchange and building professional networks between public and private actors to tackle crypto-laundering. The article investigates the validity of these statements with the most prominent sharing economy concepts: low barrier accessibility, transaction cost and trust-building. The article employs each sharing economy concept on two beneficiaries of the platform-law enforcement agencies (LEAs) and non-governmental organizations-while scaling the platform's sharing economy level. Based on Europol documents, an expert interview and participant observation of the 5th Global Cryptocurrency Conference, the article's core argument is that these cryptocurrency conferences can be categorized as a 'partial' sharing economy platform. They reduce the transaction cost for public and private actors to share knowledge about the latest trends and threats about crypto-laundering and reduce transaction costs for networking. However, co-founders should consider integrating robust trust-building mechanisms that allow low barrier entry to the conference, which will facilitate more inclusive and optimized public-private partnerships (P3).

TI Provider experience and order selection in the sharing economy
SO INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL
AB The sharing economy, enabled by digital platforms, which connect providers and consumers for peer-to-peer exchanges, experienced rapid growth in recent years. Although researchers attempted to explore the societal or business impact of the sharing economy market, little is known about how individual providers operate their businesses, given that providers are capacity-constrained, self-scheduled and unprofessional. In this study, we are interested in the relationship between experience and providers' order selection behaviours. Leveraging a rich and proprietary dataset from a large sharing economy platform-which facilitates the exchanges of home-cooked meals in China-and employing multiple identification strategies and estimation methods, we find that the number of orders declined by a provider first increases with their experience, but later decreases. However, their sales revenue keeps increasing with experience. Our investigation further reveals that this happens because providers adjust their order selection strategies at different experience levels to achieve higher revenue in the sharing economy. Our study is among the pioneering studies to empirically understand providers' market behaviours in the sharing economy and offers important practical implications.

TI The limits of trust-free systems: A literature review on blockchain
   technology and trust in the sharing economy
SO ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
AB At the tip of the hype cycle, trust-free systems based on blockchain technology promise to revolutionize interactions between peers that require high degrees of trust, usually facilitated by third party providers. Peer-to-peer platforms for resource sharing represent a frequently discussed field of application for "trust-free" blockchain technology. However, trust between peers plays a crucial and complex role in virtually all sharing economy interactions. In this article, we hence shed light on how these conflicting notions may be resolved and explore the potential of blockchain technology for dissolving the issue of trust in the sharing economy. By means of a dual literature review we find that 1) the conceptualization of trust differs substantially between the contexts of blockchain and the sharing economy, 2) blockchain technology is to some degree suitable to replace trust in platform providers, and that 3) trust-free systems are hardly transferable to sharing economy interactions and will crucially depend on the development of trusted interfaces for blockchain-based sharing economy ecosystems.

SO ROSSIISKII ZHURNAL MENEDZHMENTA-RUSSIAN MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB Goal: to systematize the factors of consumer participation in collaborative consumption at different levels of the sharing economy . Methodology: a systematic review of the literature on the topic of the factors of consumer participation in collaborative consumption was used as the main research method . For the analysis, the authors selected studies that were published between January 2012 and May 2022 in foreign scientific journals indexed in the scientific citation databases WoS, Scopus, and Google Scholar . As part of the primary selection, the authors analyzed more than 2 thousand publications on the topic . The most relevant papers for the systematic review of the literature were included in the final sample of 151 publications . Findings: as a result of the analysis, the factors of consumer participation in collaborative consumption are systematized into the following groups: economic, technological, political, legal, social, environmental, demographic, psychological, and hedonistic; in addition, the features of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as a separate macro factor are revealed . Each group of factors is described at five levels of the sharing economy: personal, organizational, industry, state, and global . Originality and contributions: from a theoretical point of view, the systematization provides comprehensive information about the factors of consumer participation in sharing at each level of the sharing economy, summarizing a number of existing approaches to interpreting participation factors . Concerning application in practice, the results of the survey may be of interest to companies in the sharing economy sector, since additional information about the interaction of exchange participants at different levels will allow companies to better understand their motives, which will contribute to the development of effective marketing and market strategies, increase sales, strengthen the company's position in the market and the development of an effective response to the challenges of the external economic environment in conditions of economic instability .

TI New Improvement of Labor Accounting in the Sharing Economy
SO ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
AB The investigation of labor is a key aspect of population research, and labor accounting, as its foundation, is an important means to judge the degree of economic development and monitor the changes of the labor market, having always been a focus of scholarly research. At present, the sharing economy is on the rise worldwide and influences labor accounting. In this paper, starting from the context of the sharing economy and the current situation of labor accounting, several important aspects of labor accounting will be discussed. In the context of the sharing economy, household subsistence service production is to be included in the production accounting boundary, which is the root of the changes in labor accounting. On this basis, the following findings are drawn. (1) The scope of accounting for employment should be expanded, which puts higher demands on the labor accounting method. (2) Working time should be remeasured, especially indicators based on pay time. (3) Finally, the design of indicators in labor underutilization also requires the formation of new ideas, especially unemployment should be redefined. Finally, in view of the current status of labor accounting in China, policy suggestions for future improvement under the sharing economy are put forward.

TI Sharing at social distance: "clay-footed giants" coping strategies for
   navigating the pandemic
SO JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 has led in a very short time to a worldwide pandemic that has had severe effects on both businesses and daily lives. In a scenario characterised by the social distancing imperative, the sharing economy found itself struggling to survive, deprived of its core asset, namely, peer (human) relationships. The purpose of this paper is to reveal the coping strategies that have been implemented by sharing economy platforms to navigate the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach An explorative empirical investigation of 20 sharing economy platforms was carried out during the first lockdown phase (March-June 2020). To drive the analysis, a theoretical framework was developed by merging the literature on the business model and crisis management strategies. Findings The answers provided by sharing economy platforms to the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have been classified into nine typologies of intervention according to the developed framework, with illustrative examples. Originality/value This paper provides an empirical investigation into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the sharing economy field and it offers evidence about the immediate reactions of sharing platforms to the health crisis effects. The paper also introduces a framework about business model and crisis management strategies as a conceptual tool that could be adopted by firms from other industries.

TI Blockchain and IoT-Based Cognitive Edge Framework for Sharing Economy
   Services in a Smart City
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based infrastructure to support security- and privacy-oriented spatio-temporal smart contract services for the sustainable Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled sharing economy in mega smart cities. The infrastructure leverages cognitive fog nodes at the edge to host and process offloaded geo-tagged multimedia payload and transactions from a mobile edge and IoT nodes, uses AI for processing and extracting significant event information, produces semantic digital analytics, and saves results in Blockchain and decentralized cloud repositories to facilitate sharing economy services. The framework offers a sustainable incentive mechanism, which can potentially support secure smart city services, such as sharing economy, smart contracts, and cyber-physical interaction with Blockchain and IoT. Our unique contribution is justified by detailed system design and implementation of the framework.

AB Trust has been found as the key determinant of consumer decisions in sharing economy platforms, and service-provider's attributesare crucial fortrust building but rarelystudied. In this paper, we investigate the effect of host's attributes on consumer's purchasing behaviors in xiaozhu.com, a leading short rental platform in China. Specifically, we argue that host's attributescan influencetrustworthiness from the perspective of benevolence, ability, integrity and have significant effects on orders. Furthermore, it is found that consumers prefer to choose women as hosts when book single roomsand genderis an influencing factor in the decision process of ordering. These findings imply that service-provider's attributes can contribute to trust building and decisionmaking in sharing economy. It's expected to make contributions to trust study the oretically and provide practical trust development guides for sharing economy platforms.

The data were collected from 487 users of different sharing economy platforms in the United States. Structural equation modelling was employed to analyse the correlation of the examined variables. The results demonstrated the positive effect of egoistic belief, reciprocity norm, social value, and the negative effect of identification on the use of the sharing economy. In addition, strong relationships between use behaviour and outcomes were identified. Future research suggestions are provided.

TI POLICY, LEGAL AND REGULATION RESEARCH IN THE SHARING ECONOMY: A
   BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS AND SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW
SO IIUM LAW JOURNAL
AB The sharing economy has changed the way we think about services, assets, and ownership. This phenomenon has shaped a new economic model which emphasises sharing over property ownership. Shared platforms such as Airbnb, Grab, and Uber are increasing in size and popularity exponentially, causing certain political and legal issues associated with such growth. In this regard, this paper aims to investigate the evolution of policy, legal and regulatory research in the sharing economy from the year 1995 to the year 2020 and focuses on new research topics in this field. To achieve this goal, the study utilised extensive bibliometric analysis to identify and analyse 343 articles published in SCOPUS indexed journals from 2004 to 2020. The result shows that research on the sharing economy has increased since 2000. However, the total number of publications in SCOPUS journal relating to policies and regulations still lags behind as compared to the publications in other disciplines. Most of the published research is in the form of concept papers and empirical research. Nevertheless, it is still inadequate. This study summarises the evolution of publications over time and outlines the interests of current research and the potential directions for future research, including addressing policy and organisational research issues in the sharing economy.

TI The Societal Impact of Sharing Economy Platform Self-Regulations-An
   Empirical Investigation
SO INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH
AB The rise of the sharing economy has disrupted traditional industries and has had many unforeseen societal impacts. This has sparked policy debates on whether and how the sharing economy should be regulated to promote the healthy growth of such markets. In this research, we examine the impact of platform selfregulations in the context of the home-sharing market. Using policy changes that reduce the number of Airbnb listings, we deploy a difference-in- difference approach to empirically test the impact of platform self-regulations on crime rate. Our results suggest that a reduction in Airbnb listings resulting from platform self- regulations leads to a reduction in crime. We further study the impact of these policy changes on different types of crime and find that these self-regulations lead to a reduction in incidents of crimes such as assault, robbery, and burglary but an increase in theft incidents. In addition, we use geographically weighted regression to investigate the heterogeneous effects of Airbnb occupancy on different types of neighborhoods, and we show that income, housing price, and population moderate the impact of the regulations. This research contributes to our understanding of the societal impacts of the sharing economy and the impact of platform self-regulation. Our findings also provide empirical evidence to inform policy making.

AB This article reviews recent literature (e.g. Kumar et al., 2018) concerning the service-focused character of the global sharing economy. Using data from BLS, Brookings Analysis of Census Bureau, Moody's data, U.S. Census Bureau, and U.S. Department of Labor, we performed analyses and made estimates regarding share of workers in each type of alternative work arrangement, the percentage of all U.S. workers who are either self-employed or hold multiple jobs, non-employer business growth by industry (2003-2018), and non-employer firms and employment (U.S.). Empirical and secondary data are used to support the claim that the sharing economy deals with the short-run rental of a certain service. As a result of the service-focused character of the sharing economy, service suppliers should provide first-rate service quality as they have a direct communication with the customers. Such suppliers in the sharing economy are not accountable for any marketing proposals as this is regulated by the service enabler. In the sharing economy, agents employ digital technologies to convert their capital or labor assets into cash by proposing them to their peers as short-run rental units. The sharing economy facilitates value transfer by adequately harmonizing time and money: it is time saving for customers via availability, brings about monetary value for service suppliers who provide their assets, and offers both time and money for service facilitators.

By adopting a public good perspective in analysing the main features of the circular business models, this study underlines how the sharing economy business models are well integrated and complementary to some features of the circular economy, representing a strong pulling factor. Other loops of the circular economy need an explicit push factor, individuated in a strong impulse to eco-efficiency, to be reached through consistent incentives to invest in R & D for eco-innovations.

Despite the varying levels of legislative status of the sharing economy, systematic research on governance that frames regulatory issues on such innovations has been lacking in the academic literature, particularly in the public administration field. In this research, we (1) examine determinants that influence the legislative status of regulations with a focus on sharing economy innovations in the U.S., and (2) explore the stakeholder groups that are perceived to be influential in shaping the regulatory environment among U.S. local government policymakers. The results indicate that stakeholder groups actively engaged in legislative lobbying as well as jurisdictional characteristics such as geographical region are associated with whether a local government is active in regulating the local sharing economy. This article offers insights into how policymakers govern the innovations taking place in their communities.

Aiming to capture the current state-of-the-art research on pricing strategies in the sharing economy and foreseeing directions for future research, this article conducts a systematic literature review and content analysis of 158 articles from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. As a result, first, this review proposes an extended definition covering B2C and C2C models and a model structure covering the entire supply chain, based on which 158 articles are categorized into nine sub-models covering 30 scenarios. Second, the general characteristics (i.e., research fields, time and journal distributions, research themes and scenarios) and technical details (i.e., theories, methodologies, approaches, models, and conclusions) of the 158 articles are reviewed and summarized by the pricing party, business mode, and scenario. Finally, this review proposes some future research directions of existing scenarios from the perspectives of information asymmetry, market competition, and empirical approaches, and discusses some extensions, including uninvestigated scenarios and COVID-19-related topics; correspondingly, this review suggests some analytical models and empirical approaches that can be employed to fill these gaps. The proposed research directions and corresponding approaches can be references for future research.

TI Sharing Economy Making Supply Meet Demand Introduction
SO SHARING ECONOMY: MAKING SUPPLY MEET DEMAND
SE Springer Series in Supply Chain Management
AB This introduction provides an overview of the book with highlights of all chapters.
   This book aims to address what it takes to be successful in today's sharing economy from an operational perspective. Sharing economy may refer to an online platform that enables individuals or small entities as buyers and sellers to "transact" effectively and efficiently or a market model that allows sharing of access to goods and services. Operations management has the tradition of coming from and going back to real-life applications. It deals with the management of the processes of matching supply with demand. The emerging business processes in a sharing economy call for active management, as well as adequate attention from operations researchers. However, as the business side of a sharing economy is still emerging and rapidly evolving, there is a lack of a comprehensive overview of ongoing academic efforts in addressing its operational problems. To fill the void, this book is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to present cutting-edge research on sharing economy from globally recognized field experts organized in one place. For future research directions, a good resource is Chen et al. (2018).

The mediating influence of motivation and the moderating impact of environment concern on all proposed relationships were also investigated. Data were collected by using a structured questionnaire survey at different eco-locations. The research uses the data from 341 valid observations collected in the survey of 550 visitors. The findings indicated the significant association of eco-brand and eco-label with green consumption intention. Eco-brand was revealed as the most important factor impacting green consumption intention. However, the relationship between social media and green consumption intention was mediated by motivation and moderated by environment concern. This study contributes to theoretical and practical implications by proposing the green behavioral model.

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Although food surplus and food waste issues are extremely important, the amount of literature published on these topics is astonishingly low by our observation. The relationships between food surplus/food waste and economic/environmental sustainability have not yet been holistically assessed and discussed. The main purpose of this study is to understand global food surplus and food waste issues in order to tackle the economic sustainability and environmental sustainability crisis. Content analysis was used to analyze 500 relevant materials and was conducted by NVivo 12 Plus software. The results contain seven countries, six organizations, and six continents, providing a framework to recognize the economic and environmental sustainability crisis. In addition, six major organizations and regions were identified and were found to be relevant to the important issues of food surplus, food waste, the sharing economy, economic sustainability, and environmental sustainability. With the trend of globalization, this study highlights some preliminary evidence for reducing food waste, for conflicts of the sharing economy, and for regulated sustainability. Further research and regulations in terms of economic and environmental sustainability are strongly suggested.

AB The paper deals with services of the sharing economy within the Slovak Republic. A sharing economy is a new form of earnings or cost savings that has evolved thanks to the development of information and communication technologies. At present, it is an indispensable part of the economy of each country. The sharing economy has gained a gradient through the years, and admittedly, it has been adapted globally. The European Union supports innovation, competitiveness and the opportunity for new working conditions created by the sharing economy. In the more developed countries, there are many platforms of the sharing economy. This phenomenon is only at the beginning in Slovakia. The identified research problem was to determine the interest in shared services and their use regarding the population of the Slovak Republic. To achieve the aim of the paper, primary research was conducted. The research was aimed to find the interest in the use of shared services in the Slovak Republic. The questionnaire was answered by residents from all regions of the Slovak Republic. Although, the Slovak Republic is a small country, it has the potential of further development of sharing economy services and thus to help people. The necessary information had been drawn from professional publications in electronic form or directly from the websites focused on a sharing economy.

TI Mapping the sharing economy for sustainability research
SO MANAGEMENT DECISION
AB Purpose - In order to guide sustainability research on the sharing economy, the purpose of this paper is to develop a comprehensive framework that captures the wide range of activities and business models that are considered to be part of the sharing economy.
   Design/methodology/approach - Based on a systematic literature review and a content analysis, existing typologies are identified and analyzed for their conceptual intersections. Finally, categorizations from 43 documents are integrated into one framework.
   Findings - Four main dimensions are identified as being used in different contexts to characterize sharing systems and were combined to form one comprehensive typology: shared good or service, market structure, market orientation, and industry sector.
   Originality/value - The proposed typology is able to distinguish sharing activities based on their similarities and differences. Social, economic, and communicational avenues for the term "sharing" are merged into a conceptual foundation of the sharing economy. This enables researchers, practitioners, and policy makers to position their projects in the broad field of sharing. By discussing inherent tensions with regard to sustainability of the sharing economy, the offered categorizations can help to guide future research and policy intervention. Last but not least, professional managers should find valuable ideas for new business models.

TI The Sharing Economy and the Behaviour of Young Polish Singles: The Case
   of BlaBlaCar
SO GOSPODARKA NARODOWA-THE POLISH JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
AB This article is a research exercise. The purpose of the study is to provide an insight into what young singles know about the sharing economy and what their key motives are for using the BlaBlaCar platform, the most popular sharing economy venture for passenger transport. In the theoretical part of the text, based on a critical analysis of the literature, the concept and essence of the sharing economy are explained, the BlaBlaCar transport service is characterised as a flagship example of the sharing economy, and an attempt is made to explain the terms "single" and " young single". The empirical section focuses on the research conceptualisation and a description of the research sample and its characteristics. Subsequently, following the author's own research, the knowledge of young singles about the sharing economy is analysed, and the most important motives encouraging them to use the BlaBlaCar platform are discussed. The analysis is based on a survey questionnaire administered from May 1 to July 30, 2018 in a sample of 826 young singles who made independent decisions in the market. The survey shows that young singles demonstrated fairly good knowledge of sharing economy ventures and the most popular car sharing websites. However, they are confused about the rich terminology associated with collaborative platforms and often misunderstand the sharing economy, identifying it with the access economy, gift economy or on-demand economy. BlaBlaCar is undoubtedly one of the most popular examples of the practical application of sharing economy fundamentals. The survey reveals that almost three-fifths of respondents use the BlaBlaCar platform. Its active participants are most often men in the 18-23 age group, with a bachelor's or engineering degree, earning a monthly income not exceeding PLN 3,000, and living in cities with over 500,000 inhabitants. Lower travel costs, better travel conditions, the possibility of reaching a destination quickly and directly and environmental considerations proved to be the most important motives for the respondents to use BlaBlaCar. In turn, social relations that are established among the users of websites such as BlaBlaCar. pl are a kind of hybrid of relations developed in direct interaction during shared rides and those built up in cyberspace.

TI INNOVATIONS IN THE INSTITUTIONAL MODELLING OF THE SHARING ECONOMY
SO JOURNAL OF INSTITUTIONAL STUDIES
AB The aim of our research paper is to develop the economic principles for modelling the new trend in the economic relations called "sharing economy". Sharing economy which is a product of social, economic, societal, and technological changes recently emerging and shaping up in the human society is marked by a high penetration into all sectors of the "traditional" economy. The rise of the Internet and the popularity of smartphones enabled its high effectivity and usage, while the rise of the creative economy and "gig" economy made its application very easy to handle. Our paper is based on the methods of institutional analysis. We obtain a number of valuable theoretical results that can be summarized as follows: First, the model of sharing economy has been examined, the main agents of interactions have been identified, among which state structures, digital platforms and companies creating them, as well as citizens themselves, actively participating in economic activities are singled out. Second, transaction costs for the most common types of transactions (peer-to-peer) were determined. Sub-transaction costs (for example, information retrieval), transaction costs in the transaction process, as well as post-transaction costs (for example, reputational costs) are noted. Third, the principles of institutional modelling of sharing economy from the perspective of its effectiveness are defined, a typology of institutions of sharing economy based on the model of interactions of economic agents is proposed. Our results and outcomes might be useful for helping to shape up the rules of the game for the use of sharing economy in the modern economic relations and might be applied by the researchers, stakeholder and policy-makers alike.

TI The sharing economy and the transformation of work: evidence from
   Foodora
SO PERSONNEL REVIEW
AB Purpose This article explores the various stakeholders' perceptions of the ways digital work is organised within the sharing economy and the social implications of the transformation of work. Design/methodology/approach Applying social media analytics (SMA) concerning the sharing economy platform Foodora, a total of 3,251 user-generated content was collected and organised throughout the social media landscape in Sweden over 12 months, and 18 stakeholder groups were identified, discussing digital work within seven thematic categories. Findings The results show that the stakeholder groups in the Swedish context primarily expressed negative views of Foodora's way of organising digital work. The social media posts outlined the distributive and procedural justice related to the working conditions, boycott and protests and critical incidents, as well as the collective bargaining of Foodora. Originality/value By utilising a novel SMA method, this study contributes to the extant literature on the sharing economy by providing a systematic assessment concerning the impact of the sharing economy platform on the transformation of work and the associated social consequences.

AB The sharing economy is an emerging phenomenon that shapes the cultural, economic, and social landscape of our modern world. With variations of the concept of the sharing economy emerging in so many fields, the area of shared mobility - the shared use of a motor vehicle, bicycle, or other mode that enables travellers to gain short-term access to transportation modes on an on-demand basis - has developed as the forerunner of the transformation to be expected in other areas. This article examines how the sphere of personal mobility has been affected by the growth of sharing economy. It contributes to the growing body of shared mobility literature by uncovering innovative mobility-based models that represent solutions on the intersection of shared mobility, physical infrastructure, and integrated-mobility schemes.

AB The emergence of sharing economy implies that consumers tend to pursue a product's value in use rather than its ownership. Therefore, the sharing economy is changing people's consumption habits and raising the new theoretical questions to operation management. Since the sharing economy has subverted the traditional industrial economic pattern, this paper studies consumers' decisions and the sharing platform's pricing strategies with a particular attention to the B2C sharing platform. To this end, this paper conducts two models to investigate the optimal pricing strategy and economic effect of product sharing. A basic model is developed to analyze the economic impact of the sharing economy by comparing with the traditional market, and then, an extended model is studied taking moral hazard of consumer under consideration, finally, numerical experiments are conducted to derive some managerial insights.

This article explores the domains of digital marketing channels-specifically e-mail marketing, social media marketing, and search engine marketing-to understand how they can contribute to growth for organizations in the sharing economy. A detailed conceptual model of the decision spectrum necessary to coordinate digital marketing channels is presented and a special case is made for the role branded-mobile applications play in this context. In particular, branded-mobile applications leverage three embedded components to overcome common deterrents for participating in the sharing economy: trust, utility, and user experience.

TI How does government regulation shape residents? green consumption
   behavior? A multi-agent simulation considering environmental values and
   social interaction
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB Green consumption is an inevitable choice to alleviate environmental pressure and promote sustainable development. Residents' green consumption behavior decisions are influenced by a combination of external government regulation and internal consumer psychological factors. This study incorporated regret theory and environmental values into a multi-agent model to simulate residents' green consumption behavior under various government regulation scenarios. The results show that in the absence of government regulation, residents have little motivation to actively choose green consumption. In terms of a single policy, government subsidy is more conducive to promoting green consumption behavior than government penalty, and the evolutionary trend of group decision making becomes more stable with increased policy intensity. However, neither of the two single regulatory policies can fully promote residents' environmentally conscious consumption decisions. Therefore, a combination of "carrots " (government subsidy) and "sticks " (government penalty) is required to motivate a significant increase in the number of residents who choose green consumption behavior. In addition, the intensity of social interaction between residents is found to influence the stability of behavioral evolution, with higher intensity (i.e., more neighbors) resulting in greater fluctuations in group behavior but driving more residents toward green consumption. These findings can provide a theoretical reference for policy formulation of green consumption behavior.

Based on numerous facts and cases, the essence of sharing economy is clear: it is a new economic form and system based on the Internet. The core of sharing economy is subdivision and application of right of use. Through analysis, it can be found that the sharing economy in tourism industry has the following characteristics: forming a large-scale supply with fragmented transactions; achieving Pareto Optimum by flexible transactions; customers putting more emphasis on right of use; relying on information technology to achieve the best match of supply and demand; changing from sharing among acquaintances to sharing among all people; security and trust are decisive factors.

TI An experimental model of regulating the sharing economy in China: The
   case of online car hailing
SO COMPUTER LAW & SECURITY REVIEW
AB Online car hailing represents a disruptive innovation model in the sharing economy and requires a new regulatory response. China's attempts to regulate this emerging industry can be considered highly experimental model. To relieve the pressure from offline competitors and to clarify the ambiguous legal status of online car hailing, China currently enforces a strict regulatory scheme through what can be described as a central-local dual system. Questions, however, have arisen regarding the legality, proportionality and effectiveness of this approach. Moreover, the current system's choice for a segmented market strategy heavily impairs the sustainable development of the sharing economy. Therefore, the adoption of Internet-based regulations for online car hailing might create better prospects to establish a fairly competitive market as well as to further boost the ever dynamic Internet sharing economy in China.

AB Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have enabled the rise of innovative business models based on the "collaborative consumption" or the "sharing economy". The pioneering business model in the field was built around the knowledge sharing (Wikipedia), but the business logic rapidly expanded in other industries resulting in the establishment of similar business models in tourism, mobility, employment, consumption and other industries. The underlining principle of the "sharing economy" is maximized use of resources leading to the improved efficiency and reduced waste. In addition, these business models allow customers to access requested goods at comparatively lower prices resulting in the improved customer satisfaction and hence, very profitable companies. However, these innovative business models are not fully integrated with existing market conditions since they are rarely aligned with the legislative framework and/or labor market policies. As a result, there are meaningful critics of these business models, where the most severe ones are related to the introduction of a non-fair competition and creating insecure job positions.
   The main aim of the paper is to examine the effects between innovative business models, that based on the principle of "sharing economy" and supported by ICTs, and their external environment, where the external environment is evaluated through well-established PEST tool. Research is undertaken through multiple-case study approach including 10 different innovative business models, allowing the author to make to-certain-extent general conclusions and recommendation. The paper results in the assessment of the integration degree of innovative business models within the external environment and the evaluation of positive and negative effects of implementation of these models for their environment. The major implication of the paper is the proven opinion that principle of "sharing economy" supported by ICT is a paradigm shift in the current economy that will have a power to influence the changing the legislative framework on the global scale.

TI EFFECT OF CONSUMER ENVIRONMENTAL ATTITUDE ON GREEN CONSUMPTION
   DECISION-MAKING
SO PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS
AB In pursuing technological advances and economic prosperity, mankind continues to exploit the earth's resources, resulting in overwhelming burden on the earth's ecology. Balancing the conflict between economic development and environmental protection is an important issue. In recent years, consumers are gradually becoming aware of environmental protection, and likewise green consumption is an issue that has gained world attention. However the market price of green products is higher than that of regular products. Consequently how environmental attitude of consumers impact their decision-making, and how to motivate consumers into purchasing higher priced green products are the primary goals of this research.
   Subjects for this study were consumers purchasing energy-saving light bulbs. The "environmental attitude" construct was introduced into Monroe and Krishnan's (1985) "perceived evaluation model" to establish a complete pattern of green consumption decision-making. Structural equation was then applied to verify the path relationships in the patterns of green consumption decision-making. Results revealed that "perceived value" and "perceived quality" increased with environmental attitude of consumers, leading to positive influence. On the other hand, the income of consumers has moderates effect on "perceived value" and "purchase intention," indicating that the income level of consumers influenced their " perceived value" toward green products and subsequently affect their " purchase intention."

TI The Sharing Economy for the Electricity Storage
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID
AB The sharing economy has upset the market for housing and transportation services. Homeowners can rent out their property when they are away on vacation, car owners can offer ridesharing services. These sharing economy business models are based on monetizing under-utilized infrastructure. They are enabled by peer-to-peer platforms that match eager sellers with willing buyers. Are there compelling sharing economy opportunities in the electricity sector? What products or services can be shared in tomorrow's smart grid? We begin by exploring sharing economy opportunities in the electricity sector, and discuss regulatory and technical obstacles to these opportunities. We then study the specific problem of a collection of firms sharing their electricity storage. We characterize equilibrium prices for shared storage in a spot market. We formulate storage investment decisions of the firms as a non-convex non-cooperative game. We show that under a mild alignment condition, a Nash equilibrium exists, it is unique, and it supports the social welfare. We discuss technology platforms necessary for the physical exchange of power, and market platforms necessary to trade electricity storage. We close with synthetic examples to illustrate our ideas.

TI Is the Meaning of the "Sharing Economy" Shared Among Us? Comparing the
   Perspectives of Japanese and Swedish Policymakers and Politicians
SO REVIEW OF SOCIONETWORK STRATEGIES
AB In another paper in this special issue, we explored how the sharing economy was understood and promoted by researchers in Japan and Sweden, respectively. In this second paper, which is based on two separate archival studies, we proceed by focusing on how the concept is used and understood in the political sphere by politicians and policymakers in the two contexts. On a general level, the sharing economy is understood as an economic model based on the acquisition, provision, and sharing of goods and services, facilitated by digital platforms. This study concludes that within the political spheres in Japan and Sweden there are, however, many different more specific understandings of and assumptions related to the concept. For example, the sharing economy is primarily promoted as a tool for economic revitalization and growth in Japan, while in Sweden its environmental benefits are emphasized. In Japan, there seems to be more consensus around what the sharing economy is, what its main effects are, and how it should be promoted. In Sweden, political parties instead advance different understandings of, and assumptions related to, the sharing economy to advance their political agendas. While the concept has been successfully translated in Japan by powerful political institutions and actors, we argue that the concept remains open to many different interpretations in Sweden.

TI Sharing Economy with the Use of Car-Sharing Applications: An Empirical
   Study in Vietnam
SO JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB The study aims to test the model of Yang et al. (2017) for the overall assessment of the transportation sector in the sharing economy and add some new elements on the benefits of customer loyalty from some previous studies that were not mentioned in Yang's model. This study will take examples from the two big brands of car-sharing apps in the sharing economy in Vietnam - Uber, and Grab. This research focuses on customer loyalty in the sharing economy with Uber and Grab as the transport sector in Ho Chi Minh City. Based on the survey data of 380 customers in Vietnam, the research results show that two independent factors positively impact commitment and satisfaction: social benefits and economic benefits. Simultaneously, economic benefit has a positive effect on satisfaction while trust benefit has a negative effect on commitment. Finally, commitment has a positive impact on customer loyalty in the sharing economy. As a result, companies in the sharing economy can identify which are the key factors that strongly influence customer satisfaction, commitment, trust, and loyalty to help managers to devise the appropriate solutions for promoting the strengths or overcoming limitations to contribute to perfecting and improving the quality of the company's services.

TI How national culture and ethics matter in consumers' green consumption
   values
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Going green in consumption is gaining momentum globally, but little is known how national cultural values and consumers' ethical ideologies explain green consumption. With a culturally rich sample of 1929 responses from consumers in Finland, Germany, Portugal, and the United Kingdom, the present study examines how cultural long-term orientation and collectivism predict consumers' green consumption values, and if these relationships are moderated by ethical ideologies. The study finds that cultural collectivism has a significant positive effect on green consumption values, as expected. However, the results show that the two long-term orientation constructs, namely planning and tradition, point in opposite directions when predicting green consumption. We demonstrate that while long-term planning has a significant positive effect on green consumption values, the effect of traditional values is negative. We further show that this negative effect varies across consumers' ethical ideologies so that the effect is the greatest for Exceptionists and Absolutists, that is, those who rely in their actions on universal moral principles rather than particular circumstances. Therefore, our research contributes to the literature by providing new evidence for the cultural and ethical aspects in green consumption values. Furthermore, the study suggests that managers pay special attention to the consumers who have high collectivistic and future-oriented values to promote environmentally friendly consumption.

AB With the growth of sharing economy, P2P resource sharing services are combined with social networks for improving user experience and giving more trustworthiness to users. For trust management, many P2P resource sharing services adopt feedback-based reputation system. Since peers in services have their social relationship in the community, reputation includes not only trust related to services but also subjective social trust which causes bias of reputation. In this paper, we propose the method that objectifies feedback-based trust by removing social trust from rating points. We conduct simulation and verify the proposed method can objectify feedback-based trust preciously with optimized parameters by using lambda square discrepancy measure.

TI Ride on Conveniently! Passengers' Adoption of Uber App in an Emerging
   Economy
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF E-ADOPTION
AB This study investigates the passengers' adoption of a ride-sharing service app (UBER) in Bangladesh. This study employed the most widely used and cited IT adoption model, The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology-2 (UTAUT2), as the theoretical framework to examine the passengers' adoption of the popular sharing economy tools ride-sharing service applications (i.e., Uber). This study adds a new construct, safety, in the UTAUT2 model. Data were obtained from 206 participants which were analyzed using partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results indicated that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, hedonic motivation, and facilitating conditions are the most significant determinant factors of behavioral intention to use the Uber app. In contrast, behavioral intention to use the Uber app is not significantly influenced by price value and safety. Additionally, the theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed, which elicits the importance for business managers, marketers, and policymakers on sharing economy platforms.

AB The brand industry sharing economy is a hot topic in academic sector. However, service providers who share their cars, houses with others remain unnoticed. This paper aims to investigate the service providers' perceived satisfaction and its influencing factors in sharing economy. Research samples were online mobile ride hail drivers in a China's cab-hailing app company. Drawn from previous literature and unstructured interactive interviews, five factors that are "trust on personal information's security", "profitability", "app's ease of use", "app's efficiency" and "social interaction" were extracted. 1786 valid questionnaires were collected to measure the five factors and overall satisfaction. Descriptive analysis and correlation analysis were conducted. Results show that the correlations between overall satisfaction and the other five factors are significant. App's efficiency and social interaction have the moderately high correlation with overall satisfaction. Also, drivers have extremely high trust on personal information submitted and a moderately high level of perceived app's ease of use, app's efficiency and overall satisfaction.

TI A strategic framework for a profitable business model in the sharing
   economy
SO INDUSTRIAL MARKETING MANAGEMENT
AB There is an increasing interest in the rapid rise of the sharing economy, from both academicians and practitioners. Recent research has focused primarily on the relationship between sharing economy firms (service enablers) and customers. Moreover, service enablers have primarily allocated their resources to acquire a critical mass of customers. This study takes a balanced two-sided customer relationship approach toward understanding the dynamics of this triadic business model (service enabler - service provider - customer). To maintain this emerging economy's fast-growth pace, service enablers should strive to acquire, retain, and win-back profitable service providers and customers simultaneously.
   We propose a conceptual strategic framework for the development of service providers and customers considering multigenerational aspects based on inferences from the literature, popular press, and interviews with members of the triad in the sharing economy. Based on our investigation, the sharing economy services are mostly adopted by Generation Y, whereas other generations are still in the early phase of adoption. Additionally, customer and service provider churn is high. We argue that this double-sided customer relationship framework will help firms take appropriate measures to keep all the actors involved in the process satisfied, loyal, and profitable in the long run.

TI Citizen Perceptions of Government's Resistance to Shared Parking
SO TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB Sharing economy services is one of the fastest growing segments in today's economy, especially in urban centres. However, some cities have taken a negative stance and sought to prohibit sharing economy services, which has raised tensions between citizens and the local government. This paper adopts a case study approach to investigate what the main topics are in citizen perceptions of their government's resistance to shared parking in Ottawa, the capital city of Canada, where shared parking is considered illegal. In so doing, the study applies topic modelling on readers' comments following news about local residents being threatened with legal action by the city for providing shared parking services to government employees suffering from insufficient office parking resources. Based on six identified topics, the study establishes a conceptual framework that contributes to the literature on sharing economies by illustrating how citizens perceive their government's resistance toward sharing economies. The paper considers whether sharing economy services could be an innovation that would benefit societies, and how understanding citizen perceptions through online comments can help a government to solve policy issues and create win-win resolutions.

A multiple case study method was applied, in which 20 semi-structured interviews were conducted with key respondents from three transport sharing economy companies (i.e., OfO, Mobike, and Man-bang) in China. We found that the structural and infrastructural aspects of the service delivery system design influence the achievement of sustainability for sharing economy platforms. Moreover, by applying contingency theory, this study identified goal congruence and application of information and communications technology as contingent factors that affect the relationship between the service delivery system design and the sustainability initiatives. This study provides insightful knowledge into the sharing-based PSS and therefore has enormous practical implications for sharing economy platforms.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The purpose of this study is to segment US green consumers based on their personal, social, and environmental motivations for purchasing pro-environmental products. By using two-step cluster analysis, this study revealed six green consumer segments, each with a distinct combination of motivations. The different segments display a wide range of demographic characteristics, knowledge of pro-environmental products, pro-environmental product use behavior, skepticism, and attitudes toward pro-environmental advertising. This study found that green consumers, who have strong environmental motivations, have high knowledge about pro-environmental products, use a higher number and more varied selection of such products, tend to have less skepticism toward pro-environmental advertising, and have more positive attitudes toward such advertising. The study expands the motivations used in green consumer segmentation, delivering a more detailed analysis of the drivers of green consumer behavior. It also helps to explain the contradictions in the literature as to whether or not green consumers are open to or skeptical of green advertising.

TI Impact of Consumer Environmental Responsibility on Green Consumption
   Behavior in China: The Role of Environmental Concern and Price
   Sensitivity
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Research on influence factors for green consumption has greatly advanced in recent years. However, little research has explored the effect of consumers' environmental responsibility on green consumption and how this effect was mediated by environmental concern and moderated by price sensitivity, especially when consumers simultaneously pay close attention to environmental and personal interests. This study investigates the impact of environmental responsibility on green consumption via the mediation of environmental concern and the moderation of price sensitivity. The questionnaire survey method was used to collect data from 680 Chinese consumers via an online questionnaire. The empirical results reveal that environmental responsibility can promote environmental concern and enhance green consumption. Specifically, environmental responsibility has a positive impact on environmental concern and also has different positive effects on green consumption intention. Environmental concern positively affects green consumption intention and plays a partial mediation role in the relationship between environmental responsibility and green consumption intention. Price sensitivity plays a negative moderation role in the relationship among environmental responsibility, environmental concern and green consumption intention. The theoretical and managerial implications of the findings were discussed.

TI Understanding Consumers' Post-Adoption Behavior in Sharing Economy
   Services
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Sharing economy services such as bicycle-sharing have become quite popular. In these services, companies maintain systems which allow consumers to conduct sharing activities. Based upon expectation-confirmation theory, we develop a model investigating the antecedents of consumer confirmation and its consequences in the sharing economy context. Specially, we identify two antecedents including perceived performance and perceived risk. Using an empirical study, our results show that perceived performance has a positive impact on confirmation while perceived risk has a negative effect. Confirmation positively affects service satisfaction, which in turn increases continuance intention and recommendation intention. Further, confirmation is negatively related to dissatisfaction, which in turn increases switch intention. Our study clarifies the process of consumers' decision-making about using sharing economy, and thus making contribution to the sharing economy literature. Practically, it delivers insights for companies into how to retain customers through increasing the value and reducing the risk associated with sharing economy.

AB The sharing economy currently forms a really important aspect of an economy. The authors set out to determine the size of the population participating in the sharing economy through the use of social networks and other channels with the purpose of identifying and describing individual factors (variables) affecting this type of market segment. The objectives of this paper were to determine the age gap between male and female participants in the sharing economy and to identify specific factors that may affect their participation in it, in particular among respondents who actively use social networks. It was concluded that gender did affect participation in the sharing economy, whilst financial position and permanent address did not have any influence on this market segment. The authors also set out to determine the level of education of the population that is dominant on this market. In terms of methodology, the information presented in this paper is based on the results of an empirical questionnaire survey on participation in the sharing economy in the Czech Republic and the application of general statistical methods.

AB The sharing economy, which is based on the exchange, sale, donation or rental of products and services among strangers, raises questions about the security, privacy and motivations of users regarding interpersonal trust and platforms. In this context, this study aims to analyze the scientific production about the thematic trust in the sharing economy through bibliometric techniques. For this purpose, a search of the Scopus platform was carried out, which initially resulted in 145 publications, in later phases these studies were selected and analyzed with the aid of software. The bibliometric analysis allowed us to explore the literature about trust in the sharing economy between the years 2013 to 2018. The findings were categorized into annual publication of articles, origin and quantity of publications, methodological nature, instruments and techniques of data collection, association between authors by affiliation countries, occurrence of keywords and referenced authors to conceptualize the sharing economy. By considering the sharing economy a recent and changing subject, this mapping elucidates the advancement of publications and identifies the current research scenario. For future studies, it is suggested to analyze the various platforms based on topics such as familiarity, perceived risk, security, privacy and interaction and design in the digital platforms of the sharing economy.

TI The Conceptualization of the Sharing Economy as a Business Model
SO INZINERINE EKONOMIKA-ENGINEERING ECONOMICS
AB The paper analyses the recently emerged and rapidly growing phenomenon of sharing economy. The assessment of an extensive amount of publications issued by Lithuanian and foreign researchers has revealed the problem that in most cases a simplified business model is still being applied to all sharing economy initiatives despite of their evident differences. The use of abstraction method, systematic approach and comparative research enabled the authors to examine the formation and disclosure of different sharing economy definitions and provide a revised one as well as to establish the chronological process of the development of the phenomenon. Moreover, the research also presents the peculiarities of the sharing economy as a new business model by highlighting its characteristics and dimensions and emphasizing the social, economic and ecological key factors and the main drivers such as monetization of excess or unused assets, increasing financial flexibility, the impact of venture capital, access over ownership, increasing urbanization etc. The outcome of this research is the conceptual sharing economy business model that allows not only to understand the functioning of the sharing economy better but also to grasp the differences of already existing initiatives and to find opportunities to create new ones. This may help for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers not only guide future research and policy intervention but also find valuable insights for sharing economy business models development and better foreseen the results of this phenomena.

TI The sharing economy and digital platforms: A review and research agenda
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
AB Over the last few years the sharing economy has been changing the way that people share and conduct transactions in digital spaces. This research phenomenon has drawn scholars from a large number of disparate fields and disciplines into an emerging research area. Given the variety of perspectives represented, there is a great need to collect and connect what has been done, and to identify some common themes, which will serve as a basis for future discussions on the crucial roles played by digital platforms in the sharing economy. Drawing on a collection of 435 publications on the sharing economy and related terms, we identify some trends in the literature and underlying research interests. Specifically, we organize the literature around the concept of platform mediation, and draw a set of essential affordances of sharing economy technologies from the reviewed literature. We present the notion of platform centralization/decentralization as an effective organizing principle for the variety of perspectives on the sharing economy, and also evaluate scholars' treatment of technology itself. Finally, we identify important gaps in the existing literature on the relationship between digital platforms and sharing economy, and provide directions for future investigations.

TI Theoretical dilemmas, conceptual review and perspectives disclosure of
   the sharing economy: a qualitative analysis
SO REVIEW OF MANAGERIAL SCIENCE
AB The sharing economy (SE) has become a prominent theme in a broad variety of research domains in the last decade. With conceptions from an increasing range of theoretical perspectives, SE literature is disperse and disconnected, with a great proliferation of definitions and related terms which hinder organized and harmonious research. This study carries out a systematic literature review from 1978 to September 2020, uncovering 50 definitions as units of analysis. The authors, through a qualitative-interpretative analysis, review definitions, identify perspectives, and critically assess their conceptual nature on an evolutionary basis. Findings show that despite the SE has been extending its routes and approaches, it is far from a stock of conceptual grounds. The paper makes three contributions. First, we portray SE within a common evolutionary framework by developing it as a life cycle model. Second, we clarify the definitional and terminological jungle. And third, we suggest a new definition that can enrich the discussion.

AB The development of information and communication technologies caused evolution of consumption patterns, with an emphasis on strengthening the bargaining power of consumers. The new model of consumption is based on intensive application of the Internet, with the development of social capital that forms the basis for group organizing of consumers. Using the available information, consumers are building special groups on the basis of trust, which carry out valuation of products and services. These models of collaborative consumption are a part of so-called., sharing economy", which represents a new consumer paradigm. Sharing economy is central research topic of this paper. The goal is to conduct critical analysis of this concept and clarify different interpretations of the same, with the presentation of the basic sharing models. In addition, the paper will present development perspectives of sharing economy, with a focus on benefits offered by this model of consumption. These benefits may relate to reduction of unemployment and the informal economy, better utilization of resources, strengthening social capital and community, and increasing foreign direct investment. The paper also analyzes the key challenges of sharing economy, which are related to flexibility of the legal and economic environment. At the end, there will be given an appropriate conclusion, with recommendations for improving the development of sharing economy.

SO EJOURNAL OF TAX RESEARCH
AB Digital innovation is creating completely new ways to do business, unlocking a new generation of micro entrepreneurs who are progressively engaging with the sharing economy. One of the most pressing challenges tax authorities face is the tax compliance of these individuals that are new to business in the sharing economy.
   Kamleitner, Korunka and Kirchler (2012) developed a conceptual framework that depicts key aspects that distinguish small business owners' perceptions of their tax obligation. Using Kamleitner et al.'s framework as a basis and analysing evidence from the literature, this article aims to point out additional considerations in order to develop a revised and extended framework of the factors influencing tax compliance of individuals in business in the home-sharing economy.
   The results of the study propose a framework depicting the four main factors that influence the tax compliance decision, namely: (1) perceived opportunity; (2) tax knowledge; (3) decision-making, and (4) person.

TI Sharing economy versus collaborative consumption: What drives consumers
   in the new forms of exchange?
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB Digital transformation led to the proliferation of new forms of exchange. This study aims, firstly, to put forward a parsimonious conceptualization for sharing economy (SE) and collaborative consumption (CC), concepts used interchangeably in literature and practice; secondly, to understand why consumers participate in each and whether they have significantly different drivers. We applied structural equation modeling to test our conceptual model with 400 participants. A market research company collected the data in Brazil. The convenience sample included respondents who had used one of the services at least once. Results show that SE is explained mostly by intrinsic reasons, while CC is driven by the extrinsic factor economics and the intrinsic reason enjoyment. Economic motivations are significantly stronger in CC than in SE, while convenience and environmental orientation are predominant in SE. The study advances knowledge in the field, making important managerial contributions revealing consumers' priorities in each mode of exchange.

AB This paper develops and tests a model of consumer trust in a sharing economy-enabled ride-sharing platform from the perspective of psychological contract violation (PCV) and subsequent service recovery efforts of the platform. Based on a mixed-design experiment, customers evaluate various hypothetical PCV and recovery scenarios and complete a survey on their perspectives of trusting beliefs and trusting intentions to the platform. We aim to prove that the type and magnitude of PCV can moderate the relationship between service recovery attributes and customers' trust in the ridesharing platform. In addition, consumer habit also has a moderating effect on the relationship between consumers' trusting beliefs and trusting intention. The findings contribute to the understanding of customers trust and evaluations of PCV encounters and service recovery. Practically, the results of this research can provide ride-sharing platform managers with practical guidelines for providing appropriate recovery efforts to a PCV encounter.

AB Recent success stories such as those of Airbnb or Uber have proved that the Sharing Economy has evolved from a niche phenomenon to an independent economic sector. Against this backdrop, it is widely recognized that business models-although a research field still based on a highly-fragmented body of knowledge-constitute one of the most important factors to create such success stories. By leveraging the extant literature, a framework for business model generation is proposed, which is specifically tailored to the domain of the Sharing Economy. Hence, this work's contribution is multifaceted: Literature is synthesized to cope with the current fragmentation and used to study state-of-the-art business model (generation) approaches. Furthermore, shortcomings in the application of current business model (generation) frameworks with regard to the Sharing Economy are pointed out. The merit of this research is the presentation of a consolidated framework for business model conceptualization and generation in the Sharing Economy.

TI Sharing Channel Strategy With Customers' Collaborative Consumption
   Behaviors
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB Associated with the sharing economy, collaborative consumption behaviors often take place among customers. Different from the traditional consumption that customers purchase the product and own it, in the sharing economy, customers can access the product only for a particular period and the ownership of the product also belongs to the firm. In this paper, we develop a theoretical analysis model, and investigate the intrinsic connection between collaborative consumption and the sharing channel strategy. Adopting the sharing channel strategy, the firm has a chance to expand the market demand and improve its profit. In addition, we examine the impacts of other influential factors on a firm's decisions, such as the unit product cost, surplus-value, and service capability coefficient.

With keen competitions, many bike-sharing startups face the challenges in service delivery and profit generation. This study attempts to understand the development of these start-ups by examining how three entrepreneurship processes (i.e., bricolage, effectuation, and causation processes) take places when they address various internal and external challenges. We conducted a case study in a bike sharing company in China and collected qualitative data using semi-structured interviews. The preliminary findings suggest three entrepreneurship processes occurred and shaped the strategies and operations of the company. We expect the findings can contribute to digital innovation and sharing economy literature.

TI Racism in the sharing economy: Regulatory challenges in a neo-liberal
   cyber world
SO GEOFORUM
AB Elements of the new-age sharing economy rely heavily on the internet, and this includes ride and accommodation services. The sharing systems are both online and offline, generating substantial offline outcomes such as access to scarce urban resources like housing and transport. We provide evidence on how sharing economy platforms like Uber and Airbnb in Australia can unevenly allocate scarce urban resources across racial and ethnic groups. The sharing economy transcends the online and offline worlds, encompassing cyber interactions as well as physical exchanges and presence. Access to real worlds scarce urban resources are determined. A geographical research agenda is advocated, including: audit testing for prevalence; case studies for successful anti-racist regulation; and smaller scale analyses of impacts and pro-social action. We review anti-racist regulation within and from outside the platforms, and press the case for new forms of peer and state regulation in an era of roll-out and roll-back neo-liberalism.

SO JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES
AB The rapid growth of the sharing economy has attracted a recent surge of academic interest. However, few studies to date address performance variation among sharing platforms. Building on the notion of business model design and applying a configurational approach, we develop a conceptual model that investigates what combinations of design elements can enhance the performance of sharing platforms. Data from 189 platforms and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) reveal six business model designs, each with its own performance implications. Of these, four configurations lead to high performance and two lead to low performance. Our study advances current understanding of the sharing economy and sheds important light on business model research.

TI Sharing economies: moving beyond binaries in a digital age
SO CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF REGIONS ECONOMY AND SOCIETY
AB In periods of turbulence, the tendency to simplify messages and polarise debates is nothing new. In our hyper-mediated world of online technologies, where it seems that even national policy can be forged in the 140 characters of Twitter, it is more important than ever to retain spaces for in-depth debate of emergent phenomena that have disruptive and transformative potential. In this article, we follow this logic and argue that to fully understand the diverse range of practices and potential consequences of activities uncomfortably corralled under the ambiguous term 'the sharing economy' requires not a simplification of arguments, but an opening out of horizons to explore the many ways in which these phenomena have emerged and are evolving. It is argued that this will require attention to multiple terrains, from diverse intellectual traditions across many disciplines to the thus far largely reactive responses of government and regulation, and from the world of techno-innovation start-ups to the optics of media (including social media) reporting on what it means to 'share' in the 21st century. Building on this, we make the case for viewing 'the sharing economy' as a matrix of diverse economies with clear links to past practices. We propose that to build a grammar for understanding these diverse sharing economies requires further attention to: (1) The etymology of sharing and sharing economies; (2) The differentiated geographies to which sharing economies contribute; (3) What it means to labour, work and be employed in sharing economies; (4) The role of the state and others in governing, regulating and shaping the organisation and practice of sharing economies; and (5) the impacts of sharing economies. In conclusion, we suggest that while media interest may fade as their presence in everyday lives becomes less novel, understanding sharing economies remains an urgent activity if we are to ensure that the new ways of living and labouring, to which sharing economies are contributing, work to promote sustainable and inclusive development in this world that ultimately we all share.

TI Assessing Trust and Risk Perceptions in the Sharing Economy: An
   Empirical Study
SO JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES
AB The sharing economy requires intensive interactions among multiple stakeholders, such as consumers, service providers, communities, and third-party platforms. Undoubtedly, trust and risk perceptions could become the key for the success and sustainable development of this collaborative business. This study addresses the critical issue of the customers' trust and risk perceptions in the sharing economy. With a sample size of 1,336 respondents, the study adopted a structural equation modelling technique to test a proposed structural model of this issue. The moderating role of social identity threats was included in the proposed model to further examine the relationships among sharing economy security factors and risk and trust perceptions. The findings identified four factors - rapport among stakeholders (customers, providers, communities), reliability of the transaction platform, facility quality, and share of value - that significantly influence the customers' trust and risk perceptions and partially confirmed a moderating effect of social identity threats in the relationships. The study also provided empirical support for the link between trust and risk perceptions and positive outcomes (customer satisfaction, revisits, and positive word-of-mouth). Theoretical and practical implications are also discussed.

AB Recently the sharing economy has emerged as a viable alternative to fulfilling a variety of consumer needs. As there is no consensus on the definition of 'sharing economy' we use the term 'marketplace' to refer more specifically to Internet/software-based sharing economy platforms connecting two different market segments. In the field of sharing economy and marketplaces we found a research gap concerning the (socio)technological aspects and the development of marketplaces. A marketplace ontology can help to have a clear account of marketplace concepts which will facilitate communication, consensus and alignment. In this paper we design this marketplace ontology in four steps. First the selection of UFO as foundation and UFO-S as core ontology. Second the search for a set of minimal conditions and properties common for marketplaces and the derivation into competency questions. Third, use the competency questions to identify fragmented sub-ontology pieces called Domain-Related Ontology Patterns (DROPs) and apply them informally by extending UFO-S concepts to design a marketplace domain ontology. This marketplace domain ontology is represented in OntoUML. The last step is the validation of the OntoUML model using expert knowledge.

TI Understanding why people share in the sharing economy
SO ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW
AB Purpose The sharing economy is an emerging trend that takes advantage of underused assets and generates enormous amount of economic value. However, little research has been done to understand the factors that drive people to share assets. Design/methodology/approach This study develops two models, one based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and another based on social capital theory (SCT), to explain why individuals want to share their assets with others. An Internet survey is conducted to collect data and test the proposed models. Most of respondents were members of Airbnb or Uber - accommodation sharing and taxi services. Findings The results show that the TPB model has greater explanatory power than the SCT model. The individual's motivations, attitude, perceived behavioral control, facilitating technological conditions and identification with the community increase their intention to share assets. Originality/value This study distinguishes asset suppliers from consumers to clearly understand the factors that influence the intention to provide underused assets. The research findings can help companies participating in the sharing economy to induce people to share.

TI The application of Aristotle's rhetorical theory to the sharing economy:
   an empirical study of Airbnb
SO JOURNAL OF TRAVEL & TOURISM MARKETING
AB Sharing economy businesses require extensive trust-based communication between users and service providers to facilitate users' positive persuasion processes. Based on Aristotle's rhetorical theory, this study identifies three key persuasive cues (credibility, emotional bonding, and accommodation characteristics) and validates their roles in establishing users' trust in an Airbnb setting. The moderating role of interactivity is further analyzed. Research findings from a survey sample of 171 Airbnb users indicate that persuasive cues are positively associated with trust in Airbnb hosts, which significantly leads to Airbnb brand trust. Interestingly, the moderating role of interactivity is only found in the relationship between emotional bonding and trust in Airbnb hosts. This study contributes to a better understanding of the factors that affect users' trust building in the sharing economy context, and it offers guidance for platform providers to better operate their businesses by highlighting the important roles of persuasive cues and interactivity in users' trust-building processes.

AB Uber is a popular ride-sharing application that matches people who need a ride (or riders) with drivers who are willing to provide it using their personal vehicles. Despite its growing popularity, there exist few studies that examine large-scale Uber data, or in general the factors affecting user participation in the sharing economy. We address this gap through a study of the Uber market that analyzes large-scale data covering 59 million rides which spans a period of 7 months. The data were extracted from email receipts sent by Uber collected on Yahoo servers, allowing us to examine the role of demographics (e.g., age and gender) on participation in the ride-sharing economy. In addition, we evaluate the impact of dynamic pricing (i.e., surge pricing) and income on both rider and driver behavior. We find that the surge pricing does not bias Uber use towards higher income riders. Moreover, we show that more homophilous matches (e.g., riders to drivers of a similar age) can result in higher driver ratings. Finally, we focus on factors that affect retention and use information from earlier rides to accurately predict which riders or drivers will become active Uber users.

TI Millennials and the sharing economy: Lessons from a 'buy nothing new,
   share everything month' project
SO ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
AB There is a growing consensus that millennials (people born between the early 1980s and the early 2000s) have embraced the sharing economy in large numbers, adopting a new mindset in which access to goods and services is seen as more valuable than ownership of them. While surveys suggest this shift may be underway, little research has been done on behavior directly. This paper is a step in that direction. My project examines student engagement with the sharing economy through experiential learning. For one month, students were asked not to buy anything new, other than food and absolute necessities. Instead, they were expected to rely on the sharing economy to meet their needs and then to describe their experiences. I use mixed-methods design to analyze the resulting data quantitatively and qualitatively. Although the findings do not generalize to millennials as a whole, they point to a possible research program with which to test millennial engagement with the sharing economy. The results also suggest that a shift toward this new, access-driven mindset may be more challenging than popularly assumed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This panel brings researchers from the sharing economy and mobile crowdsourcing space whose research has identified unique challenges for underserved populations. We consider the opportunities offered by these platforms to disadvantaged communities and examine to what extent these platforms instead may recreate disadvantage, as well as the workarounds communities employ to make these platforms work for them. We examine the opportunities for the CSCW community to address these challenges going forward.

TI The Sharing Economy in the Framework of Sustainable Development Goals:
   Case of European Union Countries
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The aim of this research study was to establish a framework for the relationships between the sharing economy and the Sustainable Development Goals (hereinafter, SDGs) set by the United Nations. There are 17 SDGs with 169 targets, which, in the scientific literature, are classified into sustainability dimensions: economic, social, and environmental. Thus, the objective of the current research was to perform an economic assessment of the sharing economy in the context of SDGs by analyzing European Union countries with a particular emphasis on their economic growth. Although the sharing economy has been analyzed from different aspects in recent scientific articles, the impact of this phenomenon on national economies in the framework of SDGs is lacking. Firstly, based on the latest research on the sharing economy from the perspective of sustainable development, a theoretical model of the sharing economy was developed in this study. Secondly, SDG indicators in the economic dimension and other key economic growth variables for European Union countries were collected. Thirdly, a cluster analysis was performed to determine the impact of the sharing economy on European Union countries in terms of SDGs in the economic dimension. The current study contributes to the existing research by analyzing the sharing economy from the perspective of sustainable economic development and highlights that this business model positively impacts countries' economic sustainability in terms of SDGs.

TI Why do customers intend to continue using internet-based sharing economy
   service platforms? Roles of network externality and service quality
SO JOURNAL OF ASIA BUSINESS STUDIES
AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to integrate network externality and service quality as antecedents to the synthesis of expectation-confirmation model (ECM) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) in explaining customers' continuance intention of internet-based sharing economy service platforms. Design/methodology/approach Sample data for this study were collected from students enrolled in a comprehensive university in Taipei, Taiwan. A total of 600 questionnaires were distributed in various campus locations, and 510 usable questionnaires were analyzed in this study, with a usable response rate of 85.0%. Collected data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings The primary findings are as follows. First, service enablers' online service quality positively affected customers' perceived usefulness (PU), confirmation and PEOU of internet-based sharing economy service platforms, which directly or indirectly explained customers' satisfaction and continuance intention of the platforms. Next, service providers' offline service quality positively influenced customers' PU of internet-based sharing economy service platforms, which in turn caused customers' satisfaction and continuance intention of the platforms. Finally, network externality from customers' side and service providers' side all positively affected customers' PU of internet-based sharing economy service platforms, which in turn led to customers' continuance intention of the platforms. Originality/value First, this study contributes to the identification of network externality and service quality that may reveal deep insights to the understanding of customers' continuance intention of internet-based sharing economy service platforms greatly driven by their confirmation of expectations and satisfaction with the platforms. Next, the empirical evidence on capturing ECM and PEOU for completely explaining the antecedents of customers' continuance intention of internet-based sharing economy service platforms is well documented. Hence, this study's findings have significantly shed light on the possible formulation of a richer post-adoption model.

TI How do product quality uncertainties affect the sharing economy
   platforms with risk considerations? A mean-variance analysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB The sharing economy is of increasing importance for various aspects of our society by providing people with cost-efficient and convenient access to services or products. However, the profitability and healthy development of the sharing economy platforms are greatly restricted by the intensive uncertainties arising from product quality. How to determine the optimal product quality improvement efforts and the optimal prices for the sharing platforms becomes crucial. Moreover, it is reasonable that many sharing economy platforms and consumers are holding a risk-averse attitude during decision making in the highly volatile market. In this paper, we employ the Mean-Variance theory to model the risk-averse attitudes of decision makers, and analytically derive the optimal average quality levels and prices that the platform should provide for the market. We also explore how the critical factors like product quality uncertainty and risk sensitivity affect the platform's equilibrium decisions and consumer surplus. Our analytical results reveal the importance of reducing the difficulty of improving product quality for enhancing the platforms' profitability and consumer surplus. Besides, we identify that it is not always wise for platforms to invest in improving product quality, especially when the related cost becomes increasingly expensive. Moreover, it is shown that the increasing risk aversion or product quality volatility will induce the platform to reduce his quality improvement efforts. Finally, we interestingly find that the platform will always suffer if he becomes risk averse from risk neutral, while consumers may benefit from this attitude change.

SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The sharing economy is a new form of resource distribution that is affecting traditional markets, cities and individuals, and challenging the prevalent regulatory frameworks, social norms and belief systems. While studies have examined some of its disruptive effects on institutional actors, there has been less focus on the ways in which sharing economy organisations work to create new or disrupt prevalent institutions. This study aims to fill this gap by 1) applying a framework for institutional work by Lawrence and Suddaby (2006) to help understand, map out and classify a variety of mechanisms for urban sharing organisations to engage in institutional creation and disruption, and by 2) testing and adjusting the framework to the context of the sharing economy. The analysis builds on empirical data from case studies, field observations and almost 70 interviews with representatives of urban sharing organisations and actors in their organisational field.

The SALSA analytical framework (Search, AppraisaL, Synthesis and Analysis) as well as qualitative and quantitative content analysis of selected publications were applied in order to appoint areas of city functioning which are influenced by activity of sharing economy platforms. Five topics appeared to be the most commonly linked with the development of sharing economy in tourism. They are: entrepreneurship and innovativeness of citizens, real estate market, local transportation, citizens' quality of life and local budgets' incomes. As recognized the indirect impact includes both positive and negative consequences.

TI Why consumers' New power' will change marketing
SO AUSTRALASIAN MARKETING JOURNAL
AB Because the sharing economy compels firm-stakeholder dynamics towards a multi-stakeholder market orientation (MSMO), the structures and power dynamics of sharing-economy firms differ markedly from traditional-economy firms. In this vein, we explore sharing-economy firms' dependence on stakeholders (new power), the continual threat of new entrants (exponential organisations), and how these conditions combine to create additional stakeholder value by shifting Pareto efficient outcomes. We also discuss how previous scholarly efforts to impel traditional-economy firms toward stakeholder orientations failed because these firms generally treated stakeholder satisfaction as an optional rather than crucial goal for achieving sustainable competitive advantages. Finally, we argue that sharing-economy firms continue to disrupt markets, which increases every firm's need to explore value creation in theory and practice.

TI Consumer segmentation within the sharing economy: The case of Airbnb
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB The sharing economy is a global phenomenon with rapid growth potential. While research has begun to explore segmentation between users and non-users, only limited research has looked at consumer segmentation within sharing economy services. In this paper, we build on this research gap by investigating consumer segmentation within a single sharing economy platform: Airbnb. Utilizing a mixed methods approach, with both a quantitative survey and a qualitative content analysis of Airbnb listings, we compare two different types of accommodation offered on Airbnb: shared room and entire home. Our findings indicate that within a single platform, the variety between offerings can create distinct consumer segments based on both demographics and behavioral criteria. We also find that Airbnb hosts use marketing logic to target their listings towards specific consumer segments. However, there is not, in all cases, strong alignment between consumer segmentation and host targeting, leading to potentially reduced matching efficiency.

AB Sharing personal digital information online has been a common activity for many years. However, the recent rise of sharing economy services has since expanded the set of "things" one can share. How does the sharing of such physical artifacts differ from "traditional" sharing practices of photos and status updates? This paper attempts to consolidate the existing body of work on both sharing personal digital content (e.g., social networking) and personal physical artifacts (e.g., apartment, car sharing), and attempts to identify both commonalities and differences between them. We summarize existing research on the diversity of shared content, users' motivations to share, audience management, privacy & trust issues, and user experience requirements. We also conduct 16 semi-structured interviews with both design practitioners and sharing economy domain experts to formulate a set of design implications for devising novel sharing economy services.

TI MARKETING PERSPECTIVES ON SUPPLY AND DEMAND IN THE SHARING ECONOMY: WHO
   ARE THE TARGET GENERATIONS?
SO CENTRAL EUROPEAN BUSINESS REVIEW
AB The sharing economy is an interesting socio-economic system that has been studied by many researchers worldwide. It is an area that will affect the patterns of behaviour, processes and thinking experienced in various fields. The sharing economy is specific in that some people who have an asset they do not fully use may be willing to share it with consumers who do not have the asset but need it for a specific reason but are unable to or do not want to buy it. Platforms operating in the sharing economy need to know whom to target with their marketing strategy to spend marketing costs effectively. We used cluster analysis, a chi-square test, a Kruskal-Wallis test and descriptive analysis of data collected from 684 respondents across Generations X, Y and Z within the Czech Republic. We identified who constitutes the general supply of and demand for unused assets. While the willingness to supply prevails among Generation Y, the willingness to demand prevails among Generation Z. For Generation X, the willingness to supply and the willingness to demand are almost equal. Using cluster analysis, we defined three basic groups of participants in the sharing economy: double-sided active participants, one-sided active participants and inactive participants. We summarise new findings from not only a theoretical but also a practical perspective. Implications for Central European audience: Platforms active in the sharing economy may better understand Czech customers regarding their supply of and demand for unused assets. The results could also be useful for managers in other countries of the Central European region. The findings may help enrich the theoretical knowledge of the sharing economy and its impact on marketing. Platforms can save money on marketing communications by focusing their marketing communications on a specific generation.

TI Consumer attitude towards green products: revisiting the profile of
   green consumers using segmentation approach
SO MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
AB Purpose Over the last few decades, there has been a substantial increase in environmentally conscious consumers' willingness to switch their preferences from mainstream products to green products. Hence, it becomes essential for academicians and marketers to understand the notion, attributes and a comprehensive profile of green consumers. Since consumer attitude towards green products is not widely studied in developing countries, the present study aims at exploring the profile of green consumers in India (Punjab State) based on the same in the Indian context. Design/methodology/approach The study used the survey method, and a sample of 400 respondents was selected from the Punjab State of India. Initially, principal component analysis was employed to reduce the dimensions. Following this, cluster analysis was applied to segment consumer market in distinctive segments. Results of cluster analysis were validated with discriminant analysis and finally, differences amongst the segments of green and non-green consumers were examined to build on the profile of green consumers. Findings The study segmented the consumer market based on consumer attitude towards green products. Results of the study revealed four distinct segments. "Dynamic Green", the largest cluster, presents truly green consumers who exhibit a positive attitude towards green products. Finally, the study highlighted the attitudinal profile of green and non-green consumers and differences amongst the segments were explained. Research limitations/implications Similar study should be conducted in other developing/developed countries. Furthermore, cross-cultural studies can be undertaken to contrast consumer attitude towards green products. The study may also be extended to probe the connection between consumers' attitude and actual behaviour towards green products. Originality/value The study examined the role of consumer attitude towards green products in identifying the distinct segment of green consumers and determining different configurations of consumer characteristics to build on the profile of green consumers.

TI Exploring the meaning of work within the sharing economy: A case of
   food-delivery workers
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT
AB This study aims to investigate how the sharing economy has redefined the meaning of work in the food delivery sector. We conducted in-depth interviews with 50 food delivery workers in the sharing economy to identify their work goals and then performed an empirical investigation into the mechanism between the meaning of work, work engagement, and career commitment. Seven work goals were empirically found to fit a bidimensional conceptualization of work goals of intrinsic and extrinsic orientations. Using an instrument developed via qualitative analysis, we found that the relationship between the meaning of work and career commitment varies across dimensions of the meaning of work. Intrinsic orientation was found to generate work engagement and career commitment effectively. The obligation norm appeared to carry unique meaning in the sharing economy. These findings theoretically expand the current understanding of sharing economy employment and provide practical implications for hospitality businesses and the legal sector.

TI Does the sharing economy hurt the traditional economy? Evidence in the
   hospitality industry from the United States
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB A burgeoning sharing economy has recently opened vast niches of opportunities for virtually every economic sector from service to knowledge creation and even manufacturing. Notwithstanding the notable expansion and opportunities it provides, new forms of challenges for decision-makers and other stakeholders -including Main Street, cities, states and the federal government - have emerged in its wake. As a result, it has become increasingly relevant to understand the nature of the relationship between the sharing economy and incumbent industries. This project delves into this matter by focusing on the hospitality industry in the United States, while examining how it is impacted by the sharing economy. Using a two-step methodological approach involving filtering methods and vector auto-regressions (VARs), the empirical findings reveal no evidence of the sharing economy acting as an impediment to the hospitality industry. In other words, there is no evidence that it constrains the development of the traditional sector, nor does it appear to be a substitute.

TI Regulation Through Deregulation: Sharing Economy Companies Gaining
   Legitimacy by Circumventing Traditional Frameworks
SO HASTINGS LAW JOURNAL
AB The "sharing economy" is a term describing organized economic activity that may supplant the traditional corporate-centered model and encourages peer-to-peer transactions. It is a system of sharing underused assets or services, for free or for a fee, directly from individuals, bypassing traditional "middle men." The sharing economy provides much of its services through on-demand platform, such as mobile apps, and matches customer needs with providers to immediately deliver these goods and services.
   Does the "sharing economy" share its risk with its consumers? Should the sharing economy be regulated? What effect does the lack of regulation have on its consumers, and would implementation of more regulations change those effects?
   This Note uses home-sharing and ridesharing companies in San Francisco as case studies to explore these questions. By comparing the hotel and the taxi industries' regulations with the emerging regulatory frameworks surrounding Airbnb and Uber, this Note argues that these companies have been left to "self-regulate." Self-regulation has not proven to be effective, and as a result, the health and safety of consumers has been put in jeopardy. This Note argues that the regulatory regimes in place prior to the rise of the "sharing economy" should be revisited and appropriately restructured for these newly emerged business models.

TI Factors inhibiting the use of sharing economy services in Japan
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The growth of sharing economy services has been led by technological development, an awareness of reducing ecological impacts, and change in attitudes toward product ownership and the demands for social networks. Research on the motivations of the sharing economy help facilitate a better under-standing of users' decision-making processes. However, despite this recent interest, there are limited quantitative studies investigating why only few people use sharing economy services in countries such as Japan. This study investigated factors inhibiting the use of sharing economy services in Japan. We compared five models of such services, considering variables such as income and savings. Results show that females tend to not use space-, goods-, money-, or mobility-sharing services, and higher-income people use mobility-, skills (time)-, and goods-sharing services. Overall, an important factor inhibiting the use of such services was "resistance and anxiety about sharing with strangers." Space-sharing services are presumed to contribute the most to the efficient use of resources, even though people believe that such services contribute to the efficient use of both time and resources. Furthermore, people are interested in the sharing economy and social contribution. For practical implications, service providers should eliminate resistance and anxiety by facilitating connections among users who are unfamiliar with each other in local or online communities.

TI Factors influencing travelers' behavioral intentions to use P2P
   accommodation based on trading activity: Airbnb vs Couchsurfing
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CULTURE TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY RESEARCH
AB Purpose The growth of information and communication technology and the appearance of the sharing economy have affected the market. This trend will potentially create a competitive transformation, especially in the accommodation sector. While Airbnb has become the leader in the sharing economy, more competitors are coming into the market, some with different business propositions and positioning strategies, thereby offering different points of differences (PODs). The purpose of this study is to identify and compare the factors that influence the usage of peer-to-peer (P2P) accommodation services for trading activity (renting vs lending), particularly between Airbnb and Couchsurfing. More specifically, this study examines the causal relationships among some major factors that influence customers' purchase intentions, such as perceived risk, perceived value, price sensitivity and word of mouth. Design/methodology/approach A total of 400 millennial respondents - 200 for each service - who have used the respective mobile applications participated in the online survey. Using structural equation modeling, the analysis revealed that the model acts differently across the groups. Findings The results revealed that Airbnb respondents paid more attention to perceived risks when booking the accommodation, thus indicating that they are more risk-averse, whereas Couchsurfing's users sought the perceived value that they would receive at the destination. Originality/value This study reveals that factors that influence the intention to use the sharing economy platform work differently based on the form of trading activities.

TI Determinants of consumers' participation in the sharing economy A social
   exchange perspective within an emerging economy context
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose Consumers' intentions to participate in the sharing economy have received much attention from researchers in recent times. However, little attention has been paid to consumers' actual participation in the sharing economy. The purpose of this paper is to examine the factors that drive customers in Ghana to use Uber. Design/methodology/approach The authors used surveys as the research design. There were 500 participants who were users of Uber. Data were collected through self-administered questionnaires. Findings The findings of this study show that trust, customer return on investment and search convenience are the key factors that contribute to riders' usage of Uber service. Furthermore, this study shows that consumers' need for prestige and social connection do not play a significant role in consumers' (riders') usage of Uber services. Originality/value Studies investigating consumers' participation in the sharing economy from an emerging economy context using the social exchange theory is limited. This study identifies elements of the economic and socio-emotional dimensions of the social exchange theory and the strength of their impact on people's participation in the sharing economy.

TI Effects of Core Resource and Competence Characteristics of Sharing
   Economy Business on Shared Value, Distinctive Competitive Advantage, and
   Behavior Intention
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Sharing economy businesses need to increase the value of service effectiveness through the efficiency of their core resources and capabilities, and the effectiveness and efficiency-based services can achieve high results through business competitive advantage. Therefore, this study identifies the need for core resource and competence characteristics, both concepts are approachable from the competitive advantage and resource-based perspectives of the sharing economy business, and it also presents a comprehensive structural model of the shared value creation, distinctive competitive advantage, and behavior intention of the sharing economy business through these concepts. For this purpose, data were collected by survey questionnaires, and a preliminary survey (50 persons) as a pretest and the main survey (550 persons) were conducted and 534 experienced consumers were finally used for data analysis. For the data analysis method, frequency, reliability/validity, model-fit, and path analyses were conducted. The results of the study are the following. First, visibility, inimitability, and asymmetry of the core resources of sharing economy business have a significant effect on shared value. Additionally, while inimitability and asymmetry have a significant effect on distinctive competitive advantage. Second, the integration and internalization of core abilities of sharing economy services have a significant effect on shared value. However, externalization and internalization have a significant effect on distinctive competitive advantage. Finally, the shared values of sharing economy business have a significant effect on distinctive competitive advantage, shared value has a significant effect on behavior intention, and distinctive competitive advantage has a significant effect on behavior intention. Through the importance of managing strategic factors for these shared values and distinctive competitive advantages, this study is aimed at the development of core resources and dynamic ability leading to achievement that is expected to be a systematic academic basis for environmental impact information of sharing economy business.

TI Sharing Economy: Challenges for the Labor Market and the Labor Law in
   China and Globally A Micro-Comparative Analysis of the EU, US, and Asia
SO EUROPEAN BUSINESS ORGANIZATION LAW REVIEW
AB The sharing economy has had a substantial impact on the labor market and created challenges for companies in traditional industry and businesses. In conducting micro-comparative research on the existing standards that test the employment relationship between Uber and Uber drivers, this study reveals how different traditional labor law dogmas deal with the conundrum brought about by the sharing economy. The test of personal dependence derived from German labor law has been a model for China, Japan, and other civil law countries as the main standard to identify an employee. This test encounters a failure in the context of the sharing economy. Unlike China, the latest court decisions in the jurisdictions of the UK, the EU, and the US tend to increasingly categorize Uber drivers as employees. This study proposes that a new test or standard in labor law should be developed 'bottom-up' through the increasingly consistent development of local court decisions and local regulators' efforts. A category that lies midway between the employee and the semi-employee is proposed for Uber drivers and other workers intermediated by sharing firms. The sharing firms (platforms), rather than individual workers, would have the ability to undertake the social cost and economic burden incurred when they are categorized as employers in labor law. Only these platforms can invoke their technological and organizational power to reasonably allocate such costs and burdens.

TI INTERNATIONAL SHARING ECONOMY: THE CASE OF AIRBNB IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC
SO ECONOMICS & SOCIOLOGY
AB The concept of the sharing economy in accommodation business, an explosively growing business model, influences housing and hotel markets worldwide. The aim of this paper is to investigate the size of the AirBnB sector in Prague, to identify a potential disruption of the accommodation market and the potential scale of tax evasion of the AirBnB users, to state the need for additional regulation in this field. The research data were collected using the method of webscrapping from AirBnb website, then validated using the AirDNA database (18 586 units, 1 048 585 records, April 2016 to March 2017). The tax evasion was measured through authors' own model. The main results are as follows: through the offer of accommodation via AirBnB platform in Prague is extensive and compatible with the capacity of Prague hotels; the average occupancy rate in Prague is highly above the values of 14 largest European cities; 80% of the real estate units offered through the AirBnB platform do not represent the case of the usual sharing economy, but are a subject to taxes. The data on Prague substantially outstrips the European average, thus indicating to a potentially significant misuse of the AirBnB platform and a low-scale associated potential tax evasion. Czech legislation is well prepared for sharing economy. 7.4% of the AirBnB users control 39.56% of all accommodation options offered via this platform in Prague.

AB Thanks to its relative novelty, the sharing economy is still an insufficiently studied concept; it has however been raising increasing awareness among population, and therefore its study is very important. During the years 2010-2020, it began to account for an increasing share of the total GDP of almost all world countries. In the sector of the sharing economy, there are companies that offer an ever-growing range of goods and services. At present, these are accommodation, transport, and multimedia services. In the Czech Republic, with the increased share of the sharing economy, an increase in the ICT sector was also recorded. There are more than 700 vehicle sharing companies operating worldwide. Relevant published data are openly available through the Czech Statistical Office (CSO) public database and companies engaged in analytical activities, and also included in annual reports for investors of particular companies (the model company). An analysis of academic and scientific publications published so far on this topic shows that this area of economics has significant potential for future research.

   perspective
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
AB Although sharing is not a new subject, sharing behavior enabled by peer-to-peer software technologies is a recent phenomenon. Studies have explored the impact of the sharing economy on consumers by applying the theory of planned behavior, complexity theory, and social exchange theory, but few studies have explored transaction costs in the sharing economy. By integrating network externalities with transaction cost theory, this study ex-plores transaction costs and their determinants in the context of the sharing economy. Structural equation modeling analysis was conducted on data from 375 users of Airbnb. The findings indicate that personalization of asset specificity and transaction frequency negatively influence transaction costs. Additionally, learning of asset specificity and transaction uncertainty positively affects transaction costs, which in turn influence behavioral intention. Furthermore, perceived complementarity has a direct effect on transaction uncertainty. Finally, the number of users moderates the relationship between transaction costs and behavioral intention. This under-standing will assist managers in numerous industries impacted by the rapid development of the sharing economy by providing them with strategies for coping with this trend.

TI Green consumers and their identities: how identities change the
   motivation for green consumption
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES
AB This research aims to fill the gap in green consumption literature from the perspective of values as types of intentions and identity-based motivation. In two studies, we examine how the salience of personal and social identities can change the relationship between types of intentions and green consumption. The results demonstrate that when personal identity is salient, self-transcendence intentions influence green consumption more than self-enhancement intentions. This is because personal identity (compared with social identity) increases the positive effect of congruent intentions (self-transcendence) on green consumption. However, when social identity is salient, self-transcendence and self-enhancement intentions have a similar impact on green consumption. This is because social identity (compared with personal identity) reduces the negative effect of self-enhancement intentions on green consumption. Finally, we discuss theoretical and managerial implications for values as types of intentions, identity-based motivation and green consumption.

TI "A predictive model of building initial trust in sharing economy:
   MULTI-DIMENSIONAL analysis of facebook users in Morocco"
SO TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
AB The present paper aims to identify factors that influence Moroccan's initial trusting intention towards the sharing economy platforms by developing a predictive model of consumer building initial trusting intention towards platforms and providers. Using a triangulation method, the research is based on exploratory studies conducted to gain further insight into the sharing economy in the Moroccan context from platforms and providers' standpoints. Exploratory studies have provided background information to develop a predictive model of building initial trusting intention towards the sharing economy platforms based on McKnight and colleagues' model of building initial trust. A survey questionnaire was used to obtain empirical data from a sample of 238 members of sharing economy Facebook pages. Structural equation modeling was employed to examine 11 hypotheses related to the relationship that exists between predictors and consumers' initial trusting intention toward the sharing economy platforms. Findings provide evidence that Moroccan consumers' initial trusting intention towards these platforms results from specific factors: consumers' personal factors (propensity to trust), knowledge-based trust (consumers' past experience), and external factors (e-worth of mouth). Results highlight the role of consumers' belief in parties' trustworthiness in building initial trusting intention: platform's reliability, functionality, and helpfulness, and providers' competence, benevolence, and integrity. Findings have not shown any influence of perceived risk in developing initial trusting intention. Research has academic and managerial implications.

TI Why Do People Consume and Provide Sharing Economy Accommodation?A
   Sustainability Perspective
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In the platform-based sharing economy service, the consumer using the service and the service provider providing the service form a two-sided market around the platform. In the two-sided market, service users and service providers interact across the platform, and the value of the platform increases with the size of the network. This study aims to study the virtuous circulation of consumption and production for sustainability of sharing economy. For this purpose, several hypotheses were established based on the literature and are tested with survey data of both consumer and service provider of Airbnb. Structural equation modeling is used to analyze whether the consumer acceptance intention model and the supplier acceptance intention model can be linked through the concept of network effect, which is a major characteristic of the sharing economy service platform. The research results are expected to contribute to development of a sustainable sharing economy model.

TI Psychological contract breach and opportunism in the sharing economy:
   Examining the platform-provider relationship
SO INDUSTRIAL MARKETING MANAGEMENT
AB In the sharing economy market, B2B relationships between service providers and sharing economy platforms are largely built on the platforms' promise of ensuring a successful sharing experience, which is not always delivered. Moreover, platforms have the opportunity to take advantage of their dominant positions in the market. Despite the growing number of studies on the dark side of the sharing economy, little is known about psychological contract breach and opportunism in the context of B2B platforms. Building on these notions, this study set out to examine the determinants of individual service providers' relationship with a sharing economy platform using psychological contract theory. The study was conducted in the UK on a sample of 252 Airbnb hosts who were recruited through an online consumer panel. The results show that psychological contract breach is an important construct within platform B2B relationships which increases feelings of violation and reduces trust. Furthermore, perceived opportunism was found to be negatively related to feelings of violation. These feelings contribute positively to negative word-of-mouth, while trust leads to continuance intentions. In addition, the indirect effects of opportunism on negative word-of-mouth and of psychological contract breach on continuance intentions were confirmed.

TI The Emergence of the Sharing Economy: Implications for Development
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPING SOCIETIES
AB With the spread of internet-based technologies, the sharing economy is emerging as a new and rapidly growing sector of the economy. This sector offers transformative potential for many other sectors of the economy, and possibilities for new economic activity and growth in the developing world. The sharing economy is a misnomer, as while there are possibilities for more cooperative economic approaches, the primary emphasis is on the reduction of transaction costs including the elimination of middlemen in sales between a good/service provider and a customer. In this introductory article to the special edition, we provide an overview of both the positive and negative potential for the contribution of the sharing economy to development. On the one hand, we find that the reduction in transactions costs and the low price of mobiles improves access to goods and services, and reduces the need for economies of scale for marginalized groups who lack access to capital and infrastructure. However, we point to the real obstacles that the poor experience in using internet-based platforms to start businesses or accumulate capital. We discuss the potential for labour substitution of traditional service providers, such as taxi drivers. In juxtaposition to some of its claimants, we find that the sharing economy changes the nature of institutional, regulatory and promotional challenges by the state and social groups, rather than reducing the need for them.

TI SHARED ECONOMY AND CAPITALIST MODE OF PRODUCTION IN THE CONTEXT OF
   DELIVERY APPLICATIONS
SO GESTAO E DESENVOLVIMENTO
AB Some of the sharing economy characteristics generate new work relationships. Therefore, it is important to understand whether this new economic model can reinforce the already precarious nature of work. Through semi-structured interviews with five bike messengers from different delivery applications, the article sought to understand if application companies perpetuate the capitalist mode of production practices through the exploitation of the delivery activity. Analyses were carried out based on a priori categories related to motivation, routine, advantages, and disadvantages of performing the activity of delivery, awareness of labor rights, relationship with companies, and the future perspective of the activity and formal jobs. As a result, it was possible to identify that even though the sharing economy brings many gains for innovative platforms, there is a context of inequality behind this economic growth that questions the social pillar of sustainability.

TI What Makes Hosts Trust Airbnb? Antecedents of Hosts' Trust toward Airbnb
   and Its Impact on Continuance Intention
SO JOURNAL OF TRAVEL RESEARCH
AB Sharing economy platforms are growing at an unprecedented rate. Travel and tourism scholars have been focusing on customers' sharing intention, yet the literature has largely overlooked what makes sharing service providers trust a sharing economy platform and decide to continue using it. Drawing on sociotechnical theory and the information systems success model, in conjunction with privacy concerns and economic value perspectives, this study develops an integrated model of antecedents and consequences of trust toward sharing economy platforms. Data from 606 Airbnb hosts were analyzed through structural equation modeling. Our research documents the importance of social antecedents (i.e., social value orientation and social utility), technical antecedents (i.e., system quality, service quality, and information quality), economic antecedents (i.e., monetary rewards) and privacy assurance antecedents (i.e., perceived effectiveness of privacy policy) in shaping hosts' trust toward Airbnb, thereby enhancing their continuance intention with regard to using the platform.

TI Business Model of Learning Platforms in Sharing Economy

AB Current economy is driven by innovation and knowledge. Sharing economy is a new perspective on economics that impulses a new economy based on trust. In this article, the key components of global education business, based on the analysis of different types of business cases such as edX, Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, and Codecademy are established. For this research we carried out a systematic literature review based on different cases to highlight some of the main advantages of the models of global education services based on sharing economy, as a result, we found out that the main components of the learning platform business model in sharing economy are related to the online cash concept, shared resources, shared knowledge access, networking collaboration, analysis based on big data, joint consumption, rather than ownership while the government loses monopolies of knowledge. Our claim is that global education will be supported by a collaborative consumption model based on the online cash concept, shared resources, and shared knowledge access.

TI Digitalization and the hybridization of markets and circuits in Airbnb
SO CONSUMPTION MARKETS & CULTURE
AB Digitalization, combined with the proliferation of online review and payment systems, has been integral to the creation of the sharing economy. While the sharing economy has opened industries to additional workers, it also shift risks to users and leads to a hybridization of previously pure economic concepts such as markets and circuits of commerce. Due to this risk shift, how do sharing economy users, specifically Airbnb hosts, protect themselves from the risks inherent in a marketplace that is both formal and informal, and regularly crosses the boundaries between legal and illegal? Using qualitative interviews with 23 Airbnb hosts in New York City, I argue that Airbnb's shifting of risk to workers leads to a hybridized form of institutional work as hosts create a social circuitry in order to protect themselves. This research contributes to the larger literature on digitalized and informal markets and circuits, risk, and societal impact of digitalization.

AB The sharing economy represents a developing business model based on sharing the temporarily unused assets, often using an on-line platform, but also without it. In view of its economic, environmental, and social benefits, the importance of this phenomenon increases also from the point of view of companies. They can apply various types of sharing both on an inter-company level, in particular within the framework of companies with ownership ties, companies located in the same industrial zones or those involved in supply chains, as well as on an in-house level. In view of the specifics of the chemical industry, the paper deals with alternative forms of sharing of chemical companies operating in the Czech Republic. The benefits and limiting factors preventing the development of sharing, as viewed by chemical companies, are also discussed. Attention is especially focused on legislation issues.

AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential determinants of sustainable consumption behavior. This study describes lifestyle of health and sustainability (LOHAS) tendency and the effects of such lifestyles on the behavioral intentions for sustainable consumption in sharing economy. Design/methodology/approach This research adapts LOHAS tendency, consumer attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control and consumers' behavioral intention for sustainable consumption scale in Indian context to describe the sustainable consumption behavior by extending the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Data of 627 individuals collected through a questionnaire, after the scales validation process and thereafter a structural equation analysis has been performed. Findings The findings confirm the extended TPB, wherein LOHAS tendency has emerged as an antecedent to consumer attitudes for taking part in sustainable consumption. Results highlight that consumer attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control are significant determining factors of consumers' sustainable consumption behavior. Research limitations/implications This study has examined the sustainable consumption behavior by considering the lifestyle tendency. A few other limitations are also discussed. Originality/value Consumer behavior in sharing economy is surely one of the emerging research areas; there is dearth of research to understand Indian consumers' sustainable consumption, particularly from lifestyle perspective. This research establishes relationship between LOHAS tendency and sustainable consumption, which may serve as a contributor to sharing economy in terms of LOHAS consumer's lifestyle and their sustainable consumption behavior.

TI How do platforms improve social capital within sharing economy-based
   service triads: an information processing perspective
SO PRODUCTION PLANNING & CONTROL
AB This study examines how platforms within sharing economy-based service triads (SESTs) can improve their social capital through information processing and knowledge management mechanisms, with the objective to provide better platform services to both service suppliers and end customers. Data were collected through multiple case studies, primarily relying on insight gathered from 32 semi-structured interviews with managers from four sharing economy platform companies in the Chinese ride-sharing (DiDi and Uber China) and logistics-sharing (Huo-che-bang and Yun-man-man) industries. Through our analysis we uncover uncertainties faced by sharing economy platforms in SETSs (including task complexity, over-competition, and task coordination), delineating their information processing requirements. Based on our findings we suggest that these requirements can be addressed by enhanced intra-organizational structures that would contribute to the SESTs' information processing capacity. Accomplishing this fit between a platform's information processing requirements and associated information processing capacity carries great promise to not only affect the platform's knowledge management capability (PKMC) but also the social capital created within SESTs.

TI Evaluation of the Consumer Perception of Sharing Economy: Cases of
   Latvia, Russia, Ukraine and Belarus
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The overwhelming goal of large-scale cross-country research is to evaluate consumers' perception of a sharing economy. The research was limited by the number of respondents, as well as by the countries represented in the survey. Latvia, Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus were mostly represented, and only these responses (757) were analyzed. The study used multilevel modelling of sharing economy elements (dependent variable) in relation to personal characteristics (age, gender, income, industry) nested by the self-assessed level of eco-friendliness (a key predictor for the attitude towards sharing economy). Findings: The key personal characteristics, which influence a person's intention to be involved in the sharing economy practices, are level of income, education, and also self-perceived ecological friendliness. The sharing economy is not only a topic for investigation among academicians, but also an issue on the agenda of the European Commission, because it is considered as a driver for growth and job creation in the European Union. Despite an increasing interest and many studies, there is a limited number of studies focused on difference in perception of sharing economy depending on personal characteristics of respondents. This indicates the necessity of conducting such surveys, involving participants from different European countries. The given paper could be used as a methodological framework for other European researchers who are interested in the exploration of the topic regarding perception of the sharing economy.

AB Recently, the trend of sharing economy has gained popularity in fashion, particularly among millennials. Few studies in the past have focused on sharing economy in the clothing industry, mainly in the US and European context. However, whether this global phenomenon of sharing economy will work in emerging markets for the luxury fashion industry is still unknown. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to understand the impact of the various key factors viz economic benefits, fashion involvement, self-pleasing experience, social projection, perceived risk, and past sustainable behavior on luxury consumption behavior in the sharing economy. Self-determination Theory (SDT) perspective was adopted to show what motivates Indian millennials to participate in luxury fashion rental consumption. Probability sampling technique was used to collect data from Indian millennials who aspired to use luxury fashion brands on a sharing basis. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted, followed by multi-group analysis and path estimates to test the hypothesized relationships. The results of the study indicated "social projection value" as the most significant predictor of intention to consume luxury fashion on a sharing basis. Furthermore, the effect of perceived risk and the influence of past sustainable behavior on young consumers' luxury fashion rental consumption was also found to be significant.

TI Online friendships in a hospitality exchange network: a sharing economy
   perspective
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose - The present study aims to clarify how online friendships between local residents and tourists are made in a hospitality exchange network, one of the not-for-profit sharing economy platforms. Specifically, the study empirically examines three topics: the properties of dyadic relationships in the platform; the effect of face-to-face interactions on online friendships in the platform; and the role of locals in building host-guest relationships in the hospitality exchange network.
   Design/methodology/approach - Social networks data in CouchSurfing. org were collected and analyzed using a social network analysis (SNA) program. Along with the descriptive analysis of the actors in the online hospitality network, several SNA indicators, including the degree of centrality, density and centralization, were measured to explore the nature of the network and identify the gatekeepers.
   Findings - Findings suggest that latent ties between tourists and hosts are likely to be manifested through face-to-face events. In particular, local people play central roles in establishing host-guest relationships.
   Research limitations/implications - This study contributes to the body of knowledge on the sharing economy in hospitality by synthesizing two areas in the literature, the host-guest framework and the online hospitality networks.
   Originality/value - The social psychological aspects of the sharing economy have yet to receive attention from hospitality scholars. In addition, studies have largely focused on profit-driven models in the sharing economy (e.g. Airbnb). This study fills this gap by examining the host and guest behavior empirically in one of the not-for-profit hospitality sharing economy platforms.

   GEOGRAFICZNEGO-STUDIES OF THE INDUSTRIAL GEOGRAPHY COMMISSION OF THE
   POLISH GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY
AB One of the key factors that contributed to the development of the sharing economy was the global recession caused by the economic crisis that began in 2008. The economic collapse forced many consumers, struggling with financial difficulties, to limit or even abandon the consumption of certain goods and services. The consequence of this situation was an increased interest in the sharing economy and, as a result, in many cases no need to give up consumption of preferred goods or services. What is more, consumers could access them at a much lower cost than if they purchased them on their own. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the COVID-19 pandemic, which among other things contributed to social isolation and crisis in selected economic sectors, will have a significant impact on people's behaviour. We can expect, among others, changes in the model of spending leisure time, an increase in the importance of remote customer service channels (e.g. e-commerce, m-commerce), or changes in the approach to sharing economy. The main objective of the article was to define the determinants of the development of sharing economy among young consumers in the period of COVID-19 pandemic. People aged 18-29 (generation C) who are active in the area of sharing economy were surveyed. Focus Group Interviews were used as a research method. The analyses were based on the author's research workshop developed on the basis of methodological literature.

TI Is the sharing economy causing a regime switch in consunitnion?
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB The recent rise of digital technology has enabled the development of various online platforms that gave rise to the so-called sharing economy. Academics suggest that this economy is causing a switch in consumer behaviour. This paper attempts to test this hypothesis by fitting a smooth transition autoregressive model to the cycle of the proportion of e-commerce to personal consumption in the U.S. between 1999 and 2019. The analysis reveals that the sharing economy, driven by the diffusion of digital technology, is causing consumption to transition smoothly, but frequently, between two regimes between 1999 and 2013. In the later period, however, it displays a stable regime due to the slow diffusion of digital technologies over this period. We conclude that, indeed, the sharing economy is causing a regime switch in consumption, and the dynamic behaviour of this regime switching is consistent with the behaviour of the diffusion process of digital technologies.

TI Sharing economy in the new hospitality: consumer perspective
SO JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM INSIGHTS
AB Purpose - The aim of the paper is to assist hospitality business, operating in a sharing economy model and responding to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) crisis. It is argued that the creation of a strategy to face COVID-19 crisis should be focussed on what the guests valued most. The paper focusses on the Airbnb service, which is the leading platform in accommodation inside the sharing economy, to explore the consumer profile and analyse its motivations to use hospitality service, based on socio-demographic characteristics and user experience.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research uses a questionnaire survey targeting tourists who have experience using the Airbnb service. A total of 380 valid responses were analysed with statistical package programme for the social sciences (SPSS), performing a multivariate variance analyses (MANOVA) and univariate analysis (UNIANOVA), which corresponds to five of the main motivations regarding Airbnb booking.
   Findings - The results show a motivation increase towards the sharing economy and benefits of the sharing economy for customers between 41 and 60 years of age. It was also observed that consumers with a monthly income below the average salary level are less keen to prefer the sharing economy philosophy. Controversially, the results also show that more than 80% of the guests do not want to share the room with people they are not related to.
   Originality/value - The paper contributes to the understanding of consumers' behaviour by discussing the potential of the accommodation sharing model for the post-COVID recovery of the hospitality sector.

TI Engagement platforms in the sharing economy Conceptual foundations and
   research directions
SO JOURNAL OF SERVICE THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify and delineate research directions that guide future empirical studies exploring how engagement platforms facilitate value co-creation and actor engagement in the context of the sharing economy.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors adopt a midrange theorizing approach with service-dominant logic as the integrating meta-theoretical perspective to develop a theoretical framework about service platforms, engagement platforms, and actor engagement in information communication technology (ICT) mediated environments. The authors then contextualize the framework for the sharing economy.
   Findings - The authors introduce 20 unique research questions to guide future studies related to service ecosystems, engagement platforms, and actor engagement practices in the context of the sharing economy.
   Research limitations/implications - The sharing economy is an emerging phenomenon that is driven by the development and proliferation of engagement platforms. The engagement platform concept therefore provides a novel perspective for exploration of how ICT can be utilized to facilitate value co-creation and engagement amongst interdependent economic actors in a service ecosystem.
   Practical implications - The purpose of this paper is to guide future academic research, rather than managerial practice. Future research based on the framework can help guide decision-makers to implement and use engagement platforms more effectively.
   Originality/value - This paper offers new insight into the important intersection of ICT and service research, and guides future studies exploring the role of engagement platforms in the context of the sharing economy.

TI The differentially associated sharing economy
SO NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY
AB The sharing economy has been booming in China. Within the sharing economy, the ridesharing sector has been a profit-generating engine. This sector is generally associated with the strikingly rapid and viral rise of major companies. However, there are alternative practices of ridesharing outside of the mainstream sphere constructed by major platforms. This article investigates these alternative practices in a prefectural area in China. They are enabled by the intertwinement of new technology usage and traditional social relations. The way in which local taxi drivers form exclusive groups resembles the differential mode of association proposed by Fei Xiaotong. Therefore, I have coined the term "differentially associated sharing economy" to describe these alternative ridesharing practices. I argue that the intersection of technology usage and traditional social relations enables resistance against platform monopoly as well as restrains the potential of technologies to kinship and friend cliques.

TI Implications of coproduction technology on waste management: Who can
   benefit from the coproduct made of leftover materials?
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
AB In recent years, coproduction technology has been developed and adopted by many third-party coproduct manufacturers (CMs). Coproducts made of leftover materials from traditional manufacturing are strongly attractive to green consumers who are willing to pay a price premium for environmental protection. However, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) might hesitate to adopt coproduction technology be-cause the coproduct cannibalizes the sales of their traditional products. In this paper, we develop a game -theoretical model to investigate the economic and environmental implications of coproduction that can be leveraged by one OEM or one CM. We find that, from the OEM's perspective, the dominant strategy can be OEM coproduction, CM coproduction, or No coproduction, which is contingent on the demand from green consumers and the supply of raw materials. We also find that the size of green consumers and the unit cost of raw materials have non-monotone impacts on the CM's profit. Interestingly, an en-larging size of green consumers might hurt the CM, while an increasing cost of raw materials might benefit the CM. Although coproduction recovers the value of leftover materials, the adoption of copro-duction technology increases the total material consumption and the total material waste when the unit cost of raw materials is sufficiently high, making the environment worse off.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI Guilt and differentiation in social discourses on "green" consumption in
   Spain
SO CONSUMPTION MARKETS & CULTURE
AB The aim of this article is to explore social discourse on "green" consumption in Spain by analysing how guilt and logic of practice are involved in this type of consumption from a psycho-sociological perspective. The empirical work was qualitative: we analysed 14 focus groups and nine interviews with "green" and "non-green" consumers from different social backgrounds. The results show that "green" consumption involves a dual process of social differentiation and guilt, especially in "greener" consumers from middle and middle-upper class social backgrounds, whose discourse is developed in socio-environmental terms. These findings question whether "green" consumption is an effective element within a transformative environmental policy.

TI Green consumption intention and behavior of tourists in urban and rural
   destinations
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB The current explosive growth of global consumption has caused many environmental problems, so guiding and regulating the public's green consumption intention and behavior is an important issue. By constructing the tourist green consumption model of urban and rural tourism destinations (TAM-TPB), this paper uses the PLS-SEM method to expound the realization path and mechanism of tourists' green consumption intention in urban and rural destinations. The TAM-TPB model provides better explanatory and predictive power for urban destinations than for rural destinations. In addition, the perceived usefulness plays a significant mediating effect, especially in urban destinations, and the green consumption attitude will not mediate or directly affect consumption intention. Finally, there is a certain gap in tourists' green consumption intention between urban and rural destinations, but it is limited to the paths from perceived ease of use to consumption attitude and from subjective norm to consumption intention.

TI The sharing economy as community marketplace? Trust, reciprocity and
   belonging in peer-to-peer accommodation platforms
SO CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF REGIONS ECONOMY AND SOCIETY
AB What is the role sociality and belonging play within the particular exchange model that the sharing economy embodies? This article presents a theoretical review and a comparative analysis of the main sharing platforms in the accommodation domain in order to outline a conceptual framework on the relations between trust, reciprocity and belonging in the sharing economy. We argue that mobilising a sense of community is not only instrumental to promising a more intense consumption experience; it is crucial to eliciting users' active participation in the self-regulation of peer-to-peer exchanges and for dealing with relevant trust issues, especially when sharing implies co-presence and/or non-monetary compensation. The drivers and potential outcomes of the decline in social depth of sharing practices are discussed.

TI Social capital creation on professional sharing economy platforms: The
   problems of rating dependency and the non-transferability of social
   capital
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB The sharing economy platforms facilitate collaboration across geographical boundaries and promote service innovation by reshaping traditional business networks. This study takes a Social Capital Theory perspective on how Social Capital (SC) is created on professional sharing economy platforms, with particular attention to the creative services industry. Our in-depth qualitative investigation draws on 35 interviews with freelance designers and platform clients based in 17 different countries. The study demonstrates that SC created outside sharing economy platforms is not readily transferred to these platforms, which represents a major difference from the dynamics of SC in more traditional settings. Furthermore, SC transfer between platforms is difficult. Building platform-specific SC 'from scratch' requires a significant effort and is highly dependent on reputation systems, in the form of ratings and reviews. We argue that the platforms' reputation systems force members to become 'slaves' to ensuring their star ratings and reviews are as good as possible. In addition, we explore how platform members learn to build SC on the platforms beyond ratings and reviews. Overall, the study contributes to academic discussions on opportunities and challenges for service innovation within the sharing economy and introduces the application of Social Capital Theory to the context of sharing economy platforms.

Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, we found nine job motivations fitted to a tri-dimensional conceptualization model of the food-delivery workers. Four role senders who induce stresses in the role structures were identified. The effects of job motivations on role stressors vary across different working conditions. Role conflict is a severe problem generating turnover intention in the supply-side of sharing economy. The practical contribution shows productivity enhancement from workers' intrinsic factors. The extrinsic factors of welfare economics are still essential for human resource transformation in the sharing economy.

TI Fraud abroad: GDP per capita, online customer reviews and vacation
   rental unit booking rates in the sharing economy
SO JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Purpose This study aims to investigate a sharing economy context, where vacation rental units that are owned and operated by individuals throughout the world are rented out through a common website: vrbo.com. It is posited that gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, a common indicator of the level of economic development of a nation, will impact the likelihood that prospective travelers will choose to book accommodations in the sharing economy channel (vs traditional hotels). The role of online customer reviews in this process is investigated as well, building upon a significant body of extant research which shows their level of customer decision influence.
   Design/methodology/approach An empirical analysis is conducted using data from the website Vacation Rentals By Owner on 1,940 rental listings across 97 countries.
   Findings GDP per capita serves as risk deterrent to prospective travelers, making the sharing economy an acceptable alternative to traditional hotels for the average traveler. It is also found that the total number of online customer reviews (OCR volume) is a signal of popularity to prospective travelers, while the average star rating of those online customer reviews (OCR valence) is instead a signal of accommodation quality.
   Originality/value This study adds to a growing agenda of research investigating the effect of online customer reviews on consumer decisions, with a particularly focus on the burgeoning sharing economy. The findings help to explain when the sharing economy may serve as a stronger disruptive threat to incumbent offerings. It also provides the following key insights for managers: sharing economy rental units in developed nations are more successful in driving booking activity, managers should look to promote volume of online customer reviews and positive online customer reviews are particularly influential for sharing economy rental booking rates in less developed nations.

It is not only adding value to the firm but to all the multiple stakeholders indulged in the business operations. Understanding this multifaceted value-driven approach, the current study delves deeper in understanding the concept of shared economy in Indian context. Theoretically, it adds the literature on the sharing economy by concentrating how value co-creation (VCC) is generated in case of shared economy. Additionally, the study suggests and tests a conceptual framework for VCC for the sharing economy, which offers an empirical support in concerned topics. Lastly, the study has managerial implications for the budding entrepreneurs in the sharing economy to building and value co-creation in service industry.

TI Fashion platform operations in the sharing economy with digital
   technologies: recent development and real case studies
SO ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH
AB With the emergence of digital technologies, we have witnessed a rapid growth of the sharing economy in recent years. In fashion industry, sharing economy concept is also widely applied. Instances can be found all over the world, like Rent the Runway, Golden Tote, Stitch Fix, and Le Tote in the US, Air Closet in Japan, Y Closet, Ms Paris, and Dora's Dream in China, etc. In this paper, motivated by the industrial practices of fashion sharing platforms, we first conduct a literature review on business operations of sharing platforms, including the sharing platform operations, digital and information technologies employed in sharing economy, business models, and sustainability and circularity in business operations. Afterwards, we analyze the challenges faced by fashion sharing platforms by exploring the two leading fashion sharing platforms in the US and in China, respectively. At last, we propose future research directions on fashion sharing platform operations and conclude the paper.

AB The global economic and social crisis has reflected on the changing perceptions and paradigms on the model of today's economy and led to a review of a number of economic and social concepts, such as the necessity of having scarce resources. This concept is in the focus of sharing economy that is still in its development and there is no generally accepted definition. It represents a business model based on sharing, rental and exchange of goods and services whose transactions are executed on online platforms and services. It relies on the principle of openness and it influences the changes of ownership dogma according to which resources have to be own in order to use them. As such it represents a challenge for the country, especially in the field of business legal regulations and taxation because it changes the standard, classic economic model based on production, distribution, exchange and consumption. Importance of sharing economy which strongly affects certain economic sectors such as tourism and transport, is recognized by the European Union, and its largest generator are young people through the development of social entrepreneurship. This work will analyze some of the most famous representatives of this model on a global level, such as Airbnb and Uber. The main objective of this work is to provide a holistic view of the sharing economy and the possibility of its implementation (business, legal and institutional), impacting the sustainability of resources, creating opportunities that will increase employment (especially youth) and promote the practices of sharing, collaboration and cooperation on all society levels.

AB Information and communication technology (ICT) has an important position in the area of sharing economy because it mediates distance communication between people. The development of various sharing economy services is dependent on ICT acceptance in the society. The paper presents exploratory pre-research focused on the three selected aspects. The aim of the paper is to find out how age, education, and economic status affect human behaviour in ICT-based sharing economy services. Emphasis is placed on the role that anyone can play in sharing economy services provider and consumer. For this purpose, a questionnaire survey was carried out on a sample of Generation X and Y members from the Czech Republic (n=453). The results show that income does not affect the role played in a sharing economy environment. Younger people from Generation Y have a greater tendency to become consumers and older people from Generation X have a greater tendency to become providers. People with higher education are more inclined to use ICT-based services of sharing economy than people with lower education.

TI The Sharing Economy
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF LAW AND SOCIAL SCIENCE, VOL 14
SE Annual Review of Law and Social Science
AB The sharing economy is an emergent field of scholarship. This review explores two clusters of debate regarding the sharing economy and seeks to discern the lines of a productive dialogue between them. It suggests that the current state of scholarship on law in the sharing economy is a complex and asymmetrical mix of narrative articulation and empirical exploration. The first cluster focuses on an on-demand commercial vision of the sharing economy and is generating an exploding legal literature largely not grounded on empirical research. This coexists with an emergent social science literature focused on a solidarity-inflected version of the sharing economy, which, however, pays little or no explicit attention to law or legality. Each cluster of debate is first separately explored, after which three sites of detente are identified where these trajectories edge toward each other: urban governance, sociolegal accounts of the interplay between enterprise diversity and regulation, and reconfigurations of property law. Common to all three is an appreciation of collective economic agency as of equal importance to regulatory responses.

AB With the development of Internet, the era of sharing economy has begun worldwide. The core of sharing economy is typically assumed to be social trust. The Google Trends data provided us chances to measure sharing economy penetration using the Airbnb, representative of accommodation sharing companies, as the search term. Regression results suggest that social trust, together with political environment and economic openness, is highly correlated with sharing economy penetration in country level, which other external variables including GDP, education, population density, Internet, and unemployment rate are not determinants affecting sharing economy penetration.

TI Modelling consumption behaviour changes in a B2C electric
   vehicle-sharing system: a perceived systemic risk perspective
SO CLIMATIC CHANGE
AB Most sharing economy business models implement win-win strategies to promote business viability on the one hand coupled with environmental and social sustainability on the other hand. To achieve this purpose, a lower cumulative consumption pattern is a critical benchmark for the effectiveness of such strategies in the sharing economy. In this paper, we define and model consumption patterns and behaviour changes from the perspective of perceived systemic risks (both scarcity and reciprocity risk) in the sharing economy and test our proposed model in the case of EVCARD, an electric vehicle (EV)-sharing system in Shanghai, China. Our analysis shows that the perceived scarcity risk of the EV-sharing significantly affects access-based consumption behaviour, collaborative consumption behaviour and substitutive behaviour intentions. We also show that the perceived reciprocity risk only has a significant effect on access-based consumption behaviour intentions. Moreover, the moderating effects of access variables are tested. We conclude that sharing businesses can achieve their win-win strategies by mitigating perceived systemic risks, influencing the consumer's desire and capability to substitute private ownership with access-based, collaborative consumption.

TI How Green Consumption Value Affects Green Consumer Behaviour: The
   Mediating Role of Consumer Attitudes Towards Sustainable Food Logistics
   Practices
SO VISION-THE JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE
AB The aim of the study is to identify the green consumption values and production patterns and understand how they impact consumer behaviour and purchase intention of green consumers, in particular, the environment-conscious youth in the city of Bangalore. The focus of the study is on the pre-purchase sustainable logistics of food products and how they impact behaviour and attitudes of green consumers. The theory of planned behaviour and social cognitive theory form the theoretical base for the current research. An online survey was conducted among 284 participants in and around the scope area. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling were used to test the hypotheses. The results showed that green consumption values and consumer attitudes towards sustainable food logistics either directly or indirectly influence green purchase intention and environmentally conscious behaviour towards food products. The main contribution of this study is the identification of new multidimensional constructs which can be used to measure green consumer attitude in terms of sustainable food logistics practices in the Indian context. These findings will empower managers and future researchers to understand how sustainable food logistics practices can create green consumer attitudes. They will also assist food production companies to identify possible opportunities, developments and other benefits they can derive from following sustainable food logistics practices.

TI More than words can say: A randomized field experiment on the effects of
   consumer self-disclosure in the sharing economy
SO ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
AB Mechanism design has emerged as relevant field for information systems management. Specifically, for two-sided markets, design choices have significant effects on user behavior and thus on how supply and demand are matched. On sharing economy platforms, not only actors from the demand side, but also from the supply side must trust their respective counterparts for any transaction to be realized. With this paper, we shed light on the effects of consumer self-disclosure by means of a field experiment on Airbnb (n = 400). Specifically, we investigate how the availability of profile photos and/or self-descriptions affects the chances of their booking requests being accepted. In view of recent anti-discrimination initiatives pushing back profile photos, we consider the compensatory and complementary roles of textual self-descriptions for creating trust. Findings suggest that, while not as powerful as photos, self-descriptions can partially compensate the trust loss induced by the renunciation of photos. Our findings have immediate implications for the design and operation of sharing economy platforms.

TI Airbnb as a sharing economy-enabled digital service platform: The power
   of motivational factors and the moderating role of experience
SO TOURISM ECONOMICS
AB Airbnb is one of the business models that represent the expansion of the sharing economy into digital environments. The model offers several different benefits to its own customers, who are guests and hosts. It affects the tourism and hospitality industry via its economic impact on competition and its influence on choices made by visitors. This study thus aims to explore the role of visitor motivation to use Airbnb (price value, authenticity, enjoyment, social interaction, home benefits, novelty, and sharing economy ethos) and the visitor experience (low-experienced vs. high-experienced individuals) by explaining usage intention via attitudes toward this particular business model. For this purpose, 468 people were surveyed online, and the gathered data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Based on the results, we can offer empirical evidence of the positive effect of motivational factors on attitude, and correspondingly, also of attitude on usage intention. The moderating role of experience on the relationship between motivation and attitude is also discussed.

A survey was held amongst 1330 respondents from Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Using stated preference data, we investigate the relative importance of (1) economic, (2) social and (3) environmental motivations to participate in peer-to-peer sharing. Hereby we consider differences between (a) sectors of the sharing economy, (b) socio-demographic groups, and (c) users and providers. Results are descriptive as well as based on ordered logit models. Notable differences are observed in the motivations for sharing between sectors. To a lesser extent there is variety in sharing drivers between socio-demographic groups. Finally, users seem more economically motivated than providers of goods. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY license.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of perceived value (both hedonic and utilitarian) in attracting consumer engagement in the sharing economy, as well as its link with trust. Design/methodology/approachThis study used a survey method to empirically tested the proposed model using the partial least squares approach to structural equation modeling on data from 320 DiDi app users. FindingsThe study's findings revealed that both hedonic and utilitarian value had a significant effect on satisfaction and trust in the platform. Although the results showed no effect of hedonic and utilitarian values on trust in driver, the authors found trust in driver and platform, and satisfaction had significant influences on users' continued intention to use the Taxi-hailing app. Interestingly, this study suggests that trust in the platform is transferred to trust in the driver. Originality/valueThe results from the Necessary Condition Analysis shows that satisfaction and utilitarian value are necessary conditions of continuance intention.

TI Matching supply and demand in a sharing economy: Classification,
   computational complexity, and application
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
AB The sharing economy, i.e., the cooperative consumption of goods and services offered by private households or companies via online market places, gains more and more attention. Most sharing platforms coordinate transactions by generating each consumer an individual list of suited and available resources to choose from. If plenty online requests arrive rather simultaneously and compete for the scarce shared resources, however, an optimization-based coordination of supply and demand promises much better matches (e.g., more satisfied requests). This paper focuses deterministic matching problems and provides a classification scheme for the resulting optimization problems occurring in different areas of the sharing economy. These matching problems vary, for instance, if immobile (e.g., parking space) or mobile resources (e.g., vehicles of a car sharing provider) are shared. With the help of this classification, we give a detailed overview on known and novel complexity results. Furthermore, we apply the example of sharing parking space and explore the potential contribution of deterministic matchings when applied in a dynamic, uncertain, and opportunistic environment.

TI Risk Assessment for Engagement in Sharing Economy of Manufacturing
   Enterprises: A Matter-Element Extension Based Approach
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB At present, manufacturing enterprises in China and across the world are undergoing a critical period of transformation and upgrading for sustainable development, with various obstacles such as financing difficulties and imperfect production facilities. The emergence of the sharing economy may provide a feasible solution for manufacturing enterprises, but meanwhile, unpredictable risks are bound to arise in the process of Engagement in the Sharing Economy of Manufacturing Enterprises (ESEME), and the assessment for the risk of ESEME is an important issue that requires special attention. Based on the characteristics of ESEME, a risk assessment indicator system is constructed, and a matter-element extension based approach is proposed to assess the risk of ESEME. The comprehensive risk value of ESEME can be calculated, and by means of sensitivity analysis and combinatory analysis, sensitive risk indicators and the risk type of indicators are identified. The innovation is embodied in three aspects: the sharing economy is studied by the matter-element extension method, the minimum deviation weight is adopted, and the risk is identified by sensitivity analysis and combinatory analysis. This assessment method is applied to enterprise E, and good results are obtained. This work is conducive to promoting manufacturing enterprises to engage in the sharing economy, which provides an effective vision for enterprises to implement risk management strategies, and also offers references for the government to formulate relevant policies for ESEME.

   Emerging Market
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Due to the rising appeal of travel, as well as the appearance of low-cost carriers that fly to both popular and exotic destinations, people nowadays tend to book their accommodation through the more convenient and flexible sharing economy platforms. The success of such platforms among consumers depends on various factors, such as satisfaction and platform credibility, and on sustainable performance among contributors, increasing their relevance and visibility. This research proposes a conceptual model for measuring the success of sharing economy platforms in tourism, based on added value, unique experience, and enhanced social interactions, together with credibility and sustainable performance. In this vein, the authors conduct an empirical investigation in an emerging market-Romania-where the development of such sharing economy platforms is still in its infancy. Data gathered by the authors by means of a self-developed questionnaire distributed to 500 respondents are modelled via structural equations with SmartPLS. The results indicate that the platform credibility and sustainable performance of sharing economy platforms are key elements in generating their success. The research adds value to the stimulus-organism-response approach, highlighting some insights from a relevant emerging market, which in the future could become a turning point for inbound and outbound tourism.

AB In the 21st century, the world faces new challenges. The development of technologies, rapidly growing urbanization, demographic and social changes, as well as depletion of natural resources, may be treated as the largest megatrends. As a result of the ongoing transformation, a new form of economic activity has emerged, known as sharing economy. Sharing economy gives us the opportunity to make of available resources more effectively, It is possible by connecting people using online platforms that enable the provision of services and the cooperative use of assets. Transport belongs to the one of a crucial area of sharing economy. The aim of the article is to analyse changes in urban mobility model based on desk study research. Shared mobility characterizes the new urban mobility model, like the shared use of cars (carpooling and car-sharing), or bicycles (bicycle-sharing system). Furthermore, the approach of users to transport is changing, mobility is perceived as a service ordered and paid by a mobile application (Mobility as a Service). The article also presents possible visions for the development of urban mobility, which may vary depending on the adopted strategies and solutions. Some cities plan to significantly reduce car traffic or make car ownership pointless.

TI Business modes in the sharing economy: How does the OEM cooperate with
   third-party sharing platforms?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB The sharing economy has changed not only the purchasing and use behaviour of consumers but also the operating mode of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). For OEMs, the sharing economy represents a challenge and an opportunity. In the car market, some OEMs (e.g., General Motors and Toyota) choose to cooperate with peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing platforms, while others (e.g., Nissan and Haima) choose to work with business-to-consumer (B2C) sharing platforms. This paper develops an analytical framework to study how the OEM selects business modes under the sharing economy. Considering participation concerns inherent in the sharing economy, including renters' perceived value of shared products and owners' maintenance costs, which depend on the marginal cost of products, we first study how the profit-maximising sharing platforms of the P2P and B2C modes affect the OEM. Then, we analyse the mode decision of the OEM. We find that the OEM should choose to cooperate with the B2C platform if the value perception factor is higher or the marginal cost is lower. If the value perception factor is in the middle range and the marginal cost is higher, the OEM should choose the P2P platform. The OEM should not cooperate with any sharing platforms if the value perception factor is lower and the marginal cost is higher.

TI Green marketing in emerging Asia: antecedents of green consumer behavior
   among younger millennials
SO JOURNAL OF ASIA BUSINESS STUDIES
AB Purpose
   Rapid economic growth, urbanization, growing population and resulting overconsumption have led to the severe environmental vulnerability of some south Asian countries, further accelerated by the impact of climate change. Bangladesh is one such country that has been recognized by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change as one of the most environmentally vulnerable in the world. A significant amount of environmental deterioration is reportedly due to consumption-related activities. This study, therefore, aims to understand the antecedents of green consumer behavior among young urban consumers, an emerging and environmentally promising market in Bangladesh.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This study uses the theory of planned behavior to integrating environmental attitudes, subjective norms, perceived consumer effectiveness and behavioral intentions in its conceptual model to examine their influence on green consumer behavior. Data were collected from 206 young urban consumers (18-24 years of age) from the capital city of Bangladesh. Covariance based structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data.
   Findings
   The subsequent results suggest that perceived consumer effectiveness and subjective norms have a direct positive influence on green consumer behavior, while the direct effect of environmental attitudes is insignificant.
   Practical implications
   Based on the key finding that one of the strongest antecedents is perceived consumer effectiveness, marketers could inspire young urban consumers by applying self-directed appeal to induce green consumer behavior.
   Originality/value
   This study is one of the first studies examining the antecedents of green consumption behavior using the framework of the theory of planned behavior that integrates both behavioral intention and reported behavior in the context of young urban consumers in South Asia. An insignificant direct influence of attitudes on green consumer behavior reinforces the attitude-behavior gap, specifically among young urban consumers in a collective society. The strong positive influence of perceived consumer effectiveness on green consumer behavior, on the other hand, extends the existing green consumer literature by empirically supporting the need for enhancing self-efficacy among young consumers to persuade them to practice green consumer behavior, especially where individuals face severe challenges of climate change and environmental deterioration.

TI Sharing Economy as a Contributor to Sustainable Growth. An EU
   Perspective
SO ROMANIAN JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN AFFAIRS
AB The paper bases its analytical approach on two assumptions: the first refers to a significant change taking place in the contemporary world economy - the phenomenon of multipolarity - and proposes a new concept, that of multi-level manifestation of multipolarity; the second has in view the need of a new model of sustainable economic growth. In the context of these two points of view, the paper analyses the sharing economy as a potential significant contributor to sustainable economic growth. The conclusion of this research is that sharing economy has a huge potential of involving millions or even billions of participants and of capitalizing the existing assets while providing spill over effects in the economy. The authors expect sharing economy to become a form of economic activity that will complement traditional forms of business while generating positive economic, social and environmental effects.

TI The role of the core competence and core resource features of a sharing
   economy on the achievement of SDGs 2030
SO JOURNAL OF INNOVATION & KNOWLEDGE
AB Globally, sustainable development goals (SDGs), which need to be achieved using the sharing economy, are the focus of many recent studies. This article investigates the impact of sharing economy features such as core competence and resources on achieving SDGs in the tourism industry in the BRICS countries (Brazil, Rus-sia, India, China, and South Africa). It examines the mediating impact of distinctive competitive advantage between the core competence and core resource features of a sharing economy, and achievement of the SDGs. The study also examines the moderating role of institutional support on the nexus of distinctive com-petitive advantage and achievement of SDGs in the BRICS countries. Questionnaires are used to collect pri-mary data and Smart-PLS is used to analyse the data. The results indicate that the core competence and core resource features have a positive association with the achievement of SDGs, and that distinctive competitive advantage significantly mediates the association between core competence, core resources, and achievement of the SDGs. The outcomes reveal that institutional support significantly moderates the nexus of distinctive competitive advantage and achievement of SDGs. The research provides guidelines for regulators establish-ing policies related to the achievement of SDGs using the sharing economy.

SO MANAGEMENT DECISION
AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to connect disruptive innovation and sharing economy by exploring the underlying mechanisms of how a disruptive innovation-based business project creates, delivers and captures value in sharing economy through analyzing the case of bike sharing in China. Design/methodology/approach An elaborate case study is used to unfold the process as well as the underlying mechanism and relationships among disruptive innovation, business model, bike-sharing business and value creation in sharing economy. Findings Bike sharing case fits well in disruptive innovation theory. Its low price and great convenience have led to rapid development in China. However, failures to improve their products and services and build an effective business model which can create, deliver and capture value have caused the failure of many bike-sharing companies. Other factors such as strategic decision-making, internal management problems, external conflicts as well as uncivilized consumer behaviors have also inhibited the sustainable development of bike-sharing companies. Originality/value The theoretical contributions of this study include the following: to explore how a disruptive innovation-based business creates, delivers and captures value successfully in sharing economy. This study contributes to both research and practice on disruptive innovation and sharing economy.

TI A Turn of the Tables: Psychological Contracts and Word of Mouth about
   Sharing Economy Platforms When Consumers Get Reviewed
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB The Peer-to-Peer sector of the sharing economy relies on reputation systems through which consumers and providers review each other. Whereas prior research has examined the effects of reviews by consumers on providers and firms, this research examines, for the first time, a turn of the tables in which consumers are evaluated. Across a pilot and seven studies (five preregistered), using multiple actual behaviors and sharing contexts, results reveal that a negative review of the consumer from the peer provider leads to negative word of mouth (NWOM) about the platform. Drawing from psychological contract theory, the research demonstrates that this effect is mediated by consumers' perceived betrayal by the platform. Two sets of moderators are identified. The first set establishes that a breach of consumers' psychological contract with the platform underlies the effect. In the second set, platform policies that may render a breach more or less consequential can intensify or mitigate consumer reactions. Specifically, making the review private (vs. public) and providing opportunities for justice restoration (response, revenge, and dispute) attenuate the effect of review valence on betrayal and NWOM. Implications for sharing economy platform managers and consumers are discussed.

SO TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
AB The emergence of digital platforms based on network algorithms can mediate relationships of trust, boosting sharing economy business models. This study aims to identify the motivations and trust elements of ridesharing apps and analyze the weight of motivation variables in the explanation of trust in the platform service. The survey method was applied to a sample of 485 Brazilian users of a ridesharing app were addressed. Five factors were analyzed to users' motivation: Perceived sustainability, Security risks, Enjoyment, Platform quality, and Economic reward. Results show that 50.6% of respondents use the service until three times per month (n = 246), while 12,6% use more than four times per week. This study contributes by showing that: (i) five key user motives and two types of trusts are empirically measured and examined for the Brazilian ridesharing market; (ii) the most significant variable that explains trust in platform is "Information providing", following by platform safety and platform security; (iii) pleasant participation, enjoyment, and cheaper alternative were also significant for the trust in the platform; and (iv) trust in platform is higher than trust in drivers. These contributions could enhance applied solutions for sharing economy platforms and guide academic research on the topic.

   framework and practice-oriented tool
SO PLOS ONE
AB (1) Background Research and user experience suggests both positive and negative social impacts resulting from practices in the sharing economy: social cohesion vs. gentrification; inclusiveness vs. discrimination; flexible employment vs. exploitation. However, as yet, there is no framework for understanding or assessing these social impacts holistically. (2) Objective We aim to improve understanding of the social impacts of sharing platforms and develop a systematic framework to assess these impacts. (3) Methods We conduct a narrative literature review and stakeholder workshop, integrating insights to produce a systematic social impact assessment framework and a practice-oriented tool. (4) Results We identify four social aspects-trust, empowerment, social justice, and inclusivity-and eighteen indicators that make up the framework. We describe each indicator and its relevance to the sharing economy as well as suggest measurable variables in the form of a practice-oriented tool. (5) Conclusions The framework and tool are the first holistic method for assessing social impact in the sharing economy, which may inform researchers, sharing platforms, regulators, investors, and citizens to mitigate adverse social impacts while enhancing the overall net social value of the sharing economy.

TI Trust spillovers in the sharing economy: Does international Airbnb
   experience foster cross-national trust?
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR
AB Sharing economy platforms commonly claim to bring about positive social impacts, such as facilitating contact between individuals that would not have met otherwise. According to contact theory, such intergroup contact would change the stereotypes that individuals hold of outgroup members, such as people with a different nationality or ethnicity. We use a large-scale online Investment Game experiment among Airbnb users to study the effect of Airbnb interactions on cross-national trust. In contrast with common claims about the positive impact of the sharing economy, we did not find that individuals who had prior experience with a nationality as a host or a guest on Airbnb trusted persons of that nationality more. This may be because monetization, institutionalization and professionalization of Airbnb limits the intensity of contact, or because Airbnb mostly establishes contact between individuals with similar backgrounds.

TI Hosting the comfortably exotic: Cosmopolitan aspirations in the sharing

SO SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW
AB This article draws on interviews with 43 Airbnb hosts in Greater Boston to analyze how this novel economic arrangement brings people together across difference. The first central finding is that a majority of the participants express a keen interest in engaging with the Other, by hosting guests of foreign nationalities and cultures, but they also filter for familiar characteristics. This paradox is conceptualized as a preference for the 'comfortably exotic' - hosts want difference, but not too much of it. The second central finding is that guest-host interactions generate cosmopolitan capital, i.e., particular forms of social and cultural capital, which suggests that exclusion from the home-sharing economy has opportunity costs on not just economic dimensions, but also on cultural and social dimensions.

TI Prosumer-to-customer exchange in the sharing economy: Evidence from the
   P2P accommodation context
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB Numerous prosumers who share their spare resources have contributed significantly to sharing economy development in recent years. Existing research on the sharing economy has primarily focused on the service demand side of consumers, thus neglecting the service supply side of individual prosumers. Understanding of the service exchange between prosumers and customers in the peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing economy remains limited. Drawing on the motivation, opportunity, and ability (MOA) model and social exchange theory, we developed a conceptual framework to explore how prosumers' service attributes influence consumers in a P2P accommodation sharing context. Using 313 questionnaires and 112 paired objective data points from prosumers in one popular P2P accommodation platform (i.e., Xiaozhu.com), this research found that prosumers' economic motivation, service flexibility, and service knowledge level have distinct effects on consumers' transactional based and relational-based participation. We also found a moderating role of prosumers' shared property management on these effects.

AB In recent years, businesses related with the sharing economy are growing, but there can be situations where profits are unevenly distributed among users, or platforms are discontinued due to the decisions of the companies providing the platforms. Therefore, building a decentralized, reliable, and sustainble sharing economy management system on the blockchain which is constructed using the computational resources of the platform's stakeholders of the business is attracting attention. However, the management system built on the blockchain can guarantee the integrity of data after registered to the platform but cannot guarantee the integrity of data before the registration. Therefore, this study proposes a method to guarantee the integrity of the data throughout its lifecycle. Assuming a logistics system as an application example of the sharing economy, the location information of transporters is the target of the integrity verification. The proposed method verifies the reality of time changes of location information registered to the blockchain and the reliability of location information for a specific location. To verify that the transporter is passing the specific point, the system exchanges information that can be obtained only at that point and time by using acoustic communication only when the IoT device installed at that point and the transporter's device are in the vicinity. Furthermore, we prototype the system and clarify whether it can be verified that a transporter is correcly passing the specific point or not.

TI FANTREPRENEURS IN THE SHARING ECONOMY: COCREATING NEOTRIBAL EVENTS
SO EVENT MANAGEMENT
AB The purpose of this article is to explore fan event organizers' (i.e., fantrepreneurs) cocreation processes linked to their fandom and neotribal characteristics as enacted within the sharing economy. In so doing, the article introduces the conceptual frameworks for understanding fantrepreneurs and subsequent cocreation of neotribal events. The article combines conceptual research methods with an analysis of empirical data collected through interviews with fantrepreneurs to enhance the explanatory power of the proposed frameworks. Findings show that there is a strong relationship between the collaborative consumption of fantrepreneurs and their neotribal lifestyle characteristics, which can be leveraged to enhance collaborative and cocreation patterns. This relationship is moderated by the factors of authenticity, nostalgia, autonomy, and anticommercialization that fantrepreneurs exhibit through the cocreation of (and within) neotribal fandom events. This integrated perspective marks fantrepreneurship as an emerging phenomenon within the sharing economy by shedding light on the cocreation patterns, moderating factors, and their interaction effects that explain the relationship between collaborative consumption and neotribalism characterizing the behavior of fantrepreneurs. The article conceptualizes the emergence of fantrepreneurs and cocreation of neotribal events providing an interdisciplinary foundation for future research that integrates literature on fandom, cocreation, and neotribalism. The resulting frameworks contribute to the understanding of fantrepreneurship as a manifestation of the sharing economy, which brings forward new fan patterns and practices in events.

Study 1, a survey of U.S. consumers, found no positive relationship between green consumerism and general ad skepticism. However, green consumerism was negatively related to green advertising skepticism. Study 2, a survey of Austrian consumers, addressed the underlying mechanism of this negative relationship in a mediation analysis. It was shown that green consumers saw more informational utility in green ads than nongreen consumers did. This, in turn, decreased their green advertising skepticism. The emotional appeal of green ads, however, had no impact on green advertising skepticism. Findings suggest that the "dilemma for marketers who desire to target the green consumer" (Zinkhan and Carlson 1995, p. 5) is far less serious than previously thought.

AB The paper is basing its analytical approach on two assumptions: the first refers to a significant change taking place in the contemporary world economy - the phenomenon of multipolarity - and proposes a new concept, that of multi-level manifestation of multipolarity; the second has in view the need of a new model of sustainable economic growth. In the context of these two points of view, the paper analyzes the sharing economy as a potential significant contributor to sustainable economic growth. The conclusion of this research is that the sharing economy has a huge potential of involving millions or even billions of participants and of capitalizing on the existing assets while providing spillover effects in the economy. The authors expect the sharing economy to become a form of economic activity that will complement traditional forms of business while generating positive economic, social and environmental effects.

TI Premium offerings in the sharing economy: Authentic immersions
SO JOURNAL OF REVENUE AND PRICING MANAGEMENT
AB Over the past few years the sharing economy has grown tremendously, driven in part by traveler desires for authentic and unique experiences. In response to these modern changes, peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplaces (e.g., Airbnb) are seeking additional revenue streams, expanding beyond room rentals into guided tours, recreational, and cultural experiences. Rather than act solely as sharing economy lodging establishments, in the near future providers will increasingly supply authentic and immersive vacation experiences, acting as a host, guide, concierge, and traveling companion to their guests. This paper explores the ability of P2P providers to command premium pricing for authentic and immersive P2P offerings. The paper details this possibility, listing drivers of change before positing a scenario that helps envision a future in which P2P providers seize this opportunity. Finally, the paper closes with limitations, practical implications, and future research recommendations.

AB The advent of the "sharing economy" challenges not only the business of hotel industry but also the theories and models based on the conventional hotel industry. A key dimension of the hospitality industry is pricing. The aim of this study is to identify the price determinants of sharing economy based accommodation offers in the digital marketplace. Specifically, a sample of 180,533 accommodation rental offers in 33 cities listed on Airbnb.com is investigated using ordinary least squares and quantile regression analysis. Twenty-five explanatory variables in five categories (host attributes, site and property attributes, amenities and services, rental rules, and online review ratings) are explored for the intricacies of the relationships between pricing and its determinants.

AB Sharing economy is associated with a series of economic activities in terms of renting, lending, trading, bartering and swapping of goods, service, space or money, that take place in organized systems or digital platforms. In this research, we interviewed 50 drivers, a kind of users type who provides cars and service from a car-sharing digital platform. Based on the prior studies of motivation, we combined Social Exchange Theory (SET) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to identify salient motivators in this context. Furthermore, building on Self-determination Theory (SDT), we propose a motivation model of users' sharing option in digital platform. The findings extend literatures of motivation researches in the context of sharing economy as well as help guide the development and operation of sharing economy digital platform.

AB We report on a randomized trial conducted during a market design transition on a sharing economy platform, where providers who formerly set rental prices for their assets were randomly assigned to groups with varying levels of pricing control. Even when faced with the prospect of significantly higher revenues, providers retaliate against the centralization of pricing by exiting the platform, reducing asset availability and cancelling transactions. Allowing providers to retain partial control lowers retaliation substantially even though providers do not frequently utilize this additional flexibility. We discuss information asymmetry, divergent incentives, and psychological contract violation as alternative explanations for our results.

Car sharing businesses, for example, will lead to the reduction of overall production volume of cars. Simultaneously, loT enables manufacturers to create new production strategies using the usage pattern of products. Our study constructs a durable goods market model with a sharing service where manufacturers and consumers mutually interact. Using multi-agent simulations, we present several cases of abstract situations and compare them with consumer attitudes obtained from questionnaire responses.

TI Addressing the challenges to electric vehicle adoption via sharing
   economy: an Indian perspective
SO MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the challenges before India for electric vehicle (EV) adoption by 2030. The study further looks into the measures taken by the Government of India (GOI) to promote research and development in EV sector and what is yet to be done. Design/methodology/approach In the present study, the challenges are identified allied to the commercialization of EVs in India. The data are collected, analyzed and compiled through secondary sources. The secondary data give a concise insight and comprehensive information regarding what is occurring around the globe as well as in the Indian context. Further, the challenges are investigated through a focus group study consisting of 11 participants from industry and academia. Findings The findings from the study are the critical roles of sharing economy and public utilities in the promotion of EV adoption, given the high cost of EV, lack of infrastructure and poor purchasing power of Indian customers. The sharing economy perspective provides various opportunities for the government to manage the resources (electric-powered transport system) optimally. Further, the study compares the global perspective in assigning the target figures. Research limitations/implications The study highlights the facilitating role of the shared format in EV technology promotion but ignores the hurdles that can come in its implementations. Also, the focus group study has its limitation as it relies more on participants' perceptions and opinions. Originality/value The present study assists GOI and various stakeholders in having a realistic plan rather than daydreaming with overambitious goals. The diffusion of technology as a shared format (especially in the context of EV) has not been academically approached in the past literature.

TI SHARING ECONOMY: THE BUSINESS MODEL OF THE DIGITAL ECONOMY IN THE
   COVID-19 PERIOD
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
AB The author undertakes an attempt to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the phenomenon of the sharing economy and the viability of this business model in force majeure circumstances. The sharing economy is a business model of the digital economy, born by the fourth industrial revolution during the Great Recession of 2008 and developing in the context of the unprecedented economic crisis of 2020, when the impact of the coronavirus pandemic simultaneously collapsed production, financial markets and consumer demand for goods and services, and the task of "conscious consumption" - to spend money correctly and reduce costs - became vital. The concept does not focus on ownership but rather on the sharing of assets and resources. A predictive construct is given: the sharing economy is not so much the introduction of new technologies to implement the world-old idea of renting on digital platforms, but a new paradigm of production and consumption and as such leads to a circular economy, causes systemic changes that form qualitatively new principles of business organization, the economy and society as a whole. The study concluded that the sharing model has proven its viability not only in a period of stable economic development, but also in a contemporary crisis, which is caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, it was during this period of force majeure that the sharing economy model showed its importance both in everyday life and in business. This allows us to conclude about the further growth of the sharing economy, the creation of new services - both in spite of and thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI Exploring influencing factors of offline knowledge service transactions
   on an online-to-offline knowledge-sharing economy platform
SO JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose Online-to-offline (O2O) knowledge-sharing economy platforms have emerged as a new public channel for matching up knowledge providers with knowledge seekers. It can facilitate offline provision and consumption of high-quality tacit knowledge around a topic upon online search and payment (called offline knowledge service transaction). However, limited research investigated this new knowledge-sharing phenomenon in the field of knowledge management (KM). The purpose of this paper is to enrich KM literature by developing a theoretical model to explore determinants of offline knowledge service transactions via O2O knowledge-sharing economy platforms from both quality and price perspectives. Design/methodology/approach The model was tested with objective data crawled from Zaihang - a leading O2O knowledge-sharing economy platform in China. Findings The results show that, in the context of O2O knowledge-sharing economy, transactions of an offline knowledge service are positively related to its provider's popularity, but negatively related to the price. Moreover, knowledge seekers are more likely to accept and purchase a high-priced service of a knowledge topic with a higher overall review score and supplied by a provider with lower popularity and shorter response time. However, the length of offline knowledge service has no significant association with its transactions. Originality/value This study contributes to KM literature through investigating a new phenomenon of tacit knowledge sharing (including provision and consumption) in the context of O2O service and the sharing economy. The results give implications for knowledge providers and platform managers to facilitate online transactions of offline knowledge services.

TI Blockchains and the disruption of the sharing economy value chains
SO STRATEGIC CHANGE-BRIEFINGS IN ENTREPRENEURIAL FINANCE
AB Against the backdrop of debates and rising public sentiments against "Big Tech," this paper takes a conceptual approach to explore the possibilities for blockchain technologies to disrupt the governance of the sharing economy value chains. Unlike centralized trust systems employed by multisided digital platforms, blockchains employ a decentralized, open-source system. Data can be shared, verified, and monitored using a consensus mechanism across multiple nodes. We bring insights and discussions from the extant literature to elucidate two guiding principles of the sharing economy value chains: resource optimization and data monetization. Against this backdrop, we propose a conceptual framework that compares traditional digital platforms' governance mechanisms and value drivers with block-chained enabled platforms, where resource optimization and data monetization are driven by decentralized platform co-owners rather than single platform owners. We offer case illustrations to explicate this framework and how it signposts a new, disruptive model for the governance of the collaborative economy, especially in developing countries.

AB With remarkable successes of sharing economy services (e.g., UBER (https://www.airbnb.com" ), and so on), the amount of items which are distributed through these services is rapidly increasing. Therefore recommender systems for the sharing economy services are required. However, the existing recommenders are hard to support the sharing economy services, since they have focused on a 'Item-User' model that the recommenders provide satisfiable items to consumers (users) in accordance with only the consumers' preferences. In this regard, we suggest a novel recommendation model, 'Owner-Borrower' model which considers the preferences of both sides: owners and borrowers of properties (items). Also, we propose a recommendation method based on the proposed model by applying a tensor factorization method and the Gale-Shapley algorithm. The tensor factorization is used for estimating preferences of the owners and the borrowers. With the estimated preferences, the Gale-Shapley algorithm makes optimal matches between the borrowers and the owners' properties.

AB The idea of a shared economy becomes one of the companies as an enterprise type. Especially with the advanced development of digital smart devices and the internet, several forms of the mutual economy have been advanced in accord with the need for sharing of separate income. Shareable commodity and digital content are also seeking to utilize. When digital content is used as a sharing economy, various possible threats may arise in the course of transactions, the potential for theft, alteration, and hacking of contents. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the security and privacy of Blockchain. Blockchain promise transparent, tamper-proof and secure systems that can enable novel solutions, especially when combined with smart contracts. In this research, we proposed a content protection and transaction method using Blockchain Ethereum Technology. The encryption algorithm is incorporated in proposed system to make transparent transactions and it is also implemented on content itself to prevent from smart forgery and hacking. The experimental results signify that the proposed method has strong potential to enhance transactions transparency by minimizing the security threats in digital content transactions.

AB The growth of the sharing economy is driven by the emergence of sharing platforms, e.g., Uber and Lyft, that match owners looking to share their resources with customers looking to rent them. The design of such platforms is a complex mixture of economics and engineering, and how to "optimally" design such platforms is still an open problem. In this paper, we focus on the design of prices and subsidies in sharing platforms. Our results provide insights into the tradeoff between revenue maximizing prices and social welfare maximizing prices. Specifically, we introduce a novel model of sharing platforms and characterize the profit and social welfare maximizing prices in this model. Further, we bound the efficiency loss under profit maximizing prices, showing that there is a strong alignment between profit and efficiency in practical settings. Our results highlight that the revenue of platforms may be limited in practice due to supply shortages; thus platforms have a strong incentive to encourage sharing via subsidies. We provide an analytic characterization of when such subsidies are valuable and show how to optimize the size of the subsidy provided. Finally, we validate the insights from our analysis using data from Didi Chuxing, the largest ridesharing platform in China.

AB During the past decade, new forms of the sharing economy have been developed as an alternative tool for the satisfaction of heterogeneous needs. From both short- and long-distance transportation to the rental of apartments, this expanding economy has created a new private supply of those services that, traditionally, were only provided by professionals. In parallel with its unexpected development, the size of its impact on relatively traditional economic sectors has grown too. This fact has determined the need, an ever more one, for studies on the dynamics of this phenomenon. The short-term housing-rental sector plays a central role within the universe of the sharing economy. In fact, it has spawned a new rental market, parallel to the traditional one, that is characterized by short and very-short-term contracts and by the immediate and easily accessed encounter between demand and supply, made possible through the use of digital platforms. Airbnb plays, without any doubt, a leading role in this phenomenon. Born in the US, it has had an astonishing global expansion in just a few years. In fact, currently, it operates in 191 countries, homogeneously, that is to say, without trying to match the enormous differences between local legislation on tourism and real estate to major procedural and systemic differences. This service was born in 2007, but it is only since 2013 that, in Italy, its presence has become massive; until then, only a few hundred listings were published for the whole nation. Its development has thus been exponential, and as the projections confirm, in all likelihood, in the next decade it will maintain the same rate of growth. By now, it has already been several years that researchers and operators have highlighted the influence of Airbnb in the market of tourist accommodations. What is still poorly detailed, perhaps because of its low visibility and immediacy, is the relationship that this kind of short-term rental contract has with the traditional real estate market. Therefore, the intent of this study is to take the first step towards the comprehension of the impact that the uncontrolled growth of the sharing economy has, specifically, on the Italian real estate market. Logically, the rental submarket is the one that is affected the most by the growth of the sharing economy. In fact, compared to traditional rentals, contracts that are stipulated with Airbnb provide lessors with much higher revenues and much lower restrictions. That is one of the reasons that the Airbnb's user base has experienced such an enormous expansion. However, this, has also led to the fear that these new dynamics are liable to distort the traditional real estate market.

TI Consumers' value co-creation in sharing economy: The role of social
   support, consumers' ethical perceptions and relationship quality
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB The ancient phenomenon of 'sharing' has become mainstream, and transformed the traditional consumer behavior due to proliferation of online sharing economy platforms. Millions of people participate in popular sharing economy platforms (SEPs) such as Airbnb and Uber. Although sharing economy research has gained interest, yet a holistic model that explains the formation of consumer value co-creation intentions on such platforms remains absent. The purpose of this study is to develop a model of the antecedents of consumers value co-creation intentions at SEPs and evaluate it empirically. Building on social support theory, relationship quality theory, value co-creation and marketing ethics literature, we propose a theoretical model that explains the formation of consumers' value co-creation intentions. Empirical data was collected from n = 342 Generation Y consumers and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results reveal that social support influences ethical perceptions, which further influences value co-creation. Ethical perceptions also influence consumers' trust, satisfaction and commitment with the SEP. However, trust and commitment do not influence value co-creation intentions. Our study contributes to the literature on sharing economy by providing a holistic model of the antecedents of consumers' value co-creation intentions. We also offer important insights for SEP managers.

TI "Social credit effect" in a sharing economy: A theory of mind and
   prisoner's dilemma game theory perspective on the two-way review and
   rating system
SO PSYCHOLOGY & MARKETING
AB Using random samples, we conducted three studies to explore the relationships among interpersonal mentalizing in predicting future sharing economy service usage. The primary focus of this research was to examine Uber passengers' theory of mind in a broader theoretical base of human abilities. The results confirm the dimensions of interpersonal mentalizing such as their experience with the sharing economy service and their current star ratings from the Uber driver. In addition, this study confirms that the dimensions of interpersonal mentalizing are dependent on the situation and the ratings they received from the Uber driver. In extreme rating situations (1-star rating), interpersonal dimensions did not have an effect on their negative beliefs about the two-way evaluation system. However, with moderate (3-star) and high ratings (4.75 and above star rating), the interpersonal dimensions such as nonverbal cues and the ability to shape behaviors and interactions serve as determinants of Uber passengers' belief in the evaluation system, which then leads to their future usage of the sharing economy services. In sum, these findings shed light on the complementary role of the autonomous abilities of Uber passengers to improve their star ratings, which then leads to their future usage of sharing economy services.

TI A decade of the sharing economy: Concepts, users, business and
   governance perspectives
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Sharing economy platforms have been transforming production and consumption systems in cities around the world. While the sharing economy may contribute to addressing sustainability issues, its actual economic, social and environmental impacts remain poorly understood. Advancing more sustainably promising forms of sharing and leveraging its benefits, while circumventing its pitfalls, is becoming increasingly important in the era of Covid-19 and climate crisis, economic downturn and uncertainty, and loss of social connectedness, particularly in anonymous urban environments. The ways to capitalise on strengths of the sharing economy are still poorly understood. In particular, the roles and perspectives of users, businesses and municipal governments in institutionalising the sharing economy in various geographical contexts are essential to examine. This volume seeks to advance the research field by focusing on four research areas: 1) understanding the sharing economy conceptually; 2) user perspectives on the sharing economy; 3) business perspective on the sharing economy; and 4) urban governance perspective on the sharing economy. The twenty articles in this volume discuss sustainability implications of the sharing economy from different perspectives, in various geographical contexts, and drawing on a range of disciplines. The volume makes a significant contribution by bringing in empirical findings from emerging and developing economies, including Brazil, China, Indonesia, Poland, the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam, thereby supplementing more frequently discussed perspectives from high-income countries. The volume also outlines the course for future research. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Modeling the Impact of the Institutional Environment on the Development
   of Digital Platforms and the Sharing Economy
SO ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CHANGES-FACTS TRENDS FORECAST
AB Digital platforms and the sharing economy contribute to a more efficient allocation of resources by releasing underutilized assets and reducing transaction costs; this opens up additional opportunities for socio-economic development. However, the rapid introduction of digital platforms and changing consumption patterns necessitate the adjustment and transformation of the current institutional environment. The aim of our study is to model the impact of the formal and informal institutional environment on the platform economy and the sharing economy in various countries. We apply theoretical analysis to show possible impact of formal and informal institutions on the development of digital platforms and the sharing economy; on this basis, four relevant hypotheses are formulated. In the study, we use data from the Digital Platform Economy Index 2020, Smart City Index 2021, WJP Rule of Law Index 2020, Social Capital Index 2020, Barometr Trust Index 2021 for 26 countries. With the help of a correlation and regression analysis, we construct linear models demonstrating the impact of the formal institutional environment on the development of the platform economy, as well as the influence of informal institutions on the services of the sharing economy. We prove that a low level of corruption and the transparency of public administration are major factors in the formal environment that affect this type of activity. The informal environment is characterized by the level of trust and social contacts in the country, expressed through social capital. The novelty of our findings consists in determining the nature of influence of the formal and informal institutional environment on the development of the sharing economy. The significance of the results lies in the possibility of using the identified patterns for the development of digital platforms and the sharing economy

As an example, Barcelona was selected where the changes taking place in the tourist accommodation sector were analysed under the influence of the Airbnb platform and their spatial and socio-economic effects. The analysis was based on data from domestic and foreign publications, public statistics data of the city of Barcelona and official Airbnb data. The research results indicate an uncontrolled development of the accommodation sector in the gentrified city districts, the displacement of residents and the lack of legal regulations enabling the functioning of the sharing economy entities in a way that generates benefits for city residents.

SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB The exponential rise of sharing economy has accelerated the growth of shared healthcare platforms in recent times. Although a shared healthcare platform transforms the exchange of service offerings, insight remains elusive regarding its value co-creation (VCC) dynamics and their effects. Drawing on the DART (dialogue, access, risk assessment, transparency) framework, this study frames the overall effects of VCC on perceived service innovation, perceived value and patient welfare. Data were collected from 251 patients from a shared healthcare platform. The findings confirm the elements of the DART framework as the antecedents of VCC of a shared healthcare platform, which significantly influence critical service outcomes.

There is an extensive international bibliography that has sought to address the dynamics imposed by this new agent. Despite this, in Brazil there are few studies on the changes promoted by Airbnb in the urban space. We aim to offer Brazilian researchers a research agenda on Airbnb interference in contemporary urban dynamics. Methodologically, we present the emergence of Airbnb and its insertion in the Sharing Economy. We organized the available bibliography into three major thematic groups dealing with Airbnb. We conclude by offering a research agenda for Airbnb in Brazil according to the themes identified in the bibliography concerning changes in contemporary urban dynamics.

AB Given that the use of shared economic resources has increased for leisure, the main goal of the present study is to investigate the influence of the leisure attributes of the sharing economy on leisure benefits and quality of life. For this, the related sub-factors were derived for the verification of the sharing economy's leisure attributes. Next, the sub-components of the concept were integrated and analyzed using a second confirmatory factor analysis. The results of a study using the structural equation model demonstrated that the sharing economy's leisure attributes statistically affect the four levels of leisure benefits (i.e., social, physical, personal, and psychological benefits). We also identified two (social and psychological benefits) out of four leisure benefits that ultimately affect quality of life. This study is meaningful in that it elucidates the relationships between the sharing economy's leisure attributes, leisure benefits, and quality of life.

TI Who shares? Profiling consumers in the sharing economy
SO AUSTRALASIAN MARKETING JOURNAL
AB Sharing platforms are becoming increasingly common, transforming how organisations and customers interact across diverse categories. While there is clear demand for the sharing economy, less is known about heterogeneity of consumer preferences and the varying demand that exists for sharing experiences across different categories of consumption. In order to help brands better understand who shares, this research takes a step forward in the profiling of users of the sharing economy. Drawing on social psychology, this research investigates how social norms can be employed as a form of social influence and nudge consumers to engage in higher levels of shared consumption. We find three clear segments of sharing consumers, representing 86% of all consumers: the mobility-focused sharer, the diverse-platform sharer, and the power-platform sharer. The last segment (accounting for 14%) comprises consumers who do not engage with sharing platforms. Moreover, social norms influenced the future behaviours of only one segment of consumers: the diverse-platform sharer. We discuss how sharing platform providers can better understand, target, and convert consumers to engage in sharing. (C) 2020 Australian and New Zealand Marketing Academy. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

SO REVIEW OF SOCIONETWORK STRATEGIES
AB In this paper, we aim to investigate how researchers in Japan and Sweden perceive and approach the term "sharing economy" in research publications. Systematic literature reviews were used to explore academic discussions in both countries. The main finding of this research is that although researchers in both contexts use similar definitions and concepts, the meanings and connotations of the sharing economy differ among the two contexts. In summary, Japanese researchers tend to focus first and foremost on the economic effects of the sharing economy, as it serves the purpose of economic revitalisation. In contrast, Swedish researchers focus on its environmental effects. The differences reflect country-specific socio-cultural, technological, and economic contexts. Finally, we suggest future directions for research and policy development.

TI Conspicuous value and luxury purchase intention in sharing economy in
   emerging markets: The moderating role of past sustainable behavior
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL FASHION MARKETING
AB In the last few years, there has been an increase in a tendency towards the sharing economy. The purpose of this study is to identify the role of conspicuous value, attitude towards luxury goods in the sharing economy, subjective norm, and past sustainable behavior in influencing purchase intention for luxury fashion goods in the sharing economy. Extant literature on luxury goods established the relationship between conspicuous value and purchase intention. However, it is still unexplored whether the same relationship will hold in luxury rental consumption or not. Thus, this study fills gaps in the marketing literature by studying the direct, mediating, and moderating relationship among these variables in the context of luxury sharing economy consumption. Data was collected through a questionnaire from two high-end malls in India (N = 232). Data analysis was done using AMOS 25 and the SPSS PROCESS macro. The findings of the study revealed that both attitude and subjective norm mediate the relationship between conspicuous value and purchase intention. Further, past sustainable behavior was found to moderate the relationship between conspicuous value and attitude. However, the subjective norm does not moderate the relationship between attitude and purchase intention.

TI Analysis of the evolution of the sharing economy towards sustainability.
   Trends and transformations of the concept
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The Sharing Economy has been emerged in recent years as a trend with high growth potential by showing itself to be an innovative model for creating products, services and relationships based on sustainable consumption. The Sharing Economy has emerged as a multidimensional and multidisciplinary concept, which initially only covered areas of the economy and social sciences and which later experienced growth in business, urban planning, tourism, information technology and digital science (industry 4.0) or engineering. This has transformed its development from an economic opportunity to a form of decentralised, equitable and sustainable economy with the creation of new initiatives and companies that have reduced environmental impact by decreasing the use of natural resources. The present study aims to evaluate the evolution of the discourse and the way research has progressed in this incipient sphere of collaborative consumption up to the present day by means of an in-depth analysis of scientific production through bibliometrics and network analysis techniques with the VOSviewer (c) software and the complete database of publications obtained from the Web Of Science (2152 publications). It also includes the detailed examination of the most relevant bibliographic reviews on Sharing Economics, as well as the main publications on bibliometric analysis. The article evaluates key words, sources, authors, citations, organizations, categories, and countries using various bibliometric techniques. Finally, in the results 5 clusters of thematic categories are obtained where a change in the trend of publications towards the field of clean and green technology is reflected, forming in recent years an agglutinating nucleus of all the disciplines in which "sustainability" acts as the backbone of scientific production. This is a positive development in cleaner production, where institutions and authors from the USA and Europe have risen to the top of the ranking of publications and impact. At a global level, the current commitment to research for the development of accessible, equitable and sustainable products and services is reflected.

TI Japan Meets the Sharing Economy: Contending Frames
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE JAPAN JOURNAL
AB The 'sharing economy epitomized by Airbnb and Uber has challenged business, labor, and regulatory institutions throughout the world.The arrival of Airbnb and Uber in Japan provided an opportunity for Prime Minister Abe's administration to demonstrate its commitment to deregulation. Both platform companies garnered support from powerful governmental and industry actors who framed the sharing economy as a solution to various economic and social problems. However, they met resistance from actors elsewhere in government, the private sector, and civil society, who constructed competing frames. Unlike studies that compare national responses to the sharing economy, we contrast the different experiences and fates of Airbnb and Uber within a single country. Doing so highlights actors, framing processes. and within-country heterogeneity.The study reveals the limits of overly institutionalized understandings of Japanese political economy. It also contributes to current debates concerning Prime Minister Abe's efforts at implementing deregulation during the 2010s.

AB This paper describes the sharing economy business cases of social enterprises using the collaborative networks in the platforms of production, consumption, and redistribution. These three cases (Orgdot's producer network, "Designers & Makers" in the fashion industry, Purun Bike Sharing's bike sharing network, and Bigwalk's donation network) show that exploiting the ICTs (Information and Communication Technologies) for social enterprise innovation can be a new driver for the success of the sharing economy business. The sharing economy model can provide social enterprises with the opportunities to overcome their market problems because social value can be fully embedded in the process of their sharing economy cycles. Using innovated and proactive platforms, collectively known as the "ICTs based sharing economy" can be a new business model to the social entrepreneurship. Also, social enterprise operations that are able to create both social and economic value are considered "double bottom-line" organizations, while other public organizations are mainly "single bottom-line" organizations. These findings have practical and strategic implications for the development and transfer of social values. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI The Sharing Economy Globalization Phenomenon: A Research Agenda
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT
AB Sharing economy firms have been able to achieve global levels of success at an unprecedented pace. In this study, we focus specifically on internet-based firms that allow rent appropriation from temporary utilization of underutilized assets. By looking at these firms' main characteristics and the current dynamics revolving around their internationalization process, we develop a framework to guide future research drawing from a business ecosystems perspective. The business ecosystem approach is a promising theoretical lens to assess this phenomenon due to its more holistic view of multisided network effects and multiple stakeholders' participation that can vary across nations. We note that the sharing economy phenomenon has spurred worldwide adoption of platform businesses which, in turn, creates a great opportunity for future research to extend current theories by exploring why, when, and how these firms expand into new countries. We argue that further research on sharing economy firms and its interactions with different national ecosystem configurations can provide important insights to theory as well as relevant information to managers and policymakers.

   Intention: A Simulation-Based Experiment for Hotels and AirBnBs
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNET COMMERCE
AB Although the influence of trust on purchase intention is well studied in e-commerce, the emergence and rapid growth of the sharing economy has renewed the relevance of this relationship. Though the sharing economy lacks the institutional assurance mechanisms inherent in traditional industries, consumers must rely on trust to inform their selection decisions more so than before. In this study, the influence on trust of four consumer characteristics and accommodation type (whether an accommodation is a hotel or an AirBnB) are evaluated. Findings reveal that disposition to trust, education, uncertainty avoidance, and the accommodation type variables influence trust. Findings also support relationships between trust and both purchase intention and recommendation intention. These findings carry implications for sharing platform developers as well as e-commerce researchers.

TI Governing Airbnb in Amsterdam and Singapore: A Comparative Study on
   Governance Strategies and Styles
SO SAGE OPEN
AB The past decade has witnessed the fast spread of Airbnb, a specific example of sharing economy initiatives. Local governments around the world are struggling with policies and regulations to govern the negative externalities caused by Airbnb. In this respect, knowledge is lacking on differences in governance strategies and their effects. This article starts to fill this lacuna by comparing the governance strategies and their effects of two major, but totally different, cities in terms of governance styles: Singapore and Amsterdam. An analytic framework is developed distinguishing different strategies and governance style in enforcing these strategies and different types of response by sharing economy platforms. The Singapore government applied predominantly a hierarchical approach to address the challenges posed by Airbnb, whereas the Amsterdam government mostly adopted a collaborative approach, resulting in different responses by Airbnb. The article goes deeper into explaining these different governance styles and reflects on their implications as derived from the case studies.

TI Tours and activities in the sharing economy
SO CURRENT ISSUES IN TOURISM
AB With the recent entrance of Airbnb, the sharing economy in the tours and activities sector has grown significantly. Due to its novelty, it is an area that has not been explored in the literature. This research is a first approach to the sector and its characteristics. We implemented a two-step methodology. First, we used a quantitative approach and analysed the Airbnb Experiences' available offer in four major destinations in Spain, and we compared this offer to that of two platforms which commercialize traditional tours and activities. We then used a qualitative approach by conducting semi-structured interviews with fifteen professional businesses that use the Airbnb platform as a distribution channel. We present several conclusions: the offer of tours and activities available in the sharing economy overlaps with the existing one in other B2C platforms, but it also presents some new features and types of activities; providers are a combination of professionals and amateurs; and customers are highly satisfied with the tours and activities they get in the sharing economy.

TI Value co-creation in the sharing economy: The role of quality of service
   provided by peer
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The mesh of consumer-provider roles in the sharing economy gives a new edge to issues of service quality, customer value and loyalty. Not much is known about how platforms can achieve sustainable competitive advantage through regulation of peers' interaction. We find that the quality of service is the cornerstone issue in creation of value and loyalty of users in the sharing economy. Specifically, we find that: quality of service and customer value are antecedents of loyalty. Not all quality dimensions impact loyalty equally. Only offline quality dimensions' impact customer value. Continuous improvement affects loyalty and customer value indirectly through other quality dimensions. Our study contributes to the literature by relating the full chain of concepts of quality, value and loyalty to the sharing economy setting. We identify specific areas that should be reinforced by the platform in order to increase loyalty of users. By making sharing a better and a more appealing consumer option, the circularity of businesses might be faster achieved. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Enhanced awareness about plastic cutlery pollution has brought a green transition in consumers' intentions. Through the lens of green offers by the food aggregators, this research investigates the relationship of the antecedents to green consumption intention. A conceptual model extending the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) theory is tested by Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) on the primary data of 622 green consumers. The significant relations between perceived consumer effectiveness to green brand trust, influencing green consumption intentions were established. Social Image partially mediates the relation of green brand trust to green consumption intention. The identified relationships among the variables provide practical and theoretical implications.

SO JOURNAL OF COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION
AB With the booming development of sharing economy, decision makers must consider the effect when making decisions with uncertain demands. In the leasing problem, people are faced with several leasing options. Participating in the shared leasing option can reduce the cost of the lessee, which makes it a good choice. This paper considers the online leasing option under sharing economy. By applying competitive analysis to the two-option online leasing problem, the optimal competitive ratios of the deterministic and randomized strategies with market interest rate are obtained, respectively. The theoretical results show that the strategies' competitive performance is improved under sharing economy. Furthermore, numerical examples are performed to illustrate that considering the shared option has a significant influence on the two-option online leasing problem.

Though gender and race have been studied, discrimination against service providers with disabilities has not been explored. In this poster, we conducted a 2 x 3 between-group experiment to study whether disability status and work type would affect perceptions of credibility and hiring. We found mixed results: there is no significant statistical difference on credibility perception of service providers and hiring decisions. In the open-end response analysis, we grouped three important factors impacting customers' hiring decision toward service providers with disabilities, including platform, work-related attributes, and personal traits.

TI Understanding Key Antecedents of Consumer Loyalty toward Sharing-Economy
   Platforms: The Case of Airbnb
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Amidst collaborative consumption and developments in information and communication technology, the sharing economy has attracted worldwide attention, being considered sustainable consumption as it shares time, resources, and materials with others. However, because sharing-economy platforms offer nearly homogeneous assets to traditional business firms, enhancing consumer loyalty presents a huge challenge. This study provides a theoretical view for understanding the mechanisms behind user loyalty in the sharing economy. It identifies consumer satisfaction and trust in Airbnb as the key antecedents of consumer loyalty. Moreover, this study investigates the different effects of economic, hedonic, and symbolic benefits on consumers' decision-making processes. A structural equation modeling method was used to check the research hypotheses based on a sample of 317 Airbnb consumers in South Korea. The analysis results reveal that in the case of Airbnb, consumer loyalty is jointly shaped by consumer satisfaction and trust, with entertainment and recognition significantly influencing both consumer satisfaction and trust. Moreover, money savings and exploration are not significantly related to consumers' decision-making processes. Although social benefits significantly influence trust in Airbnb, these have no significant effect on consumer satisfaction. The findings provide theoretical and practical implications and future research direction.

SO SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW
AB Critical accounts suggest that the 'sharing economy' is mainly an ideological entity, bringing together a wide range of diverse empirical phenomena that have little in common, apart from their common adherence to an ideology of 'sharing'. This article suggests that the sharing economy can be empirically understood as instances of peer production attempting to 'come to market via the use of a common 'sharing fiction'. Analysing the origins and present functions of this fiction, the author suggests that we can conceptualize differentials in economic power within the sharing economy in terms of the work that goes into the reproduction of this sharing fiction and the ability to capitalize on it in terms of price differentials.

TI Managing the value Co-creation of peer service providers in the sharing
   economy: The perspective of customer incivility
SO HELIYON
AB Previous studies have discussed the preconditions for peer service providers participation in value co-creation from the perspective of the platforms or the peer service providers themselves. However, little attention has been paid to the influence of customers. In the sharing economy, however, customers interact closely with peer service providers, and they have a major influence on the attitudes and behaviours of peer service providers. Based on resource conservation theory, this study uses three waves of tracking surveys and two experiments to investigate the impact of customer unfriendliness on the shared value creation of peer service providers. The results suggest that rude customers in the sharing economy reduce the value creation behaviour of peer service providers by increasing emotional exhaustion. Furthermore, self-efficacy in regulating negative emotions is found to buffer the mechanism by which customer incivility increases the likelihood of emotional exhaustion. Peer service providers with higher self-efficacy in negative emotion regulation have weaker such relationships. This research fills the gap of how customers influence the value creation behaviour of peer service providers in the sharing economy, identifies the potential negative impacts of customer incivility and increases the overall added value of the sharing economy.

TI Impact of psychological ownership on customer citizenship behaviour in
   the sharing economy
SO HUMAN SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT
AB BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to explore the effects of customers' psychological ownership of shared products on customer citizenship behaviour in the sharing economy. This study hypothesizes that customer-company identification can increase consumers' psychological ownership of shared products in the absence of legal ownership, thereby promoting customer citizenship behaviour. This study asserts that psychological ownership plays a mediating role in the relationship between customer-company identification and customer citizenship behaviour based on social identity theory. We explore the moderating role of consumers' proactive personalities in the sharing economy.
   METHODS: A questionnaire including the following was constructed: customer-company identification, psychological ownership, customer citizenship behaviour, and proactive personality. We administered the online consumer questionnaire in China to investigate the factors that affect consumer behavioural intentions in the sharing economy.
   RESULTS: First, based on a sample of 326 participants, the results suggest that both customer-company identification and psychological ownership are positively related to customer citizenship behaviour. Second, psychological ownership partially mediates the relationship between customer-company identification and customer citizenship behaviour. Third, proactive personality moderates the relationship between customer-company identification and customer citizenship behaviour.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the importance of psychological ownership in promoting customer citizenship behaviour in the sharing economy.

TI An analysis of factors and conditions pertaining to the rise of the
   sharing economy
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB Purpose This study aims to examine the various factors and conditions pertaining to the rise of the sharing economy. Design/methodology/approach After framing the sharing economy concept, the study adopts a multidisciplinary approach and relies on the extant literature to analyze and classify eight major groups of factors behind the rise of the sharing economy. Findings The analysis indicates that the sharing economy (1) represents a significant paradigm shift emphasizing utilization rather than possession and relying on mutual trust, collaboration and reciprocity; (2) benefits from fundamental transformations such as the world population growth, global urbanization, surge in the world middle class and the convergence of tastes and preferences; (3) relies on technological innovation but is affected by socio-cultural and psychological conditions; (4) is driven by emerging trends in consumption, marketing and working conditions; (5) benefits from lax or nonexistent regulation and taxation; and (6) is recognized as clean and environmentally friendly. Originality/value This paper's chief contribution resides in adopting a multidisciplinary perspective to offer an in-depth analysis of the various types of factors behind the rise of the sharing economy.

TI From Solidity to Liquidity: Macro-Level Consumption Patterns in the
   Sharing Economy
SO JOURNAL OF MACROMARKETING
AB Macro-level consumption patterns in ownership-based modernity have been identified as being predominantly passive, individualistic, private, and alienated. However, access-based consumption, the new imperative of what has been termed the sharing economy, is fundamentally changing traditional business models and affords consumers a more flexible and fluid lifestyle without the burden of ownership. The current essay updates Firat and Dholakia's framework of consumption patterns with the new conditions of the sharing economy and critically reflects on the implications of market-mediated access for the four dimensions of the framework. The authors conclude that the sharing economy implies a shift from solid to liquid consumption, but this transition is sideward rather than upward because consumption alternatives in the sharing economy remain within the boundaries of market-mediated exchange and thus fail to generate substantive higher-level consumption alternatives between modes of consumption (e.g., the choice between using a car or public transport).

TI How should Canadian tourism embrace the disruption caused by the sharing
   economy?
SO WORLDWIDE HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM THEMES
AB Purpose - This paper aims to answer two questions: What is the sharing economy? and How is the sharing economy affecting tourism in Canada?
   Design/methodology/approach - The foundation of this paper was laid during a major industry event held in Ottawa in 2016 - the Ontario Tourism Summit, an annual industry conference organized by the Tourism Industry Association of Ontario (TIAO), attended by 650 industry participants. This paper is based on presentations made at the summit. The article provides key information on Airbnb and the role of TIAO in the context of shared economy.
   Findings - Companies such as Airbnb, Uber and Turo have made the concept of sharing economies an everyday concept. As sharing economy is considered as a phenomenon that is here to stay, Canadian tourism and hospitality industries should embrace the disruption caused by it and ensure that this is done for mutual benefit of all stakeholders. Five key suggestions are made by the authors in their conclusions.
   Practical implications - As this paper is mainly based on the authors' viewpoints, prior to implementing their recommendations, further dialogue with all relevant stakeholders is needed.
   Originality/value - This paper draws upon the authors' experience working with Canadian tourism companies and incorporates their thoughts for practical solutions.

AB Sharing Economy is a relatively new phenomenon that has developed over the last ten to fifteen years, facilitated by widely available internet access as well as an increased awareness of ecological factors combined with decreased purchasing power due to the last economic crisis. It is composed of a variety of different business models with different impacts on society.
   The enclosed research paper gives an overview of the different forms of the sharing economy that have so far been classified and shows a picture of the acceptance of the sharing economy in Germany with a special emphasis on car sharing by pointing out behavioural aspects of consumers and producers as well as regulatory aspects. It points to those sectors that have strongly been impacted by the sharing economy. Germany is one of the most important manufacturing countries worldwide with a strong reliance on exports of the tools and machinery as well as the automotive sector. German customers are known for their demand of high quality products that are well manufactured. Additionally, with terrorism growing in typical former German holiday destinations (Northern Africa, Turkey, France) Germany is also witnessing an increase in domestic as well as foreign tourism. Here companies from the sharing economy threaten existing business models as i.e. car hires, hotels or restaurants. From a cultural perspective, Germans accept material status symbols, i.e. in the form of cars, watches or technical devices. Sharing threatens the German economic model due to the fact that sharing tries to use less of all resources and end-products.
   Therefore, this exploratory work is based on a survey undertaken among younger Germans. The survey took place between November 2017 and January 2018.

TI Antecedents of trust in the sharing economy: A systematic review
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR
AB Users and potential users of the sharing economy need to place a considerable amount of trust in both the person and the platform with which they are dealing. The consequences of transaction partners' opportunism may be severe, for example damage to goods or endangered personal safety. Trust is, therefore, a key factor in overcoming uncertainty and mitigating risk. However, there is no thorough overview of how trust is developed in this context. To understand how the trust of users in the sharing economy is influenced, we performed a systematic literature review. After screening, 45 articles were included in a qualitative synthesis in which the results were grouped according to a well-established trust typology. The results show various antecedents of trust in the sharing economy (e.g. reputation, trust in the platform, and interaction experience) related to multiple entities (i.e. seller, buyer, platform, interpersonal, and transaction). Trust in this economy is often reduced to the use of reputation systems alone. However, our study suggests that trust is much more complex than that and extends beyond reputation. Furthermore, our review clearly shows that research on trust in the sharing economy is still scarce and thus more research is needed to understand how trust is established in this context. Our review is the first that brings together antecedents of trust in online peer-to-peer transactions and integrates these findings within an existing framework. Additionally, the study suggests directions for future research in order to advance the understanding of trust in the sharing economy.

TI Government-driven Sharing Economy: Lessons from the Sharing City
   Initiative of the Seoul Metropolitan Government
SO JOURNAL OF DEVELOPING SOCIETIES
AB The Seoul Metropolitan Government (SMG) has been presenting a series of public policies to promote its Sharing City Initiative (SCI) since 2012. The initiative promotes many sharing programs that are aimed at providing opportunities to those who are in need of cars and public facilities such as parking facilities, convention facilities, and public libraries. This study examines the potential contribution of information and communication technology (ICT) to sustainable development and investigates the government's role in the sharing economy based on the SCI undertaken by the SMG. Based on selected cases, this study suggests that the sharing economy is not necessarily purely market driven but can often be promoted and utilized by governments as a policy instrument for both economic and social goals. The findings of this study demonstrate that the underprivileged could be a target beneficiary group of a sharing economy if a government specifically designs a sharing economy project like the SCI. It is also important for governments to use government funding such as subsidies to initially promote the sharing economy project as well as to establish a supportive legal framework to overcome existing laws which often constrain sharing economy activities. Governments need to establish partnerships with various stakeholders including private enterprises, social enterprises, and NGOs as well as other local governments to take advantage of the economy of scale of a sharing economy. Lastly, this study shows that a government-driven sharing economy project can help to make governments more transparent and accountable if governments actively open their data to promote a sharing economy.

TI Effect of energy efficiency labels on household appliance choice in
   China: Sustainable consumption or irrational intertemporal choice?
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Energy consumption has caused severe environmental problems, such as climate change and air pollution. The energy efficiency label is an environmental information policy that provides consumers with energy consumption information of products to change consumers' choices and guide consumers to green consumption. Current evaluations mainly focus on consumers' purchase intention toward energy efficiency labels through questionnaire survey and simulation experiment. Our study paper used the real purchase data on China's largest online sales platform to explore consumers' energy-efficiency home appliance purchase behaviors. This paper found that the energy efficiency labeling policy does not promote consumers' green consumption behavior, an increase of energy efficiency grade raises the sales of refrigerator by 24.47%, however, the price of the product can negatively regulate the relationship between the energy efficiency grade and the sales. The results of heterogeneity analysis show that when the product price is in the low-price range, consumers will choose high energy-consuming household appliances; only for consumers who purchase mid-to-high-priced products, energy efficiency labeling policies played a guiding role in green consumption. This will cause the energy-saving products more expensive, and consumers are less willing to buy energy-saving products resulting in an energy efficiency paradox. Through further analysis of questionnaire survey data, the results indicate that the energy efficiency paradox is not caused by rational factors, but irrational intertemporal choices. Therefore, accurate assessment of the effect of energy efficiency labels is crucial to promote consumers' green consumption behavior and mitigate climate change.

TI Business model patterns in the sharing economy
SO SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
AB Sharing platforms struggle to remain financially viable and preserve their prosocial and environmental aspirations; therefore, effort to empirically study successful sharing economy business models (SEBMs) is needed. The aim of this research is to identify business model patterns among existing SEBMs in order to suggest business model attributes that support successful implementation. Patterns describe one or several recurring business model attributes observed among existing business models. This study investigates 63 SEBMs across 93 different configuration options. The k-medoids clustering approach was used to identify configuration options recurring repeatedly across the data. The empirical results were triangulated with existing business model patterns from literature. The study presents a framework to describe and analyse SEBMs; eight prototypical patterns, with a corresponding list of relevant business model attributes; and six solution patterns unique to the sharing economy. The patterns - as well as insights across locations, shared practices, and platform types - advance knowledge on the sharing economy. Furthermore, these patterns support sharing platforms to communicate, learn, and experiment, ideally supporting successful implementation of SEBMs. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

TI HOW ORGANIZATIONS STRATEGICALLY GOVERN ONLINE COMMUNITIES: LESSONS FROM
   THE SHARING ECONOMY
SO ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT DISCOVERIES
AB For organizations in the sharing economy, the online communities they host, where users interact with each other, are core to value creation. Little is known, however, about the organizational practices used to govern these online communities-to encourage participation and to direct, coordinate, and control interactions strategically. We address this gap with a comparative case study in the Berlin sharing economy and identify three governance practices. Scoping community boundaries encourage participation by demarcating the perimeters of interaction and defining the online community as a distinct social space; nudging social relations encourages participation by providing stimuli for interaction; and steering users exerts a form of social control over interactions. We discovered that organizations rely on both online and offline technologies to govern. Building on these findings, we develop a framework that helps to unpack why organizations use governance practices differently and how these practices relate to the value creation potential of organizations. Our study highlights the dual role of organizations in the sharing economy as curators and guardians of online communities and displays the potential of sharing economy research to enhance knowledge about value creation, online communities, and organizational governance.

TI Sharing-collaborative economy in tourism: A bibliometric analysis and
   perspectives for the post-pandemic era
SO TOURISM ECONOMICS
AB Sharing economy research has risen exponentially during the last 4 years. Although several theoretical revisions on this topic have been developed, a conceptual analysis based on bibliometric techniques and science mapping tools is lacking. Within this framework, this article has two aims: (i) to carry on a performance analysis to identify the outstanding themes and (ii) to visually present the scientific structure by topics of research in sharing-collaborative economy as well as its evolution to identify future directions. The resources in the Web of Science Citation Index were used. Intelligent techniques and, more specifically, the SciMAT tool (based on co-word analysis and h-index analysis) were applied using a sample of 940 indexed papers from 2010 to 2020 (with 10.652 global citations). Our results show that the new post-pandemic era requires the sharing economy industry to investigate alternative ways: to improve trust, to innovate, to search for authenticity and experiences, to attend tourist motivations based on sustainability, and to use big data and manage overtourism.

AB Motivated by the growing significance of sharing economy within our society, we here discuss which role the public sector may have within collaborative consumption (CC). CC refers to a business model grounded on peer-to-peer based sharing of goods and services through community-based online services. While public sector to a large extent has transformed from formalised bureaucratic structures into more hybrid organisations, focusing on the co-creation between public and private stakeholders, public sector's role within the sharing economy is still in need for further investigation. We reflect on the need for studying how public sector could benefit from a more active role within CC for public service provision in the e-government area. Based on current literature on CC, we argue that the public sector can take on three main roles in CC: the customers, the service providers, and the platform providers. We further develop suggestions for a research agenda in this area and raise questions for a further discussion on the role of public sector within CC.

AB One of the greatest threats to the capital reproduction globalization is the significant increasing of unemployment. Outsourcing creates workplaces outside the framework of TNCs, but in frames of the national economy. From our point of view this is a way to maximize the financial result. Unemployment, even technical, increases social spending. At the same time, the idea of basic income should change the priorities in the system of distribution of the reproduction result. The key beneficiary of sharing-economy approach is a consumer, who can save something on intermediaries or transaction costs. The development of sharing economy rather indicates that TNCs are not planning to lower their rate of return. However, the growing technological unemployment simultaneously with the stimulation of demand found a solution. The solution is the joint consumption of goods produced by the sharing economy. Historical examples of solution to the problem of distribution clearly demonstrate the importance of transforming the reproductive cycle's financial architecture. The models operating on the basis of fair distribution have not only prospects of development, but also are capable to change society attitude to the concept and approaches to consumption.

Results from a survey of 344 respondents were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The study's findings reveal that, with the exception of the direct effect of awareness of the sharing economy on the intention to use sharing services, the underlying dimensions have a significant effect on consumers' intention to use sharing services. Implications for future research and marketing strategies for sharing services are discussed.

AB While private social dining has emerged as a new activity in the sharing economy, associated research is limited. This study aims to conceptualize tourists' private social dining experiences by incorporating the concept of the experience economy with the sharing economy. Thematic analysis of 29 interviews unveiled a hierarchical framework, beginning with a personalized experience and leading to sensory experience before ending with emotional experience in private social dining settings. Seven identified emotional experiential domains were then situated within a four-quadrant framework to address how private social dining can enrich the four original experiential domains of the experience economy (i.e. entertainment, education, esthetic, and escapism) to trigger tourists' emotional pleasure. These results lay a theoretical foundation for future studies and provide practical implications for the development of food tourism.

SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
AB Based on the unprecedented development of current information technology, under the prevalence of third-party payment, in order to increase the utilization rate of idle resources and meet the diversified economic needs of today's era, as an emerging economic model-the "sharing economy", combined with Internet big data, it has effectively realized the perfect connection between supply and demand, and it has quickly swept through all walks of life. However, while promoting economic development, the lack of regulatory measures and the imperfect credit system have severely restricted the further development of the sharing economy. Blockchain technology (BT), as a new distributed infrastructure and computing method, has always been the core technology of Bitcoin. Based on the development of generalized economic model and BT, this paper analyzes the shortcomings of generalized economic model and blockchain technology through information fusion big data and proposes a kind of information based on information fusion big data+public BT. The security management system adapts to the status quo of the sharing economy and uses the functions of information fusion big data+blockchain technology to solve the current information security risks faced by the sharing economy. The experimental results of this article show that the sharing economy information security management system based on information fusion big data+blockchain technology has good protection capabilities. The interception rate of external information reached 95%, and the interception rate of system information reached 93%. Better protection of privacy leaks is needed.

TI Effects of Customer Value Proposals on the Service Trade Repurchase
   Intentions of Sharing-Economy Users
SO JOURNAL OF KOREA TRADE
AB Purpose - This paper finds the repurchase intentions of customers in a sharing economy via Airbnb and Uber, which are classic sharing-economy service businesses.
   Design/methodology - This paper analyzes sharing economy effects using variables in a structural equation model.
   Findings - We verified that values have a significant effect on the trust in a platform. We also verified that the effects that value propositions have on repurchase intention are significant.
   Research Limitations/Implications - First, there may be some distinction between men and women with regard to divided trust. Second, if commitment is divided into commitment to the host and commitment to the platform, as is the case for trust, the results will not be as expected. Third, if results could be categorized by nationality after gathering more samples, each nationality might have different opinions about these factors. Finally, the sharing economy can be identified and analyzed for various industries, such as space, transportation, and service. At this point, it is inconvenient to not have more implications.
   Originality/value - This study focuses on the repurchase intentions of customers. Unlike earlier studies, it is meaningful that trust is divided between the host and the platform, and that it can be analyzed. It is also important to establish the relationship between trust and commitment, and the relationship toward repurchasing in the shared-economy.

TI Domesticating the market: moral exchange and the sharing economy
SO SOCIO-ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB The 'sharing economy' is a contested realm, with critics arguing it represents a further development of neoliberalism, as platforms such as Airbnb and TaskRabbit, monetize previously uncommodified realms of life via renting of bedrooms, possessions, space and labor time. To date, this debate has largely ignored participants' views. Using data from 120 in-depth interviews with providers in two for-profit and three not-for-profit sites, we find that most see the sharing economy differently, as an opportunity to build a radically different market, from the bottom up. Like the detractors, they are critical of dominant market arrangements, however, they believe the sharing sector can construct personalized exchanges that are morally attuned, based on ideals of community, and that help them achieve creative and financial autonomy in their working lives. These aspirations represent an attempt to tame, or domesticate the neoliberal market.

AB Blockchain is a novel way to construct fully distributed systems and has the potential to disrupt many businesses including Uber and Airbnb within the sharing economy. Specifically, blockchain provides a method to enforce the agreement between a user and the physical property owner without using any trusted party, e.g., if a user pays the agreed money, the blockchain guarantees that he/she has access to the property. While a blockchain based system has many desirable features, it may leak privacy information of involved parties due to its openness to the public. To mitigate the privacy concern, we propose a privacy respecting approach for blockchain-based sharing economy applications, which leverages a zero-knowledge scheme. We also analyze the security features and performance of the proposed approach to demonstrate its effectiveness in these applications.

CY 2017
CL Boston, MA
AB This study examines what types of perceived risks influence consumers' and non-consumers' willingness to pay for ride-sharing services as a representative of the sharing economy. Choice experiment models are constructed to capture consumers' and non-consumers' perceptions of the relative importance of each service attribute reducing perceived risk. Results show individuals' utility significantly increases when the service does not require private information from consumers, provides a driver-tracking system, requires a commercial driver's license from drivers, offers a driver-review system, comprehensively compensates for negative incidents, and guarantees a minimum wage and benefit plan for drivers. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of perceived risk in the sharing economy, and suggests theoretical and practical implications that can assist companies and policy makers.

TI The future of hotel chains: Branded marketplaces driven by the sharing
   economy
SO JOURNAL OF VACATION MARKETING
AB Over the past few years the sharing economy has grown tremendously, disrupting the traditional tourism industry via the mass deployment of exponentially increasing capacity. In this new economy, ownership and access are shared by individuals creating, broadcasting and exchanging their own products and services. Rather than compete against the sharing economy, hotel chains have the opportunity to oversee this communal sharing and leverage the strength of their brands by extending them to peer-to-peer (P2P) rentals. This potential future of P2P rentals offers an attractive option for guests looking for a unique stay free of the current uncertainty of the informal economy in safety, legality and quality. This paper introduces propositions regarding the future state of the P2P rental market, presents a scenario detailing branded marketplaces, discusses the drivers of change, explores branding considerations and offers recommendations for future research.

Our research is based on an explorative procedure, which qualitatively and quantitatively analyzes more than 70 online platforms associated with the SE in Germany. The results are empirically deduced features, types (of business models) and a definition of the SE. Overall, our results show that the SE appears to be of more a business model modification based on online platforms and incumbent dominated than a social innovation for the market-based society in Germany.

TI The categorical paradoxes in the sharing economy: Empirical evidence
   from Airbnb
SO PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT
AB Challenging conventional epistemological stances, we unravel two paradoxes of communication strategies in the emerging context of sharing economy. Specifically, the conformity-distinctiveness paradox asserts that differing from hotels improves hosts' economic performance, but such economic benefit diminishes when deviating from the norms in hospitality settings. The economic-social paradox propounds that positioning away from hotels improves social performance but may not result in optimal economic gains. Drawing on the theoretical underpinnings of strategic categorization and optimal distinctiveness, we collect and analyze data from a sample of Airbnb listings. Utilizing multiple estimation models and identification strategies, we find that hosts can improve their economic performance by differing from hotels, but such economic gains diminish beyond a certain point. Furthermore, deviating from hotels also increases hosts' social performance, especially when direct host-guest interactions occur in shared apartments. Our empirical findings provide compelling evidence for the two paradoxes in the context of sharing economy, extend the discourse on strategic categorization, and elucidate the effects of listing narratives conveyed through social technologies. This study also sheds new light on how operations management and service providers can exploit the communicative and linguistic perspectives of user-generated content.

TI Cloud-Based Privacy-Preserving Collaborative Consumption for Sharing
   Economy
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CLOUD COMPUTING
AB Cloud computing has been a dominant paradigm for a variety of information processing platforms, particularly for enabling various popular applications of sharing economy. However, there is a major concern regarding data privacy on these cloud-based platforms. This work presents novel cloud-based privacy-preserving solutions to support collaborative consumption applications for sharing economy. In typical collaborative consumption, information processing platforms need to enable fair cost-sharing among multiple users for utilizing certain shared facilities and communal services. Our cloud-based privacy-preserving protocols, based on homomorphic Paillier cryptosystems, can ensure that the cloud-based operator can only obtain an aggregate schedule of all users in facility sharing, or a service schedule conforming to service provision rule in communal service sharing, but is unable to track the personal schedules or demands of individual users. More importantly, the participating users are still able to settle cost-sharing among themselves in a fair manner for the incurred costs, without knowing each other's private schedules or demands. Our privacy-preserving protocols involve no other third party who may compromise privacy. We also provide an extensive evaluation study and a proof-of-concept system prototype of our protocols.

TI Listening to online reviews: A mixed-methods investigation of customer
   experience in the sharing economy
SO DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS
AB Understanding customer experience is an essential part of service operations for sustaining business in the sharing economy. We investigate the relationship among customer experience, perceived value, and customer loyalty from a stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) perspective. Using a dataset of 4166 listings in a leading Chinese accommodation-sharing platform and text mining and econometric methods to analyze online customer reviews, we find that customer experience manifests in the physical environment and human interaction dimensions. The results show a positive association among customer experience, perceived value, and customer loyalty. Notably, the physical environment and human interaction are equally important in influencing customers' value judgments about their consumption experience. Moreover, perceived value has a stronger positive effect on attitudinal loyalty than on behavioral loyalty. This study adds new insights into the customer experience-perceived value-customer loyalty path by showing that the physical environment and human interaction have the same importance in affecting perceived value and identifying the subtle difference between attitudinal and behavioral loyalty influenced by perceived value in the accommodation-sharing economy. Furthermore, these findings provide managerial insights for service operations management and marketing strategy planning.

TI PLURALIZING THE "SHARING" ECONOMY
SO WASHINGTON LAW REVIEW
AB The so-called "sharing" economy presents one of the most important and controversial regulatory dilemmas of our time yet, surprisingly, it remains undertheorized. This Article supplies needed analysis. Specifically, the Article offers a regulatory model that distinguishes between two separate kinds of transactions: conventional economic transactions and those that rely on temporary access to goods and services that would otherwise go underutilized (what I call "access-to-excess" transactions). The regulatory regime that this Article proposes would distinguish between true access-to-excess transactions and conventional transactions. The model is rooted in a version of pluralist theory that posits that the state is responsible for cultivating a range of social institutions that offer meaningful economic and social alternatives to individuals.
   Recognizing access-to-excess transactions in a separate legal regime does not mean countenancing all access-to-excess activity in an under-regulated Wild West of markets. Pluralism has something to offer here as well: I argue that, properly understood, pluralistic principles do not endorse free-market and hands-off policies. Rather, they require state intervention to preserve existing choices, embed and balance diverse values (not only autonomy), ensure fair competition, and protect consumers and employees from strategic and opportunistic behaviors. Thus, pluralistic principles offer the normative foundation for inventive regulation neither conventional nor free market that can restrain some of the "sharing" economy's harms without impeding innovation.
   Finally, the Article reverses the lens: The "sharing" economy serves as a real-life laboratory to reveal the operation of pluralistic theory and, thus, sheds light on the theory's limitations. In particular, the "sharing" economy shows how the plasticity of pluralistic theory may enable harmful free-market policies to masquerade as "choice."

TI Value co-creation and co-destruction in the Airbnb sharing economy
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose - This paper aims to develop a theoretical framework of value co-creation and value co-destruction of guest-host social practices facilitated through Airbnb in the sharing economy.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper makes use of a qualitative online content analysis to extract Airbnb data and to analyse guest reviews and host responses posted in the context of Malta.
   Findings - A theoretical framework is proposed revealing six distinct themes of guest-host social practices and their sub-categories, resulting in a spectrum of dimensions of value formation.
   Research limitations/implications - This paper collects data from Airbnb properties in Malta, with more narratives posted by guests, implying a dominance of guest views on value co-creation and co-destruction. Findings might have a limited transferability beyond similar sharing economy platforms and tourist destinations.
   Practical/implications - The paper uncovers guest-host hospitality value creation practices, providing concrete examples as to what practices lead to distinct value formation or destruction. In addressing the lack of knowledge about value creation practices in the sharing economy, strategic implications are offered to the hospitality sector to understand the distinct value propositions Airbnb offers compared to traditional accommodation types.
   Originality/value - The paper's contribution is its theoretical framework of value practices of guests staying at Airbnb-listed accommodations, contributing to a better understanding of the distinct value propositions underlying collaborative consumption offers in the sharing economy.

These circumstances provide an uncertain environment for researchers or practitioners developing new sharing services. Conducting a systematic literature review, a comprehensive overview of claimed positive and negative impacts of the Sharing Economy is given. Based on this overview, guidelines are derived that are supposed to help address these issues during the development of the new sharing services and underlying information systems.

TI Transforming self-perceived self-employability and entrepreneurship
   among mothers through mobile digital sharing economy platforms: an
   exploratory case study
SO PERSONNEL REVIEW
AB Purpose This research focuses on the extent sharing economy transforms employability for women impacted by domestic and reproductive work. The authors explore the experience of mothers, of how digital peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms can affect their self-perceived employability and skills deterioration by unlocking human capital through technology acceptance. Design/methodology/approach This study adopted a pragmatism-based approach incorporating using a single-case study research design with the Gioia methodology. It utilised a semi-structured telephone survey to collect data to explore the decisions around usage of a newly developed mobile P2P app, aiming to support employability among mothers. Analysis was conducted inductively using thematic analysis and partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Findings The study finds that mothers experience high rates of continued labour market attachment on a casual or part-time basis, difficulty in juggling family and work, and high levels of concern both about future employment/entrepreneurial opportunities and expected stress in balancing dual roles of carer and earner. While mothers are interested in using new sharing economy technologies to reduce skills deterioration and improve signalling, the authors find that there were both technology and non-technology related barriers. These included trust and security, life-stage mismatch, time poverty and limitation of service offerings. Research limitations/implications This research was limited to mothers in one state in Australia and by the case study research design, the measurement model and the self-report nature of the data collection. Hence, the findings may lack generalisability in other contexts. It also limits the ability to make conclusions regarding causality. Originality/value This exploratory study contributes to research in the intersection between human resources (HR) and entrepreneurship by illustrating how sharing economy platforms can offer women a means to overcome the issues of signalling and skills deterioration in relation to aspects of human capital theory by developing new skills that may act as positive signals signal to potential employers or investors. Additionally, the social interactions between mothers, through technology adoption, can provide a basis for improving future self-employment or entrepreneurship and employability.

TI The sharing economy: a bibliometric analysis of the state-of-the-art
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURIAL BEHAVIOR & RESEARCH
AB Purpose Quantitative bibliometric approaches were used to statistically and objectively explore patterns in the sharing economy literature. Design/methodology/approach Journal (co-)citation analysis, author (co-)citation analysis, institution citation and co-operation analysis, keyword co-occurrence analysis, document (co-)citation analysis and burst detection analysis were conducted based on a bibliometric data set relating to sharing economy publications. Findings Sharing economy research is multi- and interdisciplinary. Journals focused upon products liability, organizing framework, profile characteristics, diverse economies, consumption system and everyday life themes. Authors focused upon profile characteristics, sharing economy organization, social connections, first principle and diverse economy themes. No institution dominated the research field. Keyword co-occurrence analysis identified organizing framework, tourism industry, consumer behavior, food waste, generous exchange and quality cue as research themes. Document co-citation analysis found research themes relating to the tourism industry, exploring public acceptability, agri-food system, commercial orientation, products liability and social connection. Most cited authors, institutions and documents are reported. Research limitations/implications The study did not exclusively focus on publications in top-tier journals. Future studies could run analyses relating to top-tier journals alone, and then run analyses relating to less renowned journals alone. To address the potential fuzzy results concern, reviews could focus on business and/or management research alone. Longitudinal reviews conducted over several points in time are warranted.

TI The Sharing Economy in China's Aging Industry: Applications, Challenges,
   and Recommendations
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB Background: All aging societies face the challenge of allocating limited resources for the highest value of use. The sharing economy provides one method to address the imbalance between the demand and supply of health services to the older adult population. With a substantial aging population, China's practices in the sharing aging industry may set examples for other "getting old before getting rich" countries.
   Objective: There is a gap in both the data and research on China's aging industry sharing economy. This paper addresses these data and research lacunae by constructing a framework for the application of a sharing model in China's aging industry, by assessing the current state of the aging industry sharing economy, by setting out the challenges to the sharing aging health care and service economy, and by making recommendations for the development of the aging industry sharing economy.
   Methods: This paper constructs a sharing economy framework in the aging industry covering four aspects (people, facilities, capital, and information) to test the current state and future prospects of China's aging industry sharing economy.
   Results: In people sharing, we analyzed the sharing of emotional companionship, doctors, nurses, nursing attendants, and domestic helpers. We discussed facility sharing models from the point of land and housing, medical devices, and other items such as pensioner meals and shared medicine bins. We acknowledge that crowdfunding platforms have developed fast in China, but many older adult users faced problems in their operation. Information sharing is a developing field, which can optimize users' experiences and should help older adults filter out misinformation, but China currently does not have adequate sharing information platforms for older adults.
   Conclusions: We identified four major challenges in China's aging industry sharing economy: poor adaptability to technology for older adults, mediocre quality of shared services, one-size-fits-all and the concept of the useless elderly, and shortage of qualified practitioners. We make recommendations for specific measures by governments, communities, and enterprises to improve the sharing economy in the aging industry.

TI "Turning The Sharing Economy into a Fair Economy": Strategic Issue Work
   in the Vienna City Administration
SO THEORIZING THE SHARING ECONOMY:VARIETY AND TRAJECTORIES OF NEW FORMS OF
   ORGANIZING
SE Research in the Sociology of Organizations
AB Over the last years, and under the umbrella of the "sharing economy," various new social practices and novel business models have been established worldwide. Such practices and models are perceived both as opportunity and challenge for existing (urban) public governance regimes. It is in this sense that the sharing economy has become a contested issue and regularly provokes bold governance responses. However, local governing authorities first need to interpret, negotiate, and establish what exactly is "at issue" in order to (re-)act adequately. While such "politics of signification" are well-studied, for instance, in social movements and public media discourse, research on the concerted framing activities of public administrations as well as on the strategic work that sets the stage for public policy-making is relatively sparse - and entirely lacking for the context of the sharing economy. In this chapter, the authors look behind the scenes of the policy-making in the City of Vienna, Austria. The empirical findings unearth six distinct mechanisms -"delimiting," "negotiating," "detailing," "linking," "justifying," and "situating" - that are strategically applied to shape the "Viennese way" of governing the sharing economy. This research develops an in-depth understanding of what the authors conceptually dub "strategic issue work": the manifold efforts that lead to, and underlie, in this case, the policy-making of a local government when it tries to come to terms with the governance challenges of the sharing economy.

TI Competition between manufacturers and sharing economy platforms: An
   owner base and sharing utility perspective
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB We develop a two-period, five-stage game model with sharing utility to analyze how a manufacturer competes with a sharing economy platform that facilitates sharing of the manufacturer?s product from both a long-run and a short-run perspective. We use the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium to reveal how the manufacturer chooses its long-run (period-1) price to foster an owner base (a collection of the period-1 product buyers) that in turn affects its short-run (period-2) competition with the sharing economy platform (hereafter, platform for short). Analytical results show that (1) in the short run, an increase in the owner base has a negative (non-monotonic) impact on the profitability of the manufacturer (platform) while an increase in sharing utility negatively (positively) affects the profitability of the manufacturer (platform); (2) in the long run, the existence of the platform could be irrelevant for, pose a threat to, or benefit the manufacturer contingent upon different levels of sharing utility; (3) in the long run, a win-win scenario is attainable for both the manufacturer and platform when sharing utility is high enough. The managerial implication of this research is that the manufacturer and platform should collaborate to improve sharing utility to a sufficiently high level by enhancing the sense of community belonging, fostering benefits from sharing activities, and addressing sustainability concerns, thereby achieving a win-win result.

TI Exploring Green Consumers' Mind-Set toward Green Product Design and Life
   Cycle Assessment The Case of Skeptical Brazilian and Portuguese Green
   Consumers
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY
AB Businesses are increasingly interested in exploring the key concepts of industrial ecology (IE), particularly within the context of market-oriented sustainability. However, few studies have researched how green consumers perceive production as having relevant product design and life cycle assessment (LCA) dimensions. In this article, we explore green consumers' mind-set toward such system tools of IE by conducting 18 in-depth interviews with Brazilian and Portuguese green consumers. We propose a simplified theoretical framework for achieving market-oriented sustainability based on the multidisciplinary potential between IE and marketing. Our analysis suggests that there are still important gaps between what green consumers demand and what businesses are currently able (or willing) to supply. Our findings support the idea that businesses interested in following IE within the context of market-oriented sustainability should spend greater effort in understanding the green consumer's production-relatedmind-set. In particular, we propose (1) avoiding consumer skepticism and dissatisfaction with greenwashing and (2) establishing credibility and information transparency. Both seem to act as preconditions to better align the product design and LCA processes with green consumer needs within the emerging paradigm of market-oriented sustainability.

AB In recent years, the phenomenon of sharing economy has emerged in many industries worldwide and businesses leveraging the sharing economy have flourished. Sharing Economy denotes the "collaborative consumption made by the activities of sharing, exchanging, and rental of resources without owning the goods". Value is a central concept in consumer behavior and it directly explains why consumers choose to buy or avoid particular products or services. Therefore, to establish the theoretical linkage between collaborative consumption and consumer value, our study propose a research model to explain why consumers participate in collaborative consumption from a value co-creation perspective. Based prior literature on collaborative consumption and literature on consumer value and value co-creation, we identify five factors as key determinants of attitude towards collaborative consumption, including economic value, social value, entertainment value, convenience value, and trust. A large scale survey was designed and implemented to test our research model. Data analysis results suggested that economic value, social value, entertainment value and trust significantly affect people's attitude towards collaborative consumption. The practical and theoretical contributions of our study are discussed.

TI Transition within a transition: how cooperative platforms want to change
   the sharing economy
SO SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
AB Scholars have argued that the sharing economy represents a transitional pathway to sustainability. The growth, however, of multi-national giants, such as Airbnb or Uber, has created new environmental, social, and economic problems and led many to question the dominant form of the sharing economy. In this paper, we study a transition within a transition-that is the emergence of a new niche of cooperative platforms within the sharing economy. We examine how promoters and followers of Fairbnb, a nascent cooperative alternative to Airbnb, frame and envision their project and then discuss tensions, debates, and limits around their ideas and business model. We find that their primary motivations are to mitigate the negative effects of mass tourism, to prevent the extraction of wealth from local economies, and to sustain a prosperous social business. Tensions are found around limitations of democratic governance, decentralization, and size of the project.

Revenue management and pricing strategies are indeed pivotal aspects platforms should care about when (re)configuring their business models. A mixed-method investigation has been performed to achieve this goal: a longitudinal content analysis and a case studies analysis. Results from the first step of the research show that four main typologies of innovation emerge in the analyzed platforms. Furthermore, the case studies analysis reveals three main patterns (Network, Monetization, Lock-in) and the possible paths a platform can undergo when innovate its value capture mechanisms.

This study focuses on digital travel industry of Pakistan and aims to explore the social and economic implications of sharing economy platforms. Drawing on the concepts of social inclusion/exclusion from ICT and IS literature, we examine the potential participation of digital platforms in social inclusion/exclusion of the society. We adopted an interpretive and qualitative research design. The data was collected through informal talks, observations and semi-structured interviews. For our research study, we selected two online ride-hailing companies operational in Pakistan, Uber and Careem. The study shows social impacts of sharing economy digital-platforms to enhance culture of trust, family confidence and women empowerment. It highlights the inclusion of unemployed groups through self-entrepreneurship that improve economic activities in the society. The study also identifies few contradictions and potential challenges that support social exclusion due to technology, such as biased gendered contribution in economic activities, generation/age constraints in usability and accessibility issues based on geographic locations.

TI The taste for green: The possibilities and dynamics of status
   differentiation through "green" consumption
SO POETICS
AB Recent social science scholarship on "green" consumption (consumption promoted as relatively environmentally friendly) has connected it to social status, positioning it as an opportunity for consumers to signal their social status conspicuously. I show that the practice of green consumption does appeal to the relatively well-educated, but argue that the social differentiation implicated in green consumption occurs, in part, through the expression of tastes that do not rely on conspicuous signaling and that are contingent on the symbolic nature of the goods themselves. The paper employs a logistic regression analysis on national data from a 2008 ABC News/Discovery Channel/Stanford University survey of American adults to show that an increasing level of education is positively related to the odds of finding green consumption desirable. Being female, having children under the age of 18 years old in the home, and identifying as an environmentalist are also positive predictors. These findings are situated in existing literature on green consumption and interpreted using the theoretical contributions of Pierre Bourdieu (1984, 2005) in Distinction and The Social Structures of the Economy. The result is an engagement with scholarship on green consumption that is both theoretically and empirically informed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper studies rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) investment decisions of households. Two cases are considered: (a) the status quo of net-metering, and (b) a new sharing economy model. Under net-metering, households can sell back their excess generation to the utility at their retail tariff subject to the prevalent constraint that they cannot be net producers of electricity on an annual basis. In our sharing economy model, households can pool their excess PV generation and trade it in a spot market among themselves, but the collective cannot sell electricity back to the utility. Our objective in studying these two cases is that net-metering programs are under threat and being phased out, which places future residential PV investment at risk. In the event of this contingency, we argue that the sharing economy model offers a pathway to preserve and even accelerate residential PV investment.
   We derive expressions for the optimal investment decisions in each case assuming that households are rational and wish to minimize their costs. We characterize the random clearing price in the spot market for excess PV generation under the sharing model. We show that the optimal investment decisions are determined by a simple threshold policy. Households whose PV productivity metric exceeds this threshold invest the maximum possible, while those that fall below the threshold do not invest. We offer a convergent algorithm to compute this threshold. We close with a small-scale simulation study that reveals the favorable properties of the sharing economy model for residential PV investments.

AB With products becoming increasingly exchangeable and markets reaching their saturation limits customer orientation has become an integral tool for companies' economic success. While customer orientation in a traditional corporate context has been researched extensively and a number of measurement approaches have been developed, there has not yet been any research concerning customer orientation in the sharing economy. As sharing economy businesses operate differently in companies with a traditional corporate background, it is considered that not all indicators of customer orientation in traditional enterprises also apply to companies of the sharing economy. Therefore, in this research those differences were investigated to suggest indicators of customer orientation in the sharing economy and test them upon their practical relevance in peer-to-peer marketplaces.

AB Sharing economy relies on a business model where private individuals share goods or services. Transactions are facilitated by online platforms, where intermediary companies connect providers with users and try to create a sense of belonging to a virtual community that shares certain values. This paper attempts to investigate the features of touristic discourse of one of the most successful companies in the sharing economy, Airbnb, and its Neighborhood guides.
   Airbnb Neighborhood guides belong to a wider discourse practice which tries to foster the sense of belonging to a virtual community that shares a specific attitude towards tourism. Multimodality, strategies of representation and ego-targeting and rethorical moves that convey a specific vision of tourism as a local experience are amongst the main features of Airbnb tourism discourse.

AB Under the rapid development of sharing economy, performance is important for the prosperity of this innovative commercial model. However, the performance in sharing economy is less discussed in the academic field. Revenue and occupancy rate are widely applied as two ideal measures of performance in hospitality market. This study tries to fill the research gaps with both two measurements. Based on cue utilization theory, we explored the influence of listing cues and host cues on performance of listings and hosts in a representative Chinese room-sharing platform--XiaoZhu.com. The findings indicate that both listing and host cues have significant effects on performance. It's expected that this study discusses a number of implications and makes contributions for researchers and practitioners.

TI Leveraging social media to gain insights into service delivery: a study
   on Airbnb
SO INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND E-BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB Consumers increasingly rely on reviews and social media posts provided by others to get information about a service. Especially in the Sharing Economy, the quality of service delivery varies widely; no common quality standard can be expected. Because of the rapidly increasing number of reviews and tweets regarding a particular service, the available information becomes unmanageable for a single individual. However, this data contains valuable insights for platform operators to improve the service and educate individual providers. Therefore, an automated tool to summarize this flood of information is needed. Various approaches to aggregating and analyzing unstructured texts like reviews and tweets have already been proposed. In this research, we present a software toolkit that supports the sentiment analysis workflow informed by the current state-of-the-art. Our holistic toolkit embraces the entire process, from data collection and filtering to automated analysis to an interactive visualization of the results to guide researchers and practitioners in interpreting the results. We give an example of how the tool works by identifying positive and negative sentiments from reviews and tweets regarding Airbnb and delivering insights into the features of service delivery its users most value and most dislike. In doing so, we lay the foundation for learning why people participate in the Sharing Economy and for showing how to use the data. Beyond its application on the Sharing Economy, the proposed toolkit is a step toward providing the research community with an instrument for a holistic sentiment analysis of individual domains of interest.

TI COMPETING WITH THE SHARING ECONOMY : INCUMBENTS? REACTION ON REVIEW
   MANIPULATION
SO MIS QUARTERLY
AB The emergence of the sharing economy has provided the market with an untapped wealth of supplies, posing a threat to incumbents. In response to competition from the sharing economy, incumbents must adjust their competitive strategies. In this paper, we focus our investigation on a nascent competitive strategy- consumer opinion manipulation-in the lodging sector of the hospitality industry. We examine two types of opinion manipulations through online reviews: promoting oneself and demoting one's competitors. Combining data from Airbnb, Expedia, TripAdvisor, AirDNA, the Texas Comptroller's Office, and Smith Travel Research, we estimate the impact of a new sharing economy entrant, Airbnb, on conventional hotels' manipulation strategies by exploring the supply variation of the competing Airbnb listings around each hotel. We find that, intriguingly, hotels tend to reduce mutual demotion when facing the common "enemy" of Airbnb competition. However, there is considerable heterogeneity among hotels in response to Airbnb competition. Low-end hotels tend to not increase their review manipulation activities for purposes of either self-promotion or demotion, while high-end hotels tend to demote competing hotels less and promote themselves more in the presence of higher levels of Airbnb competition.

TI Sharing economy, technological innovation and carbon emissions: Evidence
   from Chinese cities
SO JOURNAL OF INNOVATION & KNOWLEDGE
AB The development of the sharing economy offers opportunities to reduce urban carbon emissions. Unfortunately, few studies have examined the impact of the sharing economy on urban carbon emissions from a holistic view based on the integration of local and neighborhood hierarchies. This paper examines the impact of the sharing economy on urban carbon emissions from 2011 to 2017 using a sample of 275 prefecture-level cities in China. The results show that the development of personal credit information services and digital finance both contribute to curbing urban carbon emissions. Technological innovation is not only beneficial to urban carbon emission reduction, but also has a negative moderating effect on the relationship between economic development and carbon emissions. Spatial spillover effects of the sharing economy help curb carbon emissions in neighboring cities. Finally, policy recommendations are presented to promote the collaborative economy and reduce urban carbon emissions. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

TI Purchasing intention and behavior in the sharing economy: Mediating
   effects of APP assessments
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB In the new era of the sharing economy, firms are setting up Application (APP) service platforms to reach potential consumers and enhance their assessment of how to increase consumers' perceived benefits. This study thus emphasizes that, via APP assessments in the context of the sharing economy, consumers' perceived benefits can drive their purchasing intention and behavior. We examine 464 surveys of users who had previous experiences on various related APPs in the sharing economy and present empirical results supporting that APP assessments play mediator roles among perceived benefits and purchasing intention. The research model shows that relational, attitude, and capability benefits are consumers' three main perceived benefits that influence their purchasing intention. This study thus offers management and marketing implications in the sharing economy by suggesting that firms increase consumers' perceived benefits in order to raise APP assessments, thereby spurring their intention to use the APPs to finalize their final purchase behavior.

AB In recent years, through the advances in technology and highlighting the sustainability concepts in different aspects of human lives, the sharing economy has become an interesting topic for researchers, and also, many businesses claim to be active in this environment. However, a comprehensive definition, which is generally accepted, does not yet exist in the literature. In this paper, through a systematic literature review, analysis, and coding, a comprehensive definition, and also, an inclusive framework is presented for the sharing economy. This can help scientists and businesses to clarify which companies or parts of their activities fall into the SE category, and which do not. Such clarification in a small scale is done for five companies at the end of the paper.

TI PSE and ISE Based E-Commerce Model Design of Sharing Enterprises
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
AB Sharing economy is developing rapidly in the world, but most sharing enterprises have failed and brought a huge waste of resources. We analyzed the relationship between the entrepreneurial success and the failure of e-commerce companies engaged in sharing goods. We think that the sharing economy is divided into the procurement sharing economy (PSE) and idle sharing economy (ISE). By establishing two models (PSE and ISE) to explain the success or failure of enterprises in sharing economy, we found that PSE enterprises are traditional enterprises with a high bankruptcy risk. PSE enterprises can generate a significant amount of waste and are highly dependent on venture capital; they should be restricted by the government. ISE enterprises, however, have Internet "genes," comport with sustainable development, and should be supported. Our research shows that entrepreneurs may fail if they do not pay attention to the relationship. A huge waste of resources and chaotic social order may occur if the government does not pay attention to it, and investment companies may lose a lot if they ignore it. The practical data show that our method is effective in judging whether the sharing enterprise fails.

TI Enhancing the development of sharing economy to mitigate the carbon
   emission: a case study of online ride-hailing development in China
SO NATURAL HAZARDS
AB The rapid development of online ride-hailing sharing economic platform provided an efficient way to mitigate the carbon emission of modern traffic in China. However, its development was blocked by the social management system whose update is relatively slow. How to resolve the conflict between the new economic paradigm development under the technology empowerment and the old public administration system and effectively solve the new economic and social problems it brought by are the major challenges for the healthy and sustainable development of this type of sharing economy. To shed light on the solutions to such conflict, the present paper conducts a case study on China's largest online ride-hailing platform 'Didi Chuxing'. The results indicate that the separation of ownership and use rights following the sharing economy brings a new approach to the efficient use of resources. The development of Didi displays a bottom-up policy innovation and institutional change. The path choice of enterprise development will affect its acquisition of legitimacy to a great extent. In this mobile Internet era, the public plays a critical role in shaping the new policy.

TI New Models for Collaborative Consumption: The Role of Consumer Attitudes
   Among Millennials
SO SAGE OPEN
AB In recent years, the phenomenon of the sharing economy has emerged strongly as a system of exchange and consumption of goods and services among individuals, mainly through digital platforms. The development of information and communication technologies and the need for a new consumption and ownership culture have been the driving forces behind this economy. However, there has been little research into people's motivations to participate in collaborative consumption, especially among young people, who are most likely to use such a consumption model. Therefore, this paper develops an explanatory model, based on self-determination theory, to understand the motivations to participate in the sharing economy of young people, who make up the millennial generation. The model was tested using a sample of 272 people in this population segment, who expressed an interest in this type of consumption. The results confirm that participation in collaborative consumption is motivated by factors such as sustainability, enjoyment of the activity, and economic benefits.

TI Encouraging Respect?: Understanding consumers? perspective on the

SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB This paper investigates passengers' beliefs, attitudes, engagement, and behavior toward the two-way evaluation system within the sharing economy marketplace. The sharing economy has been implementing new review initiatives to improve the service industry's resilience. Two studies were conducted. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results show three significant findings: 1) the respondents' belief in the intentions of the evaluation has a substantial impact on their attitude towards the intention to encourage mutual respect; 2) the results of passengers' attitude toward a passenger's right to rate were insignificant when the respondents have rated a driver, and 3) the perceived fairness of the company serves as a boundary between engagement and the intention to encourage mutual respect. Being evaluated is not always pleasant; however, if the evaluation system is intended to keep users and providers in check, users' attitudes toward a two-way evaluation system may differ.

The idea of establishing a service-oriented government to people's satisfaction is put forward. However, the transformation of government functions is continuous and dynamic, which cannot be achieved overnight. Although many significant achievements have been achieved, government functions lag still exists. Today sharing economy is springing up like mushrooms, and the government (this paper mainly refers to the local government) which should have provided powerful guarantee for them still have not transformed in position. And government functions come into being, which severely restricts the sharing economy development. The author intends to do a research in government functions lag based on online booking car and make efforts to give some constructive advice on how to narrow the gap of the lag and to get the sharing economy out of the predicament.

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The aim of the article is to analyze the relationship between lifestyle changes and willingness to use sharing economy services in tourism, including peer-to-peer accommodation. On the one hand, knowledge of lifestyle changes can help adapt the product offer to the requirements of consumers. On the other hand, products that consumers use can reflect lifestyle changes. The following classification of motivations for sharing economy activity selection resulting from the subjects' lifestyles has been proposed: personal motivations-related to economic advantages; social (conformist) motivations-resulting from the need to fit in with others; and ideological motivation-resulting from the understanding of the processes of natural environment degradation and excessive consumption. In order to gather opinions and to understand behaviors, attitudes, and preferences regarding sharing economy activities (i.e., the sharing of transportation, food, clothes, equipment, and accommodation), the focus group interview method was used (6 groups, 5-8 participants each). Discussions were conducted separately for two populations: young with time (YT) and older rich (OR). The study demonstrates lifestyle changes between the generations. YT actions are the consequence of personal and ideological motivations. OR have lifestyles that result from personal and conformist motivations. Neither population sees a relationship between participating in the sharing economy and caring for the environment and preventing excessive consumption.

In this study, the college students in Tai'an City were taken as examples. Through a questionnaire method, their awareness and behavior of green consumption was studied and their characteristics of green consumption were analyzed. The results showed that most of the respondents had a high level of green consumption awareness, but there were some which had deficiencies in green consumption behavior. There was a certain gap between behavior and awareness. 87.88% of the respondents believed that citizens are the main body responsible for promoting green consumption. Meanwhile, government should play a leading role in promoting green consumption and strengthening the construction of relevant facilities, so as to improve the public awareness of green consumption.

AB With an increase in the electrification of end-use sectors, various resources on the demand side provide great flexibility potential for system operation, which also leads to problems such as the strong randomness of power consumption behavior, the low utilization rate of flexible resources, and difficulties in cost recovery. With the core idea of "access over ownership", the concept of the sharing economy has gained substantial popularity in the local energy market in recent years. Thus, we provide an overview of the potential market design for the sharing economy in local energy markets (LEMs) and conduct a detailed review of research related to local energy sharing, enabling technologies, and potential practices. This paper can provide a useful reference and insights for the activation of demand-side flexibility potential. Hopefully, this paper can also provide novel insights into the development and further integration of the sharing economy in LEMs.

TI Sharing Economy in Russia: Current Status, Barriers, Prospects and Role
   of Universities
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Nowadays, information technology and the Internet are becoming a driver for a shared consumption economy (sharing economy). The paper aims to analyse the current level of use and prospects for the development of models of the sharing economy in Russia. We identify the effects of sharing consumption for the circular economy and study factors that stimulate the use of peer-to-peer models. One of the study's tasks was to investigate the involvement of the young generation in the sharing economy, as the most promising part of the population. The study is based on the analysis of open Internet sources on the operation of sharing platforms in Russia and a survey among students at two Russian universities (RUDN University in Moscow and Kuban State University in Krasnodar) to identify the awareness of young people regarding sharing platforms. Analysis of the current state of sharing in Russia showed that the use of most types of sharing is at an initial stage. At the same time, the prospects for economic growth and population development are quite high. The article identifies several effects of digital platforms for sustainable development, the main of which are informed consumption and production. For the further growth of users of the sharing economy, the authors highlight the level of penetration of the Internet and the need for high-quality services on digital platforms. Educational organisations can also become a platform for the development of models of the sharing economy by involving students in sharing processes, as demonstrated by the survey.

TI Borrowing Spaces: The Geographies of 'Libraries of Things' in the
   Canadian Sharing Economy
SO TIJDSCHRIFT VOOR ECONOMISCHE EN SOCIALE GEOGRAFIE
AB Over the last decade, the sharing economy has resulted in numerous innovative sharing and borrowing practices, many of which have the potential to radically transform communities and societies. One such innovation is the Library of Things (LoT), a non-profit sharing space modelled on traditional library systems, which enables users to borrow a diverse range of equipment, tools and goods. This paper contributes to the emerging literature and research on the non-profit sharing economy and the role of LoTs as sharing spaces. Drawing on in-depth interviews with LoT founders and managers, three main socio-spatial themes are discussed in the development of Canadian LoTs: sharing cultures, sharing capital and sharing politics. Overall, this work highlights that the success and sustainability of these sharing spaces hinge on the negotiation of these complex social and spatial dynamics, ranging from their capacity to build spaces of collaboration, experimentation and community.

TI Does income inequality influence the role of a sharing economy in
   promoting sustainable economic growth? Fresh evidence from emerging
   markets
SO JOURNAL OF INNOVATION & KNOWLEDGE
AB The impact of the sharing economy has become increasingly prominent in facilitating sustainable economic growth. The current study examined this relationship in the context of emerging markets. It addressed the influence of income inequality on restricting the expected benefits from activities associated with the sharing of assets or services. The study employed panel data from 20 developing countries across Africa and Asia from 2001 to 2020 and used dynamic models to mitigate the impact of endogeneity. The study utilised a proxy indicator for sharing economies developed in the literature, as well as three different measures for income inequality, in order to ensure robust findings. The study employed the generalised method of moments (GMM) as its primary methodology. The GMM results confirmed previous findings from developed countries in which the sharing economy tended to promote the sustainable growth of the economy. Income inequality was observed to have a negative relationship with sustainable economic growth, however, and this indicated that it hampered the ability of the sharing economy to stimulate sustainable growth. Interestingly, when the analysis included interaction terms to capture the moderating impact of income inequality there was more consistency with previous research. The interaction term had a negative coefficient, indicating that income inequality tended to act as an impediment in developing countries to the full capturing of the benefits of peer-to-peer transactions. These findings provided useful insights into collaborative consumption and the peer economy, given that the aim of the sharing of resources would be to capture rent from underused assets. The study suggested that the development of efficient and effective platforms would allow developing countries to capture the benefits of the sharing economy.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB Sharing economy is a new form of economic and social innovation by integrating the massive, decentralized and idle resources of the society, platforming and synergistically gathering, reusing and matching supply and demand. At present, it is developing rapidly in China and exerts a favorable mitigation effect on the social contradiction between increasing resource deficiency and idleness. As innovation drives development and the public's scientific literacy improves, the science popularization industry is booming, however, public science popularization service is in a sharp shortage of supply. In this context, this paper explores the development approach integrating science popularization industry with the sharing economy from policy environment, development mode and enterprise cultivation under sharing economy with a combination of a depth analysis on the existing problems in the science popularization industry through summarizing the concept, characteristics and development mode of sharing economy.

SO JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB The authors construct a psychographic profile of the green consumer in terms of variables directly related to purchase behavior, such as price consciousness and general care in shopping interest in new products, and brand loyalty. Additionally, they address attitudes toward advertising and media preferences. Data from 3264 respondents to the DDB Needham Life Style Study were analyzed. The results show the green consumer to be an opinion leader and a careful shopper who seeks information on products, including information from advertising, but also suggest that the green consumer is rather skeptical of advertising. The implications are that green consumers may be receptive to green marketing and advertising, but marketers should take care not to alienate them by using ambiguous or misleading messages.

TI Sharing intangibles: Uncovering individual motives for engagement in a
   sharing service setting
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB The sharing economy has shifted the way in which goods and services are consumed - from exclusive ownership toward collective usage with economic benefits. Current literature addresses consumer motives to participate in commercial sharing of goods and services with a physical manifestation. In contrast, this study shows the relevance of intangibility for sharing services and empirically examines consumers' motives, perceptions, and experiences in the context of a new insurance model. A qualitative investigation reveals three main characteristics of intangible service sharing: financial benefits as a main motivator for participation, emerging weak social and symbolic values in a controlled environment, and a network of strangers as a crucial precondition for sharing. The work contributes to research on the sharing economy as well as to managerial considerations for the design of sharing services. In particular, managers need to balance between community development and the preservation of anonymity when promoting sharing services based on intangible elements. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI Understanding the organization of sharing economy in agri-food systems:
   evidence from alternative food networks in Valencia
SO AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
AB Despite the proliferation of sharing economy initiatives in agri-food systems, the recent literature has still not unravelled what sharing exactly entails from an organizational standpoint. In light of this knowledge gap, this study aims to understand which resources are shared, and how, in a heterogeneous set of sharing economy initiatives in the context of food and agriculture. Specifically, this study compares the organization of various forms of alternative food networks (AFNs), which are recognized to be frugal forms of sharing economy initiatives (i.e., locally based, small-scale and with limited use of information technology), in terms of leadership, bureaucracy, shared resources and participants' engagement. Data from a comparative case study across 18 AFNs identify five sharing economy models of AFNs with distinctive shared resources and organizational mechanisms: consumer groups; commercial community gardens; as well as network-based, privately owned and publicly owned self-consumption community gardens. These models also display notable differences in terms of their origins, participants' goals and constraints which, to some extent, may be associated to the nature of their organization. Findings inform policy-makers, AFNs' leaders and stakeholders-especially those seeking to support innovative models towards sustainable transitions-on how to tailor institutional norms and develop networks to meet the heterogeneous needs of different typologies of sharing economy initiatives in agri-food systems.

TI Measuring antecedents of green consumption in a circular economy: An
   empirical study of household consumers for moral identity and
   pro-environmental self-accountability
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED AND APPLIED SCIENCES
AB This paper's goal is to investigate how consumers' moral identities and pro-environmental self-accountability combine to influence their green consumption behavior. In this study, the researcher looked at the latest literature in the area and hypotheses were framed. Previous research on structural relationships is lacking in the literature on antecedents of green consumption. Due to gaps in the literature, this research combines the theories of social-cognitive perspective moral identity theory, and self-accountability theory on the relationship between moral identity and green consumption as well as examines the impact of pro-environmental self-accountability on green consumption. The hypotheses were tested after data was collected through questionnaires. A measurement model and structural models were also assessed. The results demonstrate that consumers' moral identities affect their green consumption. In particular, consumer green consumption is impacted when they are encouraged to have a high level of self-accountability. This study adds to the body of knowledge on how to increase consumer green consumption, which has managerial and governmental policy implications. However, the dependent measures are likewise constrained as the authors only included household consumers as participants. Future studies can use different sample types and dependent metrics to test the conclusion's generalizability.(c) 2023 The Authors. Published by IASE.

TI Airbnb - exploring triple bottom line impacts on community
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CULTURE TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY RESEARCH
AB Purpose
   This paper aims to purposely place community and its stakeholders at the forefront of an investigation of positive and negative social, economic and environmental impacts of the sharing economy in the specific context of Airbnb by drawing upon the triple bottom line (TBL) framework of sustainability.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A qualitative enquiry through a "scoping approach" with the search of relevant electronic databases identified a range of conceptual and empirical studies in the period from 2008 to 2018 informing a profile focussed on the triple bottom line impacts.
   Findings
   The criteria limited search yielded 23 focal articles, which investigated or discussed Airbnb impacts on local communities. Analysis of these articles informed a three-pillar tabulation of positive and negative impacts, which are presented against four key stakeholder groupings.
   Originality/value
   To the best of authors' knowledge, this is one of the first studies to apply a "scoping approach" to holistically illuminate the positive and negative impacts of Airbnb at the micro-level in each of the three domains of sustainability. The research methodology is shown to be effective, with positive community impact, and will easily adapt to other destinations grappling with policy decisions.

AB Can platforms close the governance gap in the sharing economy, and if so, how? Through an in-depth qualitative case study, we analyze the process by which new regulation and self-regulation emerge in one sector of the sharing economy, crowdfunding, through the actions of a meta-organization. We focus on the principal French sectoral meta-organization, Financement Participatif France (FPF-Crowdfunding France). We show that this multi-stakeholder meta-organization not only closed the governance gap through collective legal, ethical, and utilitarian work but also preceded and shaped the new market. We present a hybrid governance approach combining (a) soft multi-agency regulation, (b) self-regulation through a process of "partial meta-organizing", and (c) direct civil society participation. We expand the literature by highlighting features of platforms' partial meta-organizing and by identifying conditions for successful joint regulation and self-regulation of the sector.

Design/methodology/approach The authors build on online user comments and reviews as aggregated by independent third-party websites, and apply a qualitative analysis. Findings The findings show that the quantity of information and communication are important drivers towards building trust perceptions, while an overall lack of interaction between users and the marketplace provider intensifies perceived risks. Originality/value The authors validated the importance of trust and the authors have illustrated that the critical conditions that hinder trust formation are information asymmetry as well as the lack of interaction. What is also an interesting implication is that the impact of both of these can be exacerbated when there is a perceived lack of support among users and between them and the marketplace operator.

TI THE SHARING ECONOMY AS AN EQUALIZING ECONOMY
SO NOTRE DAME LAW REVIEW
AB Economic equality is often said to be the key problem of our time. But information technology dematerializes the world in ways that are helpful to the ninety-nine percent, because information can be shared. This Article looks at how one fruit of the information revolution-the sharing economy-has important equalizing features on both its supply and demand sides. First, on the supply side, the intermediaries in the sharing economy, like Airbnb and Uber, allow owners of housing and cars to monetize their most important capital assets. The gig aspect of this economy creates spot markets in jobs that have flexible hours and monetizes people's passions, such as cooking meals in their home. Such benefits make these jobs even more valuable than the earnings that show up imperfectly in income statistics. The law and economics analysis of Hernando de Soto has shown how creating property rights and more formal markets can help those of modest means in the developing world. The sharing economy performs a similar function for people of modest means in the developed world.
   Second, on the demand side, the sharing economy also creates gains for consumers that largely go to the ninety-nine percent. Airbnb finds them cheaper accommodations in places that may have been unaffordable. But the advantages go beyond price. Summoning a ridesharing car almost anywhere with the press of a smartphone is a much closer approximation of having a chauffeur-a hallmark of wealth-than hailing a taxi. The law and economics analysis of Ronald Coase shows how replacing such physical agents with online agents redounds largely to the benefit of those with modest incomes.
   If the sharing economy has equalizing as well as efficiency features, regulations must be careful not to disturb them. But because the sharing economy permits new entry into markets, incumbents will respond with new regulatory efforts to hamper it. This Article provides a taxonomy of the different kinds of regulation to help preserve the equalizing features from being impaired.
   The Article ends by showing how the sharing economy more generally problematizes the conventional story of growing material inequality. The dematerialization of the world provides greater opportunities for broadly shared consumption, like that on Facebook, and improves working conditions, particularly for the middling classes. Only by taking account of these trends can we understand the changing relative material conditions of people.

TI The sharing economy and collaborative consumption: Strategic issues and
   global entrepreneurial opportunities
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AB The purpose of this paper is to analyze and discuss the topics of sharing economy and collaborative consumption (CC) within the domains of global entrepreneurial opportunities, strategic issues, and emerging online businesses. Both topics remain immensely rich and intertwined because of their interdisciplinary perspectives and multifaceted issues. The sharing economy and CC-based digital platforms clearly support and complement today's business models, corporate expansion, and entrepreneurial growth. The sharing economy and CC models continue to grow yet can be disruptive in international entrepreneurship. The paper investigates the sharing economy as well as CC in ten sectors (73 firms) from the perspective of "commercial sharing systems" (Lamberton and Rose 2012, p. 109). Findings of the paper reveal that the two topics distinctly remain interconnected when dealing with their business models, entrepreneurial initiatives, and consumers in global markets. The work systematically lays the foundation for future research in the international entrepreneurship literature and its related areas. Companies that pursue the areas of sharing-based systems tend to be inherently innovative and venturesome in their business models and digital platforms. The paper also provides a research agenda and managerial implications of this timely discussion that continues to grow in international entrepreneurship.

TI Banned from the sharing economy: an agent-based model of a peer-to-peer
   marketplace for consumer goods and services
SO JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY ECONOMICS
AB The emergence of profit-based online platforms related to the Sharing Economy, such as BlaBlaCar and Airbnb, provides new means for end users to create an income from their possessions. With this opportunity, participants have to make strategic economic decisions despite limited formal expertise and information. Decentralization (using digital technologies) and reputation (using user reviews) are the core mechanisms chosen by these platforms to mitigate these limitations and to work efficiently as online matchmakers. We test the performance of these two mechanisms by studying the allocative efficiency (in terms of value and volume of transactions) of simulated marketplaces under different types of motivation from the participants and control from the platforms. As a result, we find an inverted-U relationship between the decision-making leeway available to the participants and the platform's allocative efficiency. From the participants' perspectives, too much freedom or too many barriers lead to market failures affecting specific participants: low-end consumers are banned from the marketplace while high-end providers experience lower levels of activity. As governance advice for these platforms, we show the limitations of promoting these platforms on the sole motive of monetary rewards.

TI A decision model for efficient service design in the sharing economy: a
   service triad perspective
SO ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MARKETING AND LOGISTICS
AB Purpose Sharing economy-based service platforms are a relatively new way of delivering services that have received increasing attention from both practitioners and researchers. However, current research in the area is still developing in terms of offering practical insight in conjunction with a decision model that may help to determine optimal strategies for efficient service design in the sharing economy from a service triad perspective. Exploring this gap in the literature, this paper aims to develop and apply a decision model that enables managers to identify and prioritise the efficiency attributes of sharing economy-based services. It also aids in designing optimal strategies to enhance efficiency over time based on the insights obtained from users (buyers and sellers) and platform providers. Design/methodology/approach This study adopts a mixed-methods approach. The qualitative approach comprised an extensive literature review followed by in-depth interviews, and the quantitative approach adopted the quality function deployment (QFD) integrated optimisation technique to design and prioritise the most optimal strategy emanating from the application of a decision model. Findings The findings revealed that establishing global distribution, continued technological research and development (R&D) and enhancing the transactional platform are the most important strategies in the context of sharing economy platform providers (e.g. accommodation-based-platform service providers). This study also revealed that as the importance weights of the efficiency attributes changed over time, so too did the portfolio of strategies used to attain an optimal efficiency level. Originality/value The decision model brings a richer conceptual understanding of the dynamic changes over time that occur in the business ecosystem. It also allows managers of sharing economy-based platforms to select optimal strategies and make astute decisions towards achieving efficient service design.

SO KYBERNETES
AB Purpose
   This paper aims to explore the sharing economy in Italy, focusing on key socioeconomic characteristics.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Adopting an exploratory approach, it analyzes the answers of a questionnaire, created using Google Forms and administered via social networks and e-mails. To analyze the answers statistical tests and descriptive statistics were used. The survey reveals potential behavioral factors, which influence the participation propensity to share economic practices.
   Findings
   Results exhibit that the age of the consumer is an impactful participating factor of sharing economy, and therefore, it seems to be a discriminant. On the contrary, gender and annual income are insignificant determinants.
   Originality/value
   It aims to discover how this digital trend shapes the social fabric of the global economy, providing a broader reflection in terms of future sustainability developments. Ongoing dynamic changes on digital consumer preferences toward sharing products and services provide valuable evidence on their future commercial behavior.

TI The group decision-making evolution of green consumption behavior under
   overreaction: Based on multi-agent simulation analysis
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB Promoting green consumption behavior is an effective means to promote sustainable development. Previous studies have not considered the irrational decisions of residents under the influence of complex internal and external information, so this study introduces overreaction theory into a multi-agent simulation model. The results show that (1) Greater economic profit and government incentive can encourage green consumption behavior decision and are conducive to the stability of group decision state. (2) When the difference between the consumption cost of green and general consumption is too large, the group with low initial adoption rate will evolve to another decision state. And environmental loss has little effect on green consumption behavior. (3) The stronger the overreaction of consumers to green consumption, the greater the volatility of group decisionmaking, but also the greater the probability choosing green consumption behavior. These findings provide a theoretical reference for the formulation of related policies.

SO FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
AB Facing the rapid development of society, China's market has attracted more and more attention from all over the world, at the same time, the disadvantages has also gradually emerged, such as environmental pollution. Encountering many severe challenges, these problems have been gradually improved with the support of Communist Party of China's policy and the promotion of citizens' awareness of environmental protection, and the concept of green consumption has emerged as the times require, leading a new consumption trend. The inheritance and dissemination of Chinese culture for thousands of years has determined position of Chinese civilization. The profound cultural heritage is rooted in the hearts of the people, affecting the consumption mode. Combined with the the background of Chinese culture and began with consumer values, this paper studied and analyzed the relevance of consumer values and green consumption willingness and put forward the countermeasure of consumer values and green consumption willingness based on the the background of Chinese culture from the perspective of inheriting traditional culture and carrying forward the concept of green consumption through the development of relevant scales, questionnaires and data analysis., and therefore, it provided a theoretical reference for the development of green consumption in China.

AB Entrepreneurs always look for business opportunities. Long-term care is a serious problem in many countries and exhausts various resources. Hence, though the governments of these countries resort to solve the problem, it remain an impact to their government finance. Meanwhile, the sharing economy is popular for resource sharing. The sharing can greatly reduce costs. Hence, this study proposes a conceptual framework to apply the sharing economy to lower the costs and to increase the efficiency of the long-term care. The proposed framework sheds some light to the opportunities for entrepreneurs.

TI An Empirical Analysis of the Common Factors Influencing the Sharing and
   Green Economies
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The digital revolution, driven and accelerated by the current pandemic, involves changes to known business models. The innovative model of the sharing economy can be a real and sustainable solution for long-term green economic development. The aim of our research was to determine the common factors of the sharing economy and the green economy and the perceptions of Romanian users regarding them. Our research questionnaire was based on the elements we found in the academic literature. To evaluate the collected data, we used the factor analysis method with the support of the SPSS program. As our study reveals, digitalization as well as inclinations towards saving are factors impacting both the propensity towards sharing and support for the green economy. The demarcation line between the sharing and the green economies is rather fluid, the two realities being under a reciprocal influence. In our model, the green economy develops according to the principles of the sharing economy, going a step further in considering the relationship between society and environment, society and sustainable, eco-friendly behaviour. Although the sharing economy is not necessarily a prerequisite of the green economy, it is, nevertheless, easy for societies or groups that have internalized the lessons of the sharing economy to move forward towards the green economy. This study can be an important tool and a first step for businesses, and, more importantly, for the Romanian public institutions to accelerate the implementation of necessary measures, including legislative ones, in order to promote the further development of these economies.

TI Consumers' environmental ethics, willingness, and green consumerism
   between lower and higher income groups
SO RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB The emergence of the obligation to preserve the environment has affected the consumption model; therefore, green products and sustainable consumption have become an international concern. All over the world, green consumption is being considered, as consumers are essential contributors to the achievement of sustainable development goals, owing to their ability to choose between ungreen and eco-friendly products and services. However, very few studies have examined the trend in consumer's preferences and behavior in relation to sustainable development, especially in developing countries. This study analyzes the impact of consumers' environmental ethics, green consumerism, moral obligation, green attitude, on consumers' willingness to consume green products and actual green consumption, with the mediating role of willingness to consume green products. Using survey questionnaire, data were collected via face-to-face interaction and were analysed using Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The study found that consumers' environmental ethics, moral obligation, and green attitude have a significant influence on consumers' willingness to consume green products, which eventually impacts consumers' actual green consumption. Similarly, the study established the indirect mediating role of consumers' willingness to consume green products on the relationship between consumers' environmental ethics, moral obligation, and green attitude, as well as green consumption. This study further contributes to the existing literature by disproving the possible influence of income groups on the relationship between consumers' willingness to consume green products and actual green consumption. Thus, this study provides new insights for policymakers towards formulating favorable policies to increase consumers' green consumption and sustainable development.

AB Airbnb is a growing business and has received much research attention. However, no research has specifically examined complaints against Airbnb. Understanding complaints serves not as a way to help improve services but provides an insight into guests' perception of the Airbnb. I examined 664 reviews on sitejabber.com to study the common complaints and whether they are related to the perception that Airbnb is sharing economy. Using a grounded theory approach, I performed a content analysis of complaints. Besides customer service and technology challenges, one major complaint against Airbnb is their faded trust through their experiences.

TI Participants' interaction with sharing economy platforms in Russia
SO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & PEOPLE
AB Purpose The objective of this contribution is to pinpoint the practices of users' interactions with sharing economy platforms in Russia, as well as explore the source of motivation to use such platforms on the three cases of sharing economy platforms in Russia: Darudar [Gift-to-gift] (sharing goods), Bank Vremeny [Timebank] (sharing time and services) and Couchsurfing (sharing accommodation and leisure). Design/methodology/approach Empirical data were gathered from 25 in-depth interviews conducted for active users of the platforms and ethnographic observations of users' offline meetings as well as digital observations. Findings The results reveal that participants of the platforms tend to establish their own rules and norms of interaction, thus, fostering social connection. Findings suggest that users of sharing economy platforms are driven by the potential of minimising transaction costs and intrinsic motivation, such as getting experiences which have no market alternatives, upcycling and disposal of belongings, self-promotion and self-realisation. Original/value In this study, sharing as based in the sharing economy is conceptualised as a separate principle of resource allocation. The theory was applied to the empirical material of three Russian platforms, which has not been done previously in the paradigm of sharing. The current literature on the sharing economy is largely switched to the for-profit North American platforms, while case studies from other settings are lacking. This article aims to fill this gap by providing insights into non-profit platforms' operation in Russia.

SO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & TOURISM
AB The sharing economy has transformed the tourism landscape, though different destinations have featured various levels of receptivity. Two of the main organisations, or disruptors, are AirBnB and Uber. These two organisations were examined and compared in terms of how they have featured within two countries, Australia and Singapore. Using a case study approach, online contents concerning AirBnB and Uber were analysed to elucidate tourism responses in the respective countries. Drawing from the theoretical frameworks of disruptive innovation and smart tourism ecosystems, this research amplified that governance structures influenced how these two organisations carried out their operations. For instance, AirBnB received for more access in Australia than Singapore. In contrast, Singapore was more receptive to Uber and other ridesharing organisations than in the case of Australia. Incidentally, tourism responses have been almost non-existent within the two countries. In order to steer strategy and governance concerning the sharing economy, there is an urgent need to re-align existing legislation and business models in order to realise the true potential of smart tourism ecosystems.

TI Text mining and quantitative evaluation of China's green consumption
   policies based on green consumption objects
SO ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB Green consumption has become an important part of an environmentally friendly society. Policy guidance can effectively promote green consumption. Green consumption policies are extensive because of the diversity of green consumption objects. However, the various objects are not completely isolated, and policy must have a certain level of consistency. Therefore, from the perspective of green consumption objects, this paper first uses the text mining method to mine 308 green consumption policies in China, analyzing the objects covered in China's green consumption policies. Then, the evaluation system of green consumption policy consistency was built, seven key policies were selected, and the PMC-index method was used to measure policy consistency. The results show that (i) the main objectives of China's green consumption policy are the promotion of green products and the efficient use of energy. Green services and green recycling have been subject to fewer policy efforts. (ii) In terms of the links involved in green consumption, China pays more attention to the supply and the consumption chain and less attention to the recycling chain. (iii) The quantitative evaluation results of the seven typical policies show that the policy consistency is good but not perfect. The policy shortcomings are mainly reflected in the incentive methods. Therefore, it is recommended to further improve the green consumption objectives and enrich the means and methods of green consumption guidance.

TI Analysis of the sharing economy effect on sustainability in the
   transportation sector using fuzzy cognitive mapping
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB Along with the significant growth of the sharing economy in recent years, its effect on the economy, society, and the environment at the level of governments, academic communities, and researchers has been widely discussed. One of the main debates is identifying the side or negative effects of the sharing economy as well as its positive effects. Studying the cause-effect relationship of the variables affecting sustainability in the sharing economy context can provide valuable results for firms. For this purpose, fuzzy cognitive maps have been used. Based on the literature review, the sharing economy's essential variables that affect sustainability were identified, and using the Fuzzy Delphi method, these variables were localized. Snapp and Tap30 were selected as two of the largest platforms in the Iranian transportation sector. Fuzzy cognitive maps based on aggregated opinions of experts were inputted to the Mental Modeler online software to drawn the cognitive map of this research. The degree of centrality index, i.e., the summation of input and output degree, was used to identify the most relevant sustainability variables. Consequently, the incentives to make a greater use of the platform, the income of drivers, the monopoly power of platforms, the price of services, the higher service quality of platforms, the use of private vehicles by passengers, and the change of traffic in cities were identified as variables with the greatest effect on stability. Four positive loops and one negative loop were identified among these seven variables in the cause-effect analysis. In the final section, some suggestions are presented based on each loop.

AB Sharing economy platforms transform traditional production and consumption systems in cities around the world. While the sharing economy aims to increase the resilience of different economic systems, its actual economic, social, and environmental effects remain under-researched. During the pandemic of Covid-19, economic and environmental crises, and growing uncertainty, it becomes essential to promote sustainable and promising forms of shared (distributed) resources. Ways to benefit from the sharing economy's advantages, despite the significant number of Russian and foreign publications, are still poorly understood. At present, it is crucial to explore the roles, perspectives, and effects of both resource owners and users and Russian interaction platforms. Let us look at this sharing economy's development aspect on the example of the Moscow real estate market, taking into account the environmental impact of the large-scale housing renovation program. There have been identified some digital environmental IT platforms aimed at improving the efficiency of transfer and use of information resources (the main principle of sharing - to improve the efficiency of resources and information, in this case - environmental) on the environmental situation in Moscow and the region to inform the public about the opportunities and the primary environmental risks in housing purchase or construction.

SO CITIES
AB The sharing economy finds a fertile breeding ground in cities for extremely different initiatives. This paper moves from the emerging literature on sharing cities, draws on the sharing city paradigm and urban policy literature, and analyzes the roles municipalities exert in supporting and regulating urban sharing initiatives. To address this topic, we developed a mixed-method analysis to map 134 practices and policies deployed in 75 worldwide cities and tested the impact of municipalities governance roles on the sharing city paradigm. Building on our results, we propose an integrated framework for urban governance, that underlines the relevance of the active participation of municipalities in implementing and executing successful sharing initiatives in cities, thus also promoting urban sustainability. Accordingly, findings are relevant for academics studying the sharing economy impacts on cities and for urban policy makers who have the sharing economy on their agenda.

AB Sharing economy has been a phenomenon in many countries for years owing to a number of factors such as the economic recession which contributes to a pervasive thinking of renting over buying. This paper examines the sharing behavior in sharing economy based on social capital theory and social exchange theory, and looks at the example of USPACE, a start-up company providing shared parking services in metropolis, Taiwan. The research covers the urban areas in Taipei and Kaohsiung and collects data of USPACE users. A total of 160 copies of questionnaire have been distributed and 151 valid copies returned, a valid response rate of 94.4%. The Partial Least Squares (PLS) has been used for empirical analysis. The findings show that trust and identification will significantly affect the intention to share, so will extrinsic rewards and the enjoyment in helping others, while norms and reciprocity do not have significant impacts on the sharing intention. The results not only extend the application of social capital and social exchange theory, but also provide directions for future studies from sharing economy's perspective of various industries.

TI Role of the sharing economy in the achievement of energy efficiency and
   sustainable economic development: Evidence from China
SO JOURNAL OF INNOVATION & KNOWLEDGE
AB Globally, the sharing economy is considered a significant factor in achieving energy efficiency and sustain-able economic development (SED) which needs regulatory and academic focus. This article investigates the impact of the sharing economy, including sharing economy users and sharing economy values, on efficient energy use and SED in China. The research uses exports, population growth, and foreign direct investment (FDI) as control variables. The article uses secondary data extracted from Statista, the sustainable develop-ment solution network, and World Development Indicators (WDI), from 1986 to 2020. The research applies the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lagged (NARDL) model to examine the associations among the vari-ables. The results reveal that sharing economy users, sharing economy values, exports, population growth, and FDI have a positive association with efficient energy use and SED in China. This article guides policy-makers establishing policies related to the achievement of SED and energy efficiency using the sharing econ-omy. Governments, in particular, are recommended to actively encourage the growth of the sharing economy and create governance structures that support this growth.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

TI Sharing economy rebound: The case of peer-to-peer sharing of food waste
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY
AB The digital sharing economy is commonly thought to promote sustainable consumption and improve material efficiency through better utilization of existing product stocks. However, the cost savings and convenience of using digital sharing platforms can ultimately stimulate additional demand for products and services. As a result, some or even all of the expected environmental benefits attributed to sharing could be offset, a phenomenon known as the rebound effect. Relying on a unique dataset covering over 750,000 food items shared in the United Kingdom through a free peer-to-peer food-sharing platform, we use econometric modeling, geo-spatial network analysis, and environmentally extended input-output analysis to quantify how much of the expected environmental benefits attributed to sharing are offset via rebound effects under seven re-spending scenarios. We find that rebound effects can offset 59-94% of expected greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction, 20-81% of expected water depletion benefits, and 23-90% of land use benefit as platform users re-spent the money saved from food sharing on other goods and services. Our results demonstrate that rebound effects could limit the potential to achieve meaningful reductions in environmental burdens through sharing, and highlight the importance of incorporating rebound effects in environmental assessments of the digital sharing economy.

TI The relative importance of the business model motive for customer
   participation in the sharing economy
SO SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
AB The sharing economy, defined by peer-to-peer interactions through a platform, has been gaining ground in re-cent years. In this study, we discuss the relative importance of customers' perceived motives to participate in the two most common models of the sharing economy: access-based consumption and ownership-transfer. We focus on taxi-hailing and post-delivery as examples of access-based consumption and second-hand trade as an example of the ownership-transfer. While these two contain heterogeneous business model patterns that can motivate customers differently, common motives are significant in both models. We study common mo-tives and motives aligned with the business model patterns, which we call business model motives, i.e. variety for the ownership-transfer model and availability for the access-based. We demonstrate that while the business model pattern is different, the relative importance of the business model motive vis-a-vis other motives is similar. The novelty of our work lies in its coverage of more than one model of the sharing economy and juxtaposing mo-tives across them.(c) 2022 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Effects of perceived value on green consumption intention based on
   double-entry mental accounting: taking energy-efficient appliance
   purchase as an example
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB In order to effectively promoting green consumption, this paper constructs a theoretical model from the perspective of double-entry mental accounting to study the impact of perceived value and consumption sensitivity on green consumption intention. Conducting a large-scale empirical study, we analyzed the influence of perceived value on green consumption intention, tested the mediating effect of double-entry mental accounting, and explored the moderating effect of consumption sensitivity on perceived value and green consumption intention. The results indicate that perceived benefits are significantly positively correlated with green consumption intention, and perceived sacrifices are significantly negatively correlated with green consumption intention. In addition, perceived benefits have a greater impact on green consumption intention than perceived sacrifices. Double-entry mental accounting plays a significant mediating role on the path from perceived value to green consumption intention. Compared with the mediating effect of the coefficient of pleasure attenuation and the coefficient of pain buffering, the mediating effect of coefficient of pleasure attenuation is stronger and the mediating path is more important. This study concludes that individuals with lower consumption sensitivity are more willing to buy green products. When consumption sensitivity is lower, the negative correlation between perceived sacrifices and green consumption intention is stronger. Finally, corresponding policies are proposed based on the results of this study.

TI THE IMPACT OF THE SHARING ECONOMY ON HOUSEHOLD BANKRUPTCY
SO MIS QUARTERLY
AB Powered by digital technologies, many peer-to-peer platforms, or what is called the sharing economy, have emerged in the past decade. Although the impact of the sharing economy has received considerable attention over the past few years, extant research has not fully documented the impact of the sharing economy on consumers, workers, industry, or society as a whole. In this study, we exploit the geographical and temporal variation in Uber's entry to examine its impact on the personal bankruptcy rate as well as on other consumer credit default rates. We empirically document the changes in personal bankruptcy filings after Uber's entry, and show that personal bankruptcy filings under Chapter 7 experience a drop of 0.047 per 1,000 people after Uber enters a county, which translates to a 3.26% reduction in quarterly bankruptcy filings. Uber's entry also leads to a reduction in Chapter 13 personal bankruptcy filings, but to a smaller degree (0.018 cases per 1,000 people per quarter). We check the validity of our estimates using business bankruptcy filings, which we find are uncorrelated with Uber's entry.

TI Performance-based contracts in the sharing economy: A supply chain
   framework with application of Internet of Things
SO ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH
AB As an emerging economic mode, the sharing economy has the advantages of improving supply capability and capital utilization. This paper studies a performance-based contract between a service platform and an outsourcing partner, a vehicle manufacturer in the context of the sharing economy with application of Internet of Things. The service platform acquires high-quality products by giving incentives to the manufacturer. To generate more profit with better service, the manufacturer not only improves the product's performance through quality design in manufacturing but also provides exclusive maintenance in the aftermarket period with the application of Internet of Things. A performance-based contract model between the service platform and the manufacturer is designed to give decision-making suggestions for managers. Managerial implications are extracted by analyzing the operational decisions of the players. Compared with the traditional wholesale price contract, the service platform in the sharing economy can benefit more from a performance-based contract assisted with Internet of Things. The product manufacturer's preference for a performance-based contract over a traditional wholesale price contract depends on the detailed market circumstances. Managerial guidelines are given on designing performance-based contracts for members of the supply chain.

TI In whose bed shall I sleep tonight? The impact of transaction-specific
   versus partner-specific information on pricing on a sharing platform
SO INFORMATION & MANAGEMENT
AB Platform providers in the sharing economy such as AirBnB face a trade-off between providing information on the object of the transaction and providing more information about the transaction partner. We view this trade-off from an economic perspective as the choice between complete or relational contracts. Using a global data set of AirBnB listings, we empirically compare the strength of influence of premises-specific versus host-specific information on pricing on that platform. The results indicate that partner-specific information in fact has only a comparatively weak influence on prices. This sheds critical light on the frequently used argument that in the sharing economy, personal information is essential to establish the necessary trust between transaction partners. We also find that the importance of premises-specific versus partner-specific information varies with the type of premises being rented.

SO TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB This article provides a comprehensive framework-based review of literature on "Sharing Economy" (SE) using an ADO (antecedents, decisions, and outcomes) framework. Based on extensive coverage of studies published over a period of 12 years between 2008 and 2020, we reviewed extant research on this phenomenon from both more developed and emerging countries. Using PRISMA methodology inclusion and exclusion criteria, we selected 93 articles for the review. The motivation to undertake this research was to understand emerging consumer behavior that intends to collaborate for consumption with the help of technological innovation. We identified major theoretical frameworks developed for investigating SEs and collaborative consumption behavior. The findings of the paper reveal possible antecedents, decisions, and outcomes of SEs. Many areas in the SE domain remain underexplored, despite recent significant advancements, and for this the paper provides directions for future research.

TI Benchmarking of Airbnb listings: How competitive is the sharing economy
   sector of European cities?
SO TOURISM ECONOMICS
AB Airbnb is arguably the world's most popular accommodation sharing platform. Its impact on demand and supply within the tourism and hospitality industry is nowadays unquestionable. The present study delves into inspecting the efficiency of Airbnb listings of European cities, as, in spite of the success of Airbnb as a whole, it cannot be presupposed that all listings are equally successful. More specifically, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is employed in this first comprehensive benchmarking attempt within the domain of the sharing economy to date. This article also makes a contribution to robustness by introducing an interactivity note to the base model, thus, inspecting the results for corroboration/discrepancies and going beyond the static analyses that are common in DEA modeling. Ultimately, this is done with the goal of highlighting opportunities for inefficient Airbnb listings to properly utilize their inputs and therefore become more competitive.

TI Welcome to the Gig Economy: neoliberal industrial relations and the case
   of Uber
SO GEOJOURNAL
AB The competitive pressures of neoliberal economies have compelled employers to devolve responsibilities to contractors and subcontractors. The rise information technology platforms have significantly accelerated this trend over past decade. "Sharing economy" companies have such widespread adoption of neoliberalism's industrial relations that a new moniker-"the Gig Economy"-has taken root. Although shareholders and consumers have benefited, middle-class jobs have been squeezed in the process. This paper uses Uber as a case study to discuss how Sharing Economy entities are merely the latest iteration of companies to enact the neoliberal playbook, including (a) (mis)classifying workers, (b) engaging in regime shopping, and (c) employing the most economically vulnerable, rather than giving rise to a new world of work altogether. The result is a crowding out of middle-class employment by precarious 'gigs' that lack legal protections and benefits.

AB Trust is a fundamental prerequisite in the growth and sustainability of sharing economy platforms. Many of such platforms rely on actions that require trust to take place, such as entering a stranger's car or sleeping at a stranger's place. For this reason, understanding, measuring, and tracking trust can be of great benefit to such platforms, enabling them to identify trust behaviors, both online and offline, and identify groups which may benefit from trust-building interventions. In this work, we present the design and evaluation of a behavioral framework to measure a user's propensity to trust others on Airbnb. We conducted an online experiment with 4,499 Airbnb users in the form of an investment game in order to capture users' propensity to trust other users on Airbnb. Then, we used the experimental data to generate both explanatory and predictive models of trust propensity. Our contribution is a framework that can be used to measure trust propensity in sharing economy platforms via online and offline signals. We discuss which affordances need to be in place so that sharing economy platforms can get signals of trust, in addition to how such a framework can be used to inform design around trust in the short and long term.

SO ASIAN BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB In the Fourth Industrial Revolution era, the sharing economy has brought a new way of social value creation. However, the impact of COVID-19 in recent years has hampered shared consumption practices but also generated new service directions based on changing market demand. To explore the motivation and behavior of people participating in the sharing economy in the current social context in detail, we empirically examined the impact of consumers' perception of shared mobility on their continuance and normative use behavior via community identification through surveyed online/offline 585 Chinese frequent users of shared mobility. Our study shows that the perception of usefulness, ease of use, and social benefits positively affect consumer behavior through community identification, with innovative consumers and role models acting as positive moderators. The results of our study have implications for how enterprises in the COVID-19 pandemic can take advantage of the sharing economy's optimal allocation of idle resources to integrate new service sections for improved service quality. It also provides a reference for enterprises' responses to public health emergencies.

TI Coercive and legitimate power in the sharing economy: Examining
   consumers? cooperative behavior and trust
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PSYCHOLOGY
AB Sharing economy organizations depend on customer cooperation. According to the existing theory, namely, the extended slippery slope framework, coercive and legitimate power are two means of achieving cooperation and trust. Based on this theory, we examine the role of coercive and legitimate power in the sharing economy in four studies. Study 1 has examined the extent of existing sharing organizations' coercive and legitimate power (B2C, P2P, and communities) by employing website analysis. In Study 2, consumers have discussed which forms of power (coercive or legitimate) were perceived by sharing organizations in focus groups. Study 3 has investigated the impact of coercive and legitimate power on consumer cooperation in a laboratory experiment using a give-or-take-some (GOTS) game. Study 4 has examined the impact of coercive and legitimate power on cooperation using an experimental online questionnaire. We find that providers of sharing economy services highlight coercive measures on their websites, whereas consumers in the focus group discussions highlight the importance of legitimate power, as is evident in the experiments. Thus, while sharing organizations could increase their use of legitimate power, they should apply coercive power carefully.

TI Forefronts of the Sharing Economy: Uber in Cape Town
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH
AB The sharing economy, often phrased as 'platform capitalism', enables firms such as Uber and Airbnb to monetize, through specific technologies of mediation, the networks, the assets and the precarious labour of those who are described as 'the entrepreneurs of sharing'. This article explores the urban geographies of ride-sharing in the marketization of Uber in Cape Town, South Africa. I use empirical evidence collected during the first phase of its operations in the city, between 2013 and 2015, to show how Uber relied upon the developmental entrepreneurialism of Cape Town to embed its ride-sharing market locally, and how the drivers enacted multiple technical, economic and ethical regimes within and without the constraints of the software platform. The research presented in this article thus contributes to understanding how the discourses of millennial development, with its promises of entrepreneurial empowerment, are adopted by global sharing-economy firms to enact their markets in the global South. It also reveals how a different genealogy of Uber's urban transactions offers an alternative perspective on the normative rationalities of the sharing economy and on the diverse economies that exist in relation to platform capitalism in the global South.

AB Lodging sharing economy services have exponentially grown in the last decade. The users of this new economic model are also facing many challenges and difficulties which are less commonly known to the research community. In this research, we have used unique data collection and an unsupervised machine learning method to uncover the needs and concerns of the users of this new economic model. We focused on the lodging company, Airbnb, to use as our test case. Similar approaches can also be applied on other sharing economies companies. The results reported current lodging sharing services lacks regulations for disputes. Findings also revealed safety concerns of the users. Overall, this research contributes with practical managerial implications and guidelines for future research while implementing a new data collection methodology.

   impact of COVID-19
SO JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM MANAGEMENT
AB The meal-sharing economy has taken significant scholarly attention recently; however, no study examines the impact of the current health crisis on meal-sharing economy platforms. This research attempts to bridge this gap by investigating the effect of the COVID-19 on the meal-sharing economy based on the service providers' perspective. For this purpose, thirteen interviews with meal-sharing service providers in Istanbul were conducted, and the data were examined through conventional content analysis. Findings showed that meal-sharing service providers have been facing unprecedented challenges since the outbreak. The findings also reveal a common consensus on the disruptive role of the coronavirus measures in terms of limiting meal-sharing activities. Moreover, it was indicated that the current health crisis has compelled service providers to redesign their events as online virtual activities. The results provide favorable theoretical and practical insights to guide the meal-sharing platforms for a health crisis adoption and revival of such platforms.

This paper provides a systematic review of 371 papers identified in SCOPUS and WOS databases between 2000 and 2019 on P2P accommodation in the sharing economy. Research on P2P accommodation is experiencing high growth, with Airbnb a major focus for tourism scholars. The provision of authentic experiences, environmental concerns, and socialization are important themes in P2P accommodation research, with trust and negative attitudes of established businesses and government regarded as the main barriers of P2P development. Common strategies to respond P2P accommodation platforms are also identified.

TI Sustainable Governance of the Sharing Economy: The Chinese Bike-Sharing
   Industry
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Socialist countries, such as China, have stressed the importance of an equitable society where citizens work together. Thus, the sharing economy (e.g., the bike-sharing industry) could be one of the challenges determining the future of China, as the initial bubble of the bike-sharing industry collapsed in 2017, with many problems stemming from the users' deposits that were lost and the depletion of the investment funds, resulting in numerous malfunctioning bikes every day. This paper evaluates the bike-sharing industry in terms of sustainable governance in the future and identifies its factors. Therefore, we use the structural equation model based on survey questionnaires and find that most of the input variables of the perceived rational (PRV) and emotional values (PEV), perceived risk (PR), and externalities (EXT) are not very successful in promoting the sustainable governance of the bike-sharing industry. However, using the bootstrapping simulation approach, we find that the role of modulators such as satisfaction and sustainable management factors are statistically significant. The modulating effect of a user's satisfaction on the intention of continuous use based on all four inputs of PRV (0.304), PEV (0.298), PR (-0.156), and EXT (0.263), as well as the other indirect variables of sustainable management, such as environmental factors (0.284), is shown to be statistically significant. Based on these modulating effects, we conclude that the sharing economy, represented by the bike-sharing industry, could be one of the most important business cases for the future of China, but only if it is strongly supported by the public. Therefore, to help the industry get out of its current slump, we propose that the bike-sharing companies put in more diverse efforts to employ multi-use types of innovation with practical benefits such as coupons for the nearest shops, and social functions that enhance the quality of life such as mileage contribution from bike sharing for disabled people. Evidently, the Chinese government should eliminate "the over-supply issues" through appropriate market governance and increase its efforts toward a better public private partnership (PPP), as the sharing economy should be based on the harmonization of all interest groups to eventually create value.

TI The Effect of Airbnb on Hotel Performance: Comparing Single- and
   Multi-Unit Host Listings in the United States
SO CORNELL HOSPITALITY QUARTERLY
AB Extant research provides ample evidence that Airbnb has an adverse impact on hotel revenues and that a majority of Airbnb hosts offer multiple listings on the platform. Arguably, multi-unit host listings are the primary driving force for the associated decreases in hotel revenues. To test this proposition, this study examines the extent to which single- and multi-unit host Airbnb host listings have differing effects on hotel revenues. The results show that the adverse impact of Airbnb supply on hotel revenues was mainly driven by decreases in hotel prices rather than decreases in hotel demand. Contrary to expectations, single-unit host listings exerted greater downward pricing pressure on hotels than multi-unit host listings. These effects were consistently observed across hotel segments, with economy-scale hotels experiencing substitution effects in addition to pricing pressure. The findings have significant implications for researchers and stakeholders impacted by the sharing economy in the lodging industry.

First, the study introduces actors in the future electricity market and identifies their objectives. Second, valuable resources of each actor are recognized and categorized under physical and digital groups. Third, interested actors in each resource and benefits they can gain by having access to the resource are discussed. Last, a matrix of sharing opportunities amongst the actors in the electricity market is built and the current state of sharing is compared with the possibilities in the future. This paper provides and serves as a benchmark for implementing the sharing economy concept in future design of electricity markets. It highlights sharing opportunities as a means for circular economy in the electricity market. Implementing the identified sharing opportunities requires more collaborative (open) business models.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT
AB The sharing norm has enabled many of unused resources revamped and returned with some value to both travelers and local communities in the sharing economy. Airbnb requires remarkable trust that goes beyond the level where both user and host take risks from a sharing transaction. This paper suggests an empirical research model developed based on the trust building model and attachment theory explaining how users develop their trust and further attachment through two major routes. The results indicate that the cognitive trust-identity attachment building mechanism is more effective than affective trust-bond attachment depending on the emotional distance between the users and hosts. Finally, this paper provides scholars with theoretical enhancement on the trust and attachment literature and recommends managers of the sharing businesses to enrich users' trust-attachment toward the firm and the service provider that has a strong influence on users' behavioral intention to use.

TI Consumer minimalism for sustainability: Exploring the determinants of
   rental consumption intention
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR
AB The burgeoning growth of a sharing economy model in the form of a rental business has created a keen interest in understanding various underlying factors that go on to impact consumer behavior. This article aims to understand the antecedents of "rental consumption," and also examines the concepts of consumer familiarity and minimalism, perceived reputation, ascription responsibility, and perceived consumer effectiveness with the moderating role of consumer skepticism. We empirically tested our proposed framework and examined the mediating role of consumer minimalism vis-a-vis its impact on rental consumption behavior. We analyzed data (N = 365) with structural equation modeling AMOS 25 and Process Macro. The findings presumably would enhance the literature on the "sharing economy" by integrating the VBN theory, consumer minimalism, and rental consumption intention. We conclude with theoretical contributions and forward-looking research directions that emphasize the shift in consumer behavior with minimalistic value, and its implications for organizations operating in a sharing economy.

TI The Sharing Economy in the Context of Sustainable Development and Social
   Responsibility: The Example of the Czech Republic
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The rapid development of the sharing economy that has been registered in recent years is caused by a number of factors. The increasingly pronounced effort on the part of all economic entities to contribute towards sustainable development through the application of socially responsible behavior is deemed to be a key factor. The objective of the article is to analyze and evaluate the attitudes of customers towards the benefits of the sharing economy in the field of economic, social, and environmental responsibility using the example of a small post-communist economy-the Czech Republic. Primary data were obtained on the basis of a questionnaire survey. This was elaborated using descriptive and inferential statistics tools. The study that was performed shows that the majority of customers regard sharing as a source of benefits in the field of economic, social, and environmental responsibility, whereas in a complex sense, they perceive these benefits to be equal. Women perceive the investigated benefits of sharing with regard to environmental responsibility as more important compared to men. In comparison with the older generation, the younger generation perceives selected benefits of sharing as more important in all three investigated areas of responsibility. People with a higher education perceive selected benefits of sharing with regard to economic responsibility as more important compared to people with a lower level of education. The article provides original insights into the perception of the benefits of sharing for sustainable development by actors in the sharing economy and is a source of knowledge about their motivations for both policymakers and managers of companies involved in the sharing economy.

Considering the interactions of the operating enterprise, resource suppliers (basic service providers), value-added service providers, and consumers, we show that the selection of one-sided mode, two-sided mode, or multi-sided mode depends on enterprise service quality, pricing power and cross-group externalities of sharing economy service, utility evaluation and access cost of the value-added service. Further, we give a theoretical explanation of the operation mode evolution in China's online car-hailing market and put forward two specific multi-sided platform development paths.

TI Commercial orientation in grassroots social innovation: Insights from
   the sharing economy
SO ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB There is growing interest in the roles of the sharing economy and grassroots innovation in the transition to sustainable societies. Grassroots innovation research has tended to assume a sharp distinction between grassroots organisations and businesses within niches of socio-technical innovation. However, the non-profit sector literature identifies a tendency for non-profit organisations to actually become more commercially-oriented over time. Seeking to account for this tendency, we develop a conceptual model of the dynamics of grassroots organisations within socio-technical niches. Using a case study of Freegle, a grassroots organisation within the sharing economy niche, we apply the conceptual model to illustrate the causes, processes and outcomes of grassroots niche organisations becoming more commercially-oriented. We show that a grassroots organisation may be subject to coercive and indirect (isomorphic) pressures to become more commercially-oriented and highlight the ambiguities of this dynamic. Furthermore, we highlight that global niche actors may exert coercive pressures that limit the enactment and propagation of the practices and values of grassroots organisations. We conclude by highlighting the need for further research exploring the desirability and feasibility of protecting grassroots organisations from pressures to become more commercially-oriented.

TI Demystifying the authenticity experience of locally guided wine tours in
   the meal-sharing economy
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WINE BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to demystify the authenticity dimensions of wine experience with the locally guided tour in the meal-sharing economy, drawing on travellers' online reviews at Withlocals for French locally guided wine tours. Design/methodology/approach The qualitative research approach was performed through the thematic analysis of 940 online reviews from Withlocals. The coding phase was completed based on a three-step coding process (i.e. open, axial and selective coding), as all reviews that were gathered were related to locally guided wine tours rather than only wine-sharing activities. Findings The findings of this study demonstrated four interrelated authenticity dimensions: the taste of terroir, local atmosphere, oenological knowledge and local insight. The results of this study also notably showed that all reviews were primarily positive; travellers expressed their satisfaction with wine tours at Withlocals and often mentioned their re-purchase intentions as well as advising wine tours in the meal-sharing economy. Practical implications Several worthy theoretical and practical implications were discussed for local tour guides to improve their tour quality more authentically. The results also demonstrate that locally guided wine tours in the meal-sharing economy were regarded as a multidimensional activity that provides a better discovery of a wine destination. Originality/value Despite the large volume of generic meal-sharing economy experience studies, the authenticity experience of the locally guided wine tours has been surprisingly omitted by scholars. Therefore, this study contributes to the sharing economy literature through wine experience by addressing the authenticity dimensions of the locally guided wine tours in the meal-sharing economy.

AB Within the 50th Hawaiian International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS), we organize for the first time a minitrack on Trust, Identity, and Trusted Systems in Digital Environments. Trust is a pervasive concern not just with new technologies but also with established technologies as they become more complex and interdependent. Through papers and a panel, the track will discuss and debate when and to what degree trust matters, in what form(s), and with which consequences, primarily in the context of the sharing economy and blockchain technology.

TI Trust transfer and the intention to use app-enabled carpooling service
SO ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MARKETING AND LOGISTICS
AB Purpose In China, with the rapid dissemination of mobile communications technology along with congested traffic and increasingly expensive transportation costs, consumers are turning to smartphone-enabled, ride-sharing services. Sharing economy requires trust in strangers. Based on trust transfer theory and a dyadic conceptualization of trust from cognitive to affective, the purpose of this study is to examine trust building through the use of Didi, a third-party, ride-sharing platform that mediates exchanges among strangers. Design/methodology/approach Structural equation modeling (SEM) results based on 242 observations indicate that the platform functions as an important enabler of trust, which influences a consumer's behavioral intention. Findings Specifically, Didi's reputation and security assurance have a positive influence on passengers' cognitive trust in drivers. There is also evidence that the interaction as mediated by the app between passengers and drivers helps the formation of affective trust, while the results do not support a relationship between cognitive and affective trust. Originality/value The research findings address trust transference between participants in the sharing economy and its effects, which have significant theoretical and practical implications and offer opportunities for future research in other sectors of the sharing economy.

TI Impact of Consumer Environmental Consciousness on Consumer Perceived
   Value from Sharing Economy
SO INZINERINE EKONOMIKA-ENGINEERING ECONOMICS
AB The intensive spread and the growth of the sharing economy challenge the sharing platforms to attract and retain consumers. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of consumers' perceived value and marketing strategy oriented to value growth is becoming essential both from the scientific and practical point of view. However, in the scientific literature, the construct structure of consumer perceived value from sharing economy and the factors that determine it are not sufficiently explored. To fill this gap, this study aims to investigate consumer perceived value from sharing economy and explore how it is influenced by consumer environmental consciousness and consumer attitude towards sharing platforms. Based on the quantitative research findings, it was found that consumer environmental consciousness has a significant direct effect on attitude towards sharing economy platforms and directly influences consumer perceived social value. The results of this study confirm the mediating effect of the consumer attitude toward sharing platforms in the relationship between consumer environmental consciousness and consumer perceived economic, functional, emotional value from sharing economy.

TI Quick Answer for Big Data in Sharing Economy Innovative Computer
   Architecture Design Facilitating Optimal Service-Demand Matching
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB In sharing economy, people offer idle social resources to others in a sharing manner. Through community-based online platforms, the people offering services can earn commission while others can enjoy a better life via renting social resources. Consequently, the value-in-use of services is expectedly strengthened within the unit time, although the total amount of social resources remains constant. Influenced by sharing economy, some famous companies have developed intelligent systems to analyze the most appropriate coincidence between citizens' idle supply and renting demand from numerous data sets. However, the big data analysis of the optimal service-demand matching usually runs on the traditional multiprocessors equipped in intelligent systems, so-called "system-on-chip." In this paper, we design a novel computer architecture-the accelerator based on optical network-on-chip (ONoC)-to further speed up the matching between citizens' offer and demand in sharing economy. Our ONoC-based accelerator is able to quickly calculate the optimal service-demand matching by processing computation tasks on parallel cores, i.e., task-core mapping. In addition, to improve the accelerator reliability, the assorted task-core mapping algorithm is also designed. The extensive simulation results based on real trace file demonstrate the effectiveness of our system and algorithm.

   Development
SO CHANGING SOCIETIES & PERSONALITIES
AB In the present work, the authors set out to identify common ground between social entrepreneurship and the sharing economy, justify the application of these models for the sustainable development of society, as well as conduct a bibliographic study into these concepts to identify areas of overlap between them. For a more in-depth analysis, we studied 20 social entrepreneurs and 20 English versions of websites of organizations that implement the sharing economy model. Based on semantic data analysis and latent Dirichlet allocation, the texts under examination were grouped into 5 topics according to frequency of occurrence of keywords using the Python programming language. In order to trace a connection between these topics and sustainable development, we selected words that can serve as markers of environmental, social and economic aspects of the activities of these organizations. Each identified topic has appeared to have an aspect of digitalization. The study revealed that the application of the sharing economy model by social entrepreneurs and companies contributes to the sustainable development of society. The obtained results can be used in elaboration of approaches to provide the sustainable development of society.

AB How is the implementation of public transport services perceived by the public in the context of the sharing economy? What social and economic elements determine their development? The task of this article is to look for answers to questions formulated in this way. A quantitative method was used to conduct the research; the technique that was used was the CASI online survey. Profitability calculations were carried out and compared for three variants of vehicle use: rented, new and used. The deadlines for exceeding the profitability thresholds were set under the assumed preconditions for the analyzed variants. The results that were obtained provided an assessment of the customers' opinions on the use of elements of the sharing economy in public passenger transport, and enabled the formulation of determinants of the popularization of these solutions as well as a determination of the cost-effectiveness thresholds for practical applications.

TI Conceptualizing and Key Development Factors of the Sharing Economy in
   Contemporary Environment
SO POSTMODERN OPENINGS
AB We are already witnessing the emergence of a new economic paradigm - the sharing economy - that will radical transform way of life of society. The new economic paradigm is based on y the values of a post-modem society - the imperative of sustainable development models, the growth of meaningful consumption and the development of new types of solidarity. The diversity of business and non-profit sharing services is a result of the growing areas of the sharing economy, the improvement of the technological infrastructure. The sharing economy takes place in organized systems or networks, in which participants conduct sharing activities in the form of renting, lending, trading, bartering, donation and swapping of different physical and non-material resources. The sharing economy framework is an "umbrella" concept. This approach generates not only problems (statistical accounting, regulation, etc.), but has benefits. "Flexible" methodologies that focus on the process of changing sharing practices provide great opportunities for understanding current socio-economic changes and making trustworthy forecasts. Global and country-specific factors determinate the development of sharing projects. Specific factors can include specific tax regimes; expansion of foreign digital platforms that popularize the culture of sharing, socio-cultural practices of non-market exchanges that have developed in countries, which are easily transferred and scaled from an offline to an online, etc. Russian authorities provide the best competitive conditions for sharing services, increase participants' trust, provide information support and promotion. The lack of state support for some sharing sector (in Russia - foodsharing and crowdfunding) leads to a slower its development.

TI Power relations are central to shaping collaborative governance of the
   urban sharing economy
SO HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
AB Since its rise in the early 2000s, the sharing economy has expanded and developed rapidly worldwide. While the sharing economy can boost resource-use efficiency and encourage sustainable urban living, it also challenges urban governance. Recently, a collaborative governance (CG) approach involving public and private partnerships has been adopted in various global cities to address these governance dilemmas. However, the influence of stakeholder power relations on the CG of the sharing economy remains inadequately explored in the literature. This article argues that multi-actor collaboration can be enhanced by clarifying how power relations shape effective governance, actor engagement, shared motivation, and capacity for joint actions. This article draws on practical insights by discussing examples of the governance practices of urban bike-sharing programs to demonstrate how the nature of public-private power relations can result in specific (and quite different) forms of CG. This article will help CG researchers, policymakers, urban planners, and communities understand CG practices in the new era of shared cities and global cities.

TI Unjustified trust beliefs: Trust conflation on sharing economy platforms
SO RESEARCH POLICY
AB Previous research has addressed the benefits of trust mechanisms on sharing economy platforms, and digital trust cues are widely accepted to immediately boost trust beliefs amongst peer consumers; yet little is known about whether such trust beliefs are justified. Our mixed-methods, abductive research explores trust conflation by peer consumers who are relatively unfamiliar with a platform, and how this may differ from the trust differentiation of more experienced peer consumers. We find that when peer consumers start to use a sharing economy platform, they perceive that various digital trust cues influence multiple trustees across different levels simultaneously, forming unjustified beliefs provoked by trust conflation relating to the platform intermediary and peer providers. Once peer consumers have had more time to gain relevant knowledge, they develop more accurate beliefs by differentiating relationships between digital trust cues and multiple trustees.

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Sharing economy is an emerging concept that has been implemented in several industries and has achieved huge success. Novel solutions, built on the emerging concept of sharing economy, such as Uber, Didi, Mobike, and Cargostream, offer unprecedented opportunities for maritime organizations to reform traditional water transportation. This paper presents an analysis framework of a shared container transportation mode to show the restrictions and benefit of the implementation of the concept of sharing economy in maritime transportation. As a typical inland water area in China, the Yangtze River is selected as the study area. A general shared container transportation framework is designed, including a new waiting mode, business process, and software platform system design. The new business process is developed to overcome the contradiction between the new shared container transportation mode and the traditional shipping process. The potential of the new mode is also discussed. It would contribute to the sustainability of maritime transportation with respect to energy saving.
